i saw this film on september 1st, 2005 in indianapolis. i am one of the judges for the heartland film festival that screens films for their truly moving picture award. a truly moving picture "...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life." heartland gave that award to this film.this is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century. at that time, it was the game of upper class and rich "gentlemen", and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs. with this backdrop, this based-on-a-true-story unfolds with a young, working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world, harry vardon.and the story is inspirational. against all odds, francis ouimet (played by shia labeouf of "holes") gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the u.s. and great britain at the 1913 u.s. open. francis is ill-prepared, and has a child for a caddy. (the caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in.) but despite these handicaps, francis displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event.and, we learn a lot about the early years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the layout of the short holes, the manual scoreboard, the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths, the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways, and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain.this film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing. and with no big movie stars, the story is somehow more believable.this adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of "miracle" and "remember the titans."fyi - there is a truly moving pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years.

maybe i'm reading into this too much, but i wonder how much of a hand hongsheng had in developing the film. i mean, when a story is told casting the main character as himself, i would think he would be a heavy hand in writing, documenting, etc. and that would make it a little biased.but...his family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about hongsheng's life. i think the best view would have been told from hongsheng's family and friends' perspectives. they saw his transformation and weren't so messed up on drugs that they remember everything.as for hongsheng being full of himself, the consistencies of the jesus christ pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, he's obviously still alive as he was cast as himself) for his family's happiness. huh?the viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex. he lies on the grass coming down from (during?) a high by himself and with his father, he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window, he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all while outstretching his arms, his head cocked to the side.it's fabulous that he's off of drugs now, but he's no hero. he went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middle.this same device is used in ted demme's "blow" where the audience empathizes with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero.however, "quitting" ("zuotian") is a film that is recommended, mostly for its haunting soundtrack, superb acting, and landscapes. but, the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of jia hongsheng is actually a stage setting for a play. it makes the viewer feel as if hongsheng's life was merely a play told in many difficult parts.

i felt this film did have many good qualities. the cinematography was certainly different exposing the stage aspect of the set and story. the original characters as actors was certainly an achievement and i felt most played quite convincingly, of course they are playing themselves, but definitely unique. the cultural aspects may leave many disappointed as a familiarity with the chinese and oriental culture will answer a lot of questions regarding parent/child relationships and the stigma that goes with any drug use. i found the jia hongsheng story interesting. on a down note, the story is in beijing and some of the fashion and music reek of early 90s even though this was made in 2001, so it's really cheesy sometimes (the beatles crap, etc). whatever, not a top ten or twenty but if it's on the television, check it out.

this movie is amazing because the fact that the real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job it's like they're almost living the past over again. jia hongsheng plays himself an actor who quit everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and searching for the meaning of life while being angry at everyone especially the people who care for him most. there's moments in the movie that will make you wanna cry because the family especially the father did such a good job. however, this movie is not for everyone. many people who suffer from depression will understand hongsheng's problem and why he does the things he does for example keep himself shut in a dark room or go for walks or bike rides by himself. others might see the movie as boring because it's just so real that its almost like a documentary. overall this movie is great and hongsheng deserved an oscar for this movie so did his dad.

"quitting" may be as much about exiting a pre-ordained identity as about drug withdrawal. as a rural guy coming to beijing, class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents' acting success. troubles arise, however, when the new man is too new, when it demands too big a departure from family, history, nature, and personal identity. the ensuing splits, and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other. hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim.but what an exceptionally convincing particularity, honesty, and sensuousness director zhang yang, and his actors, bring to this journey. no clich√©s, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no requisite sex, romance or violence scenes, no requisite street language and, to boot, no assumed money to float character acts and whims. hongshen jia is in his mid-twenties. he's a talented actor, impressionable, vain, idealistic, and perhaps emotionally starved. the perfect recipe for his enablers. soon he's the "cool" actor, idolized by youth. "he was hot in the early nineties." "he always had to be the most fashionable." he needs extremes, and goes in for heavy metal, adopts earrings and a scarf. his acting means the arts, friends--and roles, but not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input. and his self-criticism, dulled by the immediacy of success, opens the doors to an irrational self-doubt, self-hatred-- "i didn't know how to act" "i felt like a phony"--and to readily available drugs to counter them. he says "i had to get high to do what director wanted." so, his shallow identity as an actor becomes, via drugs, an escape from identity. hongshen's disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual, intermittent--and doggedly his own. solitude, space, meditative thinking, speech refusal, replace therapy. the abstract is out. and a great deal of his change occurs outdoors---not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways, bridges, and high-rises of beijing. the physicality is almost romantic, but is not. the bike rides to ritan park, the long spontaneous walks, the drenching sun and rain, grassy picnics, the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific. he drifts in order to arrive, all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity. "i started to open up" he says of this period in retrospect. and the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancer's positioning (clumsy, graceful, humorous, telling) in a current circumstance. if mind or spirit is lacking, his legs can compel him to walk all night. central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles. to punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity, he smashes his videos and tv, and bangs his head till bloody against his "john lennon forever" poster. he has let down his iconic anti-establishment artist---but he's the only viable guide he knows. he even imagines himself as john's son (yoko ono), and adopts his "mother mary" as an intercessor in his "hour of darkness" and "time of trouble." (the wrenching, shaking pain in the park--hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals) "music is so much more real than acting" he says. and speaks of lennon's influence as "showing me a new way." in the mental institute, the life-saving apples (resistance, nourishment) reflect lennon's presence, as does hongshen's need to re-hang his hero's poster in his redecorated room.if lennon's influence is spiriting, hongshen's father's influence is grounding. although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drink), it is fegsen's differences from his son that underwrites his change. for the father is more secure in himself: he accepts that he's chinese, a peasant in a line of peasants, a rural theater director. and he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions. it's this recognizable identity that drives hongshen to treat him like a sounding board, sometimes with anger and rage, sometimes with humor (the blue jeans, beatles) and passivity. in his most crazed, and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar, and a fake, he exposes more of himself than his father: "all the acts i acted before were bullshit... life is bullshit." and to hongshen's emphatic "you are not my father," he softly replies, "why can't a peasant be your father?" under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother, sister, friends, inmates at the rehab inst., he makes some tangible connection to a real (not whole) self. as the long term drug effects recede, so does his old identity. indebtedness replaces pride, trust distrust. integrity banishes his black cloud. all his edges soften. "you are just a human being" he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap-down incurred for refusing medicine. back home, lard peasant soap is fine with him now. and his once "rare and true friendships" begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back-to-back fence scene with his musician buddy. hongshen says of this movie: "it's a good chance to think about my life." and i might add, become a new actor, one bound to art and life. like lennon, he has gained success without a loss of identity.

i loved this movie from beginning to end.i am a musician and i let drugs get in the way of my some of the things i used to love(skateboarding,drawing) but my friends were always there for me.music was like my rehab,life support,and my drug.it changed my life.i can totally relate to this movie and i wish there was more i could say.this movie left me speechless to be honest.i just saw it on the ifc channel.i usually hate having satellite but this was a perk of having satellite.the ifc channel shows some really great movies and without it i never would have found this movie.im not a big fan of the international films because i find that a lot of the don't do a very good job on translating lines.i mean the obvious language barrier leaves you to just believe thats what they are saying but its not that big of a deal i guess.i almost never got to see this amazing movie.good thing i stayed up for it instead of going to bed..well earlier than usual.lol.i hope you all enjoy the hell of this movie and love this movie just as much as i did.i wish i could type this all in caps but its again the rules i guess thats shouting but it would really show my excitement for the film.i give it three thumbs way up!this movie blew me away!

i first saw this movie on ifc. which is a great network by the way to see underground films. i watched this movie and was thinking it was going to be pure drama and a story line that doesn't hold water. but it really was a worth while watch. the main character is in such rough shape, and you hate to see him deny help, but no matter what you just can't hate him. his devotion to the beatles and john lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels. the atmosphere of the film is also great. at times, you feel like you can see what he sees, feel what he feels in some situations. this movie does not leave you wanting to know more, or disliking a loophole in the plot. there are no loopholes (in my opinion). i have always been a fan of foreign films, especially now with movies being made so poorly in america. i really enjoy the foreign settings because i feel it can take you on a trip, and sometimes understand a different culture. this movie did all those things to me and more. please watch this movie and if you're new to foreign films, this is a great start.

i must say, every time i see this movie, i am deeply touched, not only by the most painful four years of hongsheng's life, but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction. it is also true that getting addicted to anything, such as drugs, alcohol, or pornography, cannot only hurt you, but also hurt your most important people in the world: your family. since family is the #1 priority in the asian culture, it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves him/her. this is actually the first chinese movie that i actually enjoy, not for the fun of it, but the elements surrounding it (superb acting, touching story, great direction) make this movie worth watching. what stands out the most is that hongsheng and his family act out the story themselves instead of having some b-movie actor trying to imitate the real person. it shows the genuineness of the movie.

my wife is a mental health therapist and we watched it from beginning to end. i am the typical man and can not stand chick flicks, but this movie is unbelievable. if you want to see what it is like for someone who is going through these type of struggles, this is the movie for you. as i watched it i found myself feeling sorry for him and others like him. ***spoiler*** plus the fact that all the individuals in the movie including the people in the mental institution were the actual people in real life made it that more real.a must see for someone in the mental health profession!

i saw this film at the rotterdam international film festival 2002. this seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival, however, as it turned out, all the more interesting.the story, of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction, is based on actual facts. moreover, the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again, this time for the film, which is partly set up as a stage play. not only do they all happen to be good actors, jia hongsheng's parents are actors in real life as well, the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards jia are very effective.jia hongsheng is the actor of some chinese action films late eighties start nineties. later you can see him in great films such as frozen and suzhou river. in between these two career paths jia becomes a drug addict and looses all drive to act or even do anything productive, except for making somewhat futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso.i like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after withdrawal more than on the horror of drugs. we really feel the pain and struggle jia is in. at the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him.the film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern jia seems to be caught in, dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him. because there are personal 'interviews' with the characters we feel like we are getting to know jia not only through himself but through others as well.the film has a heavy feel, but scenes of jia cycling through bejing and partying with his friends lighten the tone. so does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film. the music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after. this is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and modern chinese film this is a strong recommendation.

"night of the hunted" stars french porn star brigitte lahaie.in fact,many of the cast members in this slow-moving production were porn actors at the time of its frantic filming.this film is certainly different than rollin's usual lesbian vampire flicks,but it's not as memorable as for example "lips of blood" or "fascination".lahaie plays an amnesiac hitchhiker who can't remember who she is or where she came from.most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex,where lahaie is being held by some kind of medical group that's treating a number of people with a similar condition.anyway,she escapes from the monolithic office tower where the affected people are held.on a highway outside of town,she meets a young man,who stops and picks her up."night of the hunted" offers plenty of nudity,unfortunately the pace is extremely slow.the atmosphere is horribly sad and the relationship between brigitte lahaie and another asylum inmate dominique journet is well-developed.still "night of the hunted" is too dull to be completely enjoyable.give it a look only if you are a fan of jean rollin's works.7 out of 10 and that's being kind.

even if you're a fan of jean rollin's idiosyncratic body of work, you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory. for once, there's not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight ! true to tradition, the budget proved way too tight to realize the director's vision entirely. yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema, dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity. jean-claude couty's atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and philippe br√©jean (a/k/a "gary sandeur") contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesn't resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcore.shot in and around a paris office block before and after working hours, the film was largely cast with porn regulars rollin was already quite familiar with from his "michel gentil" cash-gathering xxx efforts, most notably french f*ck film royalty brigitte lahaie in the demanding lead. playing elisabeth (rather well, i might add), she's picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by robert (vincent gard√®re), driving home at the end of a long work day. barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there, elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur, even forgetting robert's name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment. prior to making love, she rightfully describes herself as a virgin (further credit to brigitte's thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly, being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the '70s) because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his. because of this nifty bit of context, the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other "commercial" interludes rollin has had to include in other works to assure funding.when robert leaves for work, he's inevitably erased from elisabeth's feeble mind. a mysterious doctor (comedian bernard papineau effectively cast against type) and his menacing assistant solange (striking porn starlet rachel mhas) move in on her during her protector's absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from. here we get one of the movie's strongest scenes as she's re-introduced to her roommate catherine (the late cath√©rine greiner a/k/a hardcore performer "cathy stewart" in a quietly devastating turn), both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared "memories" for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate. that deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and catherine's unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup. it's also catherine who gets to voice the filmmaker's compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted them.several rather explicit - if not quite hardcore - sex scenes make up the movie's mid-section and french porn aficionados should recognize the likes of alain plumey (a/k/a "cyril val"), jacques gateau and elodie delage, along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess marilyn jess whose rape at the hands, mouth and member of plumey was only present in the film's rarely screened xxx version filles traquees. the pivotal part of v√©ronique, a girl elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with, is beautifully handled by the exquisite dominique journet - in her unforgettable debut - who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in franco zeffirelli's la traviata. the six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill, the quarantined "patients" ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell, unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace. the final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of chaplin's modern times as elisabeth, approaching complete meltdown by now, and a wounded robert stumble along the railroad bridge, clumsily clasping each other's outstretched hands.

i was surprised how much i enjoyed this. sure it is a bit slow moving in parts, but what else would one expect from rollin? also there is plenty of nudity, nothing wrong with that, particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous, brigitte lahaie. there are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead, bit more dodgey, perhaps, but most effective. there is also a sci-fi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end, but i wouldn't bother too much with that. no, here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still 'alive' without memory. my dvd sleeve mentions david cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films, there is some similarity here, particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space. as i have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller, it is a captivating, nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations, including a stunning railway setting at the end.

i went into "night of the hunted" not knowing what to expect at all. i was really impressed.it is essentially a mystery/thriller where this girl who can't remember anything gets 'rescued' by a guy who happens to be driving past. the two become fast friends and lovers and together, they try to figure out what is going on with her. through some vague flashbacks and grim memories, they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool.i really liked the setting of this one: a desolate, post-modern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings. very metropolitan. groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity.surprising it was made in 1980; seems somewhat ahead of it's time.8 out of 10, kids.

i have certainly not seen all of jean rollin's films, but they mostly seem to be bloody vampire naked women fests, which if you like that sort of thing is not bad, but this is a major departure and could almost be cronenberg minus the bio-mechanical nightmarish stuff. except it's in french with subtitles of course. a man driving on the road at night comes across a woman that is in her slippers and bathrobe and picks her up, while in the background yet another woman lingers, wearing nothing. as they drive along it's obvious that there is something not right about the woman, in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen. still though, that doesn't prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to paris & his apartment. the man leaves for work and some strangers show up at his place and take the woman away to this 'tower block', a huge apartment building referred to as the black tower, where others of her kind (for whom the 'no memory' things seems to be the least of their problems) are being held for some reason. time and events march by in the movie, which involve mostly trying to find what's going on and get out of the building for this woman, and she does manage to call robert, the guy that picked her up in the first place, to come rescue her. the revelation as to what's going on comes in the last few moments of the movie, which has a rather strange yet touching end to it. in avoiding what seemed to be his "typical" formula, rollin created, in this, what i feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film. i like this one a lot, check it out. 8 out of 10.

since this cartoon was made in the old days, felix talks using cartoon bubbles and the animation style is very crude when compared to today. however, compared to its contemporaries, it's a pretty good cartoon and still holds up well. that's because despite its age, the cartoon is very creative and funny.felix meets a guy whose shoe business is folding because he can't sell any shoes. well, felix needs money so he can go to hollywood, so he tells the guy at the shop he'll get every shoe sold. felix spreads chewing gum all over town and soon people are stuck and leave their shoes--rushing to buy new ones from the shoe store. in gratitude, the guy gives felix $500! however, felix's owner wants to take the money and go alone, so felix figures out a way to sneak along.once there, felix barges into a studio and makes a bit of a nuisance of himself. along the way, he meets cartoon versions of comics ben turpin and charlie chaplin. in the end, though, through luck, felix is discovered and offered a movie contract. hurray!

felix in hollywood is a great film. the version i viewed was very well restored, which is sometimes a problem with these silent era animated films. it has some of hollywood's most famous stars making cameo animated appearances. a must for any silent film or animation enthusiast.

a gem of a cartoon from the silent era---it was re-discovered by cartoon network, and was broadcast for likely the first time in decades, if ever.what makes this so enjoyable are the varied cameos...douglas fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitos; will hays pays a visit as 'boss' of static studios; as well as appearances by chaplin, keaton, and william s. hart. the image of chewing gum decimating the shoes of the populace (a money-making idea for felix's near-bankrupt shoe-=salesman boss) cannot be described--it must be viewed. a terrific cultural gem.

having read the unemployed critic's, review, i went to a screening of "radio" not knowing what to expect. thankfully, the unemployed critic now appears, to me anyway, a frustrated film director/movie critic. his review is callous and totally uncalled for!this is a movie that will make you laugh, it will make you cry and in the end it will give you a moment of pause!to paraphrase a line delivered by actor ed harris in the final barbershop scene "...and all this time that we thought we were teaching radio, truth is...he was teaching us. he treats us all the time, like we wish we treated each other, some of the time!"yes the movie tugs at the heartstrings. yes it is emotionally manipulative and yes cuba gooding jr. (in an oscar worthy performance) is a little over the top at times (see the christmas day dance scene) but you know what? so what! every once in awhile the community of america needs to be reminded what tolerance can do for our great country. we need to be reminded how great we can be.this is a solid cast. i was particularly pleased to see s. epatha merkerson, portraying radio's mother, do something outside of law and order. i always wondered, is ms. merkerson a great actor or is it the quality of writing delivered buy a strong cast on law and order. after watching this movie, it is easy to see that she is indeed a very fine actor.also joining the cast in small but important and powerful roles is alfre woodard as the principal, debra winger in a career-resurrecting role of coach jones's wife and chris mulkey as protagonist, frank clay.we cannot over look ed harris's performance as coach harold jones. after reflecting on this movie and having grown up in the deep south my self, it is hard to truly appreciate mr. harris and his contribution to this film. as coach jones, ed delivers a quiet, rock solid performance, that of a man on a mission. coach harris will not let the town or circumstances divert him from what he knows in his heart, is the right thing to do.if you see this movie, make sure you hang around for the end credits. you will be in for a treat as the real james robert 'radio' kennedy, now in his mid 50's, is shown, still leading the t.l. hanna football team on to the field every friday night.one final note. if you were a teen in the mid to late 70's, this movie is worth the price of admission, for the sound track alone!

cuba gooding jr. is back on top! jesus, he did a great job in this film! i loved this movie. its one of those feel good movies that makes you want to run out and volunteer at a mission or something. anyway, i would recommend seeing this movie in a heartbeat! well worth the price of admission. and as for cuba gooding jr., just give him his next oscar right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i just got home from seeing "radio." i've not seen such an inspiring story in a long time. my kids are ages 8 and 5 and i would like to take them so that they may "feel" the message as i did - you should seek to find the best in people and love them for who they are, not judge them for their differences. cuba gooding, jr. and ed harris both deserve academy awards for this movie. i don't know why we can't have more movies like this, rather than the junk that is served up at theatres on a daily basis.

this is a very moving movie about life itself. the challenges a handicapped person must face in a land that expects perfection is brought to the forefront for all to see and hopefully understand. it should teach the bigots of society that we are all humans, and while some of us are gifted with a mind, heart and sound body, there are decent human beings that exist in the world that are not as lucky, or maybe, we're the unlucky ones. we don't always see the beauty in the world because we're wrapped up in our 'blind' ambitions, and see it only in one light "what can this world do for me!!!". maybe we all wish we were like radio, a loving happy individual...who loves everyone.

as one who frequently goes to the movies, i have to say that this has been one of the most impressive movies i have seen this year. ed harris and cuba gooding jr. gave outstanding performances allowing viewers to get lost in the various emotions and really feel for the characters. it is nice to occasionally see a movie that does not depend entirely upon special effects but allows the characters of the story to touch the human psyche on many levels. i wish hollywood would produce more movies of this calibre.

cuba gooding,jr. will win the oscar for best actor in 2003.and ed harris will win for best supporting actor. what a beautiful and poignant film it is but be sure to bring along a box of tissues because if this film doesn't get to you, then you have ice water in your veins.it was 1976. the setting was in south carolina and the civil rights act was about ten years old. we have a white high school football coach and teacher, ed harris. then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow, cuba gooding, whose greatest possessions, including a radio, are piled into a shopping cart which is also used as his bicycle.ed harris takes a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained much later on in the film. he gives cuba the nickname "radio" and what follows is an absoutely riveting, engrossing, poignant exploration of the human soul.the movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.

inspired by true events, radio is one of the best acted, heart felt dramas i seen widely released in sometime. it definitely is one of the year's best films of 2003. radio stars ed harris, who is oscar worthy nonetheless in this film, as football coach harold jones. coach jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game. however coach jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by debra winger and sarah drew. one day radio, played by cuba gooding jr., in his best performance since men of honor, comes by the football field while the coach's team is practicing for the game. some members of the team, then tie up radio and throw him into a building. they then bang on the building and finally coach jones suspects something is wrong. he comes over and helps radio, who is frightened, and from that point on coach jones and radio shares a very special bond. radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in the football games and at school events. he also becomes coach jones's main interest in life over football which at first was his main priority before both his family and radio.the movie deals with all sorts of real life problems including what your priorities are life, accepting people for who they are even if they are different, death, and family relationships. the movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director michael tollin should be very proud of this film. the thing i liked most about radio was how real it felt. the performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes. radio had a great mix of comedy and drama. some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad. in conclusion, i feel that radio was very overlooked by critics only getting average reviews. they must have there heads up there butts because its amazing how this film can only get 2 star reviews and something like school of rock can get 3 or 4 stars it doesn't make any sense to me. also the performances as i mentioned before are top-notch and oscar worthy. in my opinion, both ed harris, who i think is underrated as an actor, and cuba gooding jr. should both get some kind on nomination for this movie. radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big hollywood movies. my final rating for radio is a 9/10.

cuba gooding jr. and ed harris are touching. this movie is really surprising. it was enjoyable from start to finish.the story is about mentally challenged man who helps out with a football team.

this is a movie you'll either love or hate. i loved it. if you are looking for suspense, great special effects, action, sophistication, cynicism, etc. you won't find it in this movie. it is a feel good movie, sentimental, positive, uplifting. the heroes of the movie are coach jones (played by ed harris), a man of strength and integrity, and radio (cuba gooding, jr.) a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world. i guess i didn't find this movie to be "sentimental hogwash" as so many did, because it felt very real to me. i know people like these. i've seen jocks who think it's fun to pick on the vulnerable. i've seen men of integrity stand up for the vulnerable. i've seen people who think high school football is serious business. i've seen people who know what really is important in life. any of these people could have been people i knew. i did laugh; i did cry. i left the movie feeling good, remembering that there are people like coach jones and radio in my world. if there aren't people like them in yours, you might not like the movie. if you don't like a movie that shows the better side of human nature, you'll hate it.

it may interest people to know that this film was made without any recourse to phoolan devi herself and, when she did finally see parts of it, was so enraged that she announced that the film was not to be shown in india or she would cover herself in petrol and set fire to herself. i do not know whether it was shown at all or not, but given her standing at the time as a rising politician, i doubt it. since then, i saw a report that she has been ousted from office and charged with further crimes from her dacoit days, and has gone into hiding as a result.her own concerns aside, this is an excellent film, made all the more so by its refreshingly brutal approach; none of the rose-tinted melodrama one might expect from a typical indian film. it should be stressed that concerns about how feminist the film's messages really are and the like are essentially irrelevant: it's a true story. her misgivings are, it seems, not with what is depicted but with the way in which the film depicts her.

the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved. i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. i love all six of the stooges (curly, shemp, moe, larry, joe, and curly joe)! all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team!one of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp is none other than brideless groom! all appearing in this short are dee green, the beautiful christine mcintyre, doris houck, alyn lockwood, johnny kascier, nancy saunders, and emil sitka. green and mcintyre provide great performances here! there are so many funny parts here. this is a very hilarious short. there is another similar three stooges short like this one called husbands beware and i recommend both!

there are one or two other shemp-era shorts i like more (i.e. scrambled brains), but i think one can say--without much argument--that in this particular episode, shemp gives his greatest comedic performance as a stooge after rejoining the team in 1946.scene for scene, this episode hardly lets up: from professor shemp howard's voice lessons with the glass-shattering dee green, to his futile attempts to win a dame's hand in marriage (this is your little snookums... will you marry me *click*) to the uproarious finish, it never fails to keep me in stitches.i would be remiss not mention that immortal scene with miss hopkins (the always lovely christine mcintyre). btw, isn't she rather under-dressed and over amorous in greeting the man she thinks is her 'cousin' basil? who knows, maybe the actual basil was a "very" distant cousin, which makes it legal in some states (as far as i know). >:-]

flipping through the channels i was lucky enough to stumble upon the beginning of this movie. i must admit that it grabbed my attention almost immediately. i love older films and this is or should be considered a classic! one of the most wonderful rarities of this movie is that the main character was not only female but she was also a bad girl. i highly recommend this movie!

great movie. good acting ,a wonderful script. it's exciting to find out what the people are thinking and how they react on the situation they are in. a pity about the ending; a 'page' of text of how nynke's life went on, instead of moving images was a poor choice. i hope this movie attracts a lot of people; it's worth it!

this wonderful film is a love story, and shows that not all relationships are destined to last. even so they can be great & worth the pain & suffering of breakup.director pieter verhoeff gives us an insight of the period around 1900, the way society (mis)treats women, and how a very strong woman (nynke) deals with. with great costumes, landscapes, lovely music and good actors and acting this photoplay draws you in for the length of the movie.at first the ending is a bit sudden, a page describing the rest of her life scrolls. on reflection this is a great (the best) way to have your own fantasy create the rest of her life. this was the second movie for me that had people sit while the end titles scrolled by (the first being schindler's list). apparently the movie had this effect on everybody.

nynke is a classy filmed movie in the same style as the oscar winning film character (1997). but this comparison immediately urges me to add that the latter was quite more exciting...sure, nynke is a beautiful historic & costume drama (with fantastic acting by monic hendrickx!) in which you witness the personal growth of 'nynke van hichtum' in her marriage to pieter jelles troelstra. the subtitle of this movie is 'a lovestory'. so it starts, and ends with their marriage. but that is where the director makes a crucial mistake! nynke's exciting, independent life started when the marriage ended. she wrote several children's books and travelled around the world. what a great life she has lived. but pieter verhoeff puts nynke back in the trammels of convention that depressed her and that she struggled out of: the thought that her life extended just her marriage to troelstra, being no one else but the mother of their kids.let's all hope for nynke ii!

a touching movie about a talented woman who struggles with a society and a love that structurally underestimate her. the issues are subtly addressed and timeless, as many of the depicted difficulties between man and woman still exist in dutch society today. this movie is a tribute to all modern women without dwelling on feminism. not only the story is well told, the acting and the scenery are great as well.

recovery is an incredibly moving piece of work, handling the devastating effects of brain injury on not only the individual, but the entire family. without resorting to preaching or hollywood sappy endings, tony marchant's drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way.highest praise goes david tennant and sarah parish for their incredible performances. i had presumed before watching the drama that i would see some of their previous on screen relationship in blackpool bleed through-- but it never does. neither actor is recognizable from any previous work, and i didn't see either of them as an actor playing a part during the entire 90 minutes. in addition, harry treadaway's performance as the son just on the cusp of starting his own life in university was fantastic - throughout the piece, he shows the torn nature of a teenage boy thrown into the unwilling role as man of the house,at times, nearly every character in the drama is unsympathetic. as the viewer, i wanted to give each of them a good smack to wake up to reality, stop moping, and start adjusting to the rotten but very present change in their lives. but under the same circumstances, i see myself acting like any of them - switching between trying to show the stiff upper lip to desperation to escape to anything, including behavior that is completely unlike myself. it's the show's greatest strength - truth, without sugar coating, to force us all to think what we'd be able to do under the same circumstances.this is a difficult, but must-watch show. i hope that it somehow manages to be shown in the u.s.

i just got this movie for christmas and have already added it to my favorites list. a cute and simple story which makes a beautiful movie. who could not love uncle felix or not have their mouth water at the sound of all that food. definite points go to sydney greenstreet for his performance of alexander yardley and also to reginald gardiner who played john sloane, the impossibly boring fiancee. truly a gem to be watched every christmas.

i came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday films. as you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed on for it. stanwyck is great as bride to be that is having second thoughts. dennis morgan's acting is strong also. he goes unnoticed in most films but was a very capable actor, check out kitty foyle. in this film he plays the visiting sailor that woos stanwyck away from her husband to be. this is a christmas classic. the settings and the story make for a great christmas romance

though it's a christmas movie, "christmas in connecticut" could have been done any time of year, as it's the story of a soldier who spends what is to be an idyllic time with a martha stewart type. that's what he thinks. in reality, the lady in question, portrayed by barbara stanwyck, has a popular magazine column about life on a farm with her husband and baby. she has no farm, no husband, and no baby, nor are the many recipes she publishes hers. they belong to the restaurant owner nearby. when her no-nonsense editor, sydney greenstreet, insists that she entertain soldier dennis morgan, she enlists the aid of her boyfriend to use his farm, and she transports herself and the restaurateur there. there's even a baby...well, actually, there's more than one. chaos ensues, and the charade becomes increasingly difficult to play out, especially when stanwyck falls in love with morgan.this is such a wonderful movie, and even if you're gravely depressed, "christmas in connecticut" can lift you right out of it. barbara stanwyck is wonderful as the career woman turned homemaker. despite not being as flashy as crawford or davis, she was nevertheless able to do what any role called for - she could be cheap, elegant, warm, nasty, cold, and/or sexy and she makes it look easy. on top of that, she is always attractive and alluring. dennis morgan is a handsome and charming solider; as an added bonus, he gets to use his irish tenor. fianc√© reginald gardner is all business, and you can tell he's not quite right for stanwyck. s.z. sakall as the fake uncle/real chef is hilarious, especially as he prays stanwyck can flip a pancake before an audience.i can imagine the impact this delightful film had at the tail end of world war ii. it must have been a real beacon for the better times to come.

this is a wonderful old fashioned christmas favorite, which i try to catch on tv every year if i can. it revolves around a martha stewart like journalist named elizabeth lane, charmingly portrayed by barbara stanwyck. however, in contrast to martha, this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever. the other cast members effectively complete the story, and include dennis morgan (jefferson jones), reginald gardiner (john sloan), and sydney greenstreet (alexander yardley).elizabeth lane is a journalist who writes food articles, portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children. in reality, she is a single woman living in a new york city apartment and cannot boil an egg. her recipes are borrowed from her hungarian chef friend, felix. elizabeth gets away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine, alexander yardley, decides he wants a nice old fashioned country christmas, and invites himself to visit her, bringing with him a returning war hero, jefferson jones, a sailor who had been shipwrecked. yardley demands total honesty of his employees. to get out of her predicament and save her deception based career, elizabeth borrows the connecticut country home of her longtime architect suitor, john sloan, a dull, fussy chap who has long sought marriage. she also borrows a neighbour's baby (actually, several) to pass off as her own and her 'husband' sloan's.of course this scenario makes for much merriment. it's a screwball comedy and a charming romance, with the added attraction of a christmas atmosphere. whenever i think of this movie, i picture the snowflakes falling, the tree beautifully decorated, the fire roaring in the hearth, the turkey roasting, and christmas cookies baking.why did hollywood feel compelled to do a remake? i understand there is a 1992 version, directed by arnold schwarzenegger and starring dyan cannon, kris kristofferson, and tony curtis. i have not seen this modern adaptation nor do i wish to. this old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday 'must see' along with it's a wonderful life, white christmas, miracle on 34th street, and of course all the versions of a christmas carol.

i have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites...it has all the charm, 1940's quaintness, and good old fashioned romance and it's hilarious, to boot! barbara stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking\home life articles for a famous magazine...under the premise that she is a married homemaker. even the president of the magazine is under this delusion. enter a handsome gi, (played by the talented dennis morgan)just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy. his simple wish is to stay at the homey inn the she writes so eloquently about and relax with her famous home-cooked meals. she now has to frantically find a way to save her job and reputation...add to this that her fianc√© is in a hurry to tie the knot doesn't help. the humor is superb and the chemistry between the leading characters a lot of fun. throw in the character-actor nicknamed "cuddles" (who fits this name completely) it becomes even more adorable. this has become my must-see movie that i snuggle in with a cup of cocoa each christmas season. a wonderful, enjoyable movie to enjoy at christmastime or anytime!

barbara stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy, about a sailor invited to spend christmas with a popular magazine writer's family, at her farm in connecticut. the problem is she has no husband, baby, or farm, as she writes about in her column, and she can't even cook; her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend " uncle" felix, owner of a hungarian restaurant in new york city.things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for christmas. a scheme is hastily planned, with her stuffy fianc√© providing an actual connecticut farm, neighbors providing a borrowed baby, and a quick wedding planned when the publisher isn't looking. but when the handsome young sailor arrives on christmas eve, romantic complications ensue, as the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks for the nice guy navy man and vice versa.this is a charming, warm film that deftly balances humor with sentiment and is a wonderful showcase for barbara stanwyck to display her considerable comedic talent, aided by such marvelous character actors as sydney greenstreet, una o'connor, s.z.sakall, and many others. a christmas night dance at the town hall is a toe tapping delight to see, and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of stanwyck is a wonderful surprise, for viewers who have seen her mainly as tough, bitchy women in femme fatale roles. truly a wonderful film that has stood the test of time.

personally, i don't like a lot of b/w movies, but there's something magical about this movie. the movie starts with elizabeth lane (barbara stanwyck). "liz" writes a magazine column about how she's the 'martha stewart' of connecticut. of course, she's lying. this becomes a problem when her publisher, mr yardley, asks her to play host to a navy sailor over christmas. in addition, mr yardley, who's going to be alone for christmas, invites himself up to the farm for the christmas party. from there, things just go crazy.since the movie is set on a new england farm, the movie has a warm holiday feeling. plus, the characters are hilarious. mr. yardley is always shouting orders, and liz's friend felix is always yelling 'catastroph!' when things go wrong. finally, the movie ends the way a christmas movie should end; a jolly fat man laughs and shouts "what a christmas!" in short, no matter what age you are, you will love this movie.

this film is one of my favorite christmas classics. sure, it's fluff, it's not "relevant", but when did movies being simply entertaining and fun become a bad thing? no, this movie is definitely "a good thing" as martha stewart(appropriately)would say! barbara stanwyck is so appealing in this film and dennis morgan perfectly compliments her. both of them have charm and warmth to spare. they are assisted by a crew of those incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40's and 50's--sydney greenstreet, s.z.(cuddles)sakall, reginald gardiner and una o'connor among them. where are characters like this today? not one role could have been better cast. bette davis thankfully refused this role as beneath her and she was right to refuse it. she would have attempted to steam roll over everyone and everything around her and completely destroyed the film. stanwyck was a strong actress, but had the wisdom to play this lightly. she has seldom been more appealing and is pitch perfect. morgan is the essence of the nice guy. because his part is the least splashy there is a tendency to overlook his skill. just the fact that he could hold his own surrounded by such distinct character actors is an accomplishment in itself, but he too is absolutely perfect as jefferson jones. skip the ill advised(and pointless)1992 remake and watch this bright, sparkling holiday gift!

given the acting roles he played in the 1940s (casper gutman, signior ferrari, mr. peters, jerome k. arbutny, ex-superintendent grodman, count fosco, titus semple) it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally sidney greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the west end and broadway. he was usually such a total villain, or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored. in fact he actually did make four comedy appearances (one a spoof of his villainous portrayals with his villainy partner peter lorre in a cameo appearance). his best total film appearance in a comedy was probably that of magazine publisher alexander yardley in "christmas in connecticut" (although his autocratic, half-mad soap tycoon in "the hucksters" is a close second). despite some problems with the screenplay, it is a good film, and usually revived in the christmas season.elizabeth lane (barbara stanwyck) writes a column in "american housekeeping" magazine for yardley, where she gives household tips and cooking recipes. she is the 1945 version of martha steward, except that ms steward is a cook and house-owner, and can vouch for trying out and testing what she advocates. stanwyck can't. her cooking recipes are those of her friend felix (s.z. sakall), a gourmet chef and restaurateur. the house she describes as her home (a model farmhouse in connecticut) belongs to her unofficial boyfriend, architect john sloan (reginald gardiner). gardiner really would not mind marrying stanwyck, but she is not fully ready to consider a final commitment to him.as the film begins, an american is shipwrecked by the nazis. this is jefferson jones (dennis morgan), a sailor. he spends two weeks in a raft before being rescued. sensing publicity value, greenstreet decides to grant morgan's wish to have a genuine old fashioned christmas in connecticut. he basically tells stanwyck that she will entertain morgan and himself at her farm for the holidays. stanwyck is unable to explain that the columns image of herself (complete with her ability to flip flap-jacks, and raise a baby she supposedly had with her husband) is a lie - if she does she will be fired, as will her immediate boss dudley beecham (robert shayne). in a moment of depression she accepts gardiner's proposal of marriage, and then gardiner finds his connecticut home is dragooned into becoming the "actual" home of stanwyck and himself and "their baby".of course, aside from putting off greenstreet's meddling curiosity, stanwyck and morgan find that they are falling in love (much to the annoyance of gardiner - he does actually expect that stanwyck will still marry him). complication following complication occurs, as lies piles on lies, and as neighbor's babies succeeds neighbor's babies, before greenstreet begins to wonder if he is missing something. but it is a comedy, so everything works out well. even greenstreet, at the conclusion, is amused by the entire madness - his celebrated hearty chortle mirroring that of santa clause for a change. this is not a classic comedy, certainly not a great one, but amusing enough for the season to be worth watching in december.

it's fun and fast paced, as one falsehood leads to another and another toward an inevitable, surprising conclusion. the suspense separates this holiday flick from all others. one wonders how the pieces are going to fit, both during the movie and in the future.the character actors laid the foundation and entertained us in the process. sinkewicz (frank jenks) shows us what manipulation can get...and ultimately what manipulation can cost! uncle felix (s.z. sakall) sizes up each person for us while trying to protect "lishka" (barbara stanwyck), and this helps us decide who we are going to root for in the end.if we could ever achieve a perfect world, imperfect people would likely have to undergo a series of events such as these.a glaring weakness is that fake baby cry after it allegedly swallowed uncle felix's watch. i've heard more authentic crying from a doll in a toy store.watch it, and you'll really feel like you've been somewhere!

make sure you make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season! if you admire dennis morgan or barbara stanwyck, this film is a fun one to watch. they really work well together as you would see in this movie. the whole cast was very entertaining. since i'm a dennis morgan fan, this film was a real treat! but...everyone can enjoy it! recommended!

based on actual events of 1905, silent film the battleship potemkin concerns an imperial russian ship on which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny. shocked by conditions on the ship, citizens of the port city odessa rally to the mutineers' support--and in consequence find themselves at the mercy of imperial forces, who attack the civilian supporters with savage force.potemkin is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members, and it achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of the groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences. amazingly, each of these sequences manage to top the previous one, and the film actually builds in power as it moves from the mutiny to the citizen's rally to the massacre on the odessa steps--the latter of which is among the most famous sequences in all of film history. filming largely where the real events actually occurred, director eisenstein's vision is extraordinary as he builds--not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence--some of the most memorable images ever committed to film.to describe potemkin as a great film is something of an understatement. it is an absolute essential, an absolute necessity to any one seriously interested in cinema as an art form, purely visual cinema at its most brilliant, often imitated, seldom equaled, never bested.gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

this film is a benchmark in non-mainstream cinema history. the use of montage represents a quantum leap from the relatively simple juxtapositions of strike (eisenstein's 1st film). take the scene on the steps and note the repeated shot of the soldiers descending, to reiterate the point of the horrors that actually did happen! a highly intelligent monumental film, a must see for all film students!

eisenstien's "potempkin", (bronenosets potyomkin), is among the finest films ever made and possibly the best of the silent era. eisenstien was a pioneer of film form and his use of montage editing has influenced films to this day. the odessa steps massacre footage is as powerful today as it was when first seen over 70 years ago. do not pass up the chance to see this film!

it finally hit me watching my vhs of christmas in connecticut what other film this one reminded me of. if it weren't for the fact that the other was done 20 years later, i'd say it was a remake.just as rock hudson was a phony fishing expert for abercrombie&fitch who had to get some on the job training at a fishing tournament, barbara stanwyck plays an forties version of martha stewart.stanwyck's a cooking columnist who's built up this whole image of living on a small connecticut farm with husband and baby cooking all these marvelous delicacies. trouble is she's unmarried, childless, writes her column from her apartment in new york and doesn't know how to boil water. but her writing is a hit with the public.trouble comes when she's hijacked into cooking a home christmas dinner for a war hero sailor played by dennis morgan who gets to sing a couple of songs as well. got to keep up the image at any cost. and her publisher sidney greenstreet likes the idea so well that he invites himself to the dinner.so with borrowed farm, baby, and reginald gardiner who'd like to make it real with stanwyck she tries to brazen it through. christmas in connecticut's now a yuletide classic and deservedly so. the leads are warm and human and they get great support from the assembled players. s.z. sakall as the hungarian restaurant owner/friend of stanwyck from whom she gets her cooking information and una o'connor as the housekeeper have a nice chemistry between them. reginald gardiner and stanwyck have no chemistry at all, obvious to all but reggie and he's funny in his stuffed shirt way.most people remember this film as one of sidney greenstreet's few ventures into comedy. if he's not an outright villain, a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon, greenstreet is few other things on screen. christmas in connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to burlesque his own image and he made the most of it.in a biography of barbara stanwyck, she mentions she enjoyed making christmas in connecticut as a welcome change from some villainous parts like double indemnity she'd been doing recently. one of the things that made doing the film so enjoyable was that between takes, director peter godfrey and greenstreet would do some impromptu entertaining of cast and crew with english music hall numbers. made for a relaxed and warm set and the cast responded accordingly.now if only someone had been filming those numbers.

this 1925 film narrates the story of the mutiny on board battleship potemkin at the port of odessa. the movie celebrated the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905, which was seen as a direct precursor to the october revolution of 1917. following his montage theory, eisenstein plays with scenes, their duration and the way they combine to emphasize his message, besides he uses different camera shot angles and revolutionary illumination techniques. the "odessa steps" sequence in potemkin is one of the most famous in the history of cinema. the baby carriage coming loose down the steps after its mother has been shot was later recreated in brian d' palma's the untouchables. it is clear that the film is one of the best ever made considering its time and how innovative it was though you need a little bit of patience and to be a real movie enthusiast to go through its 70 minutes.

spoilers every major regime uses the country's media to it's own ends. whether the nazi banning of certain leaflets, or the televised chinese alternative of tianamen square, governments have tried to influence the people through different mediums since the beginning of time. in 1925 though, celebrating the failed mutiny of 1905, the russian communist government supported the creation of this film, battleship potempkin. a major piece of cinematic history, it remains powerful and beautiful to this very day.set aboard the battleship potempkin, the crew are unhappy. in miserable living conditions and with maggot infested food, they are angry at their upper class suppressors. now though, after the rotten food, enough is enough. led by grigory vakulinchuk (aleksandr antonov), the crew turn upon their masters and fight for their freedom.as far as propaganda goes, "battleship potempkin" is perfect. presenting a positive light on the first, unsuccessful, communist mutiny, the film was a useful soviet tool. eighty years after the films release though, and the ussr has disappeared completely off the map. the amazing thing about this film though is that whilst the country it's message was intended for has disappeared, the film remains a powerful and worthy piece of cinema.written and directed by sergei eisenstein, the film is surprisingly a joy to watch. it is true, that it is far from what we would nowadays consider 'entertainment', but the film is a beautiful piece of art.whether it be the scenes aboard the boat or the often talked about scene on the steps of odessa, everything about this film is perfectly made. the music is powerful and dramatic, the lighting is flawless, even the acting, whilst slightly overdone, is perfect for the piece. basically, there is no way to fault this film's end product.it's impossible to know how the russian people received this film upon it's release. praising a country which has not existed for fifteen years, it's difficult for us to know the full spirits that the film inspires. as a piece of art though, it is magnificent. beautiful from start to finish, it is far from an easy watch, but it is well worth the effort.

the photography and editing of the movie is exceptional for the time period. eisenstein builds upon each scene of the movie leading to the the sailor's revolt and the massacre at the town. as much as the movie is a high point in the cinema, it is also an example of szocialist realism. by 1925 the soviet government actively used the arts, including film, as a means to spread the message of the revolution. eisensteins portrayal of the revolt on the battleship potempkin offers the viewer insight into the message of the soviet elite. marxist theory and perspectives of class struggle are demonstrated as the sailors who represent the oppressed workers and the officers who represent the elite of society. much of the film demonstrates the communist party message and how film was used as a tool of propaganda.

the movie touches the soul of the audience very much,some scene in the movie is ultimate and tears comes out automatically,i'm surprised by seeing this movie that any director can direct this type of movie in the year 1925.as a student of cinema i can say this movie helps a lot to understand use of montage.first time when our teacher told us about this movie means genre of this movie we thought nothing could be there in this movie to understand but finally when sir explained it then we came to know how great this movie is.lastly i can say it helps a lot understanding films.and being a cinema student i can the viewers that they can see this movie.

it was surprising that a silent film could be so easy to watch. the economy with which it has been edited and the films structure itself are the main elements that contribute to this.the film really captures the spirit of the revolution that it is dealing with - you really sympathise with the sailors and citizens. of course, this film has it's own agenda, but as it is a practically redundant cause, it can be viewed as a piece of entertainment in a much clearer sense.the tension created on the screen is excellent - starting with the battleship itself, and then moving onto the mainland. things escalate believably and for a film of it's era, it really is quite unflinching in revealing the sacrifices made by the characters in the film.this really is worth sitting through, (that is if you can adjust your modern viewing habits for 90mins).

forget jimmy stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead. i suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and stanwyck's other great christmas story, "meet john doe" aren't revered with the same level of love as...well, you know it's name.stanwyck plays a food writer for a mccall's-type rag who has been lying for years to her pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes. she's an ace b.s. artist until the day morgan's sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days afloat & 6 weeks recuperation in a navy hospital. released the last year of wwii, the film is dusted with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia but never sinks to sentimentality. stanwyck is sexy and sassy as always and meets her match in the hunky morgan with whom it's love at first sight. unfortunately, she has to play married to gardiner's prissy architect who actually has been seeking her hand for years at his farm in ct, just to fool her boss.s.z. sakall adds a great deal of hungarian malaprop & double-entendre humor in support as babs' true source of culinary talent & una o'connor is hilarious as gardiner's obnoxious irish housekeeper.

at the time that this movie was made most housewives knew exactly who barbara stanwick was parodying.today only some women over 50 probably remember gladys taber,whose column "butternut wisdom" ran in family circle magazine from before world war ii until the 1970's.she lived on stillmeadow farm in conecticut,and her columns were collected into a number of books,stillmeadow seasons, stillmeadow daybook, etc. the lines that barbara stanwick recites as she types them for her column are quite typical of the ones that began a typical gladys taber column.besides cooking and country living,she got rather nostalgic and philosophical at times.she talked a lot about her favorite dogs, mostly cocker spaniels.you might say that martha stewart is the gladys tabor of today.christmas is connecticut may not be any cinematic masterpiece,but it is pleasant,lighthearted entertainment,soothing to the stressed out mind,and that is good enough

from the perspective of the hectic, contemporary world in which we live, the so called `good old days' always seem so much more serene and innocent; an idyllic era gone by of which we have only memories and shadows that linger on the silver screen, as with `christmas in connecticut,' a warm and endearing film directed by peter godfrey. barbara stanwyck stars as elizabeth lane, a popular `martha stewart' type magazine columnist who writes about life on her beloved farm in connecticut, always with the latest recipe at the center of the story. one of her biggest fans is alexander yardley, played by sidney greenstreet, the publisher of the magazine for which she writes. yardley has never visited her farm, and in response to an idea expressed to him in a letter from a nurse, mary (joyce compton), he decides to spend an old fashioned christmas with elizabeth, her husband and child and, as a special guest, a certain mr. jefferson jones (dennis morgan), a sailor just recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his ship was torpedoed. elizabeth of course cannot refuse her boss, but there are problems; not the least of which is the fact that she has no farm and writes her column from the comfort of a high-rise in the city. it makes for a precarious situation for her as well as her editor, dudley beecham (robert shayne), as the one thing mr. yardley demands from his employees is total honesty. what follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that transports the audience back to a seemingly more simple time and place, to share a christmas past where a warm hearth, good food and kindness prevail.barbara stanwyck absolutely sparkles as elizabeth, with a smile and presence warmer than anything the grandest hearth could provide, and totally convincing as a city girl entirely out of her element on the farm. morgan also fares well as the somewhat naive sailor, whose trust in his fellow man is admirable. even with the deceptions being played out around him, he's the kind of guy you know will somehow land on his feet, and in the end it's elizabeth you really feel for. one of the true delights of this film, however, is sidney greenstreet. his yardley has a gruff exterior, but beneath you know without a doubt that this is a man with a heart as big as texas. it's a straightforward, honest portrayal, and it's a joy to watch him work; the most memorable scenes in the movie belong to him.the supporting cast includes reginald gardiner (john sloan), the terrific una o'connor (norah), frank jenks (sinkewicz) and dick elliott (judge crothers). a feel-good movie that plays especially well during the christmas season (though it would work any time of the year), `christmas in connecticut' is a memorable film that never takes itself too seriously, is thoroughly uplifting and will leave you with a warm spot in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be. it's a true classic, and one you do not want to miss. i rate this one 10/10.

i first saw this film about 15 years ago, and i have been enchanted by it ever since. it is such a feel-good experience, that i could happily watch it at any time of the year. however, to me, it is the ultimate christmas movie.the fact that it is in b&w is irrelevant - although i often wonder what it would be like in colour. you can just get that warm, glowing feeling watching the christmas events unfold. stanwyck and morgan are perfect together, and greenstreet is the antithesis of his usual character, sakall is a blustering joy to watch.it is light relief and certainly does not tax the brain, but leaves you feeling glad that you saw it.i can't wait for it to become available on dvd in the uk. i shall certainly be at the front of the queue to buy it.

this christmas gift arrived courtesy of tcm. we had never seen the film, even though we have seen most of the films of barbara stanwyck. this comedy made us laugh so much, that at times, we had to restrain ourselves, in order to hear the dialog.this is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations, especially around christmas. it would certainly lift one's spirits by just letting go. the movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a dvd, or a vhs tape. "christmas in connecticut" was directed with great panache by peter godfrey, based on a story by aileen hamilton. the best thing in the movie is the felicitous pairing of two of the most popular stars of that era: barbara stanwyck and dennis morgan. barbara stanwyck always played strong willed women, obviously, this was a change of pace for her. in this film, as well as "lady eve", ms. stanwyck displays a knack for comedy. she and mr. morgan, who played in a lot of musical comedies, make a winning combination.there are no weak performances in the film. sydney greenstreet, an actor notorious for playing 'heavies', is a delight to watch as the rich, and fat, alexander yardley, the man who owned a media empire and who knew a good thing when he saw it. reginald gardiner, an accomplished english actor, adds luster to the stellar cast behind the two principals.s. z. sakall, is another source of continuous mirth; he plays the hungarian chef felix,who has a hard time with his own version of the english language. also, una o'connor makes a perfect norah, the housekeeper in the sloan perfect connecticut farm.in reading other comments in this forum, it's sad to learn that the glorious black and white cinematography is not appreciated by some people. after all, color was not widely used in the 40s, and most of the classic movies have to be seen in its original format because, what would be accomplished in 'coloring' them?this film should be a requirement for anyone looking to spend almost two hours of uninterrupted fun at christmas time because total merriment is assured. watch it with an open mind and heart an maybe you'd like to see "christmas in connecticut" every year.

first, i loved the documentary. it represents a new school history/theory where a subject can reflect a wide range of social and historical issues.i'll get the camera and dogs out of the way first. i hate the blair witch quality of the camera, but also understand the advantage of such a casual approach. in fact, i agree with the other reviewer that it gives us unprecedented access.dogs: warning, i have a doctoral degree in literature which i do not use as a profession, so some of my training may seep in: the dogs are a beautiful metaphor for the complex relationship of human's great endeavors and our need to find the labor to achieve them. the dogs might reflect their owners, as one reviewer suggested. but they also serve as a stand-in for the workers we see in the film. while this might hint at the marxist problem raised by one reviewer, i think it also shows how difficult it is to globalize labor issues. no mondovi's in italy may not translate as well elsewhere. (yikes! i am a marxist at heart and hate to hear my cynical resignation hold sway!) it is a remarkable bait and switch. the dogs are family, the workers are family. but, in the end, the dogs are the workers (the last scene with the poor farmer). while you may disagree with the politics, the artistry of the analogy, coupled with the more overt politics of the film, are wonderful.had only faulkner (i am from alabama) had the power of film beyond the hollywood market, what interesting tales would have been told.

our reviewer from toronto told you what you need to know about this film (except note that it needs editing-the hand held technique gets really old, really fast). i saw this film last night in menerbes, france-we are in the luberon valley, which is covered with vineyards and of course wine makers. they were all there in the salle de polyvalente for the showing-crammed in. polite, patient, genial. although my french is testy, i got the gist of the film but noted that the audience loved the "old" terror growers interviewed-esp. the one from a communist village in languedoc. he got a lot of laughs. this is unusual in france-laughing aloud. there is no question which side of the terror-globalization war they are on! sm

mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary. in the world of wine there is a huge different between the big winery and the small one. it's not just about size of of your vineyard but also the amount of money and power you have. if you have enough money to place ads in the wine spectator and hire a so called "wine except" then it doesn't matter the size of your estate. also in business world of today wine often has to mass marketed and suited to people's taste. what is means many times wine filtered of it's origin. mondovino shows the commercial side of wine in that of mega producer robert mondavi, and michael rolland the wine expert who shapes wine to the taste of today's critics like robert parker who is also in the film. now these men are not evil or wrong for they have done a great deal of good for wine. but they have power on a grand scale. as we all know power corrupts. mondovino also shows small wine makers such as aime guilbert of the languedoc and hubert de montille of volnay in burgundy. these wine makers are not starving wine makers but they know like all great wine makers that it's about where the grapes are from. the best example of this is explained not by a wine maker but by a haitian man working for neal rosenthal the wine importer. the area the grapes are grown the terroir that matters, that a guiding hand that knows this makes important real wine.

it's not really about wine. no, nossiter's real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate the peculiarities of local (wine) production for business purposes. to this end he has made an excellent, objective film. spirited, bumptious, emotional and flawed independent wine producers are juxtaposed with media-finessed, anodynesprech amercians and auld-europeans: the art of wine-making against market-driven, laboratorised product manufacture. it's an open show that doesn't lead conclusion.nossiter's film is occasionally infuriating to watch - cameras are neither concealed, nor steadicam, by any means. there are also plenty of captions as well as subtitles to wade through, often too short a time on screen.however it does outdo michael moore at the game moore can't play anyway. the characters speak for - and therefore condemn - themselves. well worth a viewing 7/10

just saw this movie 2 days ago. a very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine. i have no special interest in wine, and yet i found this very enlightening. the director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people as they are. while he exposes a lot of things that are below the surface he manages not to take a stand and leave that for the viewer. he shows a lot of compassion to people (and dogs) and sympathy and let people tell their story and in the same time exposes what they don't want to tell.the movie shows us where our world is going to, what are the benefits and what is the heavy price we pay. it is a movie about the love of wine and the love of making it big, personal and global, character and formula.the real stars of the people for me are the older wine makers with their disillusioned look at the world and themselves.it takes some time to get use to the hectic camera moves and editing, but it's worth it.highly recommended.

i attended a screening of "fierce people" at the 2006 woodstock film festival. i hesitate to label it a "premiere" of any sort, since it was shot in the spring of 2004 and had its world premiere at tribeca in 2005. it played several festivals that year. release seemed imminent, then it disappeared. poof. vanished. or so it appeared to the film-going public. rumors of a theatrical or dvd release have popped up now and then, but all proved unfounded. then this screening was announced. perhaps one can call it a "re-premiere?" it certainly felt as if i was witness to a buried treasure. and what a treasure it was.i suppose one could characterize "fierce people" as a coming-of-age drama. but it also has elements of comedy and tragedy, as well as mystery. and a bit of farce thrown in. in short, real life. that makes it hard to pigeonhole, which puts it more into the category of an indie as opposed to a hollywood movie. but its high production values, big budget feel, and star caliber cast seem at odds with the indie label. so let's call it a hybrid. and, perhaps, that's why it's been "lost." it defies categorization.meet finn earl (anton yelchin), 15, whose father is absent. in fact, finn has never known him. but he sees him and hears him via the collection of home movies sent from south america. dad is a renowned anthropologist, and has made a name for himself by setting up shop with the yanomani, the tribe of "fierce people" who live to kill and, well, procreate. all their activities are built around those two "tasks," and finn is captivated by it. mom liz (diane lane) is also somewhat absent. although present physically, she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol. so finn becomes an adult in his little solitary world with his reels of film.one summer, mom decides to drag finn along with her into the wilds of new jersey. a massage therapist, mom has catered to a wealthy client, ogden c. osborne (donald sutherland, in a tour de force performance) and he has invited her for an extended house call at his palatial estate. osborne's "tribe" includes an assortment of eccentric rich kids, servants, and village idiots among whom finn will find himself part of his own anthropological study. will his experience with dad's films help him survive life as a visitor to this tribe? will he be accepted? or will he be seen as an outsider, concurrently struggling with his own identity as an adolescent? such is the stuff of fairy tales, and i suppose this would be if not for the dark underbelly which director griffin dunne and writer dirk wittenborn have infused into this magnificent story.with anton yelchin's voice-over, intercutting pieces of dad's home movies, finn must learn to go back to being the teenager he never really had a chance to be, stop being the parent to his mom, allow newly-sober mom to be parent to him, and learn responsibility on the way to adulthood the way it should have taken place all along. yet he needs to make this transformation in a dangerous, dark world where playing with fire is folly to this fractured family.this is, first and foremost, a story-driven film and griffin dunne emphasized as much in the intro to the film. he bought the rights to wittenborn's novel even as it was being written, and wittenborn's own screenplay comes to life in the hands of the masterful dunne in a way that's a work of wonder.this is also largely a character-driven film, and sutherland has never been better. his star turn as osborne stunned those around me and will likely leave you amazed as well. diane lane's character ultimately exhibits so many personalities that it's hard to imagine another actor pulling it off so well. she is breathtaking. but more than anything, "fierce people" is anton yelchin's film. he has a long resume as a child actor but preciously little as a teen. other than the little-known "house of d" (also a gem), he is best known as byrd on tv's "huff." in january, he will be seen in "alpha dog" (also sitting on the shelf since 2004, a film i saw at sundance this year and in which he is the "heart and soul"). his performance here goes far beyond what one would expect from someone so young, and is nothing short of spectacular.this complex, quirky film has remained out of sight long enough. "fierce people" is a treasure filled with light and shadow, comedy and tragedy, joy and pathos, but mostly wonder.

in the 2nd of his historical martial arts films, chiba portrays his real life sensei mas oyama. the film even recreates oyama's incredible feat of killing a raging bull with his bare hands (oyama did this feat over 50 times in real life). dynamic fight choreography featuring authentic kyokushinkai techniques. ironically this is one of the rare sonny chiba films in which he doesn't tear out or rip off body parts of opponents. a must see for sonny chiba fans definitely one of his top 5 films

oddly enough, the independent film channel showed this film a week after it showed karate bear fighter--even though the bear film was the second in the trilogy and this film was the first!!! what were they thinking?! while all three of these films are supposedly based on the life of this great kyokushin karate master, you can't help but think that they must have embellished the story quite a bit--especially in this first film. sure, the guy evidently did fight and kill a bull and later a bear (in fact, he fought and killed many bulls during his career), but in this film set in the early 50s, at the end of the film, the hero actually fights about 60 guys and kills many of them brutally. i just can't imagine that this really occurred. so i did some checking and found that while many of the details are correct, some of this film is pure bunk! yes, he did kill a man in self-defense and yes he did follow the widow and her son and spent a year working for them--trying to get them to forgive him. but the end of the film is great to watch but hogwash. seeing one of his opponents get a staff thrust through his head and all the other gory details couldn't have happened or else the japanese government would have locked oyama up to protect society! the film is entertaining and the fighting is excellent. there are no complaints about the action or acting. the only minor complaint is the camera work--which is a tad sloppy during some of the fight scenes. despite this minor complaint, this is a most enjoyable film. in many ways, the wandering karate master theme is pretty reminiscent of the zatoichi films--which are also lots of fun to watch but many of the exploits are truly impossible.fyi--there is an englished dubbed version of this film entitled "champion of death" and i just saw it as well. it's not a bad dubbing and it was letter boxed (a big plus), but still i prefer the subtitled version.

mas oyama was the most successful karate master of the late 20th century. he rejected the "training" of the karate clubs of the time focusing on an intense no holds form of training. he eventually built his system into a huge business empire with hundreds of schools across the world, without compromising his teachings. the testing in the kyokushin schools are still some of the most physically challenging tests any martial art school requires. one non- physical hardship oyama faced was prejudice due to his korean ancestry and he spent time proving that loyalties were to japan and japanese karate. this movie series was part of that effort although anyone who had the chance to meet oyama (i did) would never question his allegiance to japan. in this series, oyama's most famous student, sonny chiba, is called upon to portray his master.oyama arrives from the countryside where he has been training alone. he challenges and makes short work of the established karate schools he encounters. disgusted by the state of karate, oyama returns to his lone training. he eventually picks up a student, falls in love and gets in the way of gangsters who are allied with the established karate schools. in the middle of this is the legendary bullfight with a mad bull. how much of the film is true is questionable.that oyama could kill a bull with his bare hands is true. he was called on to repeat this feat numerous times. there are filmed instances of oyama actually doing this, although sometimes the bulls seemed to be tethered as oyama was getting on in years. sonny chiba portrays his master with conviction and the karate is quite good. chiba may not have been the best karate practitioner but, at this point in time, he was certainly above average. as a whole the movie is good, much better then most martial art films in the drama department. i always wondered why it's not more well known. possibly it the very realistic depictions of martial arts. people are shown getting tired and hurt unlike 99% of action film where the hero is a limitless fountain of energy and each blow instantly dispatches an opponent to death. chiba seems so exhausted at one point that it hurts to watch. perhaps viewers rather not have their entertainment reflect reality so closely.recommended especially for martial artists.

sonny chiba, as everyone knows, is the man. in this film, he portrays mas oyama (1923-1994), a real martial artist who fought over 50 bulls with his bare hands¬Öand won (interesting guy¬Ölook him up). anyway, chiba only kills one bull in the film but it's a memorable scene and as the liner notes say, right up there with the zombie vs. shark scene in zombi! the film also offers up loads of hand-to-hand combat and a decent plot to boot, though i don't believe all of it is true. this film is the first of the oyama trilogy chiba made and is recommended for fans of martial arts action. finally, three neat little tidbits; part of the opening theme was used in kill bill volume 1, oyama himself appears in the opening sequences, and that is because he trained chiba in real life for five years!

when it comes to movies, i don't easily discriminate between crap, pure crap and masterpieces. i believe this movie is an absolute masterpiece and it's hard to keep me entertained for more than 90 minutes. this movie ran slower than mystic river and harry potter 3 combined and i still managed to stay riveted to my seat. for me, it was the passion that eric bogosian put into his performance. it's extremely difficult to pull off such a stunt and manage to garner any positive effect from it. bogosian probably nailed one of the toughest single-man performances in modern cinema. i didn't have any respect for bogosian until the end of the film. the entire monologue minutes before the inexorable climax was the turning point, it was the key that turned me around. this man hit a point so low that he knew he could never recover from it. the corporate boys congratulated him on the performance. his blistering prose made even the slimiest one in the cavalcade shake his head in awe. it made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy don't matter in the world of talk radio, even in the corporate world for that matter. stone may have been pushing some uber-liberal agenda but it was the actual movie and production that got my attention. oliver stone is a minor master of the moody. the final third of the film had probably the best lighting and cinematography i have seen in any film. stone artfully makes the dj booth feel like five-by-seven cell in a nineteenth century prison. visually speaking, it appears that bogosian's only friend is the black foam that absorbs his routine vitriol. he speaks and it doesn't speak back. it's a sad metaphor considering the way he treats the people who handed him his success. stone and bogosian carved out a stunning film of a man who is trapped in both a prison of walls and a prison of self. this man is confined to his own volition and he can never escape it. the scene that made me realize his conundrum was when he was unwilling to his ex-wife back. he preferred his own prison instead of the world on the outside. every story has a conflict and it came down to the simplest of all conflicts: man versus himself. 'talk radio' presents this conflict in an intelligent, gripping, and artful fashion. there are no hidden messages in this film and the progression of events should be expected by any astute viewer. i just leaned back and let my mind be grasped by this film and i loved it. it's unheralded, unseen, and it will never receive its due recognition. let's hope it stays that way because gems deserve to be found and then hidden again. it's a gem because i found it in the discount dvd bin at my local wal-mart store. for $5.50, it was worth the half-hour i spent digging trying to find it. i did and i got more than my money's worth. this is one of the best movies ever made and that is worth ten reasons alone. ten reasons give a score of ten.here ends my rant!

first, a word of caution. the dvd box describes this film as a comedy. i don't think that was the intention of anyone connected with the film other than some marketing morons. while light and a little bit funny in places, it is not a comedy and if you expect that you will be disappointed.i had never even heard of this film and had absolutely no expectations one way or the other. considering that the other two dvds i picked up were big disappointments, i was so happy when i saw this film. the acting, writing and direction were excellent. the story itself definitely interested me, as you don't usually see films about the final month of france before the nazi takeover in 1940. it gave some insight into the parasites that gave up so quickly and agreed to partitioning their beloved country. along the way, there are plots involving a selfish and weak actress played very well by isabelle adjani--who looks marvelous after all these years. she kills an ex-lover and then finds a poor sap to take the fall. this sap escapes from prison and finds her--with another lover--a high government official and weasel played by gerard depardieu. in addition, a subplot about a jewish physicist trying to smuggle deuterium out of the country is introduced and eventually this becomes the main plot. the story has a lot of nice twists and turns, a light sense of humor (without trying to be a comedy) and some genuine suspenseful moments. together, they create a nice package this is sure to please.

i think that the costumes were excellent, and the hairdressers also performed well. it has the very authentic feeling for that period of time.i don't know if it was the computer magic or if it was real. some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background. i was especially impressed with the scene of that bridge.the main character the actress also performed well, she showed us a nervous, witty woman who knows how to use herself to seduce men to get what she wants.some of the scenes were hilarious. even though it was about 2 hours long, but it was never boring. a very good entertaining movie.

while amiable and amusing for gay audiences, frank oz's film "in and out," about a closeted gay teacher who has been outed on national television by a former student, has been sanitized and deodorized to appeal to the larger and more profitable straight viewers that patronized "the bird cage." although audiences likely patted themselves on the back for being tolerant and liberal enough to see the film, the movie revolves around kevin kline's howard brackett, who is a grossly stereotyped gay man. the movie asserts that a tendency to dance to disco music, revel in barbra streisand movies, and dress well indicates one's sexual orientation. like "queer eye," the film actually takes a backhanded slap at straight men and stereotypes them as slovenly, dim witted, and lacking in taste and culture. ok, so "in and out" is only a comedy, but even comedies send messages that can hurt.unfortunately, at the center of the film's humor lies a somewhat pathetic character. howard is middle aged, deeply closeted or in self-denial, and evidently has never had a sex life. a three-year engagement to a female teacher in the school where he works is described as a series of sunsets, long talks, and watching "funny lady." fortunately, joan cusack plays howard's intended, emily montgomery, and she steals the show throughout. most of the film's funniest moments belong to her, although kline's attempts to resist dancing during an instruction tape on macho behavior are hilarious. he is a gifted physical performer, but the film gives him only few moments to shine. matt dillon also stands out as the student turned actor, and the clip from his oscar-nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical. however, despite the movie's gay theme, there is no boy-meets-boy romance, and only one male-to-male kiss, and that smooch is about as erotic as the one between michael and fredo corleone in "godfather ii." although well intentioned, "in and out" fails to address the injustices and prejudices that it illustrates. howard is fired from his teaching job despite his outstanding performance and credentials, yet little outrage is expressed. most of the characters are more upset about the cancelled wedding than about howard's self-realization, which seems to take place overnight, and his abrupt and unjust dismissal. not surprisingly, howard's parents, endearingly portrayed by debbie reynolds and wilford brimley, and his students rise to support him. however, the sugary finale is as embarrassing to the audience as it evidently was to howard brackett in the film. the movie would have been more refreshing if it had revolved around a gay man who dressed like a slob, was a rabid fan of football, drove a station wagon, listened to country music, and lived on fast food. despite some good performances and funny situations, "in and out" perpetuates stereotypes and, whether they be positive or negative, stereotypes should be consigned to the dustbin of social history.

a beautifully constructed and brilliantly acted comedy. there is not a person in the cast who does not acquit himself (or herself) with hilarious distinction. however, the real star of the film is the unseen director, frank oz, who brings all the madcap sensibility and wit to this farce that he brought to miss piggy's encounters with kermit the frog. this is a not -to-be-missed film.

the funniest performance was by shalom harlow, as matt dillon's supermodel girlfriend. she was more interesting to me than all the lead actors. this movie got it all wrong; even the most dependable actress of the century, joan cusask, was not able to rise about the ridiculousness of the plot. i did enjoy hearing "macho man" by the village people over the closing credits. the rest of the movie might have been tolerable if it were to rise to that level of energy.

hollywood movies since the 1930s have treated gays as lepers. in condemning homosexuality, the film industry has reflected only what the repressive society of its day espoused as an ideology. for example, in the 1962 otto preminger melodrama "advise and consent," straight actor don murray was cast as a queer congressman who commits suicide rather than confess his alternative lifestyle. gay movie characters have covered a lot of ground since "advise and consent." in the 1997 movie "in & out," (**1/2 out of ****), heterosexual actor kevin kline is cast as a homosexual teacher who comes out of the closet on his wedding day. while the conservative hollywood of yesteryear stipulated that the congressional queer in "advise and consent" had to commit suicide, the liberal hollywood of today dictates that the gay english teacher should be embraced rather than maced.basically, "in & out" preaches good citizenship in the garb of a politically correct comedy. director frank oz and scenarist scott rudnick endorse honesty as the best policy because honesty always ensures happiness. high school teacher howard brackett (kevin kline of "the big chill") will be happy only after he comes out of the closet, just as his once-fat-but-now-thin fianc√©e emily (joan cusack) will only feel happy when she can ditch her diet. ultimately, the movie contends that straight society will accept gays when homosexuals can act with greater honesty and candor about themselves. the happily outed gay tabloid reporter played by straight actor tom selleck here effectively dramatizes this open-minded commentary.rudnick's lightweight script embellishes the true life incident that occurred at the oscars when tom hanks paid tribute to a high school teacher. in "in & out," cameron drake (matt dillon), a blond, brad pitt style bimbo type actor, wins the oscar for impersonating a fruity foot soldier. drake honors his mentor howard brackett during his acceptance speech. not contend to stop there, the candid cameron reveals to a live, television audience that howard is gay! suspicion, paranoia, and horror set in as the media descend upon the sleepy town of green leaf, indiana. (when would a no-name high school english teacher's sexual deviance spark such massive media concern?) among those reporters lurks peter malloy (tom selleck of "high road to china"), and he wants to do a week-long exclusive one on howard. howard, however, wants nothing to do with the witch-hunting media, especially the pesky peter malloy. howard denies drake's gay charges to everybody, including his fianc√©e and his mom. malloy lingers because he smells a scoop. the revelation has turned green leaf upside down. high school principal tom halliwell (bob newhart) squirms nervously with all the media coverage. halliwell warns howard that were his marriage not imminent, he'd have to give him a pink slip. meanwhile, peter bets howard that his marriage to emily will fall through at the last moment and he'll be there to record the result on camera.howard resorts to audio tapes about macho men. he struggles to reform himself. but howard's efforts are futile. guilt swells up inside him. and then there is peter malloy, who rags him to come clean about his homosexuality. finally, at the altar in the sight of god, howard bursts. of course, bride-to-be emily montgomery is floored by howard's gay confession. predictably, the school fires howard, but he shows up for graduation. drake shows up, too, and rushes to brackett's defense. not only has the school stripped howard of his job, but they've also given his teacher-of-the-year award to somebody else. drake appeals to the principal and wins howard the unanimous support of the community.the biggest defect in rudnick's contrived script is howard himself. rudnick has created a character too chaste to be true, either by gray or straight standards. howard brackett looms as more of a saint than a sinner. he helps one student gain admission to college, and he coaches the track team. how often do you hear of an english teacher doubling as a coach, too? everybody at his high school adores howard. he doesn't have a mean bone in his body. further, rudnick and oz ask us to believe that nobody else in green leaf is gay. where are howard's gay friends? are they too scared to come to his defense? no, "in & out" is not targeted strictly at homosexual audiences. oz, whose screen credits include cute comedies like "dirty rotten scoundrels" and "house sitter," as well as rudnick teeter on a politically correct tightrope. "in & out" is not a gay recruiting movie. the filmmakers show no interest in what prompted either howard or peter malloy to prefer the gay lifestyle. instead, oz and rudnick are only interested in shoring up a thin premise: is he or isn't he gay? they flesh it out to involve the community response to the answer. finally, when howard admits that he is gay, the filmmakers devote the rest of the movies to showing how a conservative, norman rockwell-like town can accept him despite his difference.the most shocking scenes in "in & out" is probably when tabloid reporter malloy does a lip lock on howard. straight guys kissing each other in a movie about a gay identity crisis are as hilarious as they are phony. kline and selleck grind their faces together in what appears as more of a head-on collision than a closed-mouth kiss. nothing at all like the controversial 1994 british movie "priest," "in & out" emerges as an engaging but labored piece of social propaganda with its okay-to-be-act message. if "ellen" weren't the tv equivalent, "in & out" would probably be heading toward tv as a new sitcom. watching "in & out" is not so much about dealing with the issue of gay or straight, but how to be a decent person in the last days of the 20th century. what makes "in & out" a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is its equal opportunity cheers and jeers about queers and steers.

i have seen this movie many times and i never get sick of it. it is about a man coming out of the closet, that he doesn't know he is in. kevin kline's character is a teacher and when one of his former students announces kline's character is gay the people in his town start to speculate whether he is straight or gay. kline's character starts to wonder if he is straight or gay too. the acting is absolutely fabulous and hilarious by all the cast. i found the movie very funny and heart-warming. i love this movie, it makes you laugh and makes you feel good while watching it. i recommend this movie to everyone, you will have a great time watching it.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** i loved the set-up and consistently laughed throughout the entire movie. the acting was great, with my favorite part being howard's (kevin kline) attempts to be a "manly man". the fiance and parents did a great job as a supporting cast. spoiler warning: the acting of his conservative family's acceptance and attempts to be polite were heartwarming and believable. my only problem with the end was the fact that howard was actually gay. the movie is set-up as a "be who you want to be", but the movie actually does the opposite. howard's logic behind his "discovery" is the fact that he loves barbra streisand's movies and enjoys dancing to music. his mannerisms and tastes appear to be gay, and it isn't until it is pointed out to him that he realizes it. rather than setting howard free, it pigeon holes him. oh, he likes to dance to music, than he must be gay. his confession at the marriage felt like a bending down to society's wishes. in the end, the movie becomes a gay rights movie, which was not the original course. it almost becomes bland with the rest. i believe the movie would had been ultimately better had howard been straight. it would have been truer to the message.

manna from heaven is heavenly. this is a movie for the family -- teens and grandparents can enjoy it together. but it isn't syrupy sweet or silly. the characters really are "characters". the plot is somewhat complex and you have to pay attention, but it's like putting a puzzle together as it all falls into place bit by bit. the period beginning is like watching an old photo album, or remembering back when. it's extremely well done with very accurate hairstyles and costumes. the story moves along quickly with twists, turns and lots of fun.a special treat is to watch the large cast of familiar faces, many of whom we haven't seen in much too long a time. part of the fun is to recognize and name them mentally as they appear, though this can be distracting. cloris leachman by the end of the film looks as if she's had a make-over on "oprah". i had never seen faye grant in a movie -- only knew her as grace's mother in the tv series "saving grace". she was great, even minus the southern accent. and i didn't even recognize shelly duvall. the five sisters who created this very lovely film are a very talented quintet and sister theresa is a heavenly treasure.

what a great cast for this movie. the timing was excellent and there were so many clever lines-several times i was still laughing minutes after they were delivered. i found manna from heaven to have some surprising moments and while there were things i was thinking would happen, the way they came together was anything but predictable. this movie is about hope and righting wrongs. i left the theater feeling inspired to do the right thing. bravo to the five sisters.

i found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting. initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in buffalo, intrigued me. later i found myself lost in the power of the film. how do you repay a gift from god? the ability of characters to rise above their base natures and respond to the touch from god warmed my heart. the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film. i left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race. what more can any film do? hollywood, i hope your paying attention. america does like positive, upbeat films.

being from the buffalo area i was well aware of the movie having read many articles in local publications. i was most impressed with the movie, especially its clever plot, the acting and the local scenes. nice to see so many older, quality stars in the various roles. i feel that especially those of us over 50 will find the movie excellent and you can leave the theater feeling that your time was well spent.

as a native of the city where the story takes place, buffalo, ny, it's fun to see the local sites but the story line is so local and fun, too!the small scale promoting of this film requires strong word of mouth to accomplish the wide viewing it deserves. please make this film the success the big, fat greek wedding was.

`manna from heaven' is a delightfully compelling film.within the shifting paradox of values in middle-class americans from 40 years ago to the present day, the plot tweaks the concerns and hopes of an interesting range of `damon runyonesque' characters.their struggles with moral dilemmas, dotting on `what might have been,' hopes to yet fulfill youthful dreams, romantic yearnings, and `hit it big' combine to make a most entertaining film. rather than relying upon `in-your- face' sexual explicitness, the burgeoning relationship between inez and mac/bake is classically subtle but clear. his untying the knot in her shoelace at the art gallery and their heat in their poker game is outstandingthe script's crisp writing is skillfully interpreted by an outstanding star and supporting cast. one of the few films i have ever fone to see twice in its opening run, `manna from heaven' definitely warrants national distribution.conrad f. toepfer

in the wasteland that hollywood productions have become of late, this movie - in and of itself - is truly "manna from heaven"!!!in what could best be described as a "cute" movie, approximately 350 years of movie acting experience (allright - give or take 100 years!) joyously lights up the screen to tell a tale of deceit, remorse, and redemption about a catholic family in buffalo, ny.truly well-positioned to take its place in the "feel-good" movie genre, this quiet little independent film by the burton sisters' five sisters productions company will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart, all while renewing your faith in mankind.from the spectacular opening scene shots of buffalo, ny to the final credits, the film manages to tell a tale that could have been told of any family, anywhere. yet, somehow this particular gathering of family and "family by association" in a small, non-descript house in buffalo more than fits the bill. if you've never been to buffalo, you'll leave the theater with thoughts of "shuffling off" for a visit! shots of the city landmarks and surroundings help to bring a quaint, down to earth tone to the film - which suits it just fine. the quiet beauty of the "queen city of the great lakes" compliments, rather than detracts from the tale that is being told. if only more movies would take advantage of the natural beauty of this country's "second cities" instead of running off to a soundstage somewhere, the end results would be so much more believable.great performances by shirley jones, frank gorshin, wendy malick, jill eickenberry, and the rest of the ensemble cast prove again that true talent outlasts hollywood's "flavor of the week" any time!go see this movie!you've wandered in hollywood's desert for too long!

we went to see manna from heaven, my husband, two friends, and i and we all enjoyed the film. the characters are funny, the story is amusing and so much like real life. i think that is what i liked most, just seeing something believable, no murders, no sci-fi, just good, clean fun. it is something you could take your children or elderly parents to and not worry. how many of those are around anymore!!

i thoroughly enjoyed gabrielle burton's story of a mysterious gift and how it effects it recipients in the past and present. the talented burton family of five film-making sisters, an author mother, and dancing dad offer a charming plot, respectfully edited for clarity , memorably chosen songs, and a beautifully filmed piece that made me laugh and cry as the characters' vulnerablility invited me into their predicamant. there was a farce-like attitude about this work with touching undertones of innocent wonder. fanatastic

i would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for a relaxing, fun-filled, thought-provoking movie. the absence of sex, vulgarities and violence made for a most pleasant evening. i especially enjoyed the buffalo scene, but that's probably because i live a short distance from there. even so, this film could have been produced in any city; it's the theme that's so important here. i'm just grateful that manna from heaven dropped down on us. try it...you'll like it!

this film is not your typical hollywood fare, though the pickings are so bad i often tend to stay away from movies rather than be disappointed. however, this little low-budget gem is thoroughly loveable and enjoyable and definitely a keeper. the actors are as varied as the characters they portray, the buffalo setting is charming (what a pretty city), and the story sparkles. the lack of gratuitous violence, sex and the "f" word doesn't detract in the least! take the kids, take grandma, take a break from hollywood! i give it an 11 out of 10!

when i first saw the movie, i thought it was sweet - a family movie. for the rest of the night and over the next couple of days, though, clever moments and funny lines kept creeping back into my thoughts and our conversation... there's a lot going on, classic elements of farce, good character acting, and wendie malick's story line is just hysterical. labelling it a "feel-good movie" belies the wit and fun - it's smarter than it seems, just like "it's a wonderful life" is.

the squire of gothos is one of the "sillier" episodes of star trek, and therefore one of the most entertaining ones. the entertainment factor is, generally speaking, fueled by the stand-off between william shatner and the episode's hilarious guest star, william campbell.during an unspecified routine mission, sulu suddenly vanishes into thin air, and kirk follows soon after-wards. spock immediately begins looking for his missing colleagues (and, though he'd hate to admit it, friends), while the two stranded crewmen must deal with the mysterious, all-powerful, flamboyant trelane (campbell), the self-proclaimed squire of gothos, a being capable of creating or destroying anything he wants through the sheer power of his mind.at first sight, the plot may seem recycled from previous episodes (honestly, are there any sci-fi shows that didn't feature at least one god-like character), but that feeling vanishes pretty quickly thanks to the script's winning use of exaggerated humor, all conveyed through campbell's deliberately camp performance: his trelane is essentially the trek version of a spoiled child in the body of an adult, while his ignorance-fueled curiosity for the human race (his knowledge is quite limited) probably served as inspiration for gene roddenberry when he came up with the character of q for the next generation pilot, some two decades after this episode aired.in short, the key to appreciating the squire of gothos is this: "silly" doesn't necessarily equal "bad".

general trelayne is a super-being who wants to play a little game with the crew of the enterprise. a lot of extremely unlikely and nonsensical stuff seems to be happening, and trelayne seems obsessed with the human practices of warfare and murder. he seems to need to experience what he imagines to be a thrill and has created a human environment (though a few hundred years out of date) in which to play out his fantasies. the environment is subtly inauthentic, and the crew immediately begins to spot the inconsistencies. pretty soon it becomes clear that trelayne is not just an immature god, but a very fallible one. regardless of how you feel about this one, stick around for the twilight zone-like ending. it is well worth it.as many have pointed out, trelayne's character inspired the more developed and amusing on-going character q - and you can see in john delancie's construction of that personality more than just shades of campbell's trelayne. it is fun to compare how the four captains we have seen coping with q all deal with him so radically differently.

i did enjoy watching squire trelane jerk around the crew in this episode, though after a while the whole thing just seemed a little too long. sure, the histrionics were kind of funny for a while, and the ending was a pretty good way to wrap the whole thing together. i think the problem was that i enjoyed seeing trelane when he was full of bravado and fun, the fun seemed to vanish when trelane became vindictive and nasty. talk about a mood killer--going from the obnoxious but affable host to the guy sentencing kirk to death! but, despite this, the episode was enjoyable and worth my time. for die-hard trekkies, this is a must-see, for others it's just a pretty run of the mill one.

in "the squire of gothos", kirk and his crew encounter a powerful super-being, who keeps the captain, "bones" and a few crewmembers captive for no apparent reason. i could be wrong, but i think this is the first star trek episode i ever saw and the program that made me hungry for more. it is not one of the best episodes, but the rock-solid premise of an alien being who putting the enterprise's crew in a corner, is the kind of situation that makes the show so much fun to watch. in a way, the super-humanoid anticipates one of star trek's most famous characters, next generation's enigmatic "q". this episode is also memorable for creating a unique situation: it is the first time uhura is part of the action and the story allows the viewer to see what an endearing character uhuara can be when the story allows her. too bad the show never fully explored this iconic figure.

an apt description by spock of an all-powerful fop into whose clutches fall the crew of the enterprise. this was one sector of space our starship should have avoided: first sulu & kirk simply disappear off the bridge; a landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and encounter trelane, a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in attire from an earth of many centuries past. but he demonstrates abilities of someone or something far beyond human and doesn't register on mccoy's medical tricorder. the officers manage to escape back to the ship but, like some bad cosmic penny, trelane keeps popping up. he brings them all back, including some female companionship, to continue his games. the dilemma now takes on elements of 'the most dangerous game' out in space and there's an exasperating, even infuriating aspect to the crew's utter helplessness before such unbridled power.what really makes this a great episode is the memorable performance by guest star campbell as the overpowering but not all-knowing alien. his character is obviously an early version of q, who was introduced 20 years later in the pilot for the tng series. trelane's confrontation scene with spock stands out among all the strange drama which unfolds. as usual, kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis, despite being quite outmatched. the answers to exactly what or who trelane is are right in front of us the whole time so, when we do learn the truth, it makes complete sense in view of campbell's pitch-perfect acting. he indulges himself constantly, preening before some unknown audience, remarking on things with a flair which is infectious but not quite right - we can't quite pin it down at first, but there's something missing here. every few minutes, his tone becomes sinister and the crew now appears to be in serious danger. in a way, you can't take your eyes off him, always waiting to see what he does next. actor john de lancie captured that similar tone as q on the next generation series.

this is a beautifully filmed movie that questions the future of all indigenous peoples, especially nomadic tribesmen. focusing on the saltmen of tibet, the film moves at pace that may make some western viewers uncomfortable. for some peoples, life still proceeds at the same pace which it has for thousands of years. this film follows a group of tribesmen on their annual two month quest to get salt. their tribe lives its life in a traditional manner (slowly by modern standards) and always accounting to their many gods. this is a remarkable film, one which will preserve a piece of what may, unfortunately, become history. well worth the time. don't be in a rush when you see it.

i think gerard's comments on the doc hit the nail on the head. interesting film, but very long. it's definitely the antithesis to the new school of flashy, sexy, moore-style docs. there is no narrator, no facts or side info interlaced, and no other gimmicks. what you see is what you get - a glimpse into the vanishing world of the saltmen of tibet. as a huge doc fan, i was surprised how much i lost attention with this film, namely due to the length and lack of dialogue. in the end though i would recommend it if the subject matter sounds interesting to you. it's beautifully shot, informative, and presents a valuable (and closing) window into the way of life of the tibetan saltmen (and women :) - all important attributes of a good doc. but do put on a big pot of coffee, it'll help.

a documentary about a nomadic tribe in tibet going out to a dry lake to get salt does not sound very appealing. but this is not a popcorn movie but a visual cultural feast whereby you partake of a rapidly vanishing morsel of humanity. the superstitions, the epic songs and poetry, the faith of a people who truly believe in following their own unique patterns of life are something the west had in the times of homer but that is now, unfortunately, completely foreign to most of us in the "developed" world. we have lost the spiritual serenity that comes from following well established patterns of life, often with dire mental consequences in our increasingly soulless society. the film makers have woven us intimately into the fabric of these materially poor but spiritually rich and scrappy saltmen. and made us see that there was more to life than the shopping mall and pop culture. so disconnect your land lines, turn off your cells, turn off the driveway lights and sit back and ease yourself into a timeless adventure.

_saltmen_ is a long film for its genre, and quite often the pace is much slower than that expected by western audiences. that being said, i enjoyed it thoroughly both in terms of interesting subject matter and the magnificent images this film contains. some of the scenery is truly breathtaking, and there is enough of interest that most should be able survive _saltmen_ with minimal use of the fast-forward.

yes!!!! fassbinder and ballhaus are at the top of their game, back in 1973! it's about the same subject, but in my opinion it's a much better movie than the matrix (1999), at least it was 200 times cheaper! very nice camera work by michael ballhaus and the wonderful "albatross" by fleetwood mac at the end. fassbinder is creating a very moody tone for the whole film. it's a shame this movie was never released on dvd. but now after 37 years they finally came to the conclusion, that this tv-movie, is not only one of the best fassbinder films (altough there are quiet a lot best fassbinder films), it's a brilliant example for a science-fiction movie, done without much money. buy it!! watch it!!

it is an interesting fact that metaphysics by platon and aristoteles, formal logic and abstract ontology form about those sciences that most people are not interested in. but then, around one thousand years after aristoteles, the computer began to usurp the human thinking, and the humans who were refusing to reflect questions of being other than biological, physical and chemical ones, suddenly felt paralyzed because they could not cope with the consequences that this computers would bring "over night". r.w. fassbinder's "welt am draht", together with tarkovsky's "solaris" and godard's "alphaville", is probably the first movie who took the philosophical questions of emerging computer science as a basis of a story to be told in a movie. the confusing questions about identities and realities are cleverly built into different interwoven criminal stories which the audience really tries to follow because it is interested to solve the cases. fassbinder was a master to sell highly abstracts contents to his public by embedding theoretical knowledge into practical, appetizing forms. the basis problem to understand is that an identity defines a reality, but on the other side, a reality also requires identity in order to be perceived. the idea of a person with multiple identities is known to us solely from the standpoint of psychiatry. however, logically spoken, the only reason why we have just one identity, is the fact that our logic has only two values (right and false). now take a logic with just one more value, i.e. with three: then, as you can easily see, you have already three identities. what happens now, when, let us say, dr. stiller gets killed? then, it is quite possible that only one of three identities is abolished and the other two remain and are able to rescue the individual from death. another question is, if a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at once. the idea, however, to display such sets of identities in a up-down or down-up way as shown in the scene with the elevator in the hotel, is misleading, since identities and hence realities are not structured in hierarchical, but in a heterarchical way. strictly speaking, there is no "artificial identity" either, since each identity is defined over two objects who share all of their features with one another. therefore, the idea of assuming that every individual has just one single identity is nothing but a consequence of ancient two-valued logic either (a second identity would imply that a person, at the same time, exists and not-exists). but now look around and see that one and the same object (which is by definition self-identical) is perceived by every subject in its own way. if therefore every subject sees an object differently, why should it no be possible for the single individual to open the borders of his two-valued individuality-corset, with the effect that different persons can exchange their different individualities? fassbinder would five years later pick up this topic in his masterpiece "despair. a trip into the light".

the sf premise isn't unique (although it pretty much was back then), but the focus is a completely different one than in other artificial reality films. especially during the first part it is an elaborate crime picture, that uses the sf premise to tell an unusual crime story in which the forced detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of vanishing characters and unhelpful witnesses who don't have to lie to be unhelpful. instead of an unreliable narrator we have an unreliable world.in part two we follow the main character's struggle for sanity and it turns more into a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation. he knows his very existence is nothing more than electrical impulses, how does he deal with this knowledge? he knows that there is a world that is more real than his, but he is trapped in an artificial world, a world where nobody can understand him. the problem of thinking of knowing something essential about the world that nobody else knows or wants to believe is a very real one that many of us can identify with. for me the film transports this hopelessness very well, with its dreary, artificial atmosphere which also supports the factual artificiality of the film's world.other than 'the matrix' or 'the thirteenth floor' it's little concerned with evoking a sense of awe for its artificial reality plot, instead it very much focuses on the psychological aspects. philosophy is only in so far interesting in that certain philosophical concepts are essential in how they shape and alter the character's perception of the world.arguably it is longer than it has to be (which isn't a problem if you are as captivated by it as i was) and part 2 runs pretty low on steam.

i saw this movie alone when i was an early teen in my hometown in india, at a time when the only thing that fascinated me aside from girls were tigers. i came home after watching it, with a glazed look in my eye, wanting to be that bloke in the movie that befriended the tigers. what a movie and what a moment that was! the theatre i saw it in does not exist any and has given way to a shopping mall. i don't know how i'd feel about it now after so many years and do not want to spoil a childhood memory by finding this movie available on dvd or something similar and not finding it interesting anymore. i have learned from previous experience that a childhood memory is often tarnished when one travels life's jaded highways occasionally trying to rediscover their unadulterated past by way of movies, only to find its gushing innocence completely soppy and not welcome anymore. and i do not want to throw away the experiences of a memory of this movie into the wind. i do not have kids, so i probably am being selfish in leaving this movie in a sepia toned area of my brain, not wanting it on dvd. but if you are at a precocious age and want to recollect in later years memories of an endearing childhood, try to watch this film(if you can ever). it'll be really worth it.

if it were possible to award a 10+ .... this would be the one film i would choose.i remember catching this film on tv many, many years ago - and fortunately being prepared enough to video it. now my video copy is getting old, video technology is outdated and i'm starting to worry that i may not be able to enjoy the delights of this movie for much longer.as a wildlife film it is superb. as a film about the relationship between man and nature it surpasses anything screened before or since. how can the film industry allow such a classic to go unnoticed and forgotten? if such a thing as a lobby/pressure group exists to push for the re-release of this film, count me in and send me the details pronto.my guess is there's a mint to be made by anyone able to re-release this in today's market.

the feeling of the need to have someone play the role of arbiter of public taste and political correctness always manages to get under our skin. it does seem that these self-appointed, self-superior, pseudo-intellectual types do appear everywhere; be it in one's family, church or bowling league.these are the guys who would have society completely disregard and ignore all that went before us; unless, of course, whatever 'it' is does not fly in the face of today's "acceptable" language, mores and general "standards" of "proper" behavior.so it is that these latter day, high tech book burners have targeted a great deal of what was hollywood's greatest achievement; namely their participation in our own allied propaganda via their unselfishly crafted message and theme films.coldly brutal in its generation, the banned code and list of now unacceptable extends into the wartime cartoons that don't meet with the new touchy, feely socially engineered 'official' attitudes; which these "thought police" have foisted down upon us.we were truly surprised to see that there seem to be volumes of such animated short subjects. the majority we are aware of are from warner brothers' looney tunes and merrie melodies; featuring bugs, daffy, elmer & porky, all in conflict with hitler, goerring, 'il duce', tojo and the like. surprisingly though, we found an ample supply of cartoons from mgm, walt disney, lantz, paramount-famous studios and the brothers fleischer.you're a sap mr. jap (famous studios/paramount pictures, 1942) is a prime example of just what we're talking about.being virtually indiscernible from the cartoons that were the output of the studios of max and dave fleischer before the 1941 business coup-de-tat that moved them out, bringing the new name of "famous" studios, you're a sap mr. jap bore none of the bland plot elements that would reduce the latter day popeye cartoons down to the level of the ultimate formula short movie.we all remember how we'd have popeye and olive oyl together. enter bluto, usually the exponent of wolf whistle and an on acceptable on-screen version of a male reaction to feminine pulchritude. olive falls for bluto's less than honorable attentions; until he gets a little too physical and invariably blurts out, "hey babe, how 'bout a kiss?" at this point we hear "help! help, popeye and the diminutive sailor shows up to save the day; replete with the obligatory can of spinach! do we exaggerate, schultz? once again this jap sap cartoon is nothing like any of that. oh sure, it follows the storyline of now having popeye in the u.s. navy. the brothers fleischer put the little guy in the service in 1941 to conform to the mood in the country and as an open gesture of support for the men now being conscripted in the first peacetime draft in united states history. max and dave even put popeye in service aboard the mythical battleship, the u.s.s. pensyltucky.our point is just this. you're a sap mr. jap and others like spinach fer britain aren't cartoon vehicles for comic relief in the theatre's program at all in the true sense. rather they are a sort of grouping of editorial cartoons much like those from any "great metropolitan newspaper". these animated shorts, much like those still one panel illustrations, have characters that are highly symbolic and representative of nations, ideas and ideals, such as a just and lasting peace. in most cases, the hero (popeye, bugs bunny or whoever) is alone with the symbol of the enemy. both are highly exaggerated visual metaphors for abstract concept and thought; even if they are cloaked in humorous trappings for wider palatability.our liberal stupidgencia (the antithesis of intelligencia) may not see themselves this way; but for this sort of behavior, they are no more than neo nazi book burners.please, allow the future generations to view and appreciate a view of past happenings that is both historical and humorous.poodle schnitz!!

if you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes, this cartoon is not for you. but if you are strongly interested in seeing a rare piece of wartime animation, come on in!in this cartoon, popeye is patrolling the seas and discovers what looks like a japanese fishing boat. the two japanese fishermen trick popeye into thinking that they want a peace treaty signed. but looks can be deceiving; the fishing boat turns out to be a japanese navy ship! what follows is considered today to be morale-boosting propaganda.be forewarned, the representations of the japanese in the film are done in a mean-spirited fashion. keep in mind, though, that there was a war going on at the time. but i strongly recommend this cartoon to those who are interested in the wwii era.

this world war ii popeye cartoon had some very good sight gags in it, and its decidedly above-average for its genre. it was nicely drawn, too, with some great angles, good detail and....well, lots of interesting sights.what it amounts to is popeye out at sea in his little boat and accidentally running into a small japanese boat, with two guys on it. (incidentally, why were the "japs" always pictured with big, round glasses and bucked teeth?). anyway, these harmless-looking japanese sailors want popeye to sign a peace treaty. oh, boy, thinks the gullible popeye, "wait until the admiral sees this!" in one of those great artwork scenes i was alluding to above, we slowly see how that little japanese ship is really a big destroyer.....and popeye is in deep....um, water! "why, you double-crossing ja-pansies!," yells our sailor man.how he gets out of the situation is fun to watch.

this short was the first short released by paramount famous studios and was one of several done by the studio showing popeye engaged directly against the enemy, most often the japanese. while warner brothers, disney and, to a lesser extent, other studios, did shorts often depicting germans as foils, the majority of famous studios efforts focused on the japanese. given pearl harbor and popeye's naval ties, this is quite understandable. this is an average short. seein' red, white an' blue and spinach for britain have aged better. but it's still worth watching. recommended.

i loved the great lighting and was warmed by this story of american working class society and seaport life in the first half of the 20th century. i was drawn in by the timeless watchability of this realistic performance. see and feel the star power. melancholic "greek" comedy. anybody in the mood for a shot with a beer back?...or a little ginger? hey, waterboy !!

viewed this great classic film of greta garbo and thought her performance was excellent. however, the german film version which had english captions was her greatest performance. greta garbo even mentioned to the press that the german film was her favorite where she had to make the change from silent films to sound. greta had a high pitched voice and had to take lessons in order to lower her voice for her future roles in films. this story was very sad because greta garbo(anna christie),"ninotchka",'39, was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as a coal barge captain. there were many scenes of old nyc, the brooklyn bridge, coney island and the sky line of manhattan. charles bickford(matt burke),"days of wine & roses",'62 a classic veteran actor gave a great supporting role.

039: anna christie (1930) - released 2/21/1930; viewed 3/10/06 on october 24, 1929: black thursday, the stock market crashes. now the country and indeed the world will look to hollywood for escape from the worldwide great depression.births: anne frank, june carter, yasser arafat, bob newhart, barbara walters, doris roberts, ed asner, dick clark, roy e. disney, gene hackman.doug: at long last, our odyssey resumes in earnest with greta garbo's first sound film, a simple character study called anna christie. an excellent performance from ms. garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (i wanted to see some of her silent work, but netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them. how odd). one thing i noticed over and over was the way the swedish accent sounds, like replacing the letter j with a y sound. anna ends up being the only character i liked; i didn't really care for her estranged father or her would-be suitor. it looks like the sound-recording systems are getting better (nobody leaning in to talk into the mystery-can), but the camera still isn't moving. we'll be sure to watch for that to change as our odyssey continues.kevin: our first film of the 1930's is the first sound film of silent starlet greta garbo, anna christie. this is a very simple movie, with only about five different locations where we spend long stretches of the film's 89 minute running time, often with a static camera. it was great to see marie dressler in sound as well, and quite hilarious as what we hear is an endless chain of heartfelt yet inebriated slurs. i very much enjoyed garbo's performance, as she sustains the film through even the most meandering moments. i didn't really like george marion or charles bickford, maybe because i wasn't sympathetic to either of them, so i was relieved and excited when anna finally stands up for herself and shows them that she doesn't "belong" to either her estranged father or her muscle-bound irish boyfriend. it's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.last film viewed: speedy (1928). last film chronologically: the love parade (1929). next film: the blue angel (1930).

the magnificent greta garbo is in top form in this, her first talkie. she gets fine support from the rest of the cast which includes charles bickford the rugged sailor who captures her heart. ms. garbo gives a great performance as she usually does as the estranged daughter of a sea captain who returns after fifteen years. also in the cast is that great actress marie dressler. a great movie!

'anne christie' was garbo's 14th film and the first in which her husky swedish voice was heard. she plays the lead character, anna, who has struggled with being abandoned by her father chris (a drunken barge owner played by george f marion), and with the misfortune of the life she has has to lead to keep her head above water.meeting irish matt (charles bickford) may mark the turning point for her ... or does it? garbo looks and sounds great in this drama which, although looking rather clunky and moving at a slow pace, still manages to interest and engage an audience nearly 80 years later. marie dressler makes an impact in the role which gave her a second flush of movie success in films such as min and bill, dinner at eight, and emma; while marion and bickford are more than adequate.an interesting slice of movie history. garbo would do better talkies in the years following, but 'anna christie' will always be remembered for the first time she talked on screen.

viewing both of these films concurrently is not a bad idea to get a sense of early film production and acting for the camera styles. i give the nod to garbo(but not by much)in regard to her naturalness. robeson is majestic. but his performance is aimed for a large proscenium theater. something else that struck me was the movies themes of empowerment for women and minorities. there hadn't been any films coming out of hollywood yet that allowed the voices of marginal characters like anna and brutus to take the foreground. these were very progressive films for their time. it's quite probable that o'neill saw the writing on the wall way before everyone else did about the future of america.

greta garbo stars in 'anna christie', a very early 1930 mgm 'talkie', the first time 'garbo talks'. 'anna christie' is a powerful movie but not for everyone. the movie is filmed like a stage play, short on sets and cinematography, long on dialogue and dramatic characterizations. eugene o'neil who wrote the play 'anna christie' is known for his dark work and garbo's character anna christie is a bleak figure with a tortured past.the sound quality on the dvd was mediocre. not helping matters is that george f. marion who plays anna's estranged dad, chris christofferson, is verbally hard to understand. marion gives a good performance as the old drunken seamen who‚Äôs teetering on insanity with his fixation of the evil 'devil sea'. but his dialogue is written with a very heavy swedish accent, this is true to o'neils original play. marie dressler's dialogue as marthy owens is equally hard to understand. dressler believably portrays a broken down old drunken women, a 'wharf rat'. her dialogue also is true to o'neils original play as is charles bickford as the irish seamen, matt burke who pursues anna in a troubled relationship. garbo is actually the easiest to understand.the films strong point is greta garbo. she delivers a gut wrenching performance as the victim of neglect and abuse, leading to a life of prostitution. garbo was a huge star at the time and considered one of the most beautiful women in hollywood. here her look isn't glamorous, it's tortured. her body posture nearly doubles over in agony. she scrunches her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen. garbo conveys these angst-ridden feelings to the viewer to convince us of her misery.this is dark subject matter and garbo brings it to life. it‚Äôs not light fare, not fun, not for everyone. ‚Äòanna christie‚Äô is strong emotions dredged up from the depths for examination, this is one helluva ride.

anna christie (1930)anna christie has some terrific parts, and some amazing performances, and yet it should be even better than it is. it has drama. some of the scenes are really atmospheric, and if the interior shots around the table are a bore, other shots at night and at sea are really pretty exciting. then there are the nearly historical, lively scenes set in coney island (even a brief jittery roller coaster ride), and the episode where two women are behind a netting in separate beds, and visitors to the midway can throw balls to try to tip them over, and the women (scantily dressed) egg the men on is weirdly sexual come-on kind of way. all the while garbo (at the front of the crowd) watches.garbo of course is what makes this movie more than just another very good early talkie. she plays all sides of her character. she is coy and skeptical and in some kind of inner anguish. she laughs and cries, withdraws and pushes outward. in some ways it's a forward looking, remarkable movie (directed by clarence brown, who has a whole series of significant films from this pre-code sound era).though based on a successful eugene o'neil play, it's the writing that struggles a little as the actors seem to go through the paces at times. marie dressler is great in that exaggerated way she almost trademarked. and then there is greta garbo, who really does have a natural presence, even if it seems she's overacting, just slightly, at times (but then, so is everyone else). garbo is of course famous first as a silent actress, and this is her talking film debut. audiences loved her enough that she made a german language version the following year.

this film is worthwhile despite what you may hear. the performance of marie dressler (i hope i am spelling it right) as a drunken old sot is reason enough to see this film. it is an amazing performance. she is in a drunken stupor in three scenes for a good long while and she never does the same thing twice. you can actually smell the alcohol when she is done. amazing. and greta of course speaks her first lines on film and shes great. the eugene o'neill story is solid and like most o'neill stories, very deep and intense. this is not light entertainment but if you appreciate those great character actors from the 30's and 40's you will like it. some of the film is technically fuzzy but all in all worthwhile.

and with those words one of the great movie publicity campaigns came to a conclusion. 'garbo talks' and she spoke those words in her first sound film, an adaption of the eugene o'neil play anna christie. unlike with some other players and some other studios, mgm took great care in finding the proper vehicle for greta garbo. many players who were fine in the universal medium of silent film would lose their careers because of talkies. their heavy native accents would get in the way, some didn't know any english. it was no accident that anna christie was chosen for garbo. first of all it being authored by one of america's leading playwrights, it was the kind of literary property that would have appealed to her. secondly since the title role was someone who was swedish, the accent could be explained. finally a lot of the kinks from early talkies had been worked out, even though anna christie still made use of title cards.like most of o'neil's work it's short on action, but long and deep on characterization. the story takes place on the new york waterfront where garbo as anna has come to live with her father george marion. marion ran away to sea years ago when anna was a baby and marion abandoned his wife. anna has had to do what she could to survive in the adult world and that includes prostitution.marion of course is glad to see her, he even kicks out marie dressler, the old waterfront crone he's been living with for years to make room for his flesh and blood. of course both marion and garbo have their problems adjusting to each other, not made easy when they give shelter to a sailor played by charles bickford who takes a fancy to garbo.marion is repeating his role from the original broadway production. the role of anna on stage was done by pauline lord. anna christie ran for 177 performances in the 1921-22 season on broadway. it's one of o'neil's best known works and one that's revived frequently. of course garbo's performance with perfect diction even with a swedish accent was acclaimed and her future in sound films was assured. greta garbo received an oscar nomination for best actress and the film also got nominations for clarence brown as best director and william daniels for cinematography. daniels should especially get a lot of kudos for the way he photographed the waterfront scenes. and brown created the mood around the waterfront where the film is set.eugene o'neil's work is timeless so anna christie even with a lot of the trappings of early sound films does not date the way many films of that era do. garbo also shows she mastered the subtlety needed to work in the sound medium. anna christie is a classic, all the way around.

i'd read all the negative reviews for "anna christie". you know, the gripes about the static camera, out-dated acting and wordiness of the screenplay. but when i viewed it yesterday i found it remarkably affecting and enjoyable. yep, clarence brown's camera remains stationary for the most part, and i'm pretty sure one of the microphones was concealed in the ship's light. yep, there's a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences. it's an early talkie with primitive technical aspects. but... then there's garbo, marie dressler, george f. marion and charles bickford, all proving that great acting is timeless.i believe "anna christie" is still one of garbo's most iconic performances. and it's a wonderful performance from the divine one, in a role that is really quite atypical for her. yes, we've seen garbo weary and almost beaten, yet never with bags under her eyes or her knocking back shots of whiskey. garbo played so many (delightful) costume roles, that to see her play a contemporary woman is fascinating. she's not weighed down by heavy dresses or make-up. this performance seems quite raw from garbo.the plot, from the o'neill play, follows weary swedish ex-prostitute anna, and her reunion with her boozy, seaman father. anna's had enough trouble for any girl of twenty, as she tells drunken, slovenly marthy (dressler)in a bar. she finds solace in a life at sea, and romance with a rough-hewn, but good-hearted, fisherman (charles bickford). but her past threatens to ruin it all.charles bickford is overlooked in garbo's long line of (largely inferior) leading men. he's one actor who can actually share the screen with her and not get swallowed up by her magical presence. the pair have great chemistry together and seemed to enjoy working with one another. dressler can never be accused of underplaying, and once again the grand dame is up to her old tricks, but she's terrific and convincing in her role, never annoying as in the dreadful "dinner at eight". i've never really heard of george f. marion before, but he was wonderful as garbo's father.this is pre-code, and rather gritty and dark by mgm's standards. i really enjoyed it, and while it may creak in some places, it's still wonderful.

for greta garbo's first talking picture, mgm wisely chose eugene o'neill's pultizer prize winning 1921 play anna christie. also wisely, the producers backed garbo up with not one but two members of the original broadway cast (george marion as anna's father, chris, and james t. mack as johnny the priest - transmuted to "johnny the harp" for films so as not to offend). this little change is interesting. like too many films accused (by those who want movies to be movies and ignore their origins) of being "little more than filmed stage plays," the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldn't be more faithful to the property. by diluting a great cinematic stage work so it wouldn't offend anyone, or opening it up because they could, too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place. fortunately, the respect the studio had for both o'neill and garbo allowed anna christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in frances marion's generally sensitive screen adaptation. wonder of wonders, marion even allows the point of the scene where garbo's anna reveals her past on "the farm" to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact! what the league of decency must have thought of that! the source play's greatest problem has always been that chris's friend marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that anna can take stage - the two sides of the genuinely good woman men don't always recognize. the perfectly cast marie dressler (who had cut her teeth on the broadway stage as well before going to hollywood) is the perfect balance for garbo's anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only 90 minutes, doesn't allow us too much time to miss her - one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original - and screenwriter marion is wise enough to stray from o'neill to bring dressler back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of julie laverne's second act appearance in show boat. anna and marthy's early scene together on screen (16 minutes into the film) taking each other's measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece. not to be missed. anna christie is great tragic play and a good film drama. it's hard to imagine that a latter day remake, which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake (it was first filmed without sound in 1923 - also with george marion's original broadway chris) could improve on this excellent filming. the internal scenes hew closest to the play, but the exteriors shouldn't be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere. while the background screen work is not to modern technical standards, the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set (especially in the new york harbor).nearly all garbo's naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly (only the too often parodied death scene from camille, 7 years later, will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies), but this anna christie, together with the variety of her 1932 films, mata hari and grand hotel, and the sublime lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy, ninotchka ("garbo laughs!"), surely stand as her best.o'neill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded "sea plays," should track down the fine world war ii shaped film released in the year before the u.s. entered the conflict, the long voyage home (1940). it is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from anna christie, and features a youngish john wayne in one of his rare non-westerns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way.

i thought this was a beautiful film. it is not my favourite of his films - chungking express holds that spot - this one is quite different from anything else i have seen of his. it is slow (but not annoyingly so) - it takes its time and ponders the characters.. there is minimal movement in the frame - the camerawork is wonderful. the acting is great. the film feels like a long warm comforting drink.

the plot of "in the mood for love" is simple enough: a married man and a married woman (though not to eachother) slowly develop a romantic attachment to one another. the film's pace is numbingly slow and precious little actually happens between the two. yet the backdrop of hong kong in the early 1960s and director wong kar-wai's keen sense for capturing the beauty of the setting as well as the principal characters make this film a joy to watch. actors tony leung and maggie cheung are both excellent and wong kar-wai has done an extraordinary job in capturing the feel and nostalgia of the past (something so many films and directors try to do but usually fail miserably). there are so many little details that add charm to the film (a trademark of the director) and the colors and cinematography are what send this otherwise simple story over the top as a marvelous cinematic achievement. 9/10.

a hundred miles away from the scene of a grizzly murder in small town american, jill johnson (belle) settles in for a night of babysitting. with the children asleep and a beautiful home to relax in, she locks the door and sets the alarm. but when a series of eerie phone calls from a stranger says that she "check the children," jill panics. fear to terror when she has the calls traced. and what the police find turns the perfect babysitting job into a 16-year-old's worst nightmare. there aren't any other lead actors in this movie. camilla belle is the main star with a cute face. the day she arrives to babysit, she really has no idea what in the hell really awaits her.if i were in a house like the one jill was in. i would explore everything that is around. the fridge would be the first person i would looks at, but i'm a male and i don't babysit. but what i found funny was the size of the house. i was thinking, would the movie be the same if the house weren't so big? anyone could get lost in that huge house, but this movie needed a house with a massive size.camilla belle has a cute face, a perfect smile but it's like for a movie like this, the lead actress needs someone with experience. i found camilla not that good. i don't know maybe she thought that this could be her breakthrough role. i do like her, she is a cute girl but someone to have a role in this movie has to be someone how is different to take it.this movie wasn't scary. i also found this movie more like a "chick flick". i think the only reason this was released during the superbowl weekend was that the guys stay home and watch the game and the girls go out to go see this. it also seems like a type of a movie when girls will enjoy more than guys. but i did like this movie but for how it is. girls just like tog et scared or scream. this was just a pretty decent movie.maybe anyone could like this movie. there are many pg-13 horror films that never succeed. this was on its own level. so i kinda liked this movie. i give it a 7/10.

i was recently at a sleepover birthday party with five other girls all my age (eleven.) all of us, thinking it would be some harmless little movie such as jaws decided to rent it along with rat race. (we watched rat race after when a stranger calls as to ease our fear.) we put the movie on at 11:00 at night and lay together in our sleeping bags hiding behind covers for most of it. i screamed five times which is unusual for me as i get scared in movies but never scared enough to actually scream.all of us were terrified to even leave the bedroom as we were all positive the stalker (jenkins as we called him for some reason)would get us. i played a mean trick; one everyone was all dozing off once rat race was over i hid under my sleeping bag and said quietly and lowly "have you checked the childen?" they all screamed like nuts and were so scared. all in all i would rate this movie a 9. the only thing i didn't like was that 1. there were too many false alarms when jill thinks the stalker is there and 2. the kids never woke up during the whole thing until jenkins kidnapped them and hid them in the cupboard at which time all they did was cry like babies. i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes thriller. but one thing: i am so not babysitting past 9:00 pm ever again1!

simon wests pg-13 thriller about a babysitter who gets disturbing prank calls while sitting at a mansion is neither original nor exciting enough to be called a good film. although there are some elements of suspense, good eye candy and decent characters, the film is just another i know what you did last summer, as it falls short of being taken seriously. the performances were alright, but nothing special with this flick, i say skip it, unless you are looking for a mediocre movie, you can find better films than this on lifetime sometimes, okay maybe not lifetime but at least usa or somethin, haha.... 7/10

the movie is about a girl who's not going to a bonfire only because she's baby-sitting that night. nothing weird about that, right? until ... the phone rings. until ... the phone rings again. and again ... and again. those are not some stupid prank calls. this is for real. if you wanna see how the girl reacts, just watch the movie.great atmosphere filled with scary sounds. very well performed by young camilla belle who got the lead role. i see in her some great potential to become a good actress. this is more than only a decent thriller, i have no idea why it's so underrated. anyway, on my opinion this movie deserves more than only 4/10. 24% of all voters rated the movie with 1. get serious, people. you couldn't get a better thriller for a title like this.

joline (heather graham) sets out after her husband carl (luke wilson) who disappeared to clear his head about himself and their marriage. joline, who is committed to their marriage starts her journey to find carl, yet on the way discovers a lot about herself. on her trip she encounters a bountiful of interesting characters who unknowingly help her find her way.in my eyes this is a classical road movie, which moves just at the right pace (some viewers may find it too slow). throughout the movie it keeps its humorous note while joline responds to the craziness of the world around her with a warm, knowing, sometimes sad smile. all actresses and actors give wonderful performances and the musical score is immaculate. 9/10

some people drift through life, moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye; others latch on to a cause, another person or a principle and remain adamant, committed to whatever it is-- and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it. but we're all different, `made of different clay,' as one of the characters in this film puts it, which is what makes life so interesting. some people are just plain crazy, though-- and maybe that's the way you have to be to live among the masses. who knows? who knows what it takes to make things-- life-- work? writer/director lisa krueger takes a shot at it, using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed-- and how one `gets' committed-- and obsession, in `committed,' starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy, too. her name is joline, and this is her story.	admittedly, joline has always been a committed person; in work, relationships, in life in general. she's a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what. and when she marries carl (luke wilson), it's forever. the only problem is, someone forgot to tell carl-- and 597 days into the marriage, he's gone; off to `find' himself and figure it all out. when joline realizes he's not coming back, she refuses to give up on him, or their marriage. maybe it's because of that `clay' she's made of. regardless, she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him, which she does-- in el paso, texas, of all places. but once she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, giving him his `space' and not even letting him know she's there. she considers carl as being in a `spiritual coma,' and it's her job to keep a `spiritual vigil' over him until he comes to his senses. and while she watches and waits, her life is anything but dull, as she encounters a young woman named carmen (patricia velazquez), a waitress at one of the local eateries; carmen's `grampy,' (alfonso arau), who is something of a mystic; t-bo (mark ruffalo), a truck driver who has issues concerning carl; and neil (goran visnjic) an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her. for joline, it's a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about carl, but even more about herself.	there's a touch of humor, a touch of romance, and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot. and krueger presents it all extremely well, delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining. her characters are very real people, with all the wants, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story. we see it from joline's point-of-view, as krueger makes us privy to joline's thoughts and therefore her motivations, which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold. that, along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates, makes for a very effective piece of storytelling. there's an underlying seriousness to this subject matter, but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy-handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters. and the result is a well textured, affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life.	heather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation. she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable, adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person, and one that is real. and for this film to work, it was imperative that joline be viable and believable-- and graham succeeds on all fronts. her screen presence has never been more alluring, and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes, is enough to draw you in entirely. it's all a part of the character she creates; there's an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance, who she is inside and out. she's a likable, agreeable person, and because you've shared her innermost thoughts, you know who she is. it's a good job all the way around, beginning with the way the character was written, to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life.	as carmen, patricia velazquez is totally engaging, as well. her performance is very natural and straightforward, and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character. she has a charismatic presence, but is less than flamboyant, and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down-to-earth. she is refreshingly open and up-front; you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back, but is totally honest on all fronts, and that, too, is part of her appeal. and, as with joline, this character is well written, and velazquez brings her convincingly to life.	overall, there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including those of luke wilson, casey affleck (as joline's brother, jay), goran visnjic, alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as t-bo, who, with very little actual screen time, manages to create a memorable character.	the supporting cast includes kim dickens (jenny), clea du vall (mimi), summer phoenix (meg), art alexakis (new york car thief), dylan baker (carl's editor), and mary kay place (psychiatrist). a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture-- reflecting upon who we are, where we're going and what we really need-- `committed' is an enjoyable experience; a ride definitely worth taking. 8/10.

englar alheimsins are very good movie. she happen on a mental home in iceland. ingvar e. sigurdsson is in a leading role and is good. other good actors in this movie are baltasar korm√°kur and bjorn jorundur. i like this movie she is very good. i voice with this movie.

this film is based on a true story. the author of the novel bearing the same title, einar m√°r gu√∞mundsson, had a brother, who turned mentally ill. i found this film very moving, following the main character's path down into illness, to see how he tries to cope with life after diagnosis, and how he makes friends at the mental institution, it all is very convincing. there are quite a few splendidly funny incidents also in the manuscript. the title of it gives nothing away concerning the story. you must watch it to understand ... and listen to the music, which is twisting and turning your heart and soul upside down and back as the film moves on. a must-see for everyone.

this movie is great. best acting i have ever seen in my life. ingvar e sigur√∞sson is the best icelandic actor, and of course hilmir sn√¶r and bjorn j√∂rundur. great music and sound. cold hard reality about a struggle of a man that has a lot of problems and the people in his life. black humor mixed with great acting and this european art movies style, it works, it comes together in a the best icelandic movie ever made. i say to you." see this film, you will not regret it". i gave it 9 stars. if you see one icelandic film in your life...see this one

this movie is stunningly free from storytelling. it's a pure experience where the music overshadow the visual impression. - words cannot of course enough express what should be expressed, but it is the requirement of the chattering classes that chatter is put forward, entered into production lines of mediocrity and therefore a necessity in order to express any sensible thought or opinion about something which should not need to be degraded by chatter. therefore these elaborate opinions are put forward to satisfy those empty minds which need to be filled by noise that you will not find however hard you try in this movie.

if this film doesn't at least be selected for an oscar nominee for best foreign film i'm going to stop waking at nights watching the event. fridrik thor fridriksson has proven that money isn't the key to making a good movie but originality. out of a cold country comes a warm but thought-provoking film of a mentally ill man and his struggle against an insane world. after an insight like this, you question whether or not the man is crazy or the world he lives in.

the movie angels of the universe is a pure masterpiece and it proves once again that you can make a brilliant movie on a low budget, e.g american beauty and blair witch project. the director fridrik th√≥r fridriksson gives the novel englar alheimsins a new life on the white screen. the movie is a breakthrough in icelandic film making because it's the biggest and the greatest movie that has been done in iceland.the music in the film, played by sigurr√≥s, is very symbolic for the film, it is absolutely brilliant. i recommend everybody who are able to think to go and see this film as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed. i would bet on this film to win the best foreign film award next year ¬ñ all over the globe!

this film very succeed in the film festival in karlovy vary, czech rep. logically. it' s based on a very good book, excellent actors, good camera, the best director and icelandic. it was probably the most black comedy i've seen.i really do recommend it to you.

this film by fri√∞rik √æ√≥r, director of children of nature, is powerful. it has great music by sigurr√≥s and good acting. it shows how sad insanity as a disease can be. there are many good jokes but the humor is dark. if that is not a problem then you should see this film. note though this is not a comedy but a drama.

having a close experience with one such patient is probably the best reason why i had my heart rushing throughout the entire film. intense, sensible, moral and revealing, and don't forget to check out the marvellous sound track. really good.

the movie is about paul(p√°ll) a young man who sinks into the harsh world of insanity and his stay at the mental hospital "kleppur" and his friends. victor(viktor) who during his education in england started to think he was adolf hitler. peter(p√©tur) who took to much lsd and tried to fly of a roof top the fall left no broken bones or physical damage only insanity, he is obbsesed with china. oli beatle (√≥li b√≠till) oli has spent most time at the hospital although viktor is slightly older then him, he claims he wrote every single beatles song and send it to them by telepathythe novel is better then the movie and covers all of pauls life from birth to his death, there is a long time since i saw the movie but if i remember it right the movie doesn't cover pauls childhood."englar alheimsins" is funny,sad and powerful if you haven't seen it watch it now! and read the novel first it makes the movie better

this movie i've seen many times. i read the book , englar alheimsins which was written by einar m√°r gu√∞mundsson who received the scandinavian book awards for the work. the movie does not start on the same place as the book starts. it happens in reykjav√≠k and the main character, p√°ll is young and having a good life with his girlfriend. but as she breaks up the relationship with him, he starts to get some headaches which make him annoyed and angry. and soon he starts to have big mental problems and then the movie begins. soon he is puted in the icelandic mental hospital called "kleppur" and there you get to see some great characters like viktor who thinks he is hitler and √≥li who thinks that he writes all the " the beatles" songs and sends them to them with mind transporting. ingvar e sigur√∞usson who has the role of the main character p√°ll does is so work so well that it leaves you breathless. also the music in this movie is mad by sigurr√≥s and just for the music's cost you should see the movie. overall a great movie meant to be seen.

first at all: if you like watching movies i recommend you not to watch this one. why? afterwards you won't appreciate any other movie so easily anymore...actually i don't wanna give rise to any excessive expectations but it is almost frightening how perfect, intense and beautiful this work of einar gudmundsson is. when in most movies there is at least one aspect spoiling the whole thing, like good actors but horrible dialogs or a nice scenery but low budget cinematography ¬ñ in ¬Ñangels of the universe" there is nothing of this ambivalence. really everything is just great, even (and not least) the soundtrack with the magnificent sigur r√≥s.in this story about pall, a student that goes schizophrenic after being dumped by his girlfriend, especially the dialogs (and monologues) deserve some attention: together with (and sometimes in sharp contrast to) the plot they range from depressing and fatalistic to the whole opposite of comical and totally absurd. what is more, they are often (with quotes from hegel and shakespeare) of such a poetic beauty that the movie almost drifts into a surreal sphere and is only saved to the real world by its incredibly authentic actors.one of the other comments was already referring to another point: this movie is no trivial entertainment for relaxing in the evening. despite of several comical reliefs in between it is largely disturbing, partly cynical and bitter, and most of all sad. it is a modern poetry about a life of insanity with all its emptiness, rage and solitude.finally: when you've seen the movie ¬ñ watch it again. there are some great visual metaphors and allusions in it that you realize only when you look twice and connect them with the ¬Ñmoral of the story". and of course: read the book, it contains a lot more of the small funny stories in between and also makes you understand some things in the movie a bit better.

reading the other comments here at the imdb, i had very high expectations before seeing 'angels of the universe'. i wasn't disappointed, and giving the movie an 8, i would say that i can justify that grade.the movie has some incredible acting, especially by the main-person, pall. the supporting actors are also doing a very good job like the patients in the mental institution, the parents and the siblings of pall. the music is also worth mentioning, supporting the movie throughout, giving depth and feeling.although the movie is very scandinavian, it doesn't leave out some humour and has a sort of objective authorship about pall's life. still, if you want to see a cheesy comedy or something light-weight, this is not for you. it is a story about people with mental problems, about the way they are being dealt with in society - but most of all, a story about pall.i recommend this movie to all movie connoisseurs. it is one of the best movies that has ever come out of iceland, if not out of scandinavia.

it is the best film i have seen in the last 5 years. surely, it will be in the same row with such masterpieces as the platoon, apocalypse now, the doors, the dog's heart (russian film). really, the play of the boy and his parents is so good that you can't even say that they "play". no, they live as if it was happening to them. notice the smile on there faces when the main hero agrees to go for a walk with them. the hate and love in one piece. and the final scene!really, i'm still under impression of that film. it's very hard, even impossible to combine the humor and the tragedy, but if you succeed (and frederikson did) the impact would be twice strong.i compared it with "one flew over the cuckoo's nest". i like this film either (and the novel itself is good, too), but after frederikson's movie it seems simple. (the same difference i noticed after i watched the film "american history x" and "romper stomper" - the latter is deeper). i mean milos forman only showed the material point of view of the problem. you watch it, then you say yes, it's a good film, i like him, i don't like her, and that's it. but "angels" leave you a wide base to think. there are no bad and good boys in the film. cause each of them have the right to behave in the way they do. like the girlfriend of one of the patient. of course she's young and is pregnant and that is a problem for her that his husband is in the clinic, but the feelings and emotional experience of her exfriend are even stronger (the result is his suicide). why ask him what have he done? aren't you insane yourself to ask? why do not support him, help him, understand him? finally, it is even funny when those people talk to each other. they say genius things! there are a lot of things i would like to say about this film, but i'm not so good in english. but i'm sure, those of you, who have watched the movie, understand me.good luck!

as far as i know this was my first experience with icelandic movies. it's such a relief to see something else than your regular hollywood motion picture. too bad that movies like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world. i can only hope that people watch this by accident, by recommendation or other...because it's really worth while. i left the cinema feeling really sad. i couldn't get the tragic destiny's of the characters out of my head. and it impressed me even more when i thought of the complexity of the film. not only was it a tragic story, it had excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack.if you have the opportunity, watch it! it's really thought provoking and made me ponder a lot.

this is an important historical film since it was the the first all-talking feature film. the film was made for a mere 23,000 dollars.it grossed over a million dollars upon its release. this film all so helped define the gangster melodramas that were to become the bread and butter of the warner's studio in the 1930's. the popularity of this film ended the silent era more so than its more famous part-talkie predecessor, the jazz singer. the film deserves its place in history and not as a mere footnote. the only actor who might be remember today that is in it was eugene palette.

"lights of new york" originally started out as an experimental two reel vitaphone short that eventually snowballed into the first all talkie feature film. helene costelle was supposedly one of the most beautiful actresses in hollywood and sister to (in my opinion the real beauty) dolores costello, who seemed to get all the breaks. poor helene is best known for appearing in this pretty dreary film that bought a revolution to hollywood!!two bootleggers on the lam in "main street" convince a couple of small town barbers to try their luck on broadway. the barbers eddie (cullen landis) and gene (eugene palette) don't realise that their barber shop is soon a cover for illegal bootlegging activities. they soon do realise it and regret the day they left their small town. the only thing keeping them going is the loan that eddie's mother gave them and that they desperately want to pay back. eddie becomes re-acquainted with kitty lewis (helene costello) a girl from his home town who has made good on broadway. kitty is worried about "hawk" miller (wheeler oakman) who is always hanging around her but eddie, innocently, thinks she is exaggerating as "hawk" already has a girlfriend molly (gladys brockwell) but to reassure her he gives her a little handgun to frighten unwanted admirers away. "hawk", who has killed a police officer and has the "feds" closing in, decides to frame eddie. meanwhile molly is getting pretty fed up with "hawks" treatment of her and after a showdown where he tells her he is after a chicken and not an old hen the stage is set for - murder!!!the fact is it isn't completely awful, apart from gangsters and showgirls alike speaking in their best elocution voices and that was still happening in films in 1930. gladys brockwell (if a trifle melodramatic) and eugene palette (quite natural) were okay and were the most seasoned actors in the cast. there was no john or ethel barrymore to be seen - cullen landis and helene costello soon returned to the obscurity from which they had come. i also didn't notice much of the "hidden mike" - where people had to be grouped around different objects ie a telephone or sitting on a couch before they could engage in conversation. people who saw it at the cinema probably started to think that all policeman talked in that flat monotone as that trend continued in many early talkies ie "little caesar" (1930). in any case they were probably intrigued by the novelty of a completely all talkie - with some singing and dancing - film in 1928.recommended.

lights of new york was the first all-talking feature film. there had been, of course, the jazz singer, released in oct. 1927 as the first feature film incorporating synchronized dialog. however, this film released in july 1928 is virtually unremembered for its place in film history. it had started out as a short, but gradually more was tacked on until - clocking in at 58 minutes - it accidentally became the first all-talking feature film. it opened to a grind house run and to warner bros. surprise, made over a million dollars. that was good money back in 1928.the plot is quite simple. two country barbers naively buy into a barber shop on broadway that fronts as a speak-easy for "the hawk", a gangster. when they learn the truth they can't afford to get out, because the younger barber, eddie, has all of his mother's money tied up in the place. kitty is the younger barber's girlfriend, and gangster hawk (wheeler oakman) has an eye for turning in his older girlfriend (gladys brockwell) for a newer model - chorus girl kitty(helene costello). a cop is killed while trying to stop the hawk's men from unloading a shipment of bootleg liquor, and the hawk sees it as an opportunity to frame eddie, thus getting kitty for himself.this early talkie is loads of fun for the enthusiast of these pioneering works. sure, the plot is elementary and the dialog stilted, but there is something you don't see much of in early talkies - background musical scoring. vitaphone had originally been used for this very purpose, and here they are still using it for musical accompaniment along with the dialog. and there are singing and dancing numbers! the scenes in hawk's nightclub are used as an opportunity to show off what films could never do before - musical numbers. there is even a wild-eyed emcee with some heavy makeup left over from the silent era that is a hoot to watch.vitaphone could not go outdoors at this point due to the static camera booths, so the scene in the park between the two lovers eddie and kitty is simulated - and cheaply. the greenery looks like something out of an ed wood movie or perhaps a high school production of "our town". gladys brockwell, as the hawk's castoff girlfriend, delivers her lines with punch. she's a real trooper considering what lines she has to deliver. to the hawk - "so you think you can have any chicken you want and throw me back in the deck!". huh? mixed metaphors anyone? and then there are her final lines "i've lived, and i've loved, and i've lost!" did someone get paid to write this dialog? brockwell was making a good success of her talkie career after scoring some triumphs in silent films (the evil sister in "seventh heaven"), when a fatal car accident cut her career short.then there is eugene palette - the older of the two barbers in our story. his frog voice, natural delivery of lines, and cuddly appearance gave him a long career as a character actor usually appearing as a put-upon family man/businessman with a gruff exterior and heart of gold. in fact, mr. palette is the only member of this cast who still has a notable career in films just three years after this movie is released.finally there is the question of "where is that microphone hidden?" microphones were still stationary at this point, and it's fun to figure out where they've hidden it. there is one famous scene, though, where everybody can pretty much figure it out. hawk is in his office talking to his two henchman - who seem to comprehend as slowly as they talk - about "taking eddie for a ride". if you watch this scene you'd swear the phone on the desk is a character in this film. it's front and center during the whole conversation. the microphone is likely planted in the phone.there is something heroic about these pioneers flying blind in the face of the new technology of sound. you have silent actors who are accustomed to using pantomime for expression, vaudevillians who know how to play to a live audience but don't know how to make the same impression on a vitaphone camera booth, and you have dialog writers either trying to write conversation as compactly as they did title cards or filling up films with endless chatter. check this one out. it is not boring, moves fast, and is loads of fun if you know what to look for. and no, i don't expect this one to ever be out on blu-ray, but i hope that the folks at warner brothers add it to the warner archive soon so everyone can see it.

lights of new york was the first "all-taking" feature film, coming in at a brisk 57 minutes and directed by bryan foy (of the famous vaudeville family).the story has two dopey barbers (cullen landis, eugene palette) yearning for a chance at "big city life" and getting involved with gangsters and bootleg booze. one of the guys gets framed for the murder of a cop but is saved at the last minute by a gun moll (gladys brockwell).much of the story takes place in a night club called the night hawk, which is run by a crook named hawk (wheeler oakman) who has his eye on a pretty chorine (helene costello) who is the girl friend of landis. costello gets to do a brief dance, and we hear harry downing (made up to resemble ted lewis) sing "at dawning) in his best al jolson style.the acting ranges from good (palette and brockwell) to awful (oakman). a couple of the actors muff their lines but then keep right on with the scene. as noted elsewhere this was intended to be a short 2-reeler and was made on a shoestring budget. yet the sound quality is surprisingly good, the voices all register clearly, and there is a neat cinematic touch in the silhouette death.the film was a box-office smash even though it was shown as a silent film where theaters were not wired for the new sound technology. no one expected this little film to gross an amazing $1.3 million. it briefly made stars of costello and landis and certainly launched palette on his long career as a star character actor.co-stars include mary carr as the mother, robert elliott as the detective, eddie kane as the street cop, and tom dugan as a thug.

"subconscious cruelty" has to be one of the most disturbing films i've ever seen. "salo" and "cannibal holocaust" didn't bother me that much, but there's a strange psychological element to "subconscious cruelty". this film invades your subconscious mind with shocking taboos, surrealist visuals and one of the most unsettling film scores and sound designs. repulsive at times; yes, but its visual flair can be compared to avant gard directors such as alejandro jodorowsky, dario argento, dusan makavejev and david lynch. take the most extreme elements of those 4 directors and throw in the graphic violence of a film by luico fulci, and you might be able to guess what you're in for. the film is divided into 4 parts. the first part "the ovarian eye" is real short. a narrator tells us about the the parts of the brain and its functions. then a nude woman gets her stomach cut open and an eyeball is pulled out. the second part "human larvae" is kind of like the film "eraserhead" but with incest. it deals with a man's sexual obsession with his pregnant sister. where's frued when you need him? the third part is my absolute favorite. it reminds me of "begotten" and jame's broughton's 1972 short film "dreamwood". in this segment people have sex with the earth. men hump bloody holes in the ground, girls masturbate with tree branches. the branches bleed when broken. watch in horror as a man gives fellatio to a knife sticking out of a woman's vagina. these people really know how to get in touch with nature.the last part of the film is the most disturbing and at times it borders on hardcore pornography. this part of the film made me think of jodorowsky's "the holy mountain", "sweet movie" and "cannibal holocaust". i've never been more disturbed in my life by what i witnessed. a business man gets his privates pulled apart by fishhooks. yuck and ouch! two women urinate on a christ figure and proceed to cannibalistically eat him like communion bread and sodomize him with a tree branch. poor guy. the last part was so extreme that if i ever watch the film again, i'll have close my eyes or slightly fast forward. karim hussien and mitch davis are obviously very talented, to think they did this project in there early 20's. hussein went on to direct the tarkovsky influenced "ascension" (2002) which is a much better film and he co-write the screenplay for nacho cerda's after dark horror masterpiece "the abandoned". "subconscious cruelty" is a fascinating and unsettling journey; with images that come from the unthinkable realm of everyday human minds. well, sort of.

finally watched this shocking movie last night, and what a disturbing mindf**ker it is, and unbelievably bloody and some unforgettable scenes, and a total assault on the senses. looks like a movie from the minds of lynch (specifically eraserhead), buttgereit, and even a little of "begotten". what this guy does to his pregnant sister is beyond belief, but then again, did it really happen or is it his brain's left and right sides doing battle. that's the main theme of this piece of art, to draw a fine line between fantasy and reality, and what would happen if the right side of the brain that dreams and fantasizes overtakes the reasoning and logical left side. and the music in this movie is unbelievable, a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect. even though this movie is totally shocking and pretty disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes (including hard core sex) you will ever see in any movie, i viewed it as a work of art, and loved it. and that music still amazes me, i have to try and find the soundtrack if is available. watching "subconscious cruelty" is a real event, and not something the viewer will easily forget. and a note to gorehounds, this is a must-have.warning... be careful buying this movie, because some prints have fogging on the graphic sex scenes and extreme gore, especially the copies from the japanese release.

first off - this film will not be for everybody. there are scenes of extreme graphic violence and "disturbing" images that by their nature alone will turn off many possible potential viewers. obviously from the reviews on this board - subconscious cruelty has divided those that have seen it. i'm among the ones who liked it very much for several different reasons. i feel this was a very ambitious (and quite competently pulled off...) undertaking for a bunch of 18/19 year olds with no budget and little experience. i think that each aspect of the film - the direction, the acting (though the character's performances are more likened to stage or free-form performance because of the nature of the film...) the production, the fx, the score/sound design - all are far superior to many films i've seen that exceed these kids budget and experience ten-fold. i honestly haven't been this impressed with an "art-house" style horror film since nacho cerda's genesis...first off - i'm not going to pretend to understand and/or grasp all of the graphical content in this film - but knowing that this wasn't a straight-narrative type of film when i went into it, i wasn't disappointed with how it played out. subconscious cruelty is 4 relatively short vignettes that all sort of revolve around the theory of right brain/left brain lust/anger/psychosis vs. restraint/compassion/"normalcy". to very briefly give a synopsis of each "chapter":ovarian eyeball basically just has a naked girl who has an eyeball cut out of her abdomen. i'm sure it's symbolic of something - i don't think i was paying that much attention at that point and this one blows by pretty quick. the next "episode" - human larvae - is a nihilistic, horrific, genuinely creepy story of a guy who's both in love with and repulsed by his pregnant sister, who gives into his growing psychosis which leads up to the shocking conclusion of that particular chapter. human larvae is the best of the bunch in my book, and will probably get under your skin. the dead-pan narrative dialog accentuates the growing tension as you know something horrible is going to happen - but you're not quite sure what it is. do yourself a favor and if you are interested in seeing this film - don't do too much research on it. come into it with an open mind and an iron stomach and i think you be pleasantly surprised, especially with this particular episode.rebirth has a bunch of people in a field screwing the ground and blowing trees and stuff. apparently an "arty" interpretation of the rape of the earth or something to that effect. not bad, but this one is pretty short too and i sorta missed the point on it...and right brain/martyrdom seems to be about religion and religious hypocrisy and also along with human larvae, has some of the "hardest" images/messages of the whole feature...ovarian eyeball isn't anything to write home about, mainly because of it's very short running time but does make a decent segue into the insanity to come...and rebirth is also kind of short and not quite as thought provoking, but human larvae (especially) and right brain/martyrdom are so off-the-wall and well done that they more than make up for the other parts. i think the main reason that i liked this one so much is that as "shocking", "repulsive", "violent" and "excessive" as it is, it is also done very beautifully and you can tell this was a real labor-of-love from those involved. nothing about the film feels cheap or rushed, and even if the content isn't completely decipherable, it's undeniably original - and that alone up's the points some in my book. not that every "weird art-house" film that has an unintelligible plot should be praised for it's "originality", but subconscious cruelty is the type of film that i do think i'll watch a few more times in the near future to see what other interpretations i may gain from it. again, this film is absolutely not for everyone - with some very extreme scenes of gore, murder, rape, incest, sacrilegious imagery, etc...that is definitely there to shock the viewer into taking a harder look at this film. i have to say it worked for me, and i'm anxiously awaiting the hussain/cerda collaboration that is rumored to come next. check this one out if you have the stomach for it - 9.5/10

"subconscious cruelty" has to be one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen.still it's extremely grim and gory at times,so fans of politically correct mainstream horror garbage shouldn't bother.the film mixes many wonderful visuals with plenty of sleaze and gore.it is extremely odd,vicious and disturbing,so fans of bizarre cinema won't be disappointed. my favourite segment from "subconscious cruelty" is "human larvae" which shows us a twisted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister.the birthing scene is particularly nasty and not easily forgotten.the last segment "right brain/martyrdom" has to be seen to be believed.it's incredibly harsh and blasphemous with scenes of genital mutilation and grisly torture.we see jesus christ captured by three naked females who mutilate him,ripping flesh from his chest,licking a wound on his knee and pissing on him.there is also a jesus statue with a projection of a swastika on it."subconscious cruelty" is a truly memorable film that should be seen by fans of extreme cinema.check it out.

the movie ". . . and the earth did not swallow him," based on the book by tomas rivera, is an eye-opening movie for most people. it talks about the exploitation that migrant farmworkers go through in order to survive.sergio perez uses impressionistic techniques to depict rivera's story. he uses sienna and gray-scale effects to depict some of the scenes, and he uses specific photographic techniques to make the scenes look like they took place in the 1950s.perez also gives life to the film by using time-appropriate music, including balladeering and guitar playing.i feel that it is a good film to view because it shows in detail how migrant farmworkers live, what they do for entertainment, and their beliefs.

i was very moved by the young life experiences of a man who rose so high in the academic world. a hard life surrounded by the love of a close family and extended family of companion workers created a person able to succeed in the world. for the most part the hispanic culture is shown as i have always observed and admired - hardworking, optimistic, and truly family oriented. the points of religious superstition were quite authentic to the catholic church. without a doubt,the actress who played the mother deserves an academy award. her prayers for her missing son moved me to tears. i will recommend this stunningly thoughtful film to my friends and family.

recently finally available in dvd (11/11/08), severo p√©rez' film...and the earth did not swallow him (1994) is based on one of the most highly regarded and discussed novels in chicano literature. tom√°s rivera's ...y no se lo trag√≥ la tierra/ ...and the earth did not devour him (1972) is still generally acknowledged by many critics and serious readers as the classic chicano novel. originally written in the spanish characteristic of south texas and also translated into english, rivera's novel continues as an indispensable presence within the chicano literary landscape. perez' film, originally made as a highly-rated american playhouse pbs production has taken some time to be released in dvd. one can only wonder about this matter because its high quality is not an issue. the film, and now dvd, however, remains, so far as i know, the only cinematic adaptation of any chicano novel and clearly is a tribute to earth's incredible staying power. this cinematic version also strikes an exceptionally deep-rooted nerve that is, i maintain, both specifically ethnic, yet also generally universal. doubts about earth perhaps might have arisen because it is too "ethnic," too alien from a basic american mainstream, too much a "foreign" art indie, too limited in economic resources. yet, perez in his version of art, in my opinion connects very effectively, artistically, and creates a sharply-etched portrayal of a chicano migrant collectivity that focuses on daily family life. as far as a production done with relatively limited economic resources, its lovely cinematographic work and haunting music go much beyond its available funding. simply viewing the film makes manifest this film's (or dvd) artistic value.briefly, ¬Ö.and the earth did not swallow him portrays in a neo-naturalistic way the plight, the suffering, and the despair of chicano migrant laborers as they follow the crops northward from south texas to minnesota in 1952. the local priests bless the beat-up, overstuffed vehicles of these chicano laborers who can no longer find work in the area and must follow the agricultural trail of the migrant worker northward. this chicano collectivity, like the depression-era joads in steinbeck's the grapes of wrath, forms an epic tide, driven by economic need, a survival instinct, and anguished despair, and ultimately a barely flickering faith. a tribute to these people of the earth, a collective hero, the dvd is centered on a focal family, and most especially emblematic is a young protagonist within the family, a boy, perhaps twelve or so. this work then, also, functions as a bildungsroman. ultimately, the viewer's sense of identification is generated through the experiences, subjectivity, and the struggles of the protagonist. poverty, alienation, child labor, illness (sunstroke and a pregnancy death), discrimination, school absenteeism (the boy's escapism from the bullies of discrimination is spent lying down in a lovely, peaceful cemetery) are laid bare as matter of fact¬óyet, also symbolically. worse still, the problematic conflict between the youngster and his mother goes beyond socio-economics and political conflict, into deeper realms of psychology and metaphysics. in a desperate but artistically rendered struggle, the youth battles his mother, an archetypical mexican-american traditionalist, a representative of god's will, content with prayer, resignation, consolation, and acceptance. the rebellious youth cannot believe in a god that would permit such evil and suffering to be visited upon them. how can god be so cruel, he asks, since his little sister is certainly purely innocent, as to come down with serious illness in the fields? at this point, the boy must overcome obstacles even more daunting than poverty and discrimination. the issues now include death, doubt, and despair, and lack of meaning. and he has few resources available to him¬óstrength of character, his own will power, his intelligence, and a powerful survival instinct. in this desperate, but artistically rendered struggle, the unnamed youngster, the central figure, feels the necessity of his enduring, of his achieving a heightened sense of meaning, and, the viewer hopes, a renewed and strengthened life force that can serve as an inspiration to chicanos and others.this stark battle makes use of a plot device just touched on by the original work to tie the episodic work together: missing immigrant laborers from mexico who leave no trace upon their death, although this dvd deals not with mexican but mexican-american migrant laborers a highly existential work: anguish and despair; a quest; a focus on a project; and redemption¬óall under the auspices of free will in spite of the deterministic socio-economic and religious circumstances.perez has a long list of credits basically as a documentary filmmaker. his many awards are confirmatory. the producer paul espinosa is also well-known and has been likewise honored for his work. the 1994 film, in fact, won and deserved a number of awards: first place, audience favorite at the santa barbara film festival in 1995; first place at the cairo film festival; and a number of other well-deserved awards.in my opinion this film and dvd, earth, by perez is the best chicano film that has been made.

i first saw all the rivers run on tv when i was a kid and loved it. it was great seeing a mini-series that was set and filmed in a place so close to home. living fairly close to echuca, i loved going to the historic port to see the paddle steamers. the first one i ever had a ride on was the pevensy(philadelphia in the movie). i love how it takes its time to let the events unfold. nothing feels rushed as most movies are today. the acting was fantastic. all the rivers run was perfectly cast and i just love the crew of the philadelphia. mac is always amusing to watch with his trademark raw onion sandwich after a big night out. easily deserves a 10 out of 10 and is one of my favorites mini-series of all time along with the dirtwater dynasty.

as an adventure mini-series, this is about as good as it gets. i viewed it when it was originally shown on hbo. sigrid is totally believable in her role as philadelphia, and the whole production was first rate! see all 400 minutes of it if you can. i highly recommend this mini-series. amazing that i can't rate it officially, but for you readers/users i will let you know it's a solid 10!

sigrid thornton (seachange) was seemingly born to fill the role of cato's philadelphia gordon, in this story that is often compared with margaret mitchell's american civil war classic gone with the wind. waters (heaven tonight) is in arguably his best role also as her larrakin love interest, and the two leads head a wonderful australian cast in this, arguably the most well-known and best-loved of australian miniseries. it's an outstanding production all round, though don't try watching all of it in one hit, and it deserves to be remembered as a magnificent portrayal of life in pre-federation australia. rating: 8/10

i have to hold barney drilling my head every day; well.. i guess there must be reasons. first, i'm convinced that our kids are not stupids, they are just kids, but they know (my 1 and a half years old son "selects" what to see) what's nice or disgusting. did you see the news? do you think your kids have to know the reality as it is? maybe..or maybe not; we (the adults) have the responsibility about what we want for our kids, and what to teach them. a film of drug dealers? news about massacres in middle east? of course, the kids must know there is a real life, but... they are kids; let's give them some mercy. what do you want for them? if you wanna have kids trained on weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor, go ahead, impose them lethal weapon, kill bill, any manga's anime, tell them santa's a depraved who enters through the chimney directly to violate them. i want illusions for my son (don't get me wrong, i'm not saying barney and friends is the best; in fact, the show have a lot of defects, i read other comments and i agree with most); maybe the happiness is made of dreams, or illusions. at least, i want to teach him to grow without fear but cautious, that learns to think and believe that everything is not serial killers or hijackers, whom they're reasons to worth to grow. that, at least, he can be a little happy with his own dreams. so, parents, don't underestimate your kids; they know what they want.

i have seen this show when i was younger. it is a really good show to watch. it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old. barney is definitely super de duper. b.j. is pretty funny. babie bop is very cute. the kids are very cool too. this show is about learning about numbers kinda like sesame street but different type of show and characters like barney the purple dinosaur, b.j. the yellow dinosaur with a baseball hat on his head, and baby bop the cute green dinosaur with a pink bow. the first one that started was very old barney and friends show. but then the second one was different to be new episodes. also the last one in the 2000 was new scene of barney's park. they also have a show of barney at universal studios in florida where you see barney, b.j., and baby bop and then when the show is done you get to go play, shop and meet barney. it's a very good show watch this show when you learn about many things you will like it the movie, and the live show at universal studios florida.

i can understand how barney can be annoying to some, but the hatred he gets is very ridiculous. barney was made simply right from the beginning and simplicity isn't bad, especially for the young ones he entertains. i personally find this show to be very underrated period. barney & friends is a very educational show in my opinion and even 17 years after its debut (and nearly 21 years after the character's debut on home video), he proves time and time again that he still appeals to young children. maybe less so than in the early 90's where barney was the hannah montana of the time, but he's still a classic. as a fan of barney myself, i feel that i should defend him in a way that doesn't seem like spam. the way the purple guy teaches things may be very simplistic and unrealistic, but would you rather have them hearing about war? be thankful some one (a costumed dinosaur, but still) is there to comfort kids and let them be kids simply. in this day and age, i feel that we rush our kids to grow up and barney is there to say you can still be a child at heart. in addition, many of barney's lessons on current episodes about plagiarism, being honest, and yes... even death, could appeal to everyone, not just his target audience. besides, our children need to learn to be kind and respect others for who they are, and he helps them do that. in short, barney may be annoying to some people and i completely understand why, but cut him some slack. all he and his friends (along with hit entertainment, his production company) are trying to do is help kids not only learn necessary skills, but to have fun and to also look at the positive parts of life. if more people listened to their children's favorite character and viewed him through their eyes, maybe we wouldn't be so negative about him and possibly life itself.

ok. is barney the best children's show of all time? of course not. but in some of the comments left by other members of imdb you would think it was a multi million dollar production with high class actors and a ridiculous budget for special effects. well guess what? it's barney for god's sake. he shows children good behavior, good manors and that it's ok to be who you are. for those of you who find him annoying that is because you are not five years old and the show was not meant for you. to the imdb member who wrote the review on the first page i think you may have gone a little too far. did you actually describe a sesame street character as "down to earth"? grow up everyone, this is a great show for preschoolers and actually does help children learn in a fun and creative way.

i was a bit surprised to see all of the hate comments on here. sure it's not the best kid's show, but don't people stop despising barney this much after the fifth grade?okay, everyone hates barney. okay, i think his voice and songs are annoying. okay, he's kinda creepy and strange. i'm fourteen years old, so i know well enough. but here's the thing. kids? they love this show.when i was a little kiddie of two or three, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anything else. nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. face it, that's how toddlers are. even the most patient ones can't sit still long enough to give their parents a break. there's too much to do and see and explore, too much trouble to get into.and then came barney. i don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that's so amusing to children, but they sure do love it. i know i did. i was hooked on the show, and wanted to watch it over and over. yes, the songs kind of drove my parents nuts, but to be able to watch their kids learning, and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span, it's worth it. i learned my abcs and 123's, the magic words and brushing your teeth. i'd grown out of it by five or six, of course, but by that point at least i was a little more patient, and gave my parents a break.my nieces and nephew all went through the barney stage growing up, much to their mother's delight. i know what keeps barney on the air. he entertains. of course there's big bird, ernie, and oscar, and they're great, too. but at the toddler stage, it seems that more kids prefer the big singing dinosaur. and that's enough for me.

barney is about "imagination" what you guys do not have if my preschooler never wanted to play pretend like they do in that show then i would be worried. what 2 or 3 year old actually gets all that anyways its all about the colors and the singing. for those of you saying that all they do on barney is eat junk food and recommend sesame street better well what about "cookie monster" thats all he eats but i haven't seen anyone comment that one. i do agree that sesame is a better educational show but barney is just like a show for fun don't be too serious if you didn't like your child watching tv and worried about them understanding things you don't believe then you shouldn't be propping them down in front of the tv in the first place because all of that is fake everything is fake actors are fake so why don't you take your fake brains and put it to use and think if you have a problem with a fake television show for kids then turn it off and play with them yourselves and teach them what you want them to learn not big bird or bert & ernie or barney someone who used to watch all those shows and turned out fine.

i don't understand why everyone is hating on barney. if you hate the show so much, then don't watch it! its stupid how everyone is changing the "i love you" son to "i hate you." if you don't like it, fine. whatever, thats your opinion. but there is no point to degrading the show, when it isn't even that bad. ok, so its corny, and yes, it has its flaws, but its a kids show. kids don't want to be sad and miserable, they want to be happy. and barney helps that. and even in the show, there are moments of sadness and anger and etc. and yes, barney uses magic. but the kids see barney as a figment of imagination. kids need a place to escape to express themselves. the world is a miserable and hard place. we all need a place to express ourselves, and be happier. barney does this to us. this show is great. i watched barney when i was younger. yes, some people find it stupid. but i watched it, and i'm top of my class. it might not necessarily make you smarter, but that's not the point. i believe that the point of barney is to provide a place where kids can be kids and the spirit of childhood can be expressed. where imagination lives on. so many teenagers now are unimaginative and are scared to express themselves. barney helps encourage that. barney helped me to not be afraid and to just show myself for who i am. i'm a sophomore at high school now, an ap student with a 4.0, a drama student with a love for theater and art, and with a new baby cousin who loves barney. i watch it with him and enjoy it and sing along with it. yes, its corny and silly, and whatever, but its great for kids. who wants to be an adult who doesn't have time to have fun? im a kid at heart and i love barney. its great for kids and those who are a kid at heart.its a great show for babies and toddlers. so stop hating. say that you don't like it, but stop it with the "dumbest show ever" or "barneys a load of bull" or whatever. keep it to yourself. take a chill pill or whatever. here's something: i never liked sesame street. but you don't see me going: "grover is a load of bull" or "cookie monster should die" or whatever. i hate all of the bullss**t that people say about books or movies, like barney or twilight. if you hate it, ok, whatever. no one cares. don't go saying hate things about it, cuz you might just offend someone.

yes barney is nonsense now but when i was a kid it made perfect sense.i haven't gotten any smarter but i enjoyed it. as a child i was mocked because no one could say my name so i changed it. ever since i was 4 i've gone by the name tina from barney because i could relate to her being from a different culture. i'm 17 now and barney is a huge part of my life . ...my name came from it.... i cant dis the show i grew up with no matter how stupid it seems now.i don't care if i get blocked i have nothing more to say. they shouldn't make the minimum 10 lines because some people just don't have much to say. ok done

mighty like a moose is one of many short films director leo mccarey did starring charley chase. what a dandy it is! charlie and his wife both undergo plastic surgery to improve their hideous appearances unbeknown-est to each other. they then meet at a party and become smitten with each other. now they can't allow each other to find out they're cheating. that's the preposterous premise of this frantic farce. vivien oakland, one of the few comic short leads to have a flourishing career long after the silents, is perfect as charley's long of nose wife. charley has an awful case of buck teeth, which are quickly dispatched at the dentist's. after a party is raided by police for no other reason then to practice raids, charley and his wife frantically try avoiding each other at home for fear the alterations in appearances become known. both have been photographed with their new features at the party. the hilarity back home culminates in charley trying to teach the no-good-nick cheating with his wife a lesson. the no-good-nick of course is the new charley, which his wife comes to realize long before charley teaches a lesson in faithfulness. this is one of charley chase's better efforts. *** of 4 stars.

okay. to enjoy this silent comedy short you must suspend disbelief concerning the major starting point for the film. if you can't then you'll probably be more likely to score this film a lot lower. charlie chase has a huge overbite and his wife has a nose large enough to have its own area code. unknown to each other, they have both been saving to have surgery to correct these defects. apparently, plastic and dental surgery was better back in the 1920s because neither seemed to have any need to recuperate from these major surgeries and they looked just dandy right away!! okay, remember i said to ignore this, right?! okay, well you also have to then ignore the difficult to believe idea that both could then meet and have no idea the other is their spouse. okay,...now that you allowed yourself to accept these two silly premises, the film gets really, really good.charlie makes a pass at her and she makes a pass at him. both are shocked and thrilled because no one has ever really considered them attractive. so, because of this new vanity they agree to go on a date. but, they both sneak back home--not wanting their spouses to know! anyway, they meet later and are quite attracted to each other. but what about the poor spouses supposedly at home? well, they both learn that the other is married and both anticipate their marriages will result in divorce because they really want to be with each other! late in the film, charlie figures out that the woman really is his wife and he goes through a very funny sequence where he plays both the boyfriend and the old husband--by changing his clothes and putting in false teeth when he plays the hubby! it really is a laugh riot to see him bouncing in and out of the room as he appears to be fighting with another person! you really have to see it to believe it. however, the wife sees an ad with charlie's before and after photos and knows what's happening. in the end, they both feel pretty foolish!

(***minor spoilers***)if there's something in the world of silent clowns that puzzles me, it is that charley chase never got his well deserved "break through" in the movies. oh well, maybe it isn't that strange, really, inasmuch as he never starred in any full-length features. but when i think of it, such an explanation makes it all only more mysterious -- because why the heck didn't chase get any offers to play the leading lead in features? one explanation is that his character, no matter how amusing, was simply too realistic to suit a longer story; without the burlesque elements that chaplin, keaton, lloyd, langdon and other comedians possessed, it can be assumed that the comedy he made and which worked so well for twenty minutes would get repetitive after a few more reels. i don't quite buy this, though, as chase's gag construction is magnificent and could, i believe, at its best maintain the interest of viewers alone for a longer period; at least i am tempted to think so when mighty like a moose runs the show.mr. moose isn't extraordinary handsome, and mrs. moose is hardly a "classic beauty;" he possesses the truly biggest front teeth of any human being on the planet, and she has a remarkably large nose. both of them takes plastic surgery without the other's knowledge, and when they meet by accident just a little later, he doesn't recognize his wife and she doesn't recognize her husband. a number of hilarious misunderstandings begin, with many clever gags all the way through. i don't think i'll reveal anything further, to make the viewing more enjoyable for you. because if you're a fan of silent comedies, or even if you aren't, mighty like a moose offers so many memorable moments within such a short time that i would look upon it as a downright shame not to see it; silly indeed, but no less extremely funny.

from start to finish, this 1926 classic two reeler from the hal roach studios seems to sum up what was fun about the 20's. it stars the now forgotten comic genius, charley chase and was directed by the legendary leo mccarey, who was unknown then but would earn his keep with roach and graduate to greener pastures in the 30's and 40's. recently released onto video and disc, this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by audiences of all ages. although today his star has virtually diminished, charley chase was considered the leader in the short subject comedy field in the waning years of the silents. he helped the careers of stan laurel and oliver hardy before they were brought together as a team, leo mccarey and a host of other talents. it is a shame that he is all but remembered today. check out this little gem of a film. once you do, you will be seeking out other films from this classic comic. he had his hand in over 300 films and many of them survive. rediscover this lost giant of a film from a bygone era and its giant star.

while it may not be his most laugh-packed film, mighty like a moose stands as one of charley chase's most satisfying farce comedies, twenty minutes of clever sight gags, nicely choreographed physical comedy, and amusing quips (rendered via title card, of course) all based on a wacky and wildly implausible premise. we're told up top that this is "a story of homely people-- a wife with a face that would stop a clock --and her husband with a face that would start it again." soon we meet buck-toothed charley moose and his wife vivien, who has an enormous nose. but there's no point in discussing plausibility when our plot hinges on such a patently unbelievable series of interconnected coincidences: i.e., first, that charley would have his overbite corrected the very day his wife would have her nose fixed, second, that each spouse would keep their respective cosmetic surgeries secret from the other, and third, that when bumping into each other in public afterward, charley and vivien wouldn't recognize each other. sounds like a bit of a stretch, doesn't it? multiple stretches is more like it. clearly, we're in the world of farce here and just have to roll with the silly plot twists, so as long as you can relax and forget about plausibility you're likely to enjoy this short.mighty like a moose gets off to a leisurely start as the various complications of the story are established, but things pick up once charley and vivien have "met" and made a date to attend a party together at the home of charley's dentist. they each rush home excitedly, enter separately and are at first unaware of each other's presence. (mr. & mrs. moose appear to be quite wealthy, incidentally, as they live in a mansion the size of a luxury hotel.) there follows a beautifully timed sequence somewhat reminiscent of buster keaton's the navigator in which husband and wife dash about the house without ever quite meeting up face-to-face. and once they arrive at the party the comedy really kicks into high gear as charley is forced to dance with gawky wallflower gale henry. henry, an estimable player in her own right who starred in many short comedies dating back to 1914, is hilarious as the dance partner who brings great vigor but little grace to her dancing. there's also an elegant cinematic touch during this sequence, when the camera pans down to show us only the shoes of charley, gale, vivien and vivien's dance partner, yet we're able to follow precisely what's happening between the principles by watching their feet.unfortunately for charley and vivien the party they're attending is raided, and from there on the complications multiply when they manage to escape the police dragnet and return home. when charley realizes that his newly-prettified wife was attempting to step out with another man he resolves to each her a lesson . . . while conveniently forgetting, of course, that he was attempting to do the very same thing. the last few minutes of this film offer some of chase's funniest physical comedy, capped with a good sight gag for the punchline. mighty like a moose leaves the viewer with a warm glow, and surely ranks with the most amusing comedies produced by the prolific, sadly underrated charley chase.

1st watched 8/31/1996 - (dir-tim robbins): very thought provoking and very well done movie on the subject of the death penalty. deserved more recognition and publicity than it received.

let start off by first saying that i have been a punk fan most of my life. i always kind of had a lack of respect for the la scene of the early 80's, which the decline of western civilization documents, with the exception of x and black flag, being more of new york and english punk guy. after i saw this movie that completely changed. the people shown may look like a bunch of idiotic, strung out kids who think they might accomplish something beyond street-cree through their lifestyles, but it is a great display of hedonism at it's best, coupled with some fun, loud rock n roll. one of the best scenes, and actually most insightful, is the interview with claude bessy of catholic discipline, or 'kick-boy' as he was known to slash magazine readers. originally from france, he rants about punk like a dirty old frenchman and clues in viewers to many aspects of the punk, or diy, attitude to music, politics, and life in general. darby crash of the germs comes off as a complete idiot most of the time, but the germs' performance of manimal is pretty decent, complete with a young pat smear. black flag's performance with chavo pederast on vocals (it was filmed a couple of years before henry rollins joined the band) is decent, and x and fear give the best performances in the movie. look out for the interviews with the young punk kids. you'll hear some of the funniest things you have ever heard in a documentary. highly recommended.

if i assume that you know what this film is about, i am also forced to assume that you've come to this review knowing that you will probably watch it regardless of what i say. if all this rings true - read on - you are likely to find some consonance with at least part of this review. if you're undecided, or not really entirely certain what happened in the late '70s and early '80s in the urban and suburban youth music culture, you should probably read one of the reviews which pretends to be objective instead.although i didn't grow up in california, the american punk scene was the first music scene i ever truly lived in. at the height of the hardcore i was immersed in from about 1979-1981 everybody had a band and the only common denominators between bands and indeed members of their audiences were:* the rejection of conformity* tolerance and enjoyment of difference* a desire to have fun - hard and fasthairstyles, politics, dislike of authority figures, and violent slam-dancing were not integral to what i experienced, though there were certainly cliques or factions who tended to be intolerant of those who did not dress, speak or act "punk" enough. and there was often a certain amount of unearned credit extended from some of these cliques to those who tried really hard to live down to the fascistic paradigm of anarchic, self mutilating, angry young cop-haters. although the interviews with audience punks in penelope spheeris' excellent cal-punk documentary "decline of western civilization" present a very narrow view of the subculture some of us enjoyed, the interviews with the bands, club owners, promoters and even the security people are much more representative of at least my own perspective and memories of 'the scene'. nevertheless, it is possible for those who approach this with prejudices about what punk is to experience this film without having their preconceptions challenged. unfortunate as this is, the blame for it rests solely with those who promote, believe in or feel comfortable with stereotypes - not the film-makers. don't blame the messenger. the music presented here is not going to be for everybody - nor even most. it's not the most crude stuff out there, but it's loud, obnoxious, fast, and less concerned with technique than with raw energy. for me, seeing early black flag with ron reyes singing, x, fear and the circle jerks was worth far more than the cost of this hard to obtain film. as much as i like the germs, seeing darby crash for the mess - and the nice guy - that he was left me a bit cold. nevertheless, the scenes of darby playing with his pet tarantula while "shut down" droned on and on in the background were precious. the x interview is also great. spheeris' straightforward documentary style is supplemented by wild pans and zooms during the musical segments. during the interviews, framing is used very nicely to provide context for whatever is being said. considering her experience and the budget, spheeris did as well as anybody could have with this film.recommended for those who appreciate what this film is actually about, and for those who have forgotten those few years of fun, honest, direction-less rebellion before amaerican punk was co-opted into yet another flow within the musical mainstream and the stereotypes became more important than the basic philosophy.

spheeris debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time. and as far as i know it's also the only one that focuses on the l.a. punk explosion of the early eighties. it's all there: not just great, great bands like black flag, fear, x, the germs, whose names may not mean much to you today, but whose influence on today's alternative rock music can not be over-estimated, but also the promoters, the media and first of all the audiences - the punks - all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh, shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy, the anger and the fury these youths put into their music. where is that today? the eighties may have sucked big time when it cames to mainstream music, but the underground was rocking. if you need a proof for that, watch fear's performance in decline. unmatched. great film! how come this is not available on vid, ld or dvd? p.s. the follow-up decline pt. ii is hilarious, too

another brilliant portrayal by kiefer sutherland who plays mickey hayden, a cop dealing with psychic visions of murdered victims. i absolutely love movies dealing with the psychic realm, and i wasn't disappointed with "eye of the killer" (aka after alice). i only wish the movie had been released theatrical first.

alice is the kind of movie they made in the 30's and 40's. never attempts to be an "event". just wants to entertain. and it does. i was surprised by kiefer sutherland. in a role that could be a cliche, he made it real. the plot does make allusions to alice in wonderland. a guy dressed in white does go through a hole and kiefer does fall down one. like alice the plot does twist and turn, but with a freshness you don't see in small movies. i loved the direction, sutherland, just a very fast paced and interesting movie.

peter coyote was the only name that i recognised from the cast list, so i wasn't too keen on watching this film. the only comment on imdb was positive, so i watched it on late night t.v. i would recommend this movie as a good late night viewing. it's better than a lot of this genre. the plot is excellent, the acting isn't brilliant, but it's not bad. i don't usually like flashbacks but in this film they work. as i've stated, i didn't recognise any of the cast by name, but i recognised michele lee, who gave a decent, hard working performance, as the woman wanting to stand by her man, who is lying to her. (was it knots landing?) anyhow, she's wearing really well. note: you may enjoy it more, if you miss the first few seconds of the credits. i did and it helped me. when you see the end credits, you'll get what i mean the wayne kennedy character, who is really weird, takes this to a 7 rather than a 6.

i gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10. it had an excellent plot, and peter coyote and michele lee, as well as the rest of the cast, did their parts well.both peter and michele were too long in the tooth for the ages their characters were supposed to be, and their children in the film, obviously would have been better suited being their grandchildren.i missed the first ten minutes of this film, so i don't know just how that body turned up after 25 years and got traced back to denny traynor (peter coyote's character), but i had no difficulty picking up on the storyline.barbara traynor (michele lee) is stunned when her long-time husband, denny is arrested for a murder in oregon some 25 years previous, a state denny claims he was never in.however, as evidence piles up against denny, his story changes. then his story changes again and yet again, until barbara doesn't know what to believe.barbara makes up her mind, however, to get to the bottom of the mystery whirling around the fateful time denny and a young girl named sherry accepted a ride from a stranger named wayne kennedy, that ended in murder.i found the film entertaining, well paced, and it kept me guessing as to what had really happened between those three people.from what i saw during the closing credits, this seemed to be based on a true story.

this is a nice little lifetime movie about a guy (peter coyote) who's living the perfect suburban middle class life when late one night the police suddenly bust into his home and arrest him for the murder of some guy 27 years ago.in his prison cell coyote recounts to his wife the fateful events of 27 years ago and how he came into contact with wayne kennedy the man who he supposedly killed.from here the story is told in flashback fashion and the more you learn about wayne and coyote and how they came to meet and what happened when they did the more interested you get.the acting isn't anything to crow about, although the guy who plays wayne kennedy is pretty creepy enough. the real strong point of the movie is that mystery of what actually happened on the mountain. the wife spends the movie running around digging up clues to the mystery and each time something new comes up we are treated with another flashback revealing more of the mystery. it's actually pretty well.so as far as lifetime tv movie's go this little flick comes highly recommended.enjoy!

i usually have a difficult time watching a tv movie, the extra long commercial breaks will break my concentration and i give up and find a good book. this one however made me put up with the adds and stay with it to the end. i realize the movie was based on a true story but it was not brought out why it took so long to find denny? they had his name and i would presume his social security number. while he did move around a lot it would seem he would be found as soon as his number was entered for a job etc. the actors seemed a bit old for the part and a buried metal object when dug up had no rust. these were only technical glitches and did not take from the file. for a lifetime movie it was better than most.

this movie is sort of similar to "better off dead" as it has some of the same stars. this one though isn't quite as good. granted it is rather funny and enjoyable, there is something about "better...that i like, well better. this one has these guys going to nantucket to spend there summer vacation. while there they meet this girl who's trying to save here house from this guy who wants to turn it into a lobster restaurant. this guy really doesn't seem to like lobsters, cause in one scene he sticks it into boiling water and puts in a stethoscope so he can hear it scream. the main character is torn between this girl and the girl of the son of the guy who wants to make the restaurant. somehow or another this leads to a big boat race showdown, kind of like in "summer rental" though it works a bit better here and fits into the plot a little better. though what is the deal with boat races at this time? was there some weird fascination with them? for the most part this movie delivers laughs at a good clip, but "better off dead" was still better cause it was the first and the jokes worked better.

i adore this film as much as any one adores viewing whatever it was they saw when they were young. it was one of those films that home box office showed every other day throughout my youth. this film is forever lodged in my brain. for someone who didn't grow up around this film, you may have become spoiled by the add cycle we've been in since the mid-90's and may find it more difficult to appreciate this gem. cool this is, as my sis was doped up on "better off dead" before i saw this (of which i raped & loved)-and no one, no one can deny the embrace of awkward teenage humor in american cinema in the 80's - this gave birth to everything we have found tiresome in teen comedies..because with all the overuse of slow-mo, the current soundtrack, the new tech. i wonder if cinema will go back to these roots... this is the teen comedy...yes!

"one crazy summer" is the funniest, craziest (not necessarily the best), movie i have ever seen.just when one crazy scene is done, another emerges. it never lets you rest. just one thing after another. the soundtrack is great. the songs are the right ones for the scenes.it is also a clean movie. little that is dirty in it.of course, it has the story of the guys you wouldn't trust with your lunch money, taking up a challenge, and winning over people with more resources. who'd want to see it if they failed? there is a serious side, in that parents and children do not live up to each others' dreams. one should always have an open mind, and weigh all the options. this applies both to parents and children. in "one crazy summer", the parents are wrong. this is not always the case.

i saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when it was on hbo and i loved it!! it was so hilarious i have seen it too many times to count. i love the stork brothers and the pitiful, ugly dog, bosco! my favorite quote form the movie is, "it's so ugly, it should be put to sleep." i also loved it when the little sister slaps the girls on the back and their faces stick that way. i love john cusack and demi moore in this movie too. they were great. this movie brings back memories of my college days when i first saw it. i rented the movie countless times and watched it over and over. my college roommate and i just couldn't get enough of it.who couldn't love this crazy movie?! i want to buy a copy on dvd, does anyone know where i can get it?

this is classic 80's humor. if you were a teen in the 80's this was a summer hit to go see. it was a early look at those now super stars. this and better off dead just are fun and silly movies to sit back and enjoy. everyone can admit they had a crazy summer when they were a teenager. even crazy family and friends like these characters. to be introduced to some of these characters was so much fun. the uncle who is crazy sitting every waking moment at a radio waiting to win a million dollars, the grandmother who only likes the granddaughter and handed a bill to the kids after dinner, the twin brothers who look nothing alike, and to meet hoopz was so much fun. this may not of won an award but it is just a fun movie to get lost in one afternoon.

this is the follow-up creation to better off dead. in a competition, better off dead would win hands-down. but for star power, one crazy summer outshines savage steve's better script. problems with one crazy summer (ocs): casting. better off dead (bod) was cast so much better. friendship: ocs shows cusack giving hateful looks to bill murray's little bro. trouble on the set?? more outrageous friends in ocs, but more genuine friends in bod. plot was good. you'll predict some of it, but even the predictable parts go further than you think they could. so, even though this is better off dead's ugly stepsister, it's worth a look. see demi moore before the plastic surgery if for no other reason. john cusack fans, you gotta see it, just to say you have. if you don't like bobcat golthwaite, i'm sorry. i don't like him either, but you can't escape him in this one. at least he does a great job in the film doing a tribute to another movie monster. editing needed help on the beach, but for most part, not much to complain about. overall, it's good and funny. but try not to compare it to bod or you'll find it lacking. *sigh*

i seem to notice that a lot of people have never seen this movie, and those that have usually dismiss it as garbage... that's pretty bad really.the first time i saw this movie, i admittedly was almost one of those people... thank god i'm patient, otherwise i would have never found such a classic.as goofy as this movie is, it's also a must have for anyone who is either a fan of 80's movies, or just happens to have a sense of humor.i know that there are a lot of people out there that will tell you that this movie is sort of derivative of better off dead... so what if it is? they were both excellent movies!i can honestly say that savage steve holland is a genius! 10/10

this is from much of the same creative team behind "better off dead", but is not quite as good as that amazing teen comedy. its a lot of fun, but its all over the place and just not quite as funny. curtis armstrong is used to less effect (he was incredibly funny in "better off dead", bobcat goldthwaite is hilarious, cusack is good, demi moore is demi moore (only with better hair here.) overall its fun, and as a person from cape cod, it catches the feeling of an 80s cape cod summer very effectively. for some reason, this film feels more "mainstream" than "better off dead". there isn't quite as much left field absurdity going on here. again, if you are a fan of john cusack and savage steve holland its definitely recommended.

i really love anything done by savage steve holland, the writer/director of this great movie. also see "better off dead" and "how i got into college." wonderful! anyway this movie is really humorous and delivers some unexpected things. where else but in this movie can you see demi moore as a talented singer and bobcat golthwait as a twin? i recommend this to anybody looking for some old fashioned slapstick comedy (george with the turtle raft), not to mention some really well written sarcasm (the christmas tree on the roof of the car). this movie constantly throws you unexpected things even after you've seen it 100 times like i have! enjoy!

80's comedies (especially ones with john cusak) are awesome. almost all are hillarious and instant classics and this film is no exception. plenty of nods to other films (i.e. godzilla and jaws) through out the movie that are so hillarious you'll be laughing for hours. some may complain that the movie is a little corny at times but hey it was the 80's and things were always a little cheesy. throw in a young demi moore and an even louder bob cat and you have a laughfest on your fans. if you haven't seen this, you better soon!!!!!!

one crazy summer is a fun and quirky look at love through the eyes of hoops mccann. what could have been hokey and dull is one of the freshest and most energetic comedies ever. savage steve holland reteams with john cusack to make the ultimate summer movie!

if i ever write movies or make them, i would want one of them to be like this one. i enjoy the goof-ball sense of humor and jokes contained within. this movie does stupid things without looking like it. the names of the places and characters are priceless, generic new york high school, squid calimari (george's sister), etc...genius. i've seen this movie so many times because it was a cable tv staple while i was growing up, of course i didn't get all of the jokes back than but it was still funny.this movie is a time-less classic.

john cusack stars as hoops in this silly little movie that has to be one of the best of the eighties teen comedies.believe it or not demi moore is his co star...if you love the eighties,grew up around that time,or are an angst ridden teenage artist get ready to laugh.wait until you see the cartoons..what a riot....

ok, so there's always people out there that seem to make it a point not to like movies because they're good, but instead choose to like movies based on how depressing or boring they can be, or whether they're from a foreign country. all that aside, one crazy summer is the perfect example of what a great american teen comedy should be. the jokes are a good mix of slapstick (a la bobcat goldthwait), surreal (bobcat under the inspired direction of steve holland), and dry (john cusack, one of the most morosely dry and funny actors in american cinema), and there is no character in this movie who does not deliver at least one funny line (ok, except demi moore).yes, it's immature, yes, it's screw-ball, yes, bobcat dresses up like godzilla and trashes a scale-model of a seafood restaurant. it's also funny as hell. watch it.

what can i say about this movie except that it is great fun!john cusack plays hoops mccann a recent high school graduate who has two choices, learn to take up the family business of street sweeping or spend the summer at nantucket with his pal george calamari (played hilariously by joel murray) and his zany friends.when i say zany, believe me, it can't get much zanier than the stork brothers, egg (bobcat goldthwait) and clay (tom villard) and ack ack raymond (curtis armstrong). throw in a little girl named squid and her weirdo mutt and a great performance by demi moore and you have the makings of a split your sides laughing, movie.the laughs flow freely in this movie and the story line, though the typical good versus bad and good conquers, is great with the twist of a regatta as the showdown.i would recommend this movie for anyone who likes loads of laughs and a feel good time. if you like to thoroughly *enjoy* your movies, then you can't miss one crazy summer!

it's a simple fact that there are many of us from the 80's generation who grew up loving those loopy john cusack comedies made by savage steve holland, and while i prefer there other more bizarre, out-there flick, better off dead, it's hard for me to dislike one crazy summer, a movie i grew up loving wholeheartedly as a kid into my teens. ocs was a follow-up to better off dead, returning cusack and curtis armstrong from that film. cusack is hoops, following graduation pal joel murray(george)to nantucket for the summer to each some fun on the beach. hoops finds himself embroiled in a feud with a blonde, buff punk named teddy beckersted whose lecherous father has designs on bulldozing over homes of a neighborhood to build a giant condominium. one of the homes, needing it's mortgage repaid belongs to demi moore(cassandra). there's a sailboat race which might be their only hope of saving cassandra's grandfather's home(..he had recently passed), but it has been won by teddy over the past many years, and hoops is deathly afraid of boats over water. but, with the help and motivation of newfound nantucket friends(..such as bobcat goldwait and tom villard as auto-mechanic twin brothers!), george, and budding love-interest cassandra, perhaps hoops can come to terms with his fears and win the race to save the neighborhood. armstrong has a supporting part as the son of a kooky, manic weapons salesman, general raymond(..sctv's joe flaherty in an inspired bit of casting), ack, who uses the training from his father to assist hoops and company in their goals to win the race. memorable scenes include bobcat getting stuck in a godzilla suit(!)running rampant across an entire model of aguilla beckersted(mark metcalf, barely recognizable as teddy's rather unhinged pops)'s condominium, hoops being chased by deranged cub scouts wishing to perform first aid, george a victim of toxic flatulence, bruce wagner's nutty uncle frank's increasing insanity every time he tries to better his chances to win 1 million dollars from a radio show, and the wonderful billie bird as george's grandma who actually bills the group after a meal! jeremy piven as(you guessed it)a brutish jerk who associates with teddy and causes trouble for hoops and his posse, the yummy kimberly foster as cookie(..teddy's girl who attempts to make-out with hoops while he attends a luncheon with his father), and the one-and-only william hickey as old man beckersted, who will not reward his son and grandson an inheritance if they lose the sail boat race. demi moore is cute, but this is cusack's vehicle, though bobcat and villard steal most of the scenes their in. again, some delightful animation from holland are sprinkled throughout the movie(hoops is an artist, appropriately). if you like his movies, i highly recommend the underrated, how i got into college.

affable aspiring cartoonist hoops mccann (a wonderfully engaging performance by john cusack) and his best buddy george (the deliciously deadpan joel murray) go to nantucket for the summer following graduation from high school. hoops, george, and several newfound pals come to the aid of cassandra (demi moore at her most charming), a singer who's family house is being threatened with demolition by the greedy beckersted clan. writer/director savage steve holland offers an often hilariously wacky and zesty nonstop barrage of admittedly broad and dumb, but still very funny jokes. the constant madcap lunacy has a real giddy, good-natured and infectiously inane vitality to it that's impossible to either dislike or resist. moreover, the lively and enthusiastic acting from a fine game cast adds immensely to the zany merriment: bobcat goldthwait as the spastic egg stork, tom villard as his goofy brother clay, curtis armstrong as the sweet ack ack raymond, mark metcalf as evil rich jerk aquilla beckersted, matt mulhern as the mean teddy, kimberly foster as the fetching cookie, joe flaherty as the gung-ho general raymond, william hickey as cranky old man beckersted, jeremy piven as smug preppy bully ty, and john matuszak as hulking biker stan. isidore mankofsky's slick cinematography, the hip thrashy soundtrack, cory lerios' cool rockin' score, and the funky animation are all uniformly excellent. single funniest scene: egg in a godzilla suit terrorizing a posh dinner party. an absolute hoot.

thus starts "one crazy summer", the evil twin of "better off dead..". how can any movie be bad when the opening lines are sung by david lee roth?this movie is a total blast. pairing again john cusack with curtis armstrong, but this time adding bobcat goldwaith to the mix has great, funny results. hyperactive bobcat grates the nerve of everyone around, curtis "ak ak" is the son of a deranged military with pacifist tendencies, and demi moore (with natural breasts... wow!) as the love interest of, once again, chronically depressed cusack.the story is, well, simple enough. the laughs are there, but both savage steve holland films have a certain quality to them... they are funny, but they are also sweet. the scene where curtis finds a blown up doll in the target practice beach, and begins musing about how a little girl won't be able to sleep was dumb, funny and touching. the animation used throughout is quite surreal. "the boat" is hysterical (complete with watsamatta u. sail and odie plush doll). overall, a fun film, though not as good as "better off dead..."

in the eighties, savage steve holland put out three movies, two of which are classics of what seems to be a very small genre, absurdist teen comedies. the third "how i got into college" does not measure up to "better off dead" and this one, mainly because of it's lack of john cusack and curtis armstrong (except for a tiny cameo).one crazy summer is an underrated movie, with lots of great characterizations and gags. as i recall, savage steve's movies were vilified as being brain dead at the time and after three movies he drifted into children's tv. we could use more movies from the likes of him.

when one thinks of soviet cinema, the propaganda masterpieces of eisenstein or the somber meditations of tarkovsky generally come to mind. they're great films sure, but generally not the most entertaining material out there. however, the countries within the iron curtain apparently enjoyed their escapist musicals just as much as the states had. in fact, from the 1930s up until the 70s, forty of these song-and-dance extravaganzas were released to much adoration by the public. however, they are completely unheard of in the west, so this documentary attempts to rectify that situation. it does a terrific job of both showcasing these films and putting them into the proper cultural context. despite the fact i've never been a fan of musicals, i found this documentary to be completely compelling from beginning to end. it goes to prove that, no matter how many films you manage to see in your lifetime, you're only skimming the surface of whats out there.as for the film clips themselves, they're very entertaining. while some of the musicals are blatant propaganda showing workers singing of how much they love working under the regime, some of the films (particularly the later ones) look quite accomplished from a production standpoint. plus, they are all extremely campy because of how alien they are to my western eyes. there's a few similarities between them and the american musicals i'm used to, but the presence of strict government enforcing of a message gives them a surreal edge. they certainly don't resemble the musicals made in the west. this documentary is both one of the most bizarre and entertaining films i've seen in recent memory, and its an absolute must-see for any film buff. (9/10)

east side story entertains and informs about an unknown part of cold war history. what is the purpose of any documentary? to inform the reader through commentary and footage. this one succeeds at both. you will never find many movies whose clips you get to see in here because some of them have been destroyed and some are unaccessible.you get to see and her music from musicals made in east germany, russia, and other countries under soviet control. it shows you that the people who made these movies and the people who watched them all look for same things a westerner would look for, which are pretty women and men singing and dancing on the streets with smiles and (hopefully) white teeth.

okay, when it comes to plots, this film is far from believable and also a bit silly. yet despite its many deficiencies, the film manages to work--provided you turn off your brain and just let yourself enjoy the zaniness of it all. if you can't, then you probably won't like this film very much at all.in one of the oddest plots of the 1930s, robert montgomery plays a guy living near the arctic circle at a wireless station. how exactly he came to such a remote outpost is uncertain but into this very, very lonely and isolated existence come a steady string of guests--even though it had been years since he'd seen anyone but eskimos.first, reginald owen and myrna loy arrive when their plane crashes. they are supposedly on their way to montreal--how they got that far off course is beyond belief! reginald is a stuffy and dull fellow who is really worried about montgomery, since robert hasn't seen a woman in a very long time and owen seems in constant dread that montgomery is out to steal loy for himself. as for montgomery, that's exactly what his plans are! for the longest time, you never really understand why loy is engaged to owen--since he is about as appealing as soggy bread.soon, loy and montgomery fall in love but this is all for naught when, out of the blue again, montgomery's old fianc√©e arrives to announce she's there to marry him!! considering that for over two years she never wrote and refused to follow him, montgomery naturally assumed the relationship was over--but the chipper and annoying fianc√©e's sudden arrival is enough to destroy the plans loy and montgomery were making.how all this is resolved is something you can just see for yourself. as for the film, that the plot is very silly and contrived--i can't defend this. but, it also is pretty funny and charming and i see this film as a kooky comedy that is just a step or two below contemporary films like bringing up baby. silly, slight but also very charming. it's worth seeing despite not being especially believable.

the turner classic movie channel has spent the month of january doing the films of one of my favorite actors, robert montgomery. his films are mostly rarely watched these days, except for those that were atypical for most of his career - meaning that the roles that frequently reappear on television are they were expendable, the lady in the lake, june bride, night must fall, the saxon charm, ride the pink horse, rage in heaven, the earl of chicago (in short the films he fought to get the roles in because they were not the usual comic fluff he usually appeared in). it's ironic that nowadays when one thinks of montgomery's career it is the films that were mostly made after 1937 that are pushed - the ones that broke the original image that mgm and louis b. mayer pushed. the pity of this is that montgomery was a gifted comedian, and saved many films from being routine.petticoat fever is one such film. made in 1936 with picadilly jim and trouble for two it was a banner year of good performances by montgomery, and helped lead to his being able to convince the powers that be at mgm to allow him to play "danny" in night must fall the next year.petticoat fever is set in labrador, and montgomery is a weather station operator there named dascom dinsmore. he has been living there for five years, and has not been in the company of a woman (except for inuit women) for most of that time. he has a girlfriend of sorts named clara (winifred shotter) who he sort of proposed to, but it's been two years since he has heard from her, so that he believes she has given up on him.dinsmore's world is rocked when sir james felton and irene campton (reginald owen and myrna loy) show up. they were flying to toronto for a business meeting that felton was to address. felton is engaged to campton, but dinsmore finds her enchanting...and gradually she finds him equally attractive. certainly the pompous, self-important, and hopelessly inept felton is no competition (it is a measure of owen's acting that he keeps the character entertaining even if one finds it hard to believe such a boob is a canadian captain of industry).there is something surreal about this film - probably due to the original play. while the "labrador" scenery is quite phony looking it does serve it's purpose for the comedy (witness th polar bear sequence). but the height of the surrealism is the dinner dinsmore serves his guests, a dinner of "pemmican steaks", which owen eats with real gusto. owen (a minor noble as a baronet) is dressed in normal clothing - a winter suit for the climate). but montgomery is dressed in his suit of evening dress (as though attending a ball at the embassy). loy, seeing him dress up, likewise puts on a gown. they are being served by dinsmore's servant - assistant, the inuit kimo (otto yamaoka), who is wearing a suit of evening dress too - it turns out that it is owen's! owen, who earlier insisted that dinsmore change into clothing more suitable to his station, is the only person who is improperly dressed for this dinner!! montgomery was mgm's most elegant actor in a tuxedo or evening dress (franchot tone was the his closest rival). it is a toss-up in movie if montgomery or fred astaire was the more elegant figure in such suits. hard to decide.the course of love does not move smoothly in comedy or drama. clara shows up (we are tipped off too early about this at the start of the film when we see her on an icebound ship). will dinsmore break with clara? will irene break with felton? the film is funny, and loy and montgomery make a nice couple. they had appeared together in one other film, and both were in separate scenes in a second, before this movie. but this would be their last film together.one last interesting point - at the start of the film when the credits are shown, you see illustrations of men and women in comic situations. they are based on the art work of john held jr., the great cartoonist/illustrator of the 1920s and 1930s - who was the recorder of the flapper and "jazz age". it's an unusual choice - as it has absolutely nothing to do with the film's plot or labrador.

this is a hard movie to come by in the us, but if you can find it -- and you're interested in the life and music of percy aldridge grainger, you're in for a treat. it's quite historically accurate. richard roxborough's grainger looks astoundingly like grainger at this period in time. emily woof's karen holten is quite a bit prettier than the real karen, but that was an inaccuracy i was happy to discover (!). i think what really struck me though, was how well roxborough captured grainger's outrageous personality. barbara hershey's rose was also a treasure. if she looks considerably younger than rose did at that period, it is more than made up for in how well she captured rose's obsession with percy. it's an easy film to recommend. (i should note that when she saw "passion" my wife had no particular affinity for (or knowledge of) grainger and his music, but she was totally captivated by the film.

this isn't far away from the trash that bollywood normally makes but there's just something really good about it.the title song is one of bollywoods best and is haunting throughout. this is one of the films (along with baazigar - a must see bollywood film) that made shah rukh khan and it's for this you have to check it out.other reviews give away the story - it is a fairly basic idea - sharukh definitely stands out and one of his final expressions right at the end made me give this film an extra star.its fairly cheesy but definitely worth watching if you are new to bollywood or not! 8/10

darr, although a copy of some hollywood flick, is one of the best films i have seen. it is not only beautifully portrayed but also has great songs and beautiful scenery. shahrukh is his usual self. his expressions and voice matches his character. i was pleasantly surprised by sunny deol's portrayal in the film. he is a bit romantic and lovable in the film, unlike his other characters in his other films.at times you feel like justice hasn't been done to his character. sunny was intended to be portrayed as the good guy in the film but ends up looking like the villain at the end. juhi chawla is beautiful and bubbly. she is her usual self. in short, a great love story with passion.

darr was a super hit film, which was loved by many peoples. it tells the story of shahrukh khans innocent obsession for juhi, who loves sunny deol. honestly it was a entertaining movie, but if you look carefully its not too realistic. shahrukh khan keeps phoning juhi and tells her that he loves her too bits. he gives an announcement in college that he loves her, and gives her some nice surprises like beautiful photos of her. unfortunately, instead of being flattered that a guy loves her too bits, she gets very very scared. i personally know 100s of people that get pranked by someone, and these people enjoy it, cos they play a long. yash chopra gives us a good film that does entertain, widely because of shah rukh khan's character. sunny deol is suppose to be the main actor, but darr belongs to shah rukh khan delivering a superb performance. shah rukh khan is literally the villain of the movie, but i would of been happy if he got the girl, because he loves her so dearly. sunny deol gives a decent performance, but he beats up all those guys on his own, and survives a brutal knife attack. juhi chawla is cute as ever in a fairly good performance. some good songs including tu mere samne being the best.

darr is an brilliant movie..it is 1 of my favourite films..srk has done a mind blowing job in the movie....this role couldn't have been played by anyone else because this type of role only suits srk...srk plays a mental villain in the film..srk's performance in this movie is the best performance ever in boll wood...srk deserves an honour and an encouraging appeal for his fantastic performance...juhi also delivers an excellent performance..sunny deol looked strong and physically fit in the film..

darr (1993) was an incredible movie. in my opinion, it is one of bollywood's finest. the movie itself triggers feelings of sympathy, fear, confusion, happiness, and sadness. shahrukh's role was unbelievable, in fact he gave obsession a new face. juhi chawla's innocent and girlie character contrasted greatly with shahrukh's fiery and passionate character. sunny deol's role made the "good guy" role seem like the "bad guy" one. the fact that shahrukh, not sunny, captivated the audience's attention proves that everyone has that helpless inner drive to pursue something that's not really in their hands. even though the movie is several years old, it surpasses any recent one. the song "tu mere samne" was full of passion and meaning. his personality fit the role perfectly. he should seriously consider re-starring in a similar film.

this movie is just brilliant, srk's acting is just amazing, the end is so incredibly sad, i cry every time i see this film, it's the kind you never get sick of, and can see again and again, an absolutely amazingly brilliant movie.

watch this movie just to see shahrukh khan say "i love you,k-k-kiran..." it's both heartbreaking and frightening at the same time when he says this, from the beginning to the end. this movie made him famous, and i totally recommend it :d it's highly entertaining, the music's wicked and you will laugh right along with shahrukh here...you'll genuinely feel scared for the hero and heroine and oddly enough you will identify with at least one of the characters. you will feel sad and happy and relieved and afraid at the same time. go see this classic bollywood movie with your good buddies and some lovely food and have a day in. and after you see the movie, have the songs and scenery playing in your mind...forever.

this was bollywood's answer to fatal attraction and this is a classic film in its own right. juhi chawla was good and so was sunny deol but it was shah rukh khan who shot to fame as the stalker. since then he has become a favourite of the chopra's (dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge, mohhabatein, dil to pagal hai, veer zaara and chak de india). shah rukh at first appears to be a villain but then towards the end you start to sympathize with him. the scripting was superb and the songs were chartbusters. my favourites are too mere samne and jaadu teri nazar.after the dismal failure of the underrated lamhe yash chopra fought back with darr. the dialogues were memorable, the k..k..kiran dialogue is often repeated. since darr yash chopra has slipped bit. dil to pagal hai was bad but he redeemed himself slightly with veer zaara, which was far far better. this was yash chopra's last masterpiece.

i have seen many of shahrukh's movies and this is a very good role for him. he has such versatility, but he mainly stays in positive roles. as rahul, he is very dark and disturbing, yet i found myself sympathizing with him much of the movie. if for nothing else, watch this movie for shahrukh. he plays a very complex and real character very convincingly. the story is very typical and has been done before, but the character development is very strong and entertaining. the opening is a little confusing, but by the end, it doesn't matter. the songs i found very likable and give insight to what characters are thinking. very clever. i think this movie was very good and recommend it to all shahrukh khan fans. it is a must see!

shahrukh khan and yash chopra films have never disappointed. dilwale dulhania le jayenge is a romantic classic. dil to pagal hai was fresh and perfect to watch. mohabbatein remains as one of my favorite movies ever. and veer-zaara was magical. darr, though not the best, is a romantic thriller that is different from the aforementioned movies, but definitely worth a watch. and srk, who blew me away with an excellent performance in baazigar, repeats a villain act. and this time he gets an experienced juhi chawla and sunny deol to support him.before i comment on the acting, it is not just the acting, but the wonderful script that makes it worth a watch. it is the writing that compliments the great acting. the story is gripping, but the characterization is what stands out. the comedy track goes along well. but the movie has the tendency of shifting at romance too much. the viewer is bound to lose interest and you will make a couple of yawns. but the movie is still good.shahrukh khan is brilliant in his author backed role. shahrukh khan once again is sympathetic and cruel. you are bound to cry at the end. juhi chawla is decent. her screams are bound to become annoying after a while. but in facial expression she is excellent. but her ending scene she is brilliant (though she was overshadowed by srk). she has an author backed role that makes her very likable. sunny deol is adequate. his character was very likable, but too perfect. and it gets boring after a while. he does a good job though. anupam kher is really funny, but his role felt a little out of place. tanvi azmi supports well. the songs are enjoyable and come at the right time. jadoo teri nazar (magic at your sight) is my favorite song, and presentation is very 90's film like. tu mere saamne (you are in front of me) and likha hai (written here) are nice love songs. darwaza band kar lo (close the door) is a decent love song also. the instrumental song is danced to perfection as well as the naughty wedding song solah button. the movie may not be perfect, but it is well worth your time especially if your favorite actor is in it.

pertty kiran comes back to home after completing her college. she has got a nice charisma which always drawn men to her. sunil malhotra a dare devil navy employee is one such guy. he loves her deeply and even engaged to marry her. rahul is another person who is insane and he also loves kirrrran.sunil is very close to her family and is adored by everyone in his home. kiran has never met rahul, but then rahul would kill anyone who comes between him and kiran. so when rahul comes to know that kiran is in love with sunil, what will he do ? will he kill him or he himself will be punished for his devil acts.

the movie is a very good movie.one of the best from yash raj films.the direction is incredible.the screenplay is brilliant.the story is excellent.it tells about rahul who is obssed of kiran his college friend.he is a full blown psycho doing things like talking to his mother on a phone(anyway she died 15 years back) etc.kiran is engaged to sunil.rahul does everything so he can get her.he even trys to kill sunil but he survives it.he even goes to the place where they are going to their honeymoon.the movie is every nes delight.shahrukh is superb,juhi is fairly good,sunny is average,anupham is okay and so is tanvi,dalip did good.the movie belongs to srk.the dialogues are brilliant(shahrukh ones and a lot if not the overacting and comedy)."jaadu teri nazar" and "tu mere samne" are absolutely melodious tracks.

i've never seen a bollywood film before but i caught the first ten minutes of this, laughed myself silly and hit the r button on sky+. i'm glad i did!! i hope i don't insult anybody (because basically, the bf and i loved it!) but we couldn't take it half as seriously as the actors did - especially the obsessed one (who, i understand, is a huge bollywood star because we've seen him on the cover of lots of dvds since and i even saw a doll of him today in hamleys!! the bf keeps on about this bloke - i am beginning to think he's obsessed! he keeps saying that it's strange for the traditionally good looking one to be the anti-hero of a film! but then we do like films that aren't your stock predictable hollywood fare).it was completely over the top but really good fun. if all bollywood films are like this then we're watching more. i have had that bloomin' song in my head all week and i can't speak a word of hindi! ps any recommendations would be appreciated!

darr is a great movie! shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is juhi chawla. little does juhi know in the film that shahrukh has a major crush on her and is constantly stalking her. i have to admit, some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy... like the threatening phone calls. never in my life will i forget the line, "i love you k..k..k..kiran!"it's just too bad that shahrukh and juhi weren't exactly "together" in the film. but juhi and sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie. though shahrukh's role was pretty psychotic, i still think he did a great job of playing it and can't possibly imagine anyone else doing that role. no wonder he got an award for darr in 94'!juhi... what can i say??? she looks especially amazing in this film! it's not that she doesn't always look amazing in her other films, but darr did give the public a wonderful image of her!as for the music... it was excellent! especially "jaadu teri nazar," one of my all time favorite songs. i also thought "tu mere samne" was quite nice also.a must see for everyone! overall darr deserves a 9/10!

shah rukh khan plays an obbsessed lover who would go to any lengths to get his lady. juhi chawla does a wonderful job of making the best of her character and sunny deol plays the hero and action man. this film is very good and i'd reecommend it to anyone.

the story of an obsessed lover (shahrukh khan) and the lengths he goes to get his true love (juhi chawla) who's already married to her husband (sunny deol). the film is considered one of shahrukh khan's best performances and won him acclaim from critics and audiences alike. fear that your love may not be reciprocated, fear that you may lose the one you love, fear that your beloved could have a change of heart. in short, fear is the villain in every love story.but in 'darr' fear is the ultimate expression of passion, of obsession and of sacrifice. 'darr' is rahul's (shahrukh khan) story whose love and obsession for kiran (juhi chawla) frees him from all fears of life & death. 'darr' is sunil's (sunny deol) story, whose enduring love and passion for kiran gives him the courage to face the fear of death.and finally 'darr' is kiran's story who is caught between one man's love and another man's obsession. she fears one & fears for the other. one stands for love, the other for life. in this battle between love & life, the supreme victor is love, because love always wins, in life & death. simply "darr" is one of the best indian films ever made.

i generally love srk as a villain (how can you not?) and i believe that srk and juhi are a perfect match on screen as they both are actually more nice than pretty.this movie is great to watch, although it has some major flaws: 1) the good guy (sunny) - not only he's so much less attractive than shahrukh(what in my opinion is soooooo important in bollyfilms) but his role lacks character - it would be much better if there was a conflict between two strong personalities, instead we have a conflict between a personality and an average soldier 2) kiran's and sunil's reactions for rahul's actions are unbelievably silly and naive even for a bollywood production but all this is not that important in comparison with the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere, great songs (really truly great)and (let's say it again) shahrukh as a villain, i just love him when he's so pagala must-see (along with anjaam, baazigar and duplicate)

so many times, bollywood has tried to remake hollywood hits, only to produce total duds. mercifully, yash chopra's interpretation of "sleeping with the enemy" is an extremely stylish and well-made films.shah rukh khan is obsessed with juhi chawla (who's looking her very best in here!). when he realizes that juhi has a fiance in sunny deol, he stops at nothing to make sure she becomes his.every frame of this film is a delight to watch. whether it's shah rukh chanting his trademark "i love you, k...k...k...kiran!" or the feel-good mushy scenes between sunny and juhi (who make a perfect match), you won't feel like leaving your eat in boredom.each and every song on the soundtrack is ear pleasing, especially jaadu teri nazar and tu mere samne. like i said, juhi looks like a goddess in this film. darr may not be srk's best film (that honor goes to baazigar), but it definitely figures as one of his most flawless performances! sunny is ok. he's done similar roles before, but he's good.overall, darr is g...g...g...great! ;)

certainly not a great show, but better than most other sitcoms out there at the moment. it reminds of shows like married with children and roseanne as they go to places not traditionally dealt with in sitcoms. it's sometimes funny even if you ignore the laugh tracks, but not rip-roaring hilarious.some of the characters are pretty funny (the gay friend) and some of the other drop-ins. this is also one of the few shows where the characters soliloquy (sorry for the butchered spelling) actually is effective and funny.is this an all in the family or seinfeld type show? absolutely not. however, it is certainly better than a show like 'til deat (probably the worst tv show of any type out at the moment).oh and the mom is not too bad looking and the hilary character is a little hottie.

i haven't seen this funny of a show on fox in a long time, and the wait was worth it. the kids in the show have something that i can relate to on every episode, and even my dad will sit down and watch it. it is a show not for all ages that doesn't dumb down for kids. it is like still standing but to the next level. the stuff that everyone says is stuff that everyone says and actions that everyone does. it says stuff that we all think, but in a well rounded way of presentation. the first time i saw the show i could not believe that it was on fox, and that it was allowed to stay on the air after a few episodes, from hilary's boyfriend choices to kenny's boyfriend choices, it is well worth the watch.

i have realized that many people have commented on the nature of this show being racist and homophobic, but i don't feel that is what this show is about.the show is about parents who weren't ready for kids and are now not ready for teenagers. this show helps to bring humor to a very hard topic that is sometimes over looked: parenthood.yes we have all had shows that had families in it, for example: family matters, step by step, family ties, full house....but it always would have the same old recipe to it's episodes. "steph" cuts from school and gets caught by her father. they have a heart to heart conversation and music is played and it's over with a two week grounding that after an "aww, dad..." gets a smile and the show is over. where is the comedy in such a situation? where is the realism? with the war at home, you get real situations from a real father type figure. most parents that watch this show hear some of the lines the parents put out and they either laugh (cause they know they've said it!) or they nod their heads (cause they know they've thought it and never had the guts to say it!) the war at home has situations that bring out great comedy as a father thinking his son is gay. doesn't sound funny, most think it makes the father homophobic, but the comedy comes in the bumbling father trying to talk to his son to open up. what parent knows the right thing to say, especially in a situation as this? i greatly recommend this show to anyone that i know has a sense of humor, and especially to anyone who is a young parent or was young when they had kids. you relate to a show like this when you are either.

i really like this series. its funny and unique style of off the wall, sometimes controversial comedy, is a fresh take on the genre. whilst it is a sitcom, it stands out due to the what could be awkward subjects.every aspect has a comedy turn, and the show really is very good. my favourite part of the program is the rather odd comments of the father, dave. his rants break the program up, and allow a really good flow. not perfect, because sometimes the comedy isn't laugh out loud funny, and the actors sometimes seem to be waiting for an audience response, but otherwise this program is good.i strongly recommend this program, and am very sad that it has been cancelled. please make another series, and finish it properly

this was one of the few shows that my wife and i agreed on watching. i was upset to hear that it was canceled, especially because i didn't realize the ratings were so poor. as far as i knew it was doing very well with a lot of viewers. almost all my friends and most of the people i spoke to watched the show. now we are stuck watching either crappy shows or dvd's. how bad was the show doing? does anyone know the real results of the shows viewings? i know that when it went to thursdays, it was more difficult for me to catch. thank g*d for dvr's! anyways, this was a real surprise to know that there will be no more "the war at home". if any other networks see this, please pick up the show!!!! please!

the war at home is a splendid television series and i don't understand because she has been annulled. please fairies something to continue with this very beautiful television series, with excellent and marvelous actors, good recitation and good situations, please we want the third series and even so many new episodes. i pray you!!!! i would like if possible somehow to make to reach this and mail the interested forehand, since i can tell you that here in italy this series is very liked, as in other countries of europe chest of drawers for example spain. in effects as i have written above what strikes of this television series it is the good recitation of the actors and also the honest one with which numerous matters of true importance are treated. i think both one of the best american television series arrive on the italian screens in these last years.i pray you!!!!

i'm not from usa i'm from central europe and i think the show is amazingly good. it can be easily compared with married with..children. my title says that it isn't show for conservative public. i mean i'm not so liberal but it may be slight difference between european conservatism and us cons. anyway, show is starting to be very popular in our area and it's very bad that it contains only two seasons. last episode opens many continuous and funny moments. anyway i and many peoples would be glad if that would continue playing. the last thing i'm thrilled about this is some moral education very nice packed into humorous scenes. i mean i have seen many comedies that has over two and even more minutes of very sad in tragic scenes that absolutely don't fit into comedy. war doesn't contain something like that and is made for laughing. it's like the simpsons and married whose also don't have any sad or even unfunny moments. i'm apologizing for my awful knowledge of english but i still hope that you will understand what i meant.

i would be interested to hear from the director, barbet schroeder, as to why he decided to make more his first film, and more specifically what his interest in hippies- or rather this form of the euro-hippie paradise- and about their demise. the film is, at least, true enough to keep one interested, but in its own kind of truth it's strange, biased. it's a given heroin (aka, "horse") is awful stuff, rotten, the conclusion for many a dumb-headed drug user that sees that as the be-all-end-all, because it basically is: after that everything else stops, that becomes the life, and it's either a continuous run for more of the same or death. more starts off as something concerning a romance between a new york girl and a german man, but it becomes something else, for better or worse (sometimes both in the same scene).it's basically about two "young" people, estelle and stefan, who meet in a city where stefan has come as a sort of wanderer away from his home country. she's wandering too, sort of, and is maybe too friendly with a big-time pusher named wolf. they end up on a remote island somewhere nearby and, after a somewhat daring grab for some "horse" by estelle, they also find a pad in the form of a seemingly remoter house along the seashore. schroeder's comment on youth and sex and drugs isn't too simplistic, which makes the film actually lucid and intelligent so many years later. it's both direct and subtle, more about the characters and then about the fact that what he's depicting could in other hands just be a propagandistic hippie-exploitation picture. perhaps most pleasantly, and this is just a guess, schroeder uses as inspiration the sort of long sequence from bergman's summer with monika: two kids in an inexorable connection, some good some definitely not so good, set against (too?) perfectly shot landscapes.on the one hand, i should mention that there are problems, some big ones in fact. the performances aren't very convincing throughout; a few scenes strike some power or have the actors in a good connection with one another, but klaus grumberg overplays himself even if he is an ornery german by nature (in that case i would've preferred klaus kinski in the part to make it crazier but deep enough for the subject matter) as does farmer to her own degree. and there's gaps of naivet√© in the screenplay that keep it from being as deep as it really thinks it is. on the other hand, there are two big things going for it: nestor almendros, the great cinematographer (i.e. days of heaven) is dp and is a big boost for a first time director like schroeder. nearly every image is seen with an awesome purpose or artistry, be it a shot of the cliffs by the sea or sun or something as simple as the seemingly natural light of a room.the other thing is pink floyd, probably the main reason i and many others have heard of the film in the first place (years before i knew really who schroeder was i saw the "more" soundtrack whenever i looked up pink floyd albums). it's very good music throughout, occasionally the mind-blowing variety that gives them the reputation they deserve. some of it, too, is a little tedious, even as it is a movie that concerns free love and lots of drugs and sometimes both at the same time. i wouldn't rank it anywhere near as high as a meddle or animals, certainly not dark side, but it too helps to elevate the subject matter another notch, particularly when one least expects it or in low tones or floating in and out of buildings as stefan or other walks on the streets. it's almost better atmosphere than the movie itself deserves, but overall more is still worth watching as a period piece- dated, but potent, like a less ambitious but more substantial zabriskie point.

a german freshman, stefan hitch hikes to paris during summer break were he falls for a mysterious young woman he meets in the paris freak scene. he then follows her in the famous isle of ibiza, the hippie joint were meets wolf, a man who throws hitler-jugend knives, owns bars and hotels and keeps estelle under his thumb with dope. the couple tries to escape wolf, stefan gets hooked with dope and jealousy for estelle, who's groovy and a free spirit. great photography and music, plot is quite usual for the period but it's not an exploitation kind of movie, cold and dramatic. the moral is quite strong (he was looking for the sun...) but i would not say it's a film against drugs even it puts enphasy on drug use.

"more", maybe, is mostly remembered for the excellent soundtrack composed by pink floyd -in 1969 they weren't superstars yet. actually they made an album with the film music, no fan can miss it!but this is also the first film of german-french director barbet schroeder: it's a cult movie. when it was released, censorship everywhere cut several scenes of sex and drugs. it is also one of the first films to treat explicitly the theme of drug slavery.a german boy travels to paris and meets an american girl: they fall in love. together they search for sun and exoticism. but it's a too high price love: she initiates him into drugs.in the sixties anti-drug campaigns were not like today, there wasn't much information. on the contrary, in many milieus taking drugs was a sort of spiritual experience... so it's quite surprising to see a film of that period which describes a nightmarish heroin experience.the film is simple, not vulgar at all and shot in a "cinema-verit√©" style. actors mimsy farmer and klaus gr√ºnberg are very convincing. "more" is a document of the end of the sixties -and a document of the end of the hippies illusions as well.

like most people, i was interested in "more" solely because of the pink floyd soundtrack, which has turned out to be the only pink floyd album that i still listen to after all these years. it was quite a surprise to run across the film in a local video store, in a digitally remastered version. it was an even bigger surprise to find that it is a pretty good movie.visually it is quite beautiful, especially when the two main characters are cavorting on the rocks on the spanish island of ibiza. and the use of the soundtrack music, which as far as i can tell is exclusively by pink floyd, is excellent. it was a joy to watch the film with my copy of the album alongside me, mentally ticking off each track as it was used in the film. dave gilmour's brief "a spanish piece" was the only one i didn't hear, and several tracks are used quite prominently, especially "cymbaline," "main theme," and "quicksilver." that latter track is tedious on the soundtrack album but works very well during the title sequence of the film, resurfacing at least once later on. maybe now i can appreciate it on the album, now that i have some visuals to accompany it in my mind.the plot of "more" is a little hard to take at times, especially in the early going, when the film appears to be merely a vehicle to demonstrate the hipness of those involved in making it. but eventually the film proves that it has much more than that to offer, as the plot becomes more focused. why does stefan take heroin? why does anybody take heroin, fully knowing the possible consequences? the film does not attempt to answer that question directly, but stefan's heroin use seems a logical extension of his single-minded pursuit of pure pleasure.i strongly recommend this film to any pink floyd fan who has an appreciation of the vastly underrated "more" soundtrack. i also recommend it to anyone who has an interest in sixties counterculture and how it was portrayed in the media. i have no idea how realistic this movie is, since i am too young to have experienced the sixties firsthand, but it does seem to capture the spirit of the times in a way that no other movie does.

has there ever been an angel of death like mimsy farmer in barbet schroeder's 1960s heroin opus? sort of jean seberg with a hypodermic. pink floyd score. despite some ultimately insignificant weaknesses, a classic, shamelessly ripped off by erich segal/noel black for their inept jennifer on my mind (1971), although tippy walker, playing a similar character, is herself very junkie-appealing in the latter mess. more, though, is terrific, a great 60s drug movie and, simply, an important document of its time. very much a cult film so join the cult.no american movie then, as far as i can remember, charts the same territory. mimsy's an astonishing archetype, elevating this into mythic realms. not for the faint-hearted. great sex scenes too.

there has been a political documentary, of recent vintage, called why we fight, which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation. it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq. yet, a far more famous series of films, with the same name, was made during world war two, by hollywood director frank capra. although considered documentaries, and having won oscars in that category, this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop, more in the vein of leni reifenstal's triumph of the will, scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes. that said, that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries (such as the bbc's lauded the world at war) lacked, nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable. they are skillfully made, and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store, i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase. i chose goodtimes dvd's four dvd collection of the series.rarely has something free been so worth invaluable. while there are no extras on the dvds, and the sound quality of the prints varies, these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago, when racism was overt (as in many of the classic warner brothers pro-war cartoons of the era), and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts. the seven films, produced between 1942 and 1945, are prelude to war, the nazis strike, divide and conquer, the battle of britain, the battle of russia, the battle of china, and war comes to america.overall, the film series is well worth watching, not only for the obvious reasons, but for the subtle things it reveals, such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars, rather than the modern singular, or the most overused graphic in the whole series- a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria. yet, it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars. the lesson of world war one (avoid foreign entanglements) was not applicable to world war two, whose own lesson (act early against dictatorships) has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since: korea, vietnam, nor iraq. the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today's information-clogged times. it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today, but at least you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position, nor will you be the last.

with all of mainland europe under his control hitler prepares for the last obstacle in his way before heading for north america, great britain. with an overwhelming edge in aircraft goering's luftwaffe looks unstoppable on paper. once in the air however the raf tenaciously disrupts the paradigm by blowing the enemy out of sky air at a seven to one rate. the battle of britain rages on for a over a year as the island nation is bloodied but unbowed providing crucial time for their american allies to produce more arms for the inevitable struggle. using more staged footage than the three previous documentaries in the why we fight series the battle of britain has a more propaganda like feel to it with the dramatized (some with unmistakable warners music score ) scenes glaringly obvious to newsreel. in an ironic twist amid the devastation caused by german air attacks beethoven's seventh symphony is employed to underscore the visual suffering. the story itself is one of remarkable courage by a defiant nation who refused to buckle under to the devastating attacks inflicted upon it by up until that point an invincible war machine. it is the 20th century version of the 300 spartans.there have been more exhaustively researched and better looking commercial efforts done on this battle since this film but the immediacy and motivation the battle of britain provided then will always make it a more valuable document of england during its "finest hour".

britain and france declared war on germany in 1939, but by then, almost all of europe had fallen under the advance of the nazi war machine. entering the war, britain virtually started from scratch, with scarce supplies and with an air force that was outnumbered by germany ten to one. but the will of the brits was firm, emboldened by their new prime minister winston churchill who declared - "we shall never go under".on august 8, 1940, the battle for britain was on. however for the first time since hitler's declared stance to conquer the world, he hit a wall. though massively outnumbered, the british royal air force went on the offensive, and in the span of twenty eight days in september and october of 1940, german luftwaffe casualties climbed to two thousand three hundred seventy five lost planes and crew. hitler's rage was seething, but he had to call a momentary time out. responding later in the year, hitler launched a massive fire bombing of london on christmas day of 1940. when i say that there has never been a disaster movie to rival the real live footage of london in flames during this assault would be an understatement. perhaps the most surreal effect of this chapter in the "why we fight" series would be seeing british citizens emerge from their underground shelters following the bombing raids to resume what was left of their life above ground. even as you watch, there is no way to comprehend the living horror these people must have gone through, as the city of london was left in virtual ruin.yet the nazis were stunned and stymied as well. everything hitler wanted to believe about freedom and democracy was now turned on it's head. instead of being weak willed and complacent like the french, the british were not going to give up without a fight. and fight they did, taking the air battle to germany and responding in kind with attacks on the german homeland. it was a turning point, forcing hitler to rethink his strategy.

the frozen limits is a big screen vehicle for the artists known as the crazy gang. they were a group of british entertainers who formed in the early 1930s. in the main the group's six men were bud flanagan, chesney allen, jimmy nervo, teddy knox, charlie naughton and jimmy gold. hugely popular in the variety halls the group were also darlings of the then royal family. the plot here sees them as the wonder boys troupe who set off to seek their fortunes in alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper. only problem is is that when they finally get to red gulch it turns out they are 40 years too late!i often cringe when i see the statement "it's very british" because it implies that those not of the british isles may struggle to get it. the reason it bothers me is because in this www/internet age i have garnered a ream of non british film loving friends who have been known to split their sides at the best of ealing, will hay and the imperious terry-thomas. so, then, is it true that something such as the frozen limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non british audience? well yes it's true, so much here is topically british, but really it has to be said that the classic movie fan is pretty well versed in history, and when all is said and done the visual mirth here is universal. with the anarchic "not" so wild west make over an absolute winner. a winner that has every chance of being more appreciated by an american audience now than it will be by a british audience. not all the comedy works, and in truth the "big 6" are trumped big time by a film stealing moore marriott. but there are skits and parodies here that deserve respect and a nod of approval from more illustrious comedy acts. you are unlikely to nearly fall off your chair like i did because of an ovaltine gag, but if you be a classic comedy film fan? i feel sure that you will at the worst acknowledge there's some very talented people at work here.now then, dose the mounties always get their man? 8/10

the problem with tv today is that people have been spoiled by "lite" tv viewing. this type of television show is the equivalent of elevator music or "easy listening" jazz. the typical viewers idea of "continuity" is remembering who got voted off the island last week and wondering who will be the next to go. show them a program like surface, firefly, dr. who, or anything with a plot arc of more than three episodes and...well, they'll just flip back to survivor.95% of the sheep watching tv don't want to rack their brains. they want excuses to not think. they want to make sure the "boob tube" lives up to its name...and they don't want shows that try and go any other route. because of this, surface and many other high-quality shows that should have lasted far longer have gotten the axe.tv viewers don't want stories, or morals, or philosophy, or anything over a third grade vocabulary level. they want people eating earthworms, or over-dramatized "real life" series (no such thing! you cannot observe something without changing the very nature of what you observe) or hormonal shows involving groups of people having trysts and then bragging about it to their friends.today's television is nothing but a wasteland, and the few diamonds you can pick out of the dust are just tossed out because no one even knows what a diamond is anymore. surface was one of those diamonds.

i have bought the complete season of surface. watched it in 3 days! i was so captured by the the plot, theories and basically everything about this show. the actor who plays miles is great. mile's sister, mother and father acted like real life family would. you could connect on so many levels it's fascinating.i find animals are so wonderful, you can almost connect with them as a parent is to a child. it would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists.am sadden, that surface is not having a second season or at least four more shows. i have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book.love the show very much. for those who haven't watched surface, if you like sci-fi you need to watch this!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this dvd set is the complete widescreen 15-episode run of "surface", a television show made by universal in 2006. the full running time is 10 hours and 34 minutes plus a few bonus features (deleted scenes, cast interviews, special effects featurette). this was a relatively high budget show and much of the budget makes it to the screen in the form of quality production design and special effects. unfortunately 10+ hours is a lot of time and as typically happens with this type of stuff, the overall quality begins to fall off in the later episodes. i found the first 7 episodes (discs 1 and 2) extremely engaging and the remainder a disappointment. "surface" was produced, written and directed by josh and jonas pate; and it appears that they were surprised by the success of the series and unable to cobble together enough good subsequent material as they rushed to fill the order for additional episodes. it even looks like additional writers were brought in for the later episodes because the characters (who were already the weakest part of the series) lack consistency with the way they were played in the early episodes. the series was canceled and although the last episode provides a conclusion of sorts there are still a lot of things left hanging. it is basically a science fiction story about genetically created dragons; sort of a television blend of "jurassic park" and "et". the story begins as a puzzle as a crew-less navy sub is found adrift at sea, boaters on a texas lake are sucked into whirlpool, a lighthouse in africa is destroyed by a huge monster, etc. etc. and as long as things stay this vague there is a fair amount of tension and suspense. a human element is introduced in the form of three american families, one on each coast and one on the gulf of mexico. laura daughterty (lake bell) is a california marine biologist who discovers a strange creature rising from an undersea thermal vent on the ocean floor. rich connelly (jay r. ferguson) is diving with his younger brother in the gulf when a similar creature drags his brother away (never to be seen again). miles bennett (carter jenkins) is a wilmington teenager who finds some strange eggs floating in the ocean. he takes one home where it hatches into an "et" type dragon. he will spend the rest of the series trying to hide his strange pet from his family and from the local authorities. these dragons may look like lizards but they are more like indestructible electric eels, firing electromagnetic pulses, causing lightning strikes, emptying the sea of fish, and reproducing like a bunch of randy rabbits when they find an undersea thermal vent of boiling water. as long as it's uncertain whether or not they're intelligent, extraterrestrial, or harmless the premise is interesting. once you begin to suspect their origin it all gets very tired and predictable. jay r. ferguson (a staggeringly bad actor in the tradition of david hasselhoff) essentially plays the richard dreyfuss character from "close encounters of the third kind", so you know that with a better actor and a better director it could have been an interesting character. you will grow to hate this character more with each episode. unfortunately what starts out as three parallel story lines is soon condensed into two as ferguson and bell (a low-budget version of sandra bullock) are soon paired up and involved in a series of moronic adventures almost as improbable as the stuff "jason bourne" gets himself into. you expect plot holes and the need to suspend disbelief in this type of show (that can even be part of the fun) but their adventures are not just totally implausible, they are utterly and completely boring. there are three consecutive episodes that feature ferguson and bell together in a submersible that will have you longing for the excitement of an all-day actuarial conference. jenkins (miles) is the strongest member of the cast and the segments with his pet dragon (nimrod) are inter-cut often enough with the boring ferguson-bell stuff to keep you watching. and these segments benefit from the presence of gorgeous leighton meester (of recent "gossip girl" fame) as his sister savannah. apparently the producers picked up on the importance of this to their "teenage boy" target audience and the one positive thing they did with the later episodes of the series was to introduce linsey godrey (caitlin) as a "first love" interest for miles. so as savannah's screen time decreases catlin is gradually phased in. in retrospect they needed a third storyline to keep viewers sufficiently engaged and it would have been better to limit the adult melodrama in favor of a second group of young actors. then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

i like the show, but come-on writers, get some action in it! quit dragging it on and on. you have a great concept and it could be a whole lot more. miles (jenkins) is great and performs as a kid that age should act in the situation he finds himself in. hey, get creative with the creatures, they may have telepathic capabilities or other out-worldly powers. the kid actors in the series are very good and convincing. the parents of miles do appear to be a little too out-of-sense as to what is going on, but develop this, come on! you have a great seed here and there can be a whole new twist to next season with a lot of new characters and creatures and all kinds of neat sci-fi stuff. if they could make a series on a witch, then you should be able to make one on these creatures and kids.

i am continuously amazed at the us networks. what is the matter with them? yet another very very promising series axed after just 15 episodes and we are left not knowing what the hell happens to everyone. i really thoroughly enjoyed this show and am so annoyed that we will never find out what happens to the characters and the 'monsters' from the deep. this show had everything. humour, suspense, action. what more could you want. why oh why did the pull the plug on this? it just doesn't make sense. buffy went on for 7 series as did charmed and enjoyable as they were, surface, invasion and dead like me were even better. just because a show does not get terribly high ratings doesn't mean it's rubbish and if they gave it a bit longer probably more people would catch on to it and they would end up with a big hit on their hands. one season just does not give it enough time to catch on and the networks are far to eager to pull the plug. they should learn that like fine wines and cheeses, they take time to mature.bring surface and invasion back - p l e a s e !!!!!!!

i love this show. it's truly unique. i was under the impression it was going to have more seasons. in anticipation of series 2, recently i purchased series 1 to re-watch it in order to be refreshed when part 2 started. now after watching it i was excited and craving more, so i came to the site to see the schedule for the continuation. i am really disappointed to see there no longer are plans for a second series as i was eagerly looking forward to watching more of this story. i think they really dropped the ball on this one. there was plenty of story line left to build on and lots of unanswered questions. i'm now a very unhappy view and i hope that they would reconsider their decision and pick up the story where it left off.

this is one of the better sci-fi series. it involves character development, a few really tensionate moments and reasonable episode scripts. as one other commentator said here, it looked as if it were a mini series, not a full blown series with filler episodes and low budgets.the problem with the show, which in short is a godzilla series, is that it started too big, with incredible monsters, fantastic science, then it all boiled down to local americans doing stuff. then, the show ended too soon, since the olympics were coming and hey! a sci-fi show is a sci-fi show, but half naked athletic people running around aimlessly is much more important. so they only did 15 episodes instead of the expected 22. the audience was small, too, as people didn't really caught it on at 20:00. in the end the suits did it. trust a marketing plan to destroy anything that looks remotely original and promising.conclusion: you have a show with good special effects, stuff like huge monsters killing people or destroying boats, then going into genetic engineering, transforming people, human clones, end of the world, tsunamis. also, the only fillers are scenes with aggressive rednecks or other annoying people being killed for their stupidity. the down-side is that after 15 episodes that prepare something huge, the show ends. no real ending, no closure, just a bitter taste of cloth in one's mouth, as if you just swallowed a piece of suit.

there is no denying it. sci-fi on tv is difficult. there are so many problems that the genre brings with it. like the need for a good budget, solid writing, decent acting. perhaps the budget and the script writing is the departments where i feel most attempts have failed. so does "surface" succeed? not completely, but more so than most.the way i see it, a good sci-fi show doesn't really need a lot of cgi to work, nor does it need a ton of money. what it needs is the capacity to create a larger-than-life feeling. the feeling that there is more than meets the eye, something to make me curious and willing to try and figure out how it's going to end. adding the pieces of the puzzle and sometimes saying "aha!" is what makes or breaks a show like this one."surface" had a couple of flaws. first of all it's basic premise is not as exciting as it could have been, nor is the revealed story as exciting (or daring) as i hoped in the beginning. also the tv-feeling is very present much of the time. all the way from the crappy cgi (that ranges from decent to awful) to the rather shifting quality in the acting department. also it feels sometimes a bit too family-oriented in that it takes the edge of sometimes and becomes almost cutesy. but aside from these flaws it's an enjoyable show. maybe not as spectacular as some of the other sci-fi shows out there. but it manages to keep me interested the whole season and it offers a couple of nice cliffhangers between shows as well. the ending for me is not that appealing. i don't like shows that end without ending so to speak, leaving the story unresolved. it's especially unfortunate in this case since the show seems to be canceled after the first season (it is as of yet undecided).hbo is to me the benchmark for quality television. their series have the best actors, the best production values and above all the most solid writing. this is not hbo-quality, but it's good for what it is. good enough to want another season without a doubt.

imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid. now think what would happen if you had the chance to speak with your younger self, or even change him/you. would you try to influence or try to change your younger self's beliefs in light of your future experience? or perhaps the encounter would change your older self's perception of life and reality? walt disney's the kid tries to engage this complex thought by putting "older self" bruce willis in a collision course with "younger self" spenser breslin (from the santa clause 2 and the cat in the hat "fame"). the result is a sometimes funny sometimes touching encounter, which makes you ponder about your own past, present and future ¬ñ and truly believe it is never too late to change your course.

ms. stowe is sensational in this power drama about a secret policeman who interrogates a children's author because he believes she is trying to plant ideas in her writings that are contrary to the state's. this is an incredibly powerful film. both performances are worthy of more recognition as is the message of this movie. put this on your must see list if you can locate it.

rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion. what makes this film so unsettling is that the drama feels so real, it's almost hard to remember that it's only a movie. this is by far madeline stowe and alan rickman's performance of their careers. the film almost feels like a theatrical production the way it is staged and lit. the only bad thing about this movie is that it's very difficult to get a copy of it. i have yet to see it other than on laserdisc. this truly powerful film deserves a digitally remastered transfer and special edition treatment on dvd. it really is that good.

what would it be like to be accused of being a subversive? this is what this film explores through the eyes of 2 characters, one being the accused subversive, the other being the interrogator. it is a frightening journey from the beginning to the end. this film is not for everybody and if you do not understand political governments thoroughly, you will never get the point of this film, as proved by 90% of the reviews here.

this movie took me by surprise. i first saw it more than 10 years ago, and it stays with me still. it's got it's just plain boring points, and i, personally, would have ended it differently- this has not in the least bit discouraged me from watching it over and over and recommending it to others. the acting is _fantastic_. the cast and director do an amazing job with the script, and anyone who likes 'different' movies, who has the patience to sit and say, "what the hell is this?", and allow themselves to be drawn in should give this film a chance. if you just want alan rickman to be goofy or to see things explode this is not the movie for you.

i really love this movie. it has a very real feel to it. i believe it was never popular because of the subject matter, however, because of the subject matter, it makes the movie all that much more important.this is an "a" movie and i recommend it highly. if you liked "1984" book or movie, i think you will like this one as well.this is harsh, to say the least, including mental and physical acts of torture, some pretty vile. not for the week at heart or stomach. no gore, but his movie is so great at projecting the mental anticipation it doesn't need blood and guts.if you are not a realist or a pestimistic person i don't think you will enjoy it. it leaves you with an uneasy feeling about humans, what they're capable of, and the very real possibility that our government(s)does not necessarily have our personal best interest in it's heart.

i am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie. the acting is astonishing, the movie itself is powerful and clear, and the issues involved are handled with subtlety and depth.this is an important movie. it could be profoundly transformative.i would pay good money never, ever to see it again. because it *is* so good and so complex, it is extremely difficult to watch. i admit that my taste in movies tends strongly toward light entertainment; the visual medium can be so powerful that i tend to avoid it for anything really important. those of you with greater fortitude than i have may find it easier to handle.but i strongly encourage people to see it at least once. preferably with others, so you can talk to each other, and have someone around to remind you that there's more to the world than the movie.

even the trailer for this movie makes me cry, like the first time i saw this movie. not for people who are easily upset by intense material! the finest performances by alan rickman and madelaine stowe, without a doubt. this dreadful tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture it's citizens for any reason, whether they are anarchist's or the writer of children's books will chill you to the bone. i saw it when it first came out 1991 and i remember every frame. it still scares the hell out me today. it's happening now.apparently, imdb requires ten lines to meet their criteria for a film review. imdb might want to get a grip! some of us are a little more succinct about writing opinions.

this two-character drama is extremely well-acted and has a valid message and some truly shocking moments (shocking not because they are graphic, but because you're not prepared for them when they come). but eventually it does become oppressive, just like the somewhat similar "a pure formality" did. still, alan rickman should have gotten an oscar nomination for his multi-dimensional performance, no doubt about it. (**1/2)

at the first glance of this film the camera angles immediately make you think that this is a low budget film that will bore you to tears or make you press the stop button. surprisingly, the storyline comes forward and is played through the screen in a way that i feel most would relate to. i scored this movie at 7 but like most would, felt it should be a 10, you will understand as you watch it because its a rare thing for a film to be in touch with a persons feelings and how life should be shown by a tv set. most films try to leave you in awe of their special effects, twists and turns etc, this film dealt a true hand showed a good film backed by an alabama style storyline that most would feel was a good waste of a couple of hours. wish i had put the popcorn maker on after all well done!

six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses. the one negative review happens to reside (or did) on the first page of the movie's location in the imdb.i found "what alice found" to be one of the best movies almost no one's heard of that i have seen this year. it's 6.4 rating is misleading and may be more a function of the difficult subject matter than the quality of the movie. who would think that a movie purportedly about truck stop prostitution would be worth seeing? guess again.for me, "alice" was a positively gripping psychological thriller. i was virtually on the edge of my seat the entire time. it's a very credible story with a realistic script and is very well cast. in a fairer world, actress judith ivey would win awards for keeping you guessing whether she was good or evil.ignore the rating and see this terrific movie. (and by the way, i wish there was a soundtrack album.)

there's nothing much to the story. a young woman steals some money from the dreary vermont supermarket where she works, decides to run away to florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend julie, and encounters an odd couple on the highway. if you remember the elderly couple from "rosemary's baby," you have some idea of what these two are like. bill has a comical face and is retired from the army. sandra is an ex stripper now become a truckstop whore, although we don't find this out at once. they're affectionate, helpful, and full of common sense.they more or less adopt the girl, alice, and promise to give her a ride in their elaborate rv, although they are not driving "directly" to florida.this is where the film could have gone one-hundred-percent wrong. all the film makers had to do was turn the elderly couple into the personification of evil. they would take the virginal alice (handcuffed to the bed or whatever) and sell her body to any greaseball driver who has a lot of money and likes rough sex. (alice would have had a heck of a time escaping, with lots of aborted attempts, before the final shootout.) but, no. the couple really is pretty nice, and alice is far from virginal. alice overhears sandra with a customer, asks about the business, and tries to turn a trick on her own. bill prevents anything from happening and insists she do the job right if she's going to do it at all. they don't talk her into it. they guide her.alice makes several hundred dollars, which is several hundred dollars more than she had when she met the couple. bill and sandra keep her money in the safe where customers aren't going to find it. alice misunderstands. she doesn't find whoring very pleasant work, and she thinks she'll never be paid off because every time she asks to be dropped off, sandra responds with, "what? not here, honey. not in the middle of nowhere." however, after she is talked into handing her gun over to sandra, the couple give her the money she wants and rather lovingly release her to continue her trip to florida.you know what i found the most tragic moment in the film? it had nothing to do with prostitution or thievery. alice has been expecting to room with her friend julie after she arrives in miami. julie is after all a legitimate student. but when alice calls her friend from someplace in alabama to assure her she's on her way but will be late, julie hesitates and says, "well -- my mother doesn't think you should room with us. and to tell you the truth, my roommate isn't cool on it either. i invited you down, sure, but i thought it was just like a visit for a week or something. go back to milford, alice" there is a long silence before alice hangs up.only one shot is fired (a few white frames of film) and no one is hit. tears appear only once. nobody slugs anybody else. no car explodes in a fireball. no cop chases them down the interstate.the direction is occasionally clumsy. too much cross-cutting between sandra trying to disarm alice and alice's hand holding the wobbling pistol. there is hardly any musical score. there is brief male and female nudity and it's awkward, as it's probably supposed to be. alice isn't unattractive but she is not babalicious either. she sports asiatic eyes, a kind of robust version of molly parker. the cinematography looks cheap and the colors are washed out. the direction is a straightforward narrative, with a few illuminating flashbacks. nothing is wasted. and it was all evidently shot around danbury, connecticut. the city sticks in my mind because i drove through it after one of its floods and remember the cars caked with a film of mud all the way up to the door handles.i don't know exactly what alice found. (i dread even thinking that the answer to the riddle is that "she found herself.") the acting isn't bad at all. judith ivey is better than that. it's definitely worth seeing, a quiet, orderly film that treats the audience like adults.

this is a low budget, well acted little gem. alice, a small town massachusetts teenager, fed up with her existence, takes to the road to escape her mother who flips burgers and her own job as a check out in a super market. she sets out for florida and to stay with her wealthier high school friend who is a freshman at miami. after her car suspiciously breaks down on the thruway and she loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple in an rv who also happen to be traveling to florida.. the couple, brilliantly played by judith ivy and bill raymond are overly hospitable and, it turns out, a prostitute and and her pimp. slowly, alice is lured into truck stop prostitution as the rv meanders down the thruway in the general direction of florida. through intermittent flashbacks, we learn a little more about alice and her desire to leave tiny milford. we also see the couple in a new light and their life and the choices made by the couple and alice all seem quite credible. an excellent, well made film that you will think about when it is over.

as far as i am concerned, this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs i am used to viewing: 1 - the setting is paris, france; 2 - there is 28-minute scene with no dialog.both make this movie a bit unique, at least to english-speaking film noir fans. actually, an american, jules dussain, shot the film, so it's not entirely a european film. initially, i was disappointed in this after i had watched the first 40 minutes. it's an expensive dvd and i was bored. however, once that silent segment started - the actual heist (you already know what's it about), the film picked up considerably and just got better and better.in fact, i thought the best part of the story was what happened after the heist. the best aspect of the entire film was the cinematography. this is what makes the disc worth owning. it's excellent film noir photography and a real travelogue for those of us who have never seen paris...and this is paris in the mid 1950s. there are lots of bleak-but-interesting rain-soaked paris streets and buildings i found fascinating to view. in fact, there were many more of those great shots than of london in the much better known film, the third man.the lead actor in here, jean servais, i think his name is, also is interesting to view. someone described his face as a cross between humphrey bogart and harry dean stanton, and that sums it up perfectly. a warning for those not expecting profanity or nudity in a classic film. this is france, not the united states, so there is a little bit of both in here. i appreciate the dvd offering the choice of subtitles or a dubbed version, too.

if the caper genre owes a lot to walter huston, it also has a debt of gratitude to jules dassin, a man that was ahead of his times and who suffered a lot because of his blacklisting when edward dmytryk accused him of being a communist. the end of his american career would have meant the end of mr. dassin, but moving to europe proved he was bigger than the same people that had contributed to his hollywood demise."rififi" is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to mr. dassin's vision. he decided to adapt auguste le breton's novel because he saw the possibilities for turning it into a caper film that became an instant classic. jules dassin was penniless in paris when he discovered the city that were going to serve as the background to his film. the bad weather paid off for mr. dassin as the streets were always wet and not much had to be done to show them that way.when we first meet tony, he is playing cards. tony appears to be in bad health; he coughs all the time and sweats profusely. after losing all his money, he goes to see jo, the swede, who tells him about a possibility for a robbery at maupin & webb, the fancy jewelry store at a tony section of paris. they pass the idea through mario, who suggests cesar, the milanese, an expert safe cracker.tony, who has come out of prison recently, learns that mado, his former lover is now with grutter, a creep that owns a night club. upon confronting mado, instead of love, all he feels is contempt, and the meeting ends badly and he throws her out of his place. grutter has no love for tony, who is his natural enemy because of his connection with mado.when the day arrives, the gang is able to get to the apartment building where on the second floor, right above the jewelry store, the owner lives, but he is away. everything goes well and the gang gets away with the jewels. cesar, the milanese, a typical ladies' man, takes a ring as a souvenir, which in turn he gives the chanteuse at the grutter's night club. this tactical mistake is the spark which unravels the well thought plan.jean servais made an excellent tony. he showed a tired man who was possibly doing his last robbery. carl mohner, robert manuel and the director, jules dassin, are seen as jo, mario and cesar, the quartet jewelry thieves. marie sabouret plays mado. marcel lupovici plays grutter with a subdued intensity. robert hussein, who would go to direct movies later on, makes an impression with his remi, one of grutter's men.the film best asset is the great camera work by philippe agostini, who captured the atmosphere of paris and the locales where all these criminals operate from. georges auric's music plays well with the action in the film. jules dassin was peculiar in his choice of films that he directed, and unfortunately, that is our loss because this man was a genius as proved mainly with "the naked city", "night and the city" and "rififi".

this film is a work of pure class from start to finish, for a moment forget the famous 28 minute no dialog heist, forget that it's set in paris and forget it's noir. the film itself, the premise and the execution make this a pure gold experience.. it's sharp intelligent and thought through in great detail, just like the heist itself. it portrays real characters that are not only believable but whom you empathize with. it's a film that doesn't glamorize the notion of a robbery but shows it for what it is.. theft. it shows that a heist is hard work and ultimately not worth doing. now all things considered put on top of that a daring 28 minute sequence with not a word spoken and set in gorgeous paris with truly great attention to detail and fantastic cinematography and that last scene ...when you look up and see those trees... wonderful use of raw and basic filming techniques... it is a master piece in my view and i'm glad to have seen it.

the minutiae of what's involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all heist movies. then there's the robbery itself, a wordless, thirty minute nail-biter that has never been surpassed, followed by what is probably the cinema's most pronounced example of dishonor among thieves as things begin to spectacularly unravel, and we have what is unquestionably the greatest of all heist movies.this was a tough and unsentimental film when it first appeared in 1955 and it is just as tough and unsentimental today. (it displays some of the edgy brutality of dassin's earlier "brute force"). there isn't a flabby moment or duff performance in the entire film and dassin captures the milieu of seedy clubs and parisian back streets like no-one else and the final drive through paris by a dying man is one of the most iconic closing sequences of any movie. a classic.

or vice-versa.this is a french film noir directed by an american film maker (jules dassin) who had to leave the country because of being blacklisted by hollywood thanks to huac. the premise of the story is rather familiar--one last jewel heist for tony le stephanois and his buds--and so is the ending with everybody getting... well, no spoilers here, for sure, since this is the sort of film in which tension toward the ending is important.dassin filmed in realistic lighting in black and white on the streets of paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous. the engaging--sometimes intruding--score by georges auric nicely enhances the movie and will remind viewers of many a similar score from american film noirs from the forties and early fifties. jean servais plays the hardcore, consumptive lead in a fedora much as humphrey bogart might have played him. tony's recently out of prison, past his prime, but still tough and decisive when he has to be, his mind still sharp when focused, the kind of anti-hero whose eyes water even though the tears will never fall.dassin plays the italian safecracker and would-be ladies man who knows the rules but gets careless.in film noir we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify with the bad guys. often there are levels of bad guys, the "good" bad guys we are identifying with and the "bad" bad guys who are out to do in our good bad guys, and then maybe there's a really bad, bad bad guy or two. (here we have remi grutter, played by robert hossein, a slightly sadistic druggie.) then there are the cops who are irrelevant or nearly so. in more modern film noir the bad guys are not even "good" bad guys, and they get away with it or something close to that. in the old film noir, which evolved from the gangster films of the thirties, the usual motto, following the old hollywood "code," was "crime doesn't pay," with every criminal having to pay for his or her crime before the end of the movie.probably the most impressive feature of rififi is how nicely the film moves along. the plot unfolds quickly and seamlessly much the way the great film directors always did it, directors like stanley kubrick, louis malle, and the best of hitchcock. some have actually compared this to kubrick's the killing (1956) and suggest that kubrick stole a little. well, directors always steal if need be, and there are some perhaps telling similarities, such as it being "one last heist" for the protagonist, and having the girl gum up the works. the similarities may go deeper because as this film was nearing its end i suddenly thought, oh, no! the suitcase in the back seat is going to fly out of the convertible, hit the ground, burst open, and all the money is going to fly into the air! those of you who have seen the killing may recall what happened to the money near the end of the film! which reminds me of another film with something bad happening to the money: oliver stone's u turn (1997) starring sean penn. there the money in his backpack gets blown to smithereens by a shotgun blast. ha, ha, ha! getting the dubbed version of this film would be an act of sacrilege since the dialogue (when there is some: the heist itself is done entirely without dialogue, about 30 minutes worth) is terse and easy to follow requiring only an occasional glance at the subtitles, which, by the way, are quite utilitarian and guiding as opposed to having every word spelled out.one other thing: all the brutality is done as sex used to be done in film, that is off camera. a guy gets his throat slit. we don't see it. i kind of like this approach. we don't have to see the gore. you could almost let your kids see rififi--almost.catch this one now and be on the lookout for a hollywood reprise starring al pacino and directed by harold becker coming out next year in which you can be sure that the violent scenes will be played out in full.

after five years in prison, tony le st√©phanois (jean servais) meets his dearest friends jo (carl m√∂hner) and the italian mario ferrati (robert manuel) and they invite tony to steal a couple of jewels from the show-window of the famous jewelry mappin & webb ltd, but he declines. tony finds his former girlfriend mado (marie sabouret), who became the lover of the gangster owner of the night-club l' √¢ge d' or louis grutter (pierre grasset), and he humiliates her, beating on her back and taking her jewels. then he calls jo and mario and proposes a burglary of the safe of the jewelry. they invite the italian specialist in safes and elegant wolf cesar (perlo vita) to join their team and they plot a perfect heist. they are successful in their plan, but the d. juan cesar makes things go wrong when he gives a valuable ring to his mistress."du rififi chez les hommes" is a magnificent film-noir, certainly among the best i have seen. the screenplay has credibility, supported by an awesome direction of jules dassin, stunning performances of the cast and great cinematography. jean servais has outstanding performance in the role of a criminal with principles guided by the underworld rules. the famous long silent sequence of the heist is amazing and extremely tense and certainly among the best ones of the cinema history. i am listing this great movie in my list of favorite movies ever. my vote is ten.title (brazil): "rififi"

i see alot of movies at the cinema (103 so far this year) and i have to say that this is by far and away the best film i have seen this year, even though it was released back in 1954!i sat in awe and watched this work of genius and felt quite ashamed that i had never even heard of it before my local art house cinema decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new print. the best part of the whole movie has to be the 28 minute break in where there is no speech and no music, merely the sound of the men carrying out the heist. pure quality. although really dark in places it is lightened with the dry humour.not many films score 10 out of 10 but this does and also gets a gold star for effort!! if you ever get a chance to see this movie, please do not hesitate, it's a classic. 

rififi (jules dassin - france 1955)to me, it seems a very risky idea to attempt a hollywood-remake of jules dassin's 1955 classic rififi. planned for release in 2007, al pacino apparently is gonna play the lead, taking on the role of tony le stephanois. risky business... how they're gonna pull this off?ironically, dassin was blacklisted in hollywood and went on to try his luck in france and made this little masterpiece, aptly called by some "the grandddady of all caper- and heist movies". in my opinion, it remains a one-of-a-kind classic, beautifully filmed with one of the most memorable endings ever to be put on film. whatever one's opinion of the film.in the last couple of years rififi has become dangerously overpraised. nevertheless, this french noir-classic shouldn't be forgotten. go see it, before the remake is out there, in order to have some ammunition for comparing the two.camera obscura --- 9/10

rififi deservedly gets a lot of mention for the famous heist scene, and, indeed, that scene deserves all the credit it gets. it's a masterful piece of suspense, character interaction and photography. but rififi isn't just this one scene - every scene in the film is as masterfully put together, and as a whole, the film is not only taught with suspense, plot and character, but an adroitly told moral tale that set the scene for film noire for years to come.cinematically and technically, the heist sequence may be the most impressive scene of the film, but for me, it's the final scene that holds the most power - tony le st√©phanois's hallucinogenic drive towards redemption.

du rififi chez les hommes/rififi(1955) can on the surface be described as a french variation on john huston's seminal heist film, asphalt jungle(1950). the difference between the two films is rififi(1955) pays a little more attention in detail to the robbery sequence. also, the police aren't involved in the aftermath of the robbery in rififi as much as in asphalt jungle. in the end rififi(1955) is in my opinion a slightly better film than asphalt jungle(1950). remarkable noir picture that defines 1950s french cinema.spartacus(1960) may have been the one which broke down the infamous blacklist, but in my opinion rififi(1955) was the film that began to break apart the unbreakable hollywood blacklist. first film in five years for jules dassin who was victimized by the mccarthy communist hunt of the late 40s to early 50s. he got some sort of retribution when rififi(1955) became a success around france and europe. thus defying the poisonious hollywood blacklist in a major way that probably inspired others to do the same. rififi(1955) is the most important film of dassin's career because it not only restored his name, but also gave him a second chance at making films.jules dassin gave the filmworld and its ever growing audiences a masterpiece of influential proportions. his handling of the material is exceptional and direction of the actors is flawless. builds up tense situations with precise craftsmanship. dassin came full circle in the film noir genre by directing his best and last noir, rififi(1955). marked the end of dassin's period in filmmaking when he was involved in doing noir pictures.rififi(1955) is the number one film in an arsenal of thirty plus films for director, jules dassin. a masterpiece in acting, cinematography, directing, editing, and writing. not a film to leave your seat for one minute because there is always something memorable going on. as brilliant as anything by jean pierre melville who was a master of this type of film. masterpieces such as rififi(1955) are relatively small compared to the probably billions of films made in motion picture history.the one fascinating aspect of rififi is the precise planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes up a bulk of the 118 minute duration. the main characters plan and execute the jewel heist in the same way a film director prepares for the pre-productions, production, and post-production of a film. shows how difficult a jewel heist like in rififi(1955) is in committing and why very few would do something like it. the fact that the scene hardly contains a mess up like in other heist films turns this scene into something even greater. close as one can get to having a perfect sequence in a motion picture.lack of unnatural sound in the landmark thrity minute heist sequence puts it in a realm of absolute realism. any dialogue or/and music would ruin any suspense and tension the director is trying to create. the use of natural sound makes the heist sequence a rewarding film viewing experience. now filmmakers and producers would use dialogue and music in a scene like this because of a lack of confidence of a mainstream filmgoer's patience. sustains a level of consistency that never once lets down.maintaining a high level of suspense is what makes the heist sequence tick to perfection. the director achieves suspense in the heist sequence that's rarely equaled in most robbery scenes from heist films. jean servais and the rest of the main actors contribute to the suspense with some low key acting. getting suspense put in a scene is a task few are capable of doing. the robbery sequence of rififi(1955) reaches a hitchcockian level of suspense and tension.many filmmakers from the years following du rififi chez les hommes(1955) have been influenced if not inspired by it. one filmmaker influenced was jean pierre melville(original choice for director of rififi)who used variations of the heist sequence in le doulos(1961), and le cercle rouge(1970). another filmmaker influenced was stanley kubrick who made a similarly themed film in the killing(1956). also, quentin tarantino whose debut feature reservoir dogs(1992) was inspired by this film. other film directors influenced are john woo, michael mann, paul schrader, ringo lam, etc...du rififi chez les hommes(1955) is comparable to bob le flambeur(1955) in many ways. one, jules dassin and jean pierre melville directed groundbreaking films in rififi(1955) and bob le flambeur(1955). two, each film involves an aging criminal who plans and carries out a daring heist. three, bob le flambeur and rififi finishes in fatalistic fashion. four, each film shares many motifs and situations that classify the two as film greats.part of rififi's charm are the colorful characters that surround the story such as tony le stephanois, jo le suedois, mario farrati, and cesar le milanais. most of the violence is implicit yet effectively brutal. the main characters led by tony le stephanois abide by a strong outdated code of honor that is remindful of sam peckinpah and john woo. jean servais becomes the role of tony le stephanois with his cynical outlook and tired looks. du rififi chez les hommes/rififi(1955) became a favorite of mine the moment i saw it on the big screen from beginning to end.

in this election year, where so much idealism is attached to one of the candidates, it is poignant to watch a film that warns us not to make an idol out of anyone running for public office.luke eberl is the writer and director of "choose connor". there are significant parts of the film that reveal that he is a 'genius' when it comes to telling stories via the cinema.go see this movie before the election and then ponder why and for whom you will cast your vote.let you eyes be opened like those of the young protagonist.a mix of "citizen kane", "advise and consent" and "paths of glory" by a young director as talented as those who made the films listed above.

the plot line is an expose of the under belly of american politics. while the theme seems common, what "makes" the movie is the unconventional way the story is told.the characters are played with conviction. you feel the innocence of the lead, and his innocence lost. the politician is the prince of double-talk, a real snake.the camera work is impressive. it affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue. ditto for the music.the story uses a parable-style with vingettes where the message is filled with double-entendres. a very canny strategy by the writer/director. the tension in the storyline is carried through to the last scenes.the movie was like a good mystery book. something was "afoot"; you knew it was bad; you didn't know exactly what it could be - you had your suspicions; and when the evil was revealed you let out your breath you hadn't noticed you were holding in. saddened, shaking your head.a story well written and well told. 3 cheers to a young writer/director.

i'm not sure whether i like this film or not. i think it is creepy and completely weird.crispin glover as always gave a great performance as layne. i think his performance was really good and one of his best, but i don't like the character at all. keanu reeves performance was really good, and i truly felt for his character. over all i think the whole cast gave great performances as felt like the characters were real. i disliked some, but genuinely felt sorry for others (keanu reeves). i would like to know if that was the original ending that the film was supposed to have as it didn't end how i expected it to. i was disappointed in the ending and i don't feel that it did the rest of the film justice. if you are into creepy, weird and really well different movies, go for this one. if you like things that are normal, please stay away.

imdb forces reviewers to type a certain amount of lines, but all i really want to say is -- "this is an incredible film, and you can't consider yourself a film fan without having seen it." you ought to just trust me on this one and stop reading this review and get the movie and push play. but i have to type something. so, let me point out the following: (1) river's edge contains what still may well rank as crispin glover's all-time funniest and best performance in a film, and if you have been following crispin glover at all, you know that that alone justifies giving it a 10. funny lines galore.(2) river's edge contains the second-most memorable performance of dennis hopper's career (other than the one in blue velvet), and it is really excellent. dennis hopper is really funny.(3) river's edge contains the best performance of keanu reeves' career, and it is excellent. it was the role he was born to play. he has plenty of good lines, but one in particular is really really funny. listen close when his character and the step-dad are talking to one another.still the best stoner film, it is much more than just that. it tends to show up in the drama sections of film-rental stores, but if this is a drama, it's the funniest drama of all time.

i really don't have any complaints about this movie, except for the disturbing scenes with the body. i fell upon it while switching around the tv one night. the acting was actually amazing, i didn't expect it to be better than it appeared! i thought keanu's(who looks the same since 1986, which is a very good thing hehe) acting was really *great*, and crispin played his character perfectly! this movie is a hidden gem! its a fresh awaking of reality to the '80s, compared to the other teen movies done by the brat pack(even though i do like those moives alot too). all in all, i give it thumbs up!

after reading some of these reviews, it is apparent that some have missed the point. what is great about this film (here comes the point), what is incredible about this film, what is astonishing about this film is that there is no proselytizing. there is no preaching. there is no preaching. there is no preaching. life goes on. it is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for its collective self. these are just kids doing what kids do - without consciousness. we all went to school with kids like these. we are being numbed by fiction-/movie-/tv-/news-based reality/invention.feck's (dennis hopper the great) girlfriend alone and his relationship with her is worth the price of renting this movie.there have been few movies before or since that measure up to the intelligence of this film. amen.

i hope the writer, director, editor, and composer (and let's not forget producer) read this... because their work was truly incredible on this movie. let me start by saying that i am in no way affiliated with this movie. i am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times.every second of this movie is touching. every scene is classic. the acting is real. the movie is honest. you can relate to these characters as people, not actors.this tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives. the story is carefully thought out and every sub-plot is intertwined and woven together, culminating in a message that leaves us pondering the values of right and wrong that each of us carries inside.crispen glover, daniel roebuck, dennis hopper, and joshua john miller (as a 12 year old boy) give absolutely amazing, real performances. i've seen this movie about 8 or more times and i still get so absorbed in their performances that i forget i am watching a movie. it's that good. great job everyone who worked on this. great job.the music is also wonderfully matched and haunting. with the chosen cast, the carefully timed editing and pacing, the mood and tone, and even the subject matter, the director made some of the best decisions for a movie i've ever seen.this movie is real. it's honest. it's a true movie experience which i will never forget. you may not be into the subject matter but it is something you cannot ignore. ultimately, it's about people being people... and everyone can relate to that. i recommend this movie to fans of drama, suspense, and horror above almost every other film.

i can remember a college professor commenting as to how disturbing this film was, reflecting the apathy of adolescents (this was before generation "x").in a way, most of us are products of the same consumer culture; these high school kids spend their time drinking, getting high and wondering what to do about the body left on a riverbank.what would they do today? would things be different?. some very important questions. there are some excellent scenes with keanu reeves, and the dysfunctional family he lives with; his 11 year old brother going out to get wasted; the mother has no idea what to do- spends her time drinking with her boyfriend.this film was a bit before its time in that it addresses the problems in lower class american society; these kids had no outlet; what is available for them in this dirt-water town? . all in all a few interesting social commentaries are presented, and there are no solutions. 9/10.

i have seen this movie a number of times and find it very compelling and sad. the lack of real emotion from most of the characters is very disturbing. they seem empty, hopeless. the story is based on a real event.a teenage girl is murdered by her boyfriend for no obvious reason - apparently he just felt like it. then he boasts about it to his friends and as they don't believe him he takes them to view the body - a number of times. no one reports the murder. there are two strong leads - keanu reeves and crispen glover - crispen glovers character is seriously annoying.keanu's character matt appears to be the only one who has a sense of right and wrong. this is keanu at his best - a flawless performance and very believable - anyone who thinks this man can't act should watch this movie. matt's little brother is almost the most disturbing character in the movie. only twelve and no compassion or love factor in his life. it is very sad to think there are kids out there like this. it really makes you grateful for what you have. 9/10.

river's edge is an excellent film and it's a shame that it hasn't made more of a mark for itself in cinematic history. there were a number of gritty films based around school kids made in the eighties, but of all the ones i've seen; this is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing. the film takes a storyline that is disturbing in its own right and adds the theme of teenage slackers and their uncaring attitude about things, which takes the story onto another level. the film works because the central story is interesting and it's played out by complex characters. the film begins with a murder. we then follow the murderer, nicknamed john, as he goes back to school and tells all his friends about what he has done. rather than give the expected reaction, most of them hardly react at all and the strongest reaction that the murderer gets comes from layne; who makes it his number one priority to help john clear up the mess he's in and get him out of it. the other friends mull over the crime, and before long one of them goes to the police...river's edge features a host of great performances from its young cast. keanu reeves has a reputation for wooden acting, and for good reason; but he fits in very well to this early role and this performance is easily one of his best. crispin glover is the biggest standout as the slightly insane layne. glover always stands out in every film he's in, and while he does go over the top a little bit; he convinces well as the lead in this movie. reeves and glover receive good support from a talented young cast that includes daniel roebuck and joshua john miller, as well as the great dennis hopper in another wild role. the film features a very gritty picture which bodes well with its nihilistic tone. the central characters are all of the 'slacker/stoner' generation and the way that they genuinely don't seem to care about the murder of their friend is more shocking than the murder itself; and the point that the film tries to make about modern society is both strong and well defined. the film is also rather funny, owing to some of the characters' lines; but the humour is pitch black and clearly this film was never meant to be a comedy. overall, this is an excellent and memorable film that is definitely worth seeing!

less than zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they actually stuck to the damn book. but, where they hadn't, this movie presents does the job, and leaves you with the creepiest feeling when its all over in ways not done until the late nineties with larry clark's movies 'kids' and 'bully.' societal outcast teens are faced with a rather curious dilemma (they don't treat it much like one) when their estranged friend (daniel roebuck) boasts to them that he killed a teenage girl near the river's edge in their suburban town. keanu reeves may be the only civilized character among the bunch, the only one willing to exhibit any sort of conscience, anyway, while the others either don't do anything about the girl's death or want to help their friend hide the body. i don't know who is more sick in this film--crispin glover--who becomes nearly obsessed and quite paternal in trying to protect the friend and hide the crime by smuggling him out of the state. dennis hopper, an on-edge drug dealer (who clings to a female blowup doll) that befriends the teens (as a dealer, of course) and suddenly becomes involved in the events. or, josh miller, who plays reeve's little brother, tim. he appears to be the most apathetic of them all, at least until his emotional breakdown at the end. it is definitely not peppy 80s teen fare, obviously. and certainly makes the point strikingly clear about the serious detachment these kids deal with (despite a bizarre series of events) thanks to many great performances all around (even reeves proved some acting capability).help yourself to a comedy to recover if it rocks you too hard.

i just saw this movie for the second time. i first saw it back in the mid-90's as a vanguard video selection. it has retained it power.it is interesting from several aspects. one is that it is based on a true story. two is it is a launching pad for two interesting actors: keanu reeves and crispin glover. and three, it has dennis hopper in one of his better social misfit/psychotic character roles.the movie is also a study in the way people act in different settings. you have characters in one-on-one, family, peer group, school, general society settings, etc. the story does well in demonstrating how a person will act in each setting.i wish i could find the details of the actual murder to compare to the movie. i saw a short bit that indicated it occurred in california and that several schoolmates were taken to view the corpse. this is a good choice for a rainy night video rental. be prepared to feel unsettled at the end.

this film is one of the best of 1986 with creepy, yet intriguing performances from crispin glover and dennis hopper! the reagan years were pretty bleak for a lot of people, not just teenagers, but this flick really captured the desperation and despair. well-directed with great script (apparently based on a true story), i don't really see any weaknesses in this. the opening shot was brilliant.keanu reeves was decent for a change and miss skye was right on the money. hopper had three other great performances that same year (blue velvet, texas chainsaw ii, and hoosiers). i imagine this has a cult following and i wonder how this picture would fare if it was re-released. super stuff!

one of the better movies to come out of the 1980's, this based-on-fact movie tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend, leaves her naked body on a river bank, and brags about it later to his friends. what is just as bad is their inability to feel anything about it.disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic kids who have no respect for their parents or any sort of authority, who seem almost doomed to live lives of rebellion and recklessness. this drama hits hard and is impossible to forget. the young cast does a creditable job - even keanu reeves, in one of his earliest roles, is better than usual. of course, there's no reason for the character of layne (crispin glover) to be as crazed and off-the-wall as he is, but that's just glover being himself. veteran dennis hopper has an especially good role as a loner who despite his own sordid past is saddened by the attitudes of this group of kids. i would like to point out the chilling performance by daniel roebuck as the young murderer; he's an under-rated actor and aside from hopper, his is probably the best performance in the film.i saw "river's edge" for the first time a long time ago when it first started being shown on cable tv movie channels; however, i didn't catch all of it; i saw it in its entirety for the first time a number of years later, and now i've seen it again for what is probably the definitive time.some potently affecting moments include madeleine's (constance forslund) breakdown where she wails that maybe she should leave her children just like their worthless father did. i also liked the scenes where matt (reeves) faces off with his disturbed younger brother (joshua miller) and when the teacher, mr. burkewaite (jim metzler) deplores the fact that the girl has died and that none of his students seem to care.i will never forget this film, not as long as i live. it's too saddening for that.10/10

river's edge is not a pleasant film to watch but it is an incredible one. having viewed it many years ago i truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be re released or remade or something. perhaps no movie ever made has captured the essense of young suburban inertia like this distrubing frightening movie. given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing. very well acted and just unpleasant at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a truely important film. should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all highschools. fantastic.

this is actually the first movie i ever saw in a theatre , where the people didn't leave immediately when the end credits started. in stead they remained seated for a few minutes , gaping with their mouths open staring in the infinite , trying to understand what they 've just seen.the only thing i can say: try to go watch this movie with as little knowledge about it as possible (so did i)!. i gave it a 10

fair and nifty little science fiction/horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer, allegra geller (jennifer jason leigh) whose latest game - "existenz" not only draws the attention of people who volunteer to try the game, but one who nearly kills her (and her game, too). since she forced to stay out of sight, allegra is stuck with ted pikul (jude law), a marketing trainee ("p.r. nerd") to be her bodyguard even though he only has a gun that's made out of flesh and bone and the bullets are teeth. director david cronenberg has, well, used some bits from his earlier films ("videodrome", "scanners", "the fly", etc.) and placed it into certain parts of the story with some good timing. law and leigh are fine here and so are some of the supporting cast (ian holm, willem dafoe, sarah polley, christopher eccelston, and so on) that has an international twist to it. dafoe is anything but devilish as gas, a deceiving garage mechanic. one of the movie's best scenes is witnessing ted eat (fish and frogs) and construct a gun and admit to allegra - " i can't help myself." "existenz" manages to show that he (cronenberg) is up to his old tricks and it still works like a charm.

this was a movie i came across by accident. i was flipping through and saw it was on showtime so i watched it. now i watch it at least once a month. this is a movie that is filled with symbols that might cause some people to trash it. don't listen to people that hate this movie, if they want an action movie with expensive f/x they should have rented a movie that promises them. if you are in the mood for a good sci-fi, i highly recommend. if purchasing on dvd i recommend the alliance atlantic edition of the film, it contains many more extras than the dimension films edition.

i have seen this movie twice and it's theme is an invigorating one. i have been into computers for many years now and this movie inspired me in a technologically sense as does a fresh love which stoked the furnace of my poetic passion in the heat of infatuation. very original idea,great allurement in the way it holds you as it tells it's story to minds that need a release from the every day realities of this life.

david cronenberg movies are easily identifiable, or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks. fetishism, the blurring between the organic and inorganic, squishy throbbing things that shouldn't be squishy and throbbing. "existenz" is classic cronenberg. briefly, it's about a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, visuals are supplied by your mind. the game plugs directly into a 'bio port' in the base of your spine and while the game is running, the player can't tell reality from game. jennifer jason leigh plays the game's developer, guiding a novitiate marketeer, jude law, through the game's paces. while in the game they uncover strange goings-on and possible crimes. but are they real, or is it the game? not even the game's author knows. the movie is quite a treat, keeping the viewer engaged, but in the dark until the final minutes. another thing i like about "existenz" is that it doesn't use a heavy reliance on special effects, it's the story itself that propels the movie. recommended for the saturday night when science fiction is called for.

the movie existenz is about a futuristic video game on a "pod" system that is almost like virtual reality. the only copy of the video game is damaged when an assassination attempt is made on the designer (jennifer jason leigh). unless it can be repaired, the many years and 38 million dollars spent on the development will all go to waste. the only way to repair the game however, is to actually go in the game with the only person she feels she can trust(jude law). this movie was pretty good, but doesn't really pick up until very late in the film. the best thing about this film were the twists toward the end. definitely worth seeing. 7/10

i loved this movie but then again i am a big cronenberg fan. if you have not seen a david cronenberg film then this is not a good place to start. scanners, the fly, rabid would be a place to start and then work up to videodrome before checking this one out. this is certainly one of his best and takes the interactive game phenomena one step beyond.in this game the players plug a bio-engineered game pad through a jack inserted into their spinal cord and get into the game directly through their nervous system. it is very hard to tell you more without giving away the story and the plot but it is enough to say that this is a game you will not forget. it is full of cronenberg's slimy body works, dark foreboding scenery all populated by a great cast including jennifer jason leigh, jude law and willem dafoe who take the situation they find themselves in very seriously. these people will do what they can to figure out the game and then to win at it. like other movies of his there is no shortage of imagination or parts where you sink to the seat but like an auto-accident you don't look away. if you liked any of the movies mentioned above then by all means go out and get this one.

yes, i have noticed that there are 347 other comments, i think that is a good sign for a movie, even if some are negative. i have seen this movie 2 and a half times. i adore it and would watch it again. it is very smart, but i can understand why some people would hate it. they don't get it's appeal. yes, i have a weird taste in movies, but this is a great movie. some of the lines are just so quick, like the whole scene in the chinese restaurant. i started dying laughing. that and when he was in the assembly line talking to the contact. jude law was wonderful, though it was humorous, him trying to cover up his wonderful accent. anyways, i do not consider myself the movie goddess as some critics of this movie and if you have nothing better to do than write pseudo-intellectual movie commentaries about films you hate online, i feel sorry for you. why don't you write about movies you like, like me. i just love how everything ties together, it keeps you guessing, even though you guess wrong. the ending was interesting, and not overdone. it was purely clever. i would not compare it to the matrix, because i think people then get the wrong idea. i went into this movie expecting nothing except jude law and a sci-fi. i was blown away. i have no clue about any other of cronenburg's films, but love this on its own merit. another clever thing was the foreshadowing with the dog. definitely watch this movie.

this was a great movie, i would compare it to the movie the game. you get to the end of the flick and cant move... your brain has been removed and shaken (not stirred) and put back in your head. dont plan anything after this movie, you will need time to think about what just happened.dont come to this movie expecting the matrix style multi millions spent on special effects, this movies special effects come from the actors, they keep you involved, no, they suck you in and dont let go for the entire duration of the movie. great acting, great plot... very enjoyable film, i cant say enough. also very original plot, plenty of twists and ideas that i would have never thought of. the ending is abrupt and leaves you hanging wondering, was that real? is this really the end? good ending, not saying that it is bad... just leaves you wondering, and a little frazzled.great movie for those who like action, like a good plot (dont get up for a bathroom break on this movie, you will come back lost) and like mind games, because thats exactly in a nutshell what this is.

rock star is a well-told hollywood-style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how ripper became rob halford's replacement for judas priest. mark wahlberg poured on his likable boy-ish charm and performed with believable admirably, something he has been known to do since the release of boogie nights.stephen herek, no stranger to musically-themed movies, takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species, the hair-metal rock god. wahlberg's "izzy" acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true. his likable character quickly wins over the heart of the viewer, who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the metal "goat horn" hand-sign several times over.the only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast, namely the other members of the band, were not fleshed out, or even introduced, properly. more interaction with these life-long rock musicians would have amplified and solidified izzy's new surroundings. naturally, rock star is filled with great music. rabin's score, the steel dragon's original work and plenty of 80's-style metal hits makes this soundtrack a must-have! let's all hope that films like rock star not only give a credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation but also spark a very-needed revival.

rock star / (2001) *** (out of four)by blake french:	"rock star" is the story of a nobody who becomes propelled into fame, only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it. we have seen all this before (in better movies), but this human story does capture the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge. it garners a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere. the script, by "crazy/beautiful" director john stockwell, portrays the hard-core universe with memorable images-it doesn't explain what it is about, it shows us.	"rock star," originally titled "metal god," stars mark wahlberg as chris "izzy" cole, a pittsburgh office supplies salesperson who dreams of becoming bobby beers, the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group, steel dragon. although chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called blood pollution, instead of writing his own songs, he insists on performing only those by steel dragon, and only in the exact way they perform them. his group becomes irritated with chris' obsessions and gives him the boot.	this devastates chris, as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend, emily (jennifer aniston from tv's "friends"). he then receives a phone call. it's the steel dragon band. they have seen chris' tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer. in an instant, chris rockets into the dizzying world of sudden stardom-from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. unfortunately, it's not as rewarding as he expected.	a true story inspired the "rock star" concept. an ohio supply salesman, tim "ripper" owens, really did replace rob halford, the lead singer in judas priest, after initially singing for a tribute band. the rest of the film is probably fiction, although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands. the film details the various ordeals of being a rock star. it explores the aspects of touring, personality differences, the danger of drug abuse and violence, struggling relationships, sexual freedom, dishonesty, and the extreme measures of the producers all to please the fans and keep popularity high. i have seen all of mark wahlberg's movies, and this is the first that has earned my affection. wahlberg, a former singer/model, has made movies like "fear," "boogie nights" "three kings," and most recently tim burton's lacking remake "planet of the apes." i am starting to admire the young actor more and more. although he has not performed in many successful films, he has taken many chances, and done a variety of roles. "rock star" is his best film to date. i can't think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed chris cole's struggles and aspirations. wahlberg truly makes "rock star" rock. jennifer aniston lights up the screen as well. she creates a chemistry-rich relationship with chris that induces audience participation. it's tragic of what happens to their relationship. we care about these characters a great deal. during the film concert scenes, director stephen herek (who also directed "holy man" and the live action version of "101 dalmatians") creates a gripping atmosphere. he captures the scenes with an intense urgency, and a raw, unmistakable energy. the musical numbers provide the film with the best, most involving scenes. unfortunately herek cannot sustain the energy and zest throughout. at the three-quarters mark, he looses the spark as the movie becomes dull and unpleasant. i understand where the story needs to go in order to portray the negative side of fame, but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it. in "almost famous," a much better film about rock and roll, there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most sorrowful scenes. here, it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion.the message comes a bit too late and suddenly in the story. the film turns into a morality tale that wants to provide us with a sappy destination. the filmmakers might as well stop everything, appear on screen and say: "now audience, the moral of the story is¬Ö" we understand the theme, but it's too instantaneous. the personal discovery for chris' must be gradual.fortunately, all of this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the film, hardly enough to completely destroy an entire eighty-five minutes of a reasonably good feature. "rock star" is not a great movie-see "almost famous" if you want a remarkable film about rock and roll-but for marky mark, it's a turning point in his career. 

surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. but the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clich√©s in the final act. i enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball "almost famous". it has a nice, bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish might've made it more memorable. **1/2 from ****

i'm an action movie fan but until today i've never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in italy, so i went to see "the long kiss goodnight" on pay-tv hoping for nothing special.but, what a surprise! this movie is great! the only problem i found is the presence of some holes in the plot, but the rest is the most entertaining, intriguing and funny action movie ever made.the transformation of samantha/charly from ordinary wife-teacher to cool-blooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea. the action scenes and the stunts are the best i've ever seen. samuel l. jackson adds some of the best lines i have ever heard and his chemistry with geena davis is good.and what about geena? she is wonderful, she plays the best action heroine ever seen and does strong, convincing acting and fantastic stunts.so i think this movie had weak performances at box office and bad critics because most reviewers and some kind of public have a hard time with strong female lead roles.9/10.

this is one of the best action films i have seen. geena's portrayal of the tough as nails, 'charly'/gentle mother 'sam', was superb and samuel l jackson just keeps you laughing all the way through, with his classic one liners. sure, there were a few holes in the actual story, but this fast-paced flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end.i felt geena was a perfect choice for the role of sam/charly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as the mother in the recent movie 'stuart little'. both samuel and geena were well supported by david morse, brian cox, sweet little yvonne zima and newcomers, sexy craig bierko, and melina kanakaredes. this film accentuates the growing trend of strong female character and the diversion away from traditional male/female stereotypes as we see sam/charly (davis) and mitch (jackson) hurtling from one disaster to the next.while i and many others loved this movie, it is fair to say that there will always be people that don't and that's fine - each, to their own. i highly recommend this film to action fans, for its hilarious scenes and fast-paced action.

terrific movie: if you did not watch yet, you must watch. geena davis and samuel l. jackson are amazing in this movie.great actors + good story + incredible action scenes > "the long kiss goodnight" i give it a 10, a+, 4 stars.

spoilers in this reviewthe long kiss goodnight is yet another prime example of a common affliction of many modern films; it starts off on a very interesting concept - a trained assassin whose memory was erased regains consciousness of herself - and the initial setup is engaging but then it seems the writers don't know very well where to go next and the whole thing trails off down increasingly confusing and/or inane paths, leaving the disappointing taste of something that was ok but promised to be a lot better. the baddies are remarkably unremarkable, and even jackson's comic sidekick turn seems more like something from his pre-pulp fiction days; it looks like harlin, as in cutthroat island, made every effort so that no-one would upstage his then wife. her character is by far the best of the film and this fact only makes you feel even more frustrated that they weren't able to do something better with it.however, there is still something about this film which for me sets it apart from the run-of-the-mill hollywood actioner and places it above average, if only just. it is something very subtle i can't quite put my finger on; it's a disturbing, cold, dark, even sickly edge, a nightmarish and unreal feel, a decadent air, a mean streak, which keeps cropping up in various ways. it's in the dark reddish photography and almost permanent night the characters dwell in, it's in samantha's dreams in front of the mirror, it's in her vicious eyes and smile whenever she's about to kill a man or when she announces how she will enjoy watching her nemesis die with her daughter listening, it's in mitch's comeback at the wheel of a car while he is spurting so much blood from his mouth he can hardly speak... i don't know, it's an atmosphere, something i can't define but which gives me the creeps (a bit) and which makes this film still oddly intriguing for me.

almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. geena davis is a schoolteacher housewife who suffers from amnesia. she'e even on the pta! but then an auto accident awakens the woman she used to be, and it's hot! samuel l. jackson is hilarious as the low rent private eye who tries to help davis find her past, only to find out he's in way over his head. davis has some hilarious lines too, and the interaction between her and jackson works surprisingly well.look for brian cox, the original hannibal lechter, and david moorse finally managing to shed his st. elsewhere tv image. the film is directed by davis' husband, who almost seems to have built the whole film around her, but it works.i pull out this dvd and rewatch it often. i still love the makeup scene. is geena hot or what?

i was happy to find out that at least now this movie is beginning to get the appreciation it deserves (just view those votes). not top-class action like "die hard" or "lethal weapon", but still something like a solid 7 out of 10: fine script, good actors with working chemistry, and a director who knows what he wants (sadly, this was director harlin's last good film. "deep blue sea" managed to reach 'an ok rollercoaster-ride'- status, but "cutthroat island, and especially, "driven" are well-deserved flops!) personally i think the turn-off at the box-office might have been the "woman as an action star"-theme. well, give her a chance, because davis does deliver a performance above par. and, after all, this film doesn't concentrate so much on the "feminine"-side, but instead on good ol' action, buddyism (jackson as a sidekick is given a lot of room in here, plus his share of action- and about a thousand killer wisecracks!) and on the plot (from shane black, the writer of "lethal weapon" and "the last boy scout". the latter of which as a movie is on very many levels much like this one...the theme, the clever plot, also as good and as underrated!) overall: if one hasn't seen this one yet, don't forget to rent it for the next quiet saturday night!

i love this film...! i've seen it 1000 x on dvd and i cant say enough about it. it has it all, comedy, awesome action and incredible stunts/fx. samuel jackson steals the show here big time. i dont think there isnt a moment that he's in that he isnt funny! "everyone knows that when you make an assumption, you make an ass out of you and umption"!! the f/x are great! the bridge/truck explosion is incredible, although the sound isnt all that great!when samuel drives out of the truck, the sound is off a little i think and what he says is priceless!!! for those of you who own it on dvd, put the audio in french!!! it's halarious!!! even emotional moments are great when the bad guy discovers that sam's/charlie's daughter is his, is great... this is a great film that no action fan can do without... i also reccomend cutthroat island... aside from all the negative publicity, it kicks!!!!

not a box office success; no-one really knows why. it may have failed simply because of its title. it looks as though you need a two-word tough-guy title to attract a sufficient proportion of the idiot crowd - "die hard", "lethal weapon", "hard weapon", "die lethal", etc. - talking about "the long kiss goodnight" will get you nowhere. but for once renny harlin has made a good action movie. a large part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character, samantha, earns our affection and interest early on. as she becomes charly again, we're torn: we certainly want charly to thwart the bad guys, and all that; but we don't want her to lose touch with samantha in order to do so - even though we like charly, too. geena davis bestows all of her considerable charm on both halves of the central character. samuel l. jackson plays second fiddle for a change. it turns out he's good at it. that was a compliment.intelligent, far superior to anything in the "die hard" series - if i were more cynical i'd add, "it's not surprising that it didn't do well", but i don't really feel that way; it is surprising that it didn't do well.

definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over-think their movies. lots of action, lots of great dialogue (e.g. fun to quote), a little intrigue, and stuff blowing up all over the place. samuel l jackson and geena davis had great chemistry. violent, but not gory. the fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turn-about.have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every 3 or 4 months. i initially rented the movie because samuel l jackson was in the film, but was caught up in the events surrounding samantha's quest to regain her memory and have never looked back.all you cerebral folks out there -- suspend disbelief for once, take yourself a little less seriously -- you might actually enjoy yourselves!

this is by far my favorite action movie. but what makes it work is not the elaborate renny harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups. it's the shane black script and its deft delivery by geena davis and samuel l. jackson.the chemistry between the two principals merited a sequel. thank god it was never made. too much danger of marring the original.'the long kiss' checkerboards from quotable scene to action scene to quotable scene and back again. never a dull moment. this has to be jackson's funniest role ever, and the amazing thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career. no quirky tarantino hit-man, super-cool shaft, or borderline psycho soldier. in tlkg, jackson is the everyman we identify with. the poor schmuck gets dragged along on this crazy woman's odyssey to uncover the dangerous secret of her past.though the story claims that davis's character, samantha caine is suffering from amnesia, the writer and director treat her condition as if it were a multiple personality disorder.samantha caine is not just a new identity taken by the amnesiac charly baltimore -- she is a separate, fully-developed personality. the traumas suffered by samantha in the first half-hour of the movie help the submerged dissociate personality of charly to emerge again.the materials of her past life excavated by jackson's detective mitch henessey facilitate charly's resurfacing. good timing, too, considering the target samantha makes of herself.but charly has to fight herself to remain the dominant personality. one gathers from bits of dialogue that the warrior personality (charly) developed after her father died and she was recruited by the "chapter".in the eight years charly was buried in the psyche, though, her samantha identity developed into the dominant personality. (she's even funnier that charly.) this was probably due to becoming a mother, because it's the reunion with her daughter that breaks charly's struggle to suppress samantha, leading to their apparent integration by movie's end.it's impossible to choose a "best quote" from this film:"now you're a sharpshooter?""i saved your ass. it was great!""continue dying. out.""i sock 'em in the jaw and yell 'pop goes the weasel'".and a couple of dozen more, many too raunchy to quote here.geena davis looks great, and comes off as an action hero without glossing over the fact she's turning forty. (listen to charley's history, do the math).fantastic soundtrack, too. santana, muddy waters, elvis, labelle, marvin gaye. i give 'the long kiss goodnight' a 9, only because i don't believe in a perfect 10. seen it a dozen times, and it still stays fresh. nice twisted holiday flick to place on your shelf next to 'it's a wonderful life.'

though this is a good, enjoyable cartoon, they did much better ones later on, like carrotblanca. this is almost like the first star trek feature, which would have been welcomed with open arms and glee no matter what, just for existing. this is really a patchwork of old bits with some nice touches, but nothing special. reminds me a bit of the hunting trilogy in spots and the ending is priceless. available and certainly well worth watching just for the novelty and the good bits. recommended.

black scorpion is roger cormen's batman. which is cool and there is a lot of cool stuff in this movie. like the breathtaker being a cross between doctor doom and darth vader, that's kind of cool. the mind control gas in the inhalers was worthy of the mad hatter. the cormen b-movie style is all over this puppy which is not always a good thing. there are plenty of stunts and hot babes to make any action fan happy. this movie, the good out weighs the bad. but if you aren't one for comic book movies, then i would advise not watching black scorpion, however if you like comic book like movies and don't care if it was ever a comic before. then check out black scorpion, as for me i give it 8 stars.

i'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (i'm not counting super bug budget, no storyline batman's either)a couple of my favorites are the phantom and a budget movie called the demolitionist. the black scorpion can be added to that collection.if you've seen the demolitionist then get this movie. it's basically a copy of that heroine. (it even stars the same guy in both movies)if you haven't, then let me explain...a cop's father is murdered and she seeks vengeance. she laces up the black outfit (a sexy catwomanish, skimpy outfit that looks absolutely great on joan severance) and goes out to kick some booty.it's a fun, action packed movie, mind you, you may not wish the kids to see it...without screening it first to see if you approve of the pretty graphic sex scene severance has in it. which in my opinion, was a bonus (alright, give it an extra star <grin>)

black scorpion is a fun flick about a groovy female super heroine who wears leather tights and drives a car that can morph into her snazzy armored scorpion mobile. she battles the evil breathtaker and all of this is an excellent recipe for a good time imho. i loved the bit about her having to say "yo" to get the car's computer to take orders! breathtaker is so evil he wants to give the entire city asthma! it's all so over the top and that's the beauty of it! the scene where black scorpion "attacks" her partner steals the show. you'll know it when you see it. this dvd also has a fun interview with joan severance. she's a doll. black scorpion is a fun dvd. loved it!

this movie will not be considered for an academy award, but if you enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and just wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety mins it is not a disappointment. you'll enjoy a send up of darth vader for the villain (the breather), a female batman for the heroine (but much cuter with much less costume), and a running joke that involves cigarettes and the police captain that's very funny. not by any means a great cinematic achievement. but if you enjoy campy fun it was worth a viewing. god help me, i liked it.

this movie was better than i expected. i don't think it deserved an r rating, though. i've seen pg-13 films with worse language and violence. i found this movie entertaining and i enjoyed it. if you're a person who dissects everything, you might find a lot wrong with it, but if you take it for its face value, i think you'll find it entertaining.

i was a guest at the sept. 30th screening of eddie monroe and was pleasantly surprised with the story, the great acting and the talented directing. i found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film. powerful performances by vario, (uncle benny), sara, (jessica tsunis), and morris, (eddie monroe). the supporting cast was chock full of colorful and amusing characters. this film reminds me of one of those movies that you will look back on in 20 years and discover that it launched many actors into stardom. much like "the outsiders" where tom cruise, emilio estavez, patrick swazey, ralph macchio, and others can be found. look out hollywood, there are new stars out on the horizon and they can be discovered in a little long island, independent film called, "eddie monroe." great job!

ramin bahrani sets up a scene early on in chop shop that immediately had me identifying with where the character of ale (alejandro polanco) and his friend were coming from. the two of them get on a subway, and as soon as the doors close they ask if they could have everyone's attention for a moment, and that they are selling candy bars or m&m's or something, and then they proceed to sell some bars. if you (as i) have ever been on a subway in new york city, at any time, this is the kind of situation that happens so often you almost don't notice it. often the people on a subway will see kids like these or minorities selling something or announcing and talking about something on a subway and not pay them any mind. bahrani's focus isn't necessarily just on kids who hock things for sale on subway rides, but on survival and the state of being one is in when in the lower class in america. it is, subsequently in his hands, thoughtful and heartbreaking, usually at once.to compare it to pixote or the bicycle thief isn't too far of a leap (actually in the latter at least the father and son have each other), though bahrani is specific in his intentions in his documentary style. we care about this character ali, no older than eleven and working in a car shop cleaning some cars and helping take apart others, and his sister who comes from out of town to stay with him. but it's not simply because we're force-fed any clich√©s, aside from, you know, a brother and sister (more-so the brother) trying to take care of one another. bahrani makes the story accessible through the simple aspiration ali has, the kind of goal that is possible attainable in his situation: saving up enough to buy a used food truck that ali and isamar can operate themselves.it's all ali is working for, but what bahrani shows us in brutal detail is this work, what ali has to do to make it happen even if its distasteful things like ripping hubcaps off of tires from cars in shea stadium or, at one point, stealing a purse in a desperate moment. this makes it all the more serious an issue when ale sees what his sister does for money on the side at night, doing sexual favors for men in an abandoned truck on the side of the road. he doesn't mention it and pushes it aside, but its always something that adds to the tension, something ale wants to protect his sister from. it adds to the tragedy when ale finds out the real cost of what it will take to make the food truck into a profit-maker, a cost that just further adds to the anguish that he just internalizes.one could look immediately at the fact that ale is an orphan in such a neighborhood as the one in the area of queens the film was shot in- naturally, as with a work of neo-neo realism (lets just call it realism), featuring practically all non-professional actors in the parts of the mechanics and workers and people on the streets- but bahrani is focused more-so on the here and the now, and that is what makes chop shop so immediate and heartfelt. not a trace of melodrama is in the film, barely even music accompaniment aside from the live latino music coming from the cars and radios. sometimes bahrani will focus on a very subtle moment that makes it pronounced in further scenes, like the way ale is awake but acts like he's asleep the first night after he witnesses isamar's late-night tryst, and we see as she slinks into bed she probably knows he's awake but neither can say a word. or, in a lot of other scenes, poetic touches that seem seamless, like when the man shows ale how feeding the pigeons work.it's rough and gritty, as you can expect, and it doesn't give much hope for its main characters despite the few moments of happiness sprinkled about. it's also a superbly shot hand-held film, where the technique, as with a lot of movies made in its urban-set tone and approach, informs and compliment the subjects on screen and what they're doing, but it also is never recklessly shot or too flashy. the filmmaker has a superb 'real-life' cast (ale was plucked from a nyc public school without any experience) and knows how to not waste a shot, while at the same time achieve a brutal artistry with just showing what he shows. it's not city of god or pixote; it's its own little masterpiece on a character or characters we usually would just not give a second look to (or a first one barely) on our way in a city such as new york. if you're not moved by ale and his daily struggles, i don't know what to do for you.

this almost documentary look at an enterprising boy who lives in the body shop area outside of new york is real all the way. real lighting. real sound. less editing in the whole movie than in 1 minute of most movies. and while there is very little script, there is a story. shot in primary colors, almost all red, white, blue and yellow, we get a real sense of the life of a boy who is making something from nothing. he has a place to live that he makes his own, has a good job, and is trying to bring his sister into his little universe. the people in the chop shop area also give us a look at this culture which i didn't know about. they mostly seem decent and pay ale what seems like daily, seeming truly concerned about his well being. the actor (i think) playing ale says more with one facial expression than one can imagine. this reminded me what a true small movie can accomplish. it shows what kids are capable of, even without much support and love. definitely recommend.

chop shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters! i cannot begin to describe how wonderful the performances are in this movie. this film is for anyone who wants to watch a powerful story and see an example of what contemporary movies should look and be like.this film is about a young boy, alejandro "ale" who works and lives with his teenage sister, isamar "izzie" in a one-room tiny loft in an auto shop. the story takes place in a part of new york city (that i did not even know existed--willits points) where there are endless junkyards and body shops. here, bahrani tells the story of two forgotten children hoping to support themselves by buying and fixing up a food van.ale makes money helping at the auto shop, and izzie helps at a food van; both, however, earn extra money on the side. ale sells bootleg movies and stolen car parts; izzie results to selling herself. their lives are surrounded by grit and grim, but even though both witness, live and barely survive within their harsh world, their love for each other is never tainted by the filth that surround them. and occasionally they are able to laugh and enjoy moments of their childhood that is being stolen by the reality of struggling to survive and stay together.the best comparison i have for chop shop is that bahrani's juxtaposition of an innocent love between family members against such a bleak atmosphere is as powerful as pasolini's mama roma combined with the struggles of growing up too fast in an adverse environment just as in bresson's mouchette.having co-written, directed and edited both this film and his first, man push cart (which won awards all over the world), bahrani is a total package filmmaker.i can only hope that his films will not be hidden treasures for long!

chop shop. written and directed by ramin bahrani ( man push cart). bahrani specializes in character driven studies in naturalist style films about the sort of little people that get passed by every day, without anyone ever really noticing they are there, in new york. these are people who have been pushed to the very fringe of society. they exist in a sort of grey world, many of them migrants whose legal status in america is appears somewhat doubtful. where do they come from ? how did they get there ? how do they cope ? where will they end up ? these are not feel good stories as such, but stories about survival at its most basic, day to day level. ale is one such street kid. he has no education and hustles anyway he can, to save money, he is also not beyond turning to petty theft. mostly he is anxious to be reunited with his older sister. we see him in the early scenes ringing a safe house looking for her, but not having any real success. a young friend, carlos gets him a job in a chop shop, in the shadows of shea baseball stadium. eventually his older sister comes to live on site with him, but he is jealous of the motives of her friends and suspicious of how she makes extra money. he dreams of buying a food van and setting up a vending business with his older sister. bahrani shoots all his films on location. there is nothing glossy or glossed over about them. this is life as these people have to live it, in the raw. lt is not pretty although it is never ominous, and the slightly despairing air that hangs over much of the film, is the same one that hangs over these peoples' everyday lives.the script is also very natural and the characters are given plenty of scope and room to work in. polanco is outstanding in the lead role, and gonzalez gives solid support as the older sister.

a friend brought me this movie and at first i was hesitating, the pace in the movie was so slow that it was admittedly boring at the beginning. but the life scenes were attractive, it's like observing than watching. it turned out to be simply stunning throughout the film, the way how the director handled the life scenes to reflect the reality was confounding but somehow also overwhelming. it's like understanding the real life of a lively person than watching a movie. mr alejandro polanco and miss isamar gonzales did their roles so well that it's more like telling us their own stories. indeed they used their real names in the movie.

i couldn't believe that the adult swim guys came up with this character. i laughed for days just thinking about this show. having finally seen the pilot i guess i will stick around for a few more episodes. assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips. assy drinks too much and "plays by his own rules" as you might have guessed. the only other funny moments are assy shooting many,many people and spending time at home - in the bathroom. it is not squidbillies funny, but it is worth a look.

"please, don't kill me! i'm just an actor!" "can you play dead?" it's difficult to describe this show. it's like a crime dramedy. where the bad cop is an ass. literally. what's great about the show is some of assy's perfectly awful one-liners. cracking out such gems as "adios, blimp," assy mcgee provides some great laughs at points. sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch. this is definitely the kind of show you'll love or hate, there's essentially no middleman. it's not the best show on {adult swim}, but it has some strong points. it's worth looking into just to see if you enjoy it. i know i did.

assy mcgee is an out-of-control, hard-nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas. the twist here is that assy is literally a walking buttocks.the cheap, low-brow facade of the show belies its cleverness and hidden satire. that is not to say that assy is devoid of fart jokes, just that the toilet humor is used sparingly enough to elicit consistent laughs, not groans and eye-rolls. the title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever, subtle humor used throughout. the sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s cop theme. in one photo, a police cruiser is shown and the "camera" zooms in on the front license plate holder, which is vacant. the meaningless zoom-in satirizes the production of the typical 70s-80s cop drama and, incidentally, makes me laugh every time.all the typical characters are included: the frustrated police chief who can't control assy; the loyal, minority partner who acts as a foil to assy's recklessness; the regular cops who detest assy's means.... all are accounted for and all are hilarious satires of the typical police drama.the voice acting, primarily performed by larry murphy, is nothing less than spectacular. assy's voice--breathy and gruff with a bit of a drunken slur--is so clever and unique that it ranks alongside all-time greats like stewie griffin (family guy) and homer simpson (simpsons). though the voice is slurred, the diction is somehow clear and easy to understand. this is a nice change from other adult swim program voices that often require closed captioning to understand.besides the fantastic production and voice acting, the script is also hilarious. assy's no- nonsense directness fuels most of the humor, particularly in his interactions with citizens outside the police force.if you have access to the adult swim comedies, assy mcgee is certainly worth the watching. each episode clocks in at a mere 8-9 minutes, so you really have little to lose.

we really liked this movie. it wasn't trying to be outrageous, controversial, clever or profound. it was just entertaining and was what it said on the box a charming romantic comedy. every other brit film maker seems to want to change the world, nice to see one that just concentrates on telling a good yarn with elegant style.

rented this out from my local because it was the only new british film available this week. never heard of the film-maker before or his other films (thank you imdb). about time some one made a good young british comedy that didn't star hugh grant or forty something's. the story is a morality tale but never preachy, throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast. luke goss's cameo was surprisingly very good, but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in 'blade'. loved the colour grading, especially in the night club sequences. great music and a truly original voice at work here. nine out of ten and well worth the rental charge.

a vg brit rom-com, one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy. quirky and often surprising, this is not the best of brady's films (kiss kiss bang bang is by far the funniest), though it does have a unique charm. well written the story veers off into a few dead ends but mostly surfaces with a new plot high. you know from the start how it's going to end, but when it comes it is honest and very open ended, a realistic and credible ending, the end seemed like a beginning, enjoyable and left me wanting more.

inherited this from my x's dvd collection when he left with my best friend (enough said), watched it one night when there was nothing on the telly (nothing new there then) and got a very pleasant surprise. very british (you no hardly any budget, no faces you know or have even seen before), the accents were a bit thick for my liking, but after a worrying start (a bit too close to home in my case) it began to grow on me. apart from the some unnecessary jokey cutting that really didn't add anything, i found the film throughly uplifting, very real, natural performances throughout left me wanting more from an ending that came suddenly too soon. highly recommended!

after having seen the lost child for quite a number of times since its release in 1995, and having read the reader's comments (mostly about jane tennison's background and helen mirren's superb role in it), it strikes me more than ever that no comments are made upon the brilliant role robert glenister is playing as chris hughes. even after 10 years it is still one of the most credible ways of portraying the complex personality of a child abuser, carrying the weight of his own past.watching the episode for the full one and a half hour makes you constantly switch between feelings of love and hate for this guy, in which the hate prevails because of the gravity of his actions. i have seen more brilliant roles of my favorite actor, but this one never fails to make the largest impression possible to me. helen mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her. praise for robert glenister!

i'm surprised that mine, so far, is the only comment on this t.v. movie...as far as i'm aware, the series itself, has had a huge following, reviewer pundits and real people alike, have praised it to a person. anyway, let me tell you right away that, if like me, you're a sucker for gritty police dramas, you'll like "the lost child" tennison, the heroine, throughout the "prime suspect"series, has been battling the male police establishment, throughout the series, getting to her present, comparatively powerful rank in the police hierarchy through hard work,obstinacy, and sheer talent for police work. she is,essentially, an ambitious career woman, but she has a romantic side and is certainly no man-hater. unfortunately her relationships are affected by the wicked hours, which her career demands, and she has never married, so when she finds herself pregnant from her latest affair, she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother, and jeopardising her entire police job, let alone future advancement, or having an abortion - which she opts for. this abortion never looms large in the ensuing drama - it's very skilfully dealt with, in less than a couple of minutes screentime, a marvel of economy in scripting, and editing - but it's always there, as a counterpoint to tennison's desperate efforts to find another "lost child" - a kidnap victim - before it's too late. the story takes many twists and turns,before the surprise ending, and one is fascinated, alike, by the plot, and characters (although i found the many villains a little overdrawn), the police, and especially tennison, herself, are not always competent, nor that likeable, which figures, given the unpleasant job that they have to do, in the sleazy underworld which this series, habitually inhabits.mirren, herself, has said that she'll make no more movies in the series, but, excellent as she's always been in the role of tennison, the series, itself, is as "actor proof" as is another addiction of mine -dick wolf's american"law & order" - whoever appears therein, each could go on forever. as is my fervent hope.

"prime suspect 4" continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice, detective superintendent jane tennison; the first of three miniseries (ps4, ps5, & ps6) with the notable absence of founding writer lynda la plante from the credits. imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series, the second three series pit tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age, loneliness, indiscretions, a host of personal and professional problems, and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal. ps4 conjures two stories while ps5 & ps6 are single episodes each which find tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good. in other words, to prevail, tennison must overcome both evil and good forces, something which makes the always gray scenarios of the ps series yet grayer and the tennison wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers. very good stuff which only gets better from series to series. (b+)

albert finney and tom courtenay are brilliant as sir and his dresser. of course the play is brilliant to begin with and nothing can compare with the immediacy and collegiality of theatre, and i think you listen better in theatre; but on the screen we become more intimate, we're 'up-close' more than we are in the theatre, we witness subtle changes in expression, we "see" better as well as listen. both the play and the movie are wondrous: moving, intelligent, illuminating--of the backstage story of the company, of historical context, of the two main characters, and of the parallel characters in "lear" itself. if you cannot get to see it in a theatre (i don't imagine it's produced much these days) then, please, do yourself a favor, and get the video.

as the superb `prime suspect' series reaches part four there is no loss of momentum at all, this in itself a considerable achievement.' prime suspect iv: the lost child' has the solid supporting cast that we take for granted in these british dramas but of course the beautiful helen mirren easily dominates; our eyes never leave her while she's on-screen.the search for the lost child of the title leads superintendent jane tennison's cid team to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile now living with a single mother and her two young daughters. the insight we are given into the workings of his mind is one of the emotional highlights of this mini-series but it may be too strong for many stomachs.the action sequences are brilliantly handled with the hand-held camera thrusting us right into the middle of the excitement and there's gripping tension during the climactic siege.altogether this is another magnificent police procedural drama.

i watched this film in a singapore theatre yesterday (4 february, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.ms aparna sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.we have had hollywood movies on this subject such as "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" where jack nicholson carried away the honours. since then research has helped provide more insights into the problem and clearing some misconceptions about treatment. in "... cuckoo's nest," for example shock therapy has been portrayed as barbaric, but in "15 ..." the point has been made that it is not as bad as it has been made out to be.the other misconception is that abuse in childhood is a cause for schizophrenia. but scholars such as dr. e. fuller torrey have emphasised that studies have shown that childhood schizophrenia is a brain disease and is thought to have some genetic roots.it is now established that schizophrenia can be treated like any clinical ailment and its advance can be checked if detected early. even in fairly advanced stages regular medication and counselling can be effective.the same understanding shown by ms sen is evident in the way the actors play out their parts. in keeping with the gravity of the theme, the acting is controlled throughout with ms konkana sen-sharma's evocative silences and eyes mirroring the helpless confusion of a disturbed mind speaking louder than some of the rantings we are used to in most of the movies that have included mentally challenged characters.like me most of the audience in the theatre appeared confused at the abrupt ending. it leaves lot of questions hanging in terms of the plot.has meethi's search ended? why is she not found in no. 15? were children actually playing when meethi strode past the gates with her eyes sparkling with recognition? can anyone sort out this jigsaw puzzle?

comeundone, i love you! i could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. my family has not seen this movie yet, but i know them too well; they will hate it. but this time, i watched it alone and i found that it affected me greatly. although the movie is long in length, i was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. i initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.but like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality. instead, it challenges it and the viewer to think strongly about what the word "normal" means. it also gives you the insight to personally think about what the ending means, i can say that i loved how it turned out and i'm happy for mithi.

i resisted watching 15 park avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clich√©d topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.once in a while, movies like 15 park avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.the movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. aparna sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. the impeccable character development, "just right" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...i have a renewed respect for konkana sen sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic mithi. she beats expectation yet again after page-3 and mr.& mrs.iyer. prof. anjali's role is very well developed and shabana does full justice to the character. rahul bose, shefali chaya, waheeda rehman add incredible flavor to the movie.i define "shower moments" as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you ponder over in your shower endlessly, till your wife/girlfriend/mom bangs at the door. 15pa delivers many "shower moments" especially the conversation between anjali and her mother where the mother is cautious when talking to anjali about her thoughts. it immediately brings out anjali's personality to the audience.the end is a very bold statement by the director; probably too westernized for the indian audience; yet delivers the elements to promote the movie from a "good" to a "great" status.

our family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. the theme was well handled by the director with great performances from shabana azmi, konkana sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. the climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called "good". we are still trying to understand what was the director trying to convey? were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? a better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship. this however should not take away credit that is due to konkana and shabana azmi for relating so well with the characters!

a fantastic cinema experience. i really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out. there is nothing to add, except that is a terrible shame that sir albert finney still isn't accepted by the ampas (american academy). after roles in such films as tom jones, murder on the orient express, under the volcano (to name only few - for these he was nominated for the oscar), the dresser is arguably his highlight, yet...i know, oscars are just popularity contest, but if americans like british actors and actresses ("and the oscar goes to" jeremy irons, daniel day-lewis, anthony hopkins, emma thompson, glenda jackson etc. - and they all deserved the award!), why they always left sir finney with empty hands?on the other hand, they gave it to john wayne and marisa tomei (in cousin vinny). i don't know, should i laugh or cry.if you have seen the two leads in the dresser, you won't forget what is the art of acting. watch this film and enjoy! i recommend it to everyone who loves art.i give 9/10 for this excellent film (1 point missing for non-cinematic material, after all it is "just" a theater)note: my criteria is much stronger than this on imdb (10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that should/could last forever).

what more can you ask for? a great screenplay based on one of the finest plays of the latter half of the 20th century, two fine emotional performances by courtney and finney, a realistic vision of war time london, a great supporting cast. this film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster through humour, sadness, loss and fulfillment. if you are in the theatre it is even more effective. this is a true 10 on the rating scale !

well what do you know, i was painting my house today and an elton john song came on the radio, which immediately took me back to this movie which i saw in 1971. so long ago and so far away. ten years later i hitched hiked through the country side of france, and i sure would have been keen to see michelle. the film is probably not very sophisticated by todays standards, more's the pity, but it seemed rather racy back then. a few years later a sequel was made with michelle living in a high rise in paris and paul coming back to meet her, just like life they had moved on, the film was very downbeat. still the original was fab, and if you can get a copy go rent it, just remember to give it its' due and treat it gently. i note americans can be rather prudish, so take note, contains scenes and themes possibly upsetting to middle america.

first love. teenage love. we all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. "friends" could be considered an adaptation of the classic "the blue lagoon", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with brooke shields) and 1999 (with a young milla jovovich). while "the blue lagoon" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, "friends" goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences. paul and michelle who, for different reasons, turn their backs on family and the adult world to end up living together in a small cottage in southern france. having only each other and their childhood innocence, their friendship slowly develops into much more as they struggle to sustain themselves, in this sweet coming of age story. this film even to this day is controversial since the actors are teenagers and they certainly look the ages that are stated in the movie (15 and 14 1/2). the movie does contains a hint of child molesting, nudity, depictions of teenage sex and teenage pregnancy. but the real controversy is not the subject matter but the fact that paul and michelle's love is presented as a natural and healthy relationship. while this worked fine for stranded lovers in another time and in a desert island, having them in a modern setting presents some very difficult moral issues. laws prohibiting consenting sex between minors are in effect in almost all countries and lack of sexual education in teenagers is seen as one of the causes for the rise in unwanted teenage pregnancies and abortions. is a movie like this one just child pornography or a slap in the face to make us face our own hypocrisy, regarding a modern society that does not cater to teenage parents and laws that clearly go against human nature and hormonal development but that are needed to prevent child abuse? is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth? these are not easy questions and most of us will feel uncomfortable with them. as an artistic piece, this movie is really a forgotten and rough gem. the script progresses with extreme simplicity, albeit some sappiness, but never pulling any punches to state its message, although by today standards, it is somewhat slow. the photography is beautiful and it has scenes of great beauty. the acting of the two protagonists varies from really awful in some scenes to marvelously innocent and credible in others. pop music, unlike most productions nowadays, is used tastefully and sometimes the lyrics speak the thoughts of the protagonists. overall, this is a delightful piece, even if the moral values are not in concordance with your own.

first of all - i'm not one to go all sappy over movies. i saw friends in the 70's when it was first released. i was about 17 years old at the time. even now, at age 50, i still can remember some of the scenes. the movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but i loved it. the story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home. at the time it was pretty risky to have a movie about a couple of young runaways who successfully setup house and have a baby on their own. i'm not surprised the movie and elton john's soundtrack are almost unknown today. the music is beautiful. it was unforgettable.

when i first saw this film on video in a department store... it intrigued me. considering the fact that i thought i was in love and i was the same age as the youths in this film at the time (although i realize they are now old enough to be my parents), plus the soundtrack being written by elton john & bernie taupin just before they "made it big" here in north america... i figured i had nothing to lose in buying it. i was not disappointed.so far, i have shown it to many guys i have dated since, and to my current boyfriend... obviously, they didn't find it as lovely as i do... preferring to call it a "chick" movie... but i still laugh and cry. this film was vastly overlooked. it's good to see it's available to rent at one of the local video stores around here so that other people can share the magic. so maybe it's a bit far fetched... but it gives you a lighthearted sense of innocence... and a renewed faith in love.

i caught this flick on the trail end of a tape i had used to capture a movie i truly wanted to wanted to see again. when i saw raquel welch's name in the opening credits, i decided to watch it. it was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back "in the wayback machine" to the farcical movies that hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current austin powers stuff. oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching. there was some delightful scenery, although ms. welch provided the most pleasant of such. tape it if you get the chance and watch it when you have absolutely nothing else to do. it is not a snoozer, but it won't have you rolling in the aisles wanting more, either.

i don't go for that many "heist" comedies, and i might not care for this one if it weren't for the actors, when it was made, and when i first saw it (just a few years later). it's almost too similar to "the happening" (even though it's obviously a much less serious comedy than that one) - mafia figure takes over his own kidnapping, or rather, turns it in a different direction altogether. of course, raquel welch didn't play the kind of sharp character faye dunaway did in the happening, but that doesn't make it a sexist film either - she was practically playing a stock character, almost her version of a "moll"! but, i'm completely biased - it's among the first films i ever saw with her, and at the time i saw it, you couldn't turn around without seeing a poster of her (luckily). i think robert wagner was really just right as the neither thoroughly likable nor dis-likable leader of the group, as were edward g. robinson (naturally) and vittoria de sica. and godfrey cambridge, an actor who always managed to be funny.

i bought this movie because of raquel welch. she was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of harry (mike wagner) girl friend. harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. harry goes to a funeral where he meets vittorio de sica and takes him for a ride. when things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. harry and his gang decide with the help of vittorio de sica to from there on mob. rest a sure that no matter what the gang goes after that the outcome is never the same and will keep you on the edge of your sit. the rest of the out come you need to watch for yourself. as far as raquel goes if you're a fan of here then you need to watch this movie because she never looked better standing on the beach with a ****** on. i give this movie 10 weasel stars on raquel welch body alone. it's no wonder why she was the hottest actress back in the sixties. she was the sex symbol everyone one wanted and no one could get. not only does she look good, she can act even better. if you like, raquel welch then you'll like this movie

'the dresser' is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them. written by ronald harwood (himself a former dresser to the legendary donald wolfit), it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlights.as 'sir', the overbearing actor and main focus of the play, albert finney is a joy to watch - whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the 'blow, winds ...' bit of 'king lear' or chatting to his faithful stage manager, madge (eileen atkins, good as ever) about the old times. as norman, his camp dresser, tom courtenay gives a fabulous performance, wiggling around at the beck and call of 'lear', collecting a bottle to go at the pub, or bitchily disparaging the former fool, mr davenport-scott (often mentioned, but never seen!).in an engaging support cast, there's edward fox as oxenby (a typical arrogant second lead), zena walker as her ladyship, lockwood west as the replacement fool, and many others.this film has great energy, bringing with it some of the greasepaint of its stage origins, it is true, but being so well-acted you don't notice. very well done indeed.

the hurried approach that lewis seiler takes with king of the underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. one of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. the audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. this development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. the story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate. by abruptly cutting from this scenario to the morally conflicting occupation (the mob's personal physician), the viewer is called upon to experience this sudden turn of events. the nelsons (kay francis and john eldredge) are forcibly employed by gurney (bogart) without objections. this stylized notion of organized crime being too influential and powerful to overcome has become a standard component in every gangster picture. the one aspect of this film that raised some questions for me, ironically dealt with the pacing of the story, and that rate at which it was told. i think that character development and social identity can suffer when certain aspects of a story are not fully examined. this paradox happens to be a result of personal taste, in that i think that the movie going experience can be enhanced through rigorous character development. however, for the purposes of this film, i must admit that the rapid action contributes more dynamic flare to the impact of the film.**1/2 (of ****)

king of the underworld features an early role for humphery bogart in one of his many gangster roles.he plays joe gurney who uses a female doctor to treat his men and pays her for it. he follows her when she goes to live with her auntie after one of gurney's men kills her doctor husband who also worked for him. gurney kidnaps an author on his way to find the female doctor and gets him to write his life story and he then plans to kill him. he finally meets up with the doctor and after she gives gurney and his men a substance that makes them temporarily blind, she and the author, who have now fallen in love manage to escape just as police arrive...joing the excellent bogie in the cast are kay francis, james stephenson and john eldredge.watching king of the underworld is a good way to spend just over an hour one evening.rating: 3 stars out of 5.

husband-and-wife doctor team carole and niles nelson are doing modestly well in their careers, but niles has a gambling problem. his luck changes when he (unknowingly) saves the life of a gangster from joe gurney's mob and gets a big bonus from the gangleader himself. loving his change of fortune (and snazzy new apartment), niles continues to receive payoffs for patching up other injured members of the gang. unfortunately, his shady deals come to light in a police raid, which hangs a shadow over his wife's career as well.at this point the plot comes into focus, as carole nelson has to rescue her career before her license is suspended. this involves bringing the gang to justice more or less single- handedly. this is not a hard-edged gangster picture, but a plot that might have been comfortable on a show like matlock or murder she wrote. there is some tension, but the mood is kept light by bogart's tongue-in-cheek performance of a stupid gangster who imagines himself as the "napoleon of crime." his other gang members also function more as stooges than hoodlums. and there's some snappy dialog between bogart and francis, especially when she's treating his injuries at his hideout. of course, as in all gangster flicks, there's a big shootout ending, but with a humorous twist. this is a good short film showing bogart on his rise to stardom.

wow this wrestlemania took place from 3 different cities. this was the very first wrestling pay per view i ever saw and it's a good one indeed! there is a great steel cage match for the main event as hulk hogan takes on king kong bundy!

i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could. the writers were "smack on" and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.these characters were so real. one could tell that from the two main actresses ms. toussaint & ms. potts that their relationship on & off camera was genuine it didn't just end when you hear those familiar words "cut" at the end of a "take". the show has thought me a lot about life for e.g. historical struggles, tragedies and triumphs,relationships,every day situations, every household have same situations no matter who the members are, it really came down to just being a wonderful family show that at the end of every episode, you can just sit on your living room couch and say to yourself "now what did i learn from this particular episode".i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.now you know why i gave it a 10+!!

this show was not only great human drama but portrayed racism in this country in a raw, all too true to life manner. when one show can be so witty and entertaining and yet so poignant and educational all at once, this is television in its highest form. the acting was phenomenal. the writing was exceptional. not only did the show portray race relations in a straightforward manner that seems unmatched by any other television series, but its ability to depict this subject matter as it existed in the 1960's alongside how it exists in the beginning of the twenty-first century powerfully demonstrates the ways we have changed, and sadly, the many more ways we have not.

i loved this show. i was waiting for it to come out on dvd....it never has. does anyone know how to get the show available on dvd? i have contacted lifetime tv and a few others and nothing. please let me know if there is a way we can have this series on dvd. iwould be first in line to purchase it. i really got hooked on this show. i do not understand how a bunch of other tv shows are available on dvd but not any day now. i am sure there are many of us out there who would love to have this series on dvd or even vhs. i thought of contacting the production company. has anyone else out there tried to contact anyone for this information?

i just started watching the show around july. i found it by mistake, i was channel surfing during a vacation. it is a great show, i just wish it wasn't on so late at night. it's on at 12:30 am. as a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.i read some comments. i did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.i grew up in the 60's. i'm hispanic and i had a "white" boyfriend plus we had black friends in high school. i believe people get along because of their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with being a certain race or color.i can't wait till the show goes on dvd so i can buy it. this way i can see it from the beginning.

i give this film 8/10 overall. visually, a great deal of it is nothing short of stunning: an art director's dream mix of hieryonomous bosch, salvador dali, frieda kahlo and georgia o'keeffe--and a valid testament to the power of film as a serious art form. beautiful use of color, form, imagery, environment--and fabulous set decoration, combine with state-of-the-art computer graphics. so, 10/10 for that! wow!the plot line is, well, more predictable. you know they'll save the girl and get the killer in the end, but the story is still interesting and pacy enough to pull you in and keep you there. 6/10 for that.squirm factor...i won't give this a rating, but the film certainly made me squirm, and i was watching it on video on a tv screen. it would, of course, have a great deal more impact on a big screen. graphic violence of a twisted, erotic nature in a surreal landscape--even if beautiful--is highly unpredictable. the world inside the killer's head is not--thank goodness!--my world. because i watched this film on video, i was able to replay a couple of sequences and found much to admire the second time around when i wasn't so nervous about where the scene might be going, and i suspect the whole film would be worth seeing a second time, just for the "visual art".general suggestion: don't take the kids or conservative grandparents to this one, but if you're keen on the visual look of films, like surrealist art, don't mind a bit of kinky gore, and just want to take a bit of a "mind trip", this one's a winner. oh, and if you're keen on babes, jennifer lopez is pretty hot.

i couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. i am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. there are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that i see this movie, i find something new that i had not seen before. as with previous movies that i have seen, such as blade and mystery men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well. though the characters could have been developed better, the action and costuming was well worth the price of admission. i recommend you buy this one for your dvd collection. even if you haven't seen this on the big screen, you won't be disappointed. i know i wasn't.

this one started excellently. the photography and audio are the best i've experienced in years (okay, months). especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. also, making jennifer lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but i'm not sure what singh wants to accomplish with that.now for the minuses. the screenplay was awful. lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. she seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. the three beds seemed just too obvious. the baptizing of the child carl was a psychologically too underlined way to embark the motive which carl 'worked' under. and so on..anyway, the movie had great way of showing where singh comes from. why is it that the most talented directors seem to emerge from india nowadays?

i had no expectations when i started to watch this movie. how surprised i was! this is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! it's not simple. if you only enjoy police academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. the cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like cube, silence of the lambs and the lawnmower man, along with lots of completely new ideas. wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films i have seen in a long time! be open-minded, and you will love it!

despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as silence of the lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by vincent d'onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist jennifer lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all. this is where the film gets all new and different, as we enter (via a 21st-century cgi update of dr who's kaleidoscopic favourite, the trendy time tunnel) a kind of hellraiser-y weird world of scary crazy stuff going on all over the place, ruled over by d'onofrio, now a kind of superking overlord of his twisted mental world, inside his comatose body. the inside-the-mind sequences are well realised and often pretty stunning, all the leads perform adequately, the gruesomeness is to the max if you like that kind of thing, but the hype around the whole thing led to a disappointment for me, as i had expected something completely new and unlike anything ever done before, not this fairly successful blending of serial-killer and special-effect-horror genre staples. sometimes horrifying, often pretty, a fairly gripping story told with care and attention by talented film people, but by no means the great leap into the unknown it has been marketed as.

it must be said that the director of the cell, tarsem singh, has quite handily established himself with his first feature, which happens to rank as one of the most visually astounding films in contemporary cinema.the cell is more of a visceral experience than a film. as a thriller, it rises above most of its peers, with competent editing and a chilling score effectively providing an exceptionally suspenseful atmosphere. however, it is ultimately tarsem's skill for elaborate and disturbing set design and imagery that carries the film's jolting sense of terror.as with several recent films, i have been shocked by the alarming hypocrisy among those who have commented negatively about the cell; in defence of the film, i will address a few of these issues. the plot appears to be the main concern, and while it is not revolutionary and borrows heavily from the silence of the lambs, it was never intended to be the most important aspect of the film; the plot itself is a vehicle through which tarsem's vision--simultaneously horrifying and wondrous--is presented to the audience, much in the same way that the plot of the silence of the lambs is secondary to the fascinating study of its two lead characters, lecter and starling. while the silence of the lambs is clearly the superior film, it is irrational for one to condemn the plot of the cell, and in the same breath, praise that of the silence of the lambs.my final concern is the mention of "mtv style" directing. it pains me to see the condemnation of directors who use innovative camera and cinematography techniques. a camera has the potential to be much more than simply a tool with which to record events; angles, pans, colour adjustment, and so forth, are all used to their full extent in the cell with the purpose of creating the sense of a dream-like state that could not have been otherwise achieved. this is essential to the film, as the entire premise behind it is the visualization of a serial killer's subconscious. if you simply want a series of static shots, stick to stage plays and give up cinema altogether.that being said, the cell is thoroughly entertaining, terrifying, and breathtaking in both its pacing and design. anyone who is able to look past the--perhaps uninspired, yet never dull--screenplay will find one of the best films of the year 2000.

the cell fascinated me at first glance. i was a bit surprised about that fact, because the story of that movie is absolutely boring. if it had no story, the film would be better. bunuels "un chien andalou" comes to my mind- a film without story, but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images. but the cell is at first a hollywood-movie, and only second a piece of art. i'm very interested in tarsem's next project. hamlet on indian could be very interesting, especially when it has the same looks as the cell.for film music enthusiasts: howard shore's score for the cell is absolutely marvelous, but a hard listening experience, because of its very modernistic style.

i went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. this is the only flick that i know of that tarsem singh has directed but boy was it intense. this movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.the characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. this movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. this movie compares to no other i have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. in that respect it is a fairly large step above `a clockwork orange.' definitely see this movie on the big screen and don't wait for it to come out on tape. it won't be half as good on tape.this movie is not for the easily freaked out. it will mess with your mind and leave you with images that take a while to forget. but for those who like to be freaked out.....enjoy!

i do not want to go into a criticism of the movie which i think is - for a big budget movie - quite exceptional and daring.i just wanted to remark that i am really fed up with the studios policies and the laws of different states which treat their viewers like children. in the database we find at least 4 different versions of the movie according to running time. but, of course, it is likely that there are much more different cuts.the result is complete confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie (unless you live in argentina where the movie runs 115 minutes which sounds quite complete).later on dvd and video, the studios try to rob us further by selling us a presumable director's cut (in germany, there is already such a version around, running approx. 110 minutes).it would be nice, if the studios would not only think of the cash they make with their movies but also think of their products as a work of art, even at the risk of an unfavourable rating, so that i as a viewer don't have to feel cheated and am taken seriously, not only as a resource of money.

the cell (2000) rating: 8/10the cell, like antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. the first time i saw this film i thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, i decided i had to rent it again. i did, and i found the film to be much more likeable. the cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched. the film's script can be clunky at times, as can the acting, but the visuals are ingenious and bring the engaging story to an exotic and intriguing life. the oscar nominated makeup is also daring and careful, while the beautiful costumes and utterly brilliant set decoration went unnoticed. tarsem singh who has also directed music videos, goes totally crazy with his direction and it results well. he has major talent and this film has a lot of potential if you give it a chance. overall, the cell is a powerful, disturbing and avoids being too tacky which makes it a great, pleasurable watch.

i just watched the dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago.it's not a "big" movie, and doesn't try to make a big splash, but my god, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.the dresser is the story of sir, an aging shakespearean actor (finney), and his dresser norman (courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii. these are two men, each dependent upon the other: sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of lear. and norman lives his life vicariously through sir; without sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway.this is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. finney, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they're taking their bows! and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. employer is really the wrong term to use, though. for although, technically their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple.yes, there are others in the cast of this movie, but there is no question that the true stars are finney, courtenay, and the marvelous script by ronald harwood. that is not to say that there aren't other fine performances, most notably eileen atkins as the long-suffering stage manager madge. there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been.although it doesn't get talked about these days, it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards: best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay, best picture, best director (peter yates), and best adapted screenplay.i had remembered this as being a good movie, but i wasn't prepared to be as completely mesmerized as i was from beginning to end. if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about, and be hugely entertained all the while, then i encourage you to see the dresser.

the ma & pa kettle characters were highly popular and controversial. the films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. one obvious reference is 'the beverly hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. you could even say the 1980s sitcom 'newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. still, i wonder if betty macdonald, the washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good. her portrayal of hillbilly characters makes them the butt of many jokes in terms of their alleged sloppiness and laziness. (the real life family that macdonald based the kettles upon, successfully sued...claiming they had been ridiculed and humiliated with these less-than-flattering references). sure, it's comedy and the situations bring us a great many laughs and fun moments...and political correctness as we know it today did not exist in the 1940s and 1950s. but i think macdonald could've still written these characters more sensibly and universal international could've had its scriptwriters show them on screen with more dignity (there's such a thing as good taste). the more realistic moments are when the oldest son tom is ashamed of his rural heritage but learns to accept his parents and siblings for who they are. for their part, the kettles have to realize that they don't exactly fit into a modern world. that's not a joke...that's a sober truth.

the further adventures of ma and pa kettle almost seamlessly picks up where the egg and i left off. for the first solo adventure of the kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. leonard goldstein, associate producer of the egg and i, was producer of the further adventures of ma and pa kettle. with many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the macdonalds to the kettles works very well. there is a reference to ma beating birdie hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in the egg and i. the prize money from the quilt contest was to be used to send tom kettle to college. in this movie tom is returning home as a college graduate.there are two plots intertwined in this movie. one is the comedy of the simple mountain family moving into a state of the art modern house. the other is a light morality play on how environment affects children as they grow up.pa kettle (percy kilbride) wanted a free tobacco pouch for entering a contest, and ended up winning a house. his disappointment at not getting the free tobacco pouch is played for laughs quite a bit. when pa plays with dynamite he is totally oblivious to the explosion. kilbride never flinched in the scene as the debris from the explosion fell around him. he played the part to perfection. in his autobiography, jack benny mentioned how impressed he was with percy kilbride's deadpan delivery. kilbride took that comedic device to a high level of perfection.ma (marjorie main) and pa move into the new house with modern conveniences that confuse ma and pa almost as much as they help them. ma adapts far more quickly than pa. included with the modern conveniences is a television, a very new household item in 1949. moving walls, hidden beds, and plumbing fixtures are used as comic props, but the attention is on ma and pa, never the props themselves.tom kettle (richard long) meets kim parker (meg randall), a magazine writer who feels that hygiene and environment are essential for children to realize success as adults. tom is a bright, self-made man who contradicts the theory that success can only come from a pristine environment. this subject is briefly discussed in a couple of scenes, but left to subside. it was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise whimsical movie.seeing the kettles moving out of their run-down old house to move to a new house would almost be a disaster if it were not for the characters staying true to themselves. ma was the practical one, just as she had been in the the egg and i. pa was the fish out of water that provided the best comedy. he never felt at home in the new house, but the actual location of a comfortable bed would never be of concern to him.

there is a need for this kind of entertainment in our modern world. you can watch "ma and pa" with adults, with your family (kids any age or just by yourself like me. they are gentle, but gentle is so refreshing in a society of kids killing kids, a horrible war, inappropriate prime time television and poverty. we don't even get a hint of where all of those children came from! give me modern plumbing and i'll gladly become a kettle. humor does not require offensive language. it is hard to follow conversations in shows where every other word is bleeped. relax, take your shoes off, and climb in your recliner with a good old-fashioned glass of lemonade, and just breathe easy watching ma sweeping the chickens off the table at lunch time! pj

the film begins with a cranky old broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor richard carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. however, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised). however, while this seems like bad and contrived writing, it is not....as this is all part of an elaborate ruse by the writer to have a group of actors in the home act out his plot. however, part-way through the ruse, the producer and his browbeaten assistant figure out that the murder mystery taking place in the home is fake and think the whole affair is pretty funny. what no one realizes, though, is that an escaped maniac is loose and he is about to enter this contrived little plot--making for some wonderful twists and turns. so when it seems that there is a real murder, the actors are truly terrified while carle and his sidekick are convinced it's all a hoax. while i have explained some of the plot, there are many more aspects of the film you'll just have to figure out yourself--and it's surely to keep you entertained and guessing.considering that this is a b-movie in the public domain, i certainly did not have very high hopes for this little film. however, i was thrilled when the film turned out to be a much better than average flick--with a very interesting and novel twist on the old clich√©d plot about a dark and stormy night spent in a mansion. plus, while the plotting of the film was very good, the dialog was even better--with lots of sparkling wit and a nice light-hearted pace. full of pleasant surprises and well worth your time.

i have this movie on a collection of inexpensive b-movies. it's not restored, in fact, the audio was difficult to discern for the first few minutes.at first, it seemed like a typical haunted house film, and feels very much like the forerunner of clue, murder by death, house on haunted hill, etc.about a half hour into the film, the storyline takes a really interesting twist--and it goes from being a clich√© melodrama to something entirely different, and far more entertaining than i had initially thought.check it out, it's a great deal of fun, even if the long clips and wider shots (and near lack of music score) make it feel a bit creaky by today's standards.

one of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as "the murder mystery", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. and since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced). aspiring playwright charles belden saw in this renewed interest in murder mysteries a chance to make a name for himself, after warner bros. picked his three-act play, "the wax works", to create the 1933 horror film, "mystery of the wax museum". belden joined independent filmmaker frank r. strayer to keep making films, and "the ghost walks" was one of his best.in "the ghost walks", john miljan plays prescott ames, a young playwright who wants to impress a famous broadway producer named herman wood (richard carle) with his new play. ames takes wood and his assistant homer (johnny arthur) to his country house for a reading of his play, but his car ends up stuck in the mud during a terrible storm. the three men ask for refugee in an old mansion which happens to be property of one of ames' old acquaintances. inside the house, wood and homer witnesses the strange relationship between ames and the house owners, however, this is all a plan conceived to impress wood: everyone in the house is an actor playing a role in his murder mystery. unfortunately, the murder committed is done for real, and while wood and homer think it's all fake (after discovering ames' original plan), the cast knows that someone inside the house is a real murderer.as expected, charles belden's screenplay for "the ghost walks" features the classic elements of the murder mystery stories of its time, as we have the stormy night at an old dark house as setting, the obligatory group of suspects, and the touch of comedy. however, what's interesting here is how belden makes the film a real spoof on the genre with the many twists he puts in his story to play with the clich√©s of murder mystery plays. the dialogs are excellent, full of wit and lighthearted charm, and while the plot certainly loses a lot of steam by the end (it follows the murder mystery routine anyways), it never fails to be interesting and entertaining thanks to its smart twists and specially its quirky characters. interestingly, there's an obvious gay subtext that while stereotypical, it's never denigrating and it's genuinely funny at times.by 1934 director frank r. strayer was already an experienced craftsman in the poverty row side of the film industry, but his partnership with writer charles belden would give him a couple of his most interesting movies, and "the ghost walks" was one of them. while obviously done on a shoestring budget and the typical production values of independent films of its time, strayer manages to take advantage of his set and makes an atmospheric movie that fits nicely the mood and tone of the story. the pacing is a little too slow at times, but strayer knew that the power of his film was on belden's script and makes the most of it, letting his cast to make the most of their characters with excellent results. certainly the execution is a bit typical and unoriginal, but strayer makes an effective albeit restrained work in this film.as written above, the screenplay is filled with great lines that make the quirky characters shine, and fortunately, most of the cast play with this to their advantage. veteran character actor richard carle is remarkably funny as cranky producer herman wood, adding a lot of charm to his character, specially in his scenes with johnny arthur, who plays the flamboyant secretary homer. arthur is the one who gets the most best scenes, and he gives and hilarious performance as the cowardly yet witty assistant. john miljan is just effective as presocott ames, nothing amazing, but nothing really bad, and the same could be said about june collyer as gloria shaw (the obligatory love interest), whom is just fine. however, donald kirke is really enjoyable as the malicious terry shaw, and it's a shame he didn't get more screen time.as usual with frank r. strayer films, the low budget hurts the film badly, as while strayer makes the best he can, the film still feels kind of plain at times. however, the main problem is problem the very slow pace it has, as even when the film is filled with sparkly moments of witty dialogs, it moves at a pace so slow that can become boring and tedious for moments. it also must be said that while effective in their roles, miljan and collyer are pretty dull and average when compared to arthur and carle, and one wishes the movie had been more focused on the comedic pair they make than on the main couple. finally, as written above the ending is kind of weak and not up to the high standard of the first and middle parts, although credit must go to belden for keeping creative plot twists appearing until the very end.one could say that charles belden is an unsung hero of the murder mystery genre, as among the many horror and mystery films that came out the b movie studios nicknamed as "the poverty row", "the ghost walks" is easily among the best (alongisde strayer's previous film, "the vmapire bat") despite its shortcomings. and even when it's definitely not a masterpiece of the genre, it's a nice way to spend a night enjoying the way it pokes fun at its own origin as a murder mystery play. a very recommended film if you like the genre. 7/10

on their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. they make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. if you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.this is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it. the cast is across the board excellent and they're more than willing to have a good time with what is good material.i would love to say that this is one of the best of the genre, it should have been, but for me something happened on the way that made me down grade the rating to only seven out of ten. i can't tell you what it is, not for certain anyway. perhaps its the sense that i knew where it was going almost from the outset, or perhaps its something else, i'm not sure what, but there was something that i couldn't shake that made me like this film despite wanting to love it. it just missed being great and somehow fell short.that said i do suggest you see it. it is after all a very witty film, that entertains fully, despite just missing being great.

the ghost walks is a nifty little mystery with a great twist, snappy dialog, and best of all a pansy played to the twittery hilt by character actor johnny arthur which never demeans or denigrates his character. mr. arthur is great in his role of homer erskine bringing great comic relief as the secretary of the broadway producer herman wood, played by another great character actor richard carle.they play off of each other superbly.although the acceptable words of the time sissy and cream puff are used to describe the character of homer, it is never mean spirited or meant as denigration, and are not spoken by the manly males of the film but by his employer, who fires and rehires him every other scene and who displays an almost exasperated affection for his devoted employee.there is a great scene where homer tells his boss that he has devoted the best years of his life to him and has been everything but a mother to him.the mystery angle of the film is very entertaining, and the twist at the end might just leave you in stitches.for a low budget poverty row picture, this film has superb set decoration and great costuming.director frank strayer ably handles his cast and this film holds together much better than some of his other low budget mystery attempts, but he had a great script to work with and some wonderful actors to carry it through.this film is a must see for devotees of poverty row films, old dark house mysteries (they actually managed to work in the lines "it was a dark and stormy night)and it has the added bonus of being an early representation of a gay character in film where nothing bad happens to them in the end.this movie is available for download in the public domain film section of the internet archive at archive.org.

both jackie and candice are terrific in this movie. they are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. in particular, the way candice pronounces the words "puerto rican" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. i had seen the original of this movie, called "old acquaintance", starring bette davis and miriam hopkins. they allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other. hart bochner and meg ryan have supporting parts and are both excellent, in particular bochner, who never got many decent parts in movies, as far as i am concerned. george cukor did not make another movie after this, so this was a good one to go out on.

gosh, i am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. for example, i had no idea who george cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. all i can say is..i really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. can that ever exist? well, in certain doses, yes...and this film let out in a bit on ... "how".being a youngster with not a lot of life experience at the first time i saw this so i focused more on the "rich" and "famous" part between the two. at the time, i had no idea there was a difference and what would happen to two women who discovered there was...and how that would effect their friendship. through their men, their career, the decades that defined them. and coming to realize one thing remained stronger than anything else...their friendship and knowing each other more than anyone else could have.then i got older, studied film a bit... and watched this film again with my best friend from high school. we do understand the 'rich' and 'famous' angle ... and we are still the best of friends...but this film is not a cinematic masterpiece...it can be seen as a bit campy at times...a little over the top at points (kinda on a 'dynasty' and 'dallas' level to me..) and honestly i can identify with the "teddy bear" scene for we do share a bear that means a lot more than a stuffed fun toy through our trials and tribulations with men/careers, et al..so its not as over the top as it seems....! as many already said, seeing meg ryan and matt latanzzi and dack rambo and david selby are great in this 1981 piece. this is a nice "chick" flick!

recently i saw this movie again (after 25 years). in the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between jacqueline bisset's character and michael brandon's character. the rented version did not have this scene in it. did i imagine this?or, is this part of the "clean up" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not "appropriate"?i love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and i and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together. her husband thought it was us as well.thank you, joan

i loved this film because of the dialog and superb acting by candace and jacqueline. however, i never knew until now, watching a bette david marathon on tnt that this film is a remake of a 1943 bette davis classic called old acquaintance. bette co-stars with miriam hopkins who she was in a terrible feud with during the making of the movie because bette had had an affair with miriam's husband who directed her in a film before they made old acquaintance.anyway, both are worth every minute spent watching. i highly recommend this film if you like a lot of dialog and drama. it's a study in the psychology of women and their relationships with each other, in my opinion.

i finally received my dvd today, viewed it and i'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. as you may have read in previous reviews of "rich and famous" that the edited for tv version of the film that somehow made it onto vhs sometime in the late 90's but, now wb has corrected the error and released it on dvd complete with the airplane restroom scene, matt lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the hotel room where liz (jacqueline bisset) calls merry (candice bergen) a c**t! it's all there and looks better than ever! a crisp clear digital transfer, widescreen, and special features that include original theatrical trailer and a vintage 1981 featurette called "on location with rich and famous" with cast and director interviews. if you love this film as i do you won't be disappointed with purchasing this dvd. glad to finally have this on dvd¬Ö well worth the wait! thank you warner bros!

george cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. itself a remake of bette davis' campy "old acquaintance" written by john van druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.bergen and bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. liz hamilton (bisset) is a "serious" writer, intellectual, and elegant. she meets her lifelong best friend merry noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition. later in their lives, when liz is a "promising" but blocked writer of serious fiction, merry decides to try her hand at writing, which infuriates her pal because of merry's casual approach to the craft she herself takes perhaps a little too seriously. much to liz's chagrin, merry's trashy novels hit pay dirt, and ultimately, her old friend liz is judging her novel for the national book award. bergen steals the show as the haughty writer of steamy bestsellers who schemes to bring together the broken pieces of her life in conjunction with her final literary triumph, but alas, things are never that simple.the supporting cast includes david selby, whom you might remember as the tragic quentin collins from dark shadows, hart bochner and, of course, a deliciously young and mercurial meg ryan in her first film role since leaving the soaps. rich and famous is catty, campy, witty and wise. it culminates in a new years fiasco that stresses the enduring nature of true friendship, and i never let a year go by without watching it on new years eve. watch it and you'll see why.

george cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. the unsung hero of his generation. nobody mentions cukor in the same breath as john ford, howard hawks, william wyler or billy wilder and yet, look at his filmography. from sparkling comedies "the philadelphia story" "adam's rib" "holiday" psycho melodramas "gaslight" "a double life" a great semi western "heller in pink tights" not to mention "my fair lady" or "travels with my aunt" he was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera. i feel a certain tenderness watching "rich and famous" flashes of the old master still very much in evidence. candice bergen gives us for the first time in her career glimpses of the wonderful comedian she was about to become. jacqueline bisset is a throwback to the days of greer garson and loretta young and hart bochner steps in, teasing us, promising something spectacular that will eventually materialize in 1989 with "apartment zero", meg ryan, as bergen's daughter is already meg ryan. as tired as the formula is, it remains a cukor film and for what i gather one of almodovar's favorite movies.

the year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'the gunfighter' by henry king, and 'wagon master' by john ford. 'the gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced zimmerman's 'high noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.however, i personally find 'wagon master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring. frontier scenery is well used as it supports the poetic narrative perfectly. add naturalistic camera work and we are transported among the mormon travellers to witness western folklore told in cinematic means.

the performances by the male leads make this long-hard-journey west interesting throughout. the soundtrack by the sons of the pioneers is one of the most beautiful i have every heard. the journey itself is somewhat episodic, and joanne dru is badly miscast. overall, this is a very heartwarming and heartfelt western.

what can you say about a short little film filled with secondary actors and no "stars", with absolutely no bad performances, not one poorly delivered line of dialog, and with the cold violence on one hand being balanced by the warm "heart" of the protagonists in the story? it's a jewel, a diamond, a little valuable gem of a western that evokes the spirit and legend of the american west. a west not settled by grand heroes like hickock or cody or masterson or earp, but by the spread of the everyday man and woman, farmers and ranch hands, merchants and miners and lumbermen, whores and barkeeps, and entertainers of the day, some looking for riches, some for peace and quiet, some for religious freedom. it is, perhaps, a very spiritual story, though not promoting any particular religion, for even the non-mormon cowboys portrayed by ben johnson and harry carey jr. act in kind and noble ways toward everybody in the story, regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs, and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train comes upon the stranded medicine show people. and in true biblical fashion, like david and goliath or samson and the philistines, they are the guardian angels sent to the wagon train who eventually have to go head to head with the evil incarnate clegg clan, likening them to the serpent in the garden of eden, and regretting what it is they have to do afterward. it's a sweet folkloric tale of the west that hits every target john ford takes aim at.nowadays i have a western santa claus whose red outfit is covered with a denim drover coat, whose red stocking cap is replaced by a brown stetson, who carries a burlap bag of presents and a coil of rope. to my santa i added a winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a colt revolver to tuck into his waistband. when people at the office ask why my santa has to carry guns, i simply reply, "snakes!" after all, isn't the spirit of the christmas season one where everybody should get what they deserve? fifty five years later, especially post-911, the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and story of this movie are still as relevant today as they were back then.

i first saw this movie on tv back in 1959 when i was eight years old. i knew nothing of westerns then but recognized ben johnson from the movie "mighty joe young." what attracted me to "wagon master" were the great songs sung by the "sons of the pioneers." merian c. cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. cooper hired max steiner to create the mood for his classic creation king kong. steiner would later win an oscar for the theme for "gone with the wind.' cooper was also the producer of "mighty joe young." if you remember, music was important to the big ape which would only respond to the sound of stephan foster's "beautiful dreamer." in 1947, cooper would partner with john ford, who directed "wagon master." of all of ford's famous westerns, this one is my favorite which features his brother francis and a sullen janes arness.

most of us kids growing up in the 40's or 50's were western buffs but this was one that had escaped me until seeing on the movies for men channel today. i loved the film's story, cinematography as well as the superb casting of ben johnson and harry carey jr. in the lead roles along with the ever dependable ward bond. apparently this movie was the inspiration for the later television series 'wagon train' which featured bond once again as the boss of the wagon trains heading west. johnson steals the film with his horse riding skills and it's nice to see an actor doing his own stunts like ben does in this movie. other notables include the lovely joanne dru as denver and an early non speaking role for james arness who later became famous for his marshal matt dillon role in 'gunsmoke.' if you like films of this genre you can't fail to like this one.

for my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director ford ever made. the dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l the story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any american black-and-white film. owes an awful lot to sergei eisenstein's editing technique, but never as coolly detached or 'scientific' as eisenstein could frequently get. and a great musical score. a magnificent panorama of an important and poorly understood episode in american history.one little quibble: it's not clear why the film involves the mormons, who, as far as i know, were never the pacifists the quakers and amish were. this confusion leaves a slightly bitter after-taste.however, the rest of the film is such a feast, this is easy to ignore. in all other ways, a true masterpiece of american cinema that needs to be revived and looked at again (and again and again).

this small john ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. it has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey west of a party of mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all ford's films, (it's on par with "the sun shines bright" which he made a couple of years later).there is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental. the splendid performances of ford's stock company, (ben johnson, harry carey jr, ward bond, jane darwell etc), adds considerably to the film's authenticity while the nearest the film gets to a full-bodied star performance is joanne dru's denver. dru was a much finer actress than she was ever given credit for as were bond and johnson, who at least was finally awarded with the recognition of an oscar for his work in "the last picture show". as he said himself, 'it couldn't have happened to a nicer fella'. add bert glennon's superb location photography and you have a genuine piece of americana that couldn't have some from anyone other than ford. this is a film that truly honors america's pioneers and is full of sentiment and feeling.

by 1950, john ford had already fully-developed the ideas and motifs that would form the core of his most successful westerns. always present, for example, is a strong sense of community, most poignantly captured in the joad family of steinbeck's 'the grapes of wrath (1940).' within these communities, even amid ford's loftier themes of racism and the pioneer spirit, there's always room for the smaller human interactions, the minor friendships and romances that make life worth living. 'wagon master (1950)' came after ford had released the first two films in his "cavalry" trilogy ¬ñ 'fort apache (1948)' and 'she wore a yellow ribbon (1949)' ¬ñ and it covers similar territory, only without the military perspective and, more damningly, the strong lead of john wayne. ben johnson and harry cary, jr. are fine actors, but they feel as though they should be playing second-fiddle to somebody, and ward bond's cursing mormon elder, while potentially a candidate for such a role, isn't given quite enough focus to satisfactorily fit the bill.in 'wagon master,' ford seems so comfortable with his tried-and-tested western formula that any character development is largely glossed over. ben johnson's romance with joanne dru is treated as an obligation more than anything else, and harry cary jr's charming of a mormon girl is so perfunctory as to be almost nonexistent in the final film, leaving one to ponder the survival of deleted scenes. only in charles kemper's charismatic and shamelessly-villainous uncle shiloh does ford try some different, and it works, even with his being surrounded by a troop of insufferably hammy slack-jawed yokels. where ford does succeed is in orchestrating the conglomeration of three distinct races of americans ¬ñ the values-orientated mormoms, the easygoing horse-traders, the eccentric travelling showmen ¬ñ into a cohesive community of pioneers looking towards a bright future. this apparent harmony is thrown into disarray by the arrival of uncle shiloh's gun-toting outlaws, who exploit the lawlessness of the western frontier but ultimately lose out to the noble cowboys who "only ever drew on snakes."ford reportedly considered wagon master among the favourite of his films, and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like john wayne or henry fonda. armed only with his stock selection of usual players, ford is able to generate a sense of community by avoiding placing focus on any one character, though most of the mormom travellers still remain completely anonymous. despite being undoubtedly well-made, i can't help feeling that this film only does well what other ford pictures did even better: the terrific majesty of the the western frontier was presented more beautifully in 'she wore a yellow ribbon'; the romances and friendly squabbles among community members took greater prominence in 'fort apache'; the early relations with native americans, only hinted at here, were more thoroughly examined in 'the searchers (1956)'; the bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored more movingly (albeit by henry hathaway and george marshall) in 'how the west was won (1962).' 'wagon master' is pure john ford, but it isn't a landmark.

i don't think i really have any spoilers in here but since i do describe a couple of funny scenes, i'll check the box saying 'might contain spoilers' just to be on the safe side. now...i hardly know where to start. by now you know the basic outline of the story - horse traders travis (ben johnson) and sandy (harry carey jr.) take the job of guiding a mormon wagon train west to their 'promised land' and along the way encounter a variety of trials and interesting characters, most notably the outlaw clegg family.anyone can enjoy this movie. you don't have to be a fan of westerns to like this one. for one thing, johnson and carey are two of the most quickly likable characters you'll see in any movie. carey in particular is animated and outgoing, almost like a big kid - while johnson is a little calmer and wiser, kind of like an older-brother figure. i get a kick out of the scene where they sell the sheriff one of their 'gentle horses' for ten dollars; then inform him that the horse has "some peculiarities - you might say failings"... travis elbows sandy who lets loose with a shrill whistle, sending the sheriff's new horse off on a wild bucking fit with him in the saddle. the look on his face as the horse finally dumps him and gallops away is priceless.pay attention to the music... even if you never thought you'd be a fan of the sons of the pioneers, listen to "shadows in the dust" as the wagon train is shown in motion with some of the people walking along between the wagons. it's a truly beautiful song- too bad only half a minute or so of it is in the movie. i want to hear the whole thing sometime.one thing that impressed me greatly about this movie is that much of it must have been almost as hard to make as the real situation it portrays. teams of six horses pulling wagons up steep mountain trails, straining to make the top - this was no simple and easy film. it must have been risky for the actors, the stunt people and the animals as well. fording rivers too, this movie has plenty of authentic-looking action involving the movement of the wagon train. it should be mentioned that both harry carey jr. and ben johnson were extremely competent riders, both with many years' experience riding, roping, and doing all manner of cowboy-type things. carey grew up on a ranch where his family employed many navaho indians and in fact he learned to speak navaho before he learned to speak english. no rhinestone cowboys in this movie - "travis" and "sandy" were the real thing through and through.watch for the scene when miss denver throws out the pan of water from her wagon, hitting travis's horse in the face... the horse starts bucking, eventually throwing him off it. watch the look on sandy's face when denver tells travis 'i'm sorry you fell off your horse.' another favorite scene of mine is when harry carey jr. (sandy) gets into a bit of a tiff with one of the mormons. they're working back to back getting their gear ready, and after sandy gets disgusted with the other fellow, the two of them get into a rear-end bumping match that quickly turns into a rolling-around-on-the-ground fist fight. even after the elder (ward bond) stands them up and separates them, the two combatants continue trying to get at each other. the mormon (named 'jackson' in the film) gets one final kick in at sandy so high it hits his shoulder. it's a really funny scene from start to finish. i don't know what else i can say about this movie other than that it has a good story, very engaging characters, beautiful scenery and plenty of action balanced with humor and a bit of drama. oh, it has been colorized, at least in the version i saw; not the most beautiful color film you'll ever see but i think i prefer it to black and white. i give this one a ten and i don't give out many 10's. one of my favorite movies, without a doubt. and, judging by the other comments, i have plenty of company in that assessment.

this film has to be as near to perfect a film as john ford made. the film is magic, a masterpiece, the reason ford was, well ford. if you want to know why ford was great this one explains it.the photography of course is superb, black and white as black and white should be, wonderful shots, not an over the shoulder conversation in it, pure ford, great moments, big and little. the famous ripped pants of ward bond. apparently two dogs kept invading the set and fighting so ford wanted to use them in the fighting scene, but instead of fighting one dog ran away and the other attacked ward bond and ripped his pants, which caused ford no end of mirth. a whole scene around plaiting a rope. the way ben johnson burn then snuffs his rope, wonderful foreshadowing and anticipation of the final. harry carey's naive courting of prudence. the usual ford line about being scared and not showing it. bond's horse accidentally falling in him and its left in the film. johnson and bond are fantastic in that scene. lord help any ford actor who does not stay in character while the camera is rolling even when a horse falls on top of you.a couple of very sweet romances, not intruding on the whole focus, two very likable leads, not to mention for the girls, the number of times the cameras focus on ben johnson's rather delightful backside.lots of old time stuntmen getting lines and roles, cliff lyons, frank mcgrath. some wonderful character studies mostly of faces staring, all the villains and main stars. a set of villains to rival any group in any western.many many fordian shots of faces, groups, children, women, small things happening, foals in the background (ford seems to love images of foals), women in aprons, allowing the moment as wagons cross rivers and the camera lingers.this is probably not a western as much as an artist's picture that happens to be set in the west.lucky the film was made in 1950 because it is impossible to imagine such a film could be ever made again, but then it is such a work of art that it would be a sacrilege to attempt it

this film is about two horse traders who agree to escort a small group of mormons across the desert. along the way, they encounter a murderous family of thugs who menace the peaceful folks and put their pilgrimage in jeopardy.wagon master is what i would term a "little" john ford film, as it obviously did not have the budget or scope of some of his other westerns. in particular, this film lacks the big-name stars like john wayne but allows some of the usual supporting characters to take center stage. long-time ford stock character actors ben johnson, harry carey, jr. and ward bond have been elevated to starring roles and perhaps the one who came of as "the" lead was probably johnson--though the other two got nearly as much screen time and focus. this is not a bad thing, as the film worked just fine without the big star--and is well worth seeing.now this isn't to say i loved the movie. it was very good but certainly not perfect. in particular, as far as the music goes, you'll probably either love it or hate it. i found the sons of the pioneers' music a bit schmaltzy at times. it did evoke a nice mood, but seemed to occasionally dominate the scenes. i think a little would have worked much better. plus, with their incessant singing in the background, i kept expecting roy rogers to pop out at any moment. another minor problem is that the plot was amazingly simple and the ending was pretty much a foregone conclusion.however, and i am glad to say there is a 'however', despite this being rather formulaic and sentimental, the film still worked well. this was primarily due to john ford's nice, as usual, direction as well as ben johnson's exceptional performance. he was able to provide an excellent anchor for the film. another plus for me is that i saw this in the same week as brigham young, another film about the mormon migration. while brigham young was a bit silly and overly "saintly" in its portrayals, here the mormons were less "perfect" and more like real people--with foibles and personalities. oh, and speaking of brigham young, it seems as if jane darwell was the 'go to' girl for mormon-themed films during this era, as she was a major supporting character in both films. considering that she died in brigham young and it was set about 20 years before wagon master, this is some stunt!also, if you'd like to catch a glimpse of the famous jim thorpe, he's in a tiny role where he plays the impassive indian dancing next to jane darwell around the camp fire.

wagon master (1950) dir: john ford production: argosy pictures / rko radio pictures john ford brings the stock company out into the utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. no john wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.this ensemble piece nominally stars ben johnson (as travis) and harry carey jr. (sandy). they're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of mormons, led by ward bond, are being shown the exit. the group is about to embark on a trek to their own settlement, but they know the odds and the harsh terrain are against them. so they hire travis and sandy as wagon masters for their trip. along the way they run into and take along a traveling medicine salesman and his two female cohorts (alan mowbray as the doctor, recalling his appearance in my darling clementine and joanne dru as his "daughter"). tension is added when the murderous clegg gang comes upon the wagon train. and there is also an atypical (for hollywood) meeting with the navajo.most of the story and humor is driven by the clash of ideals/cultures; first between travis and sandy and the mormons, between ward bond himself (he's constantly trying to suppress his urge to curse and be a reformed man), between the doctor and his ladies and the mormons, between the wagon train and the outlaws, and finally, everyone and the navajo. there is also a classic ford scene of a rowdy dance which expresses one of his signature themes of civilization coming to the frontier.again, no duke here, but i've found ben johnson, especially the young, cocksure ben johnson, to have an engaging screen presence of his own. he comes with his own backstory, with that drawl and also when you see him doing all the stunt riding himself. he's great here in one of his early credited appearances. harry carey jr., although having been around for a few years by this time, is still pretty raw at times, but he's likable. ward bond is his usual marvelous, blustery self. i've found joanne dru to be a drag in whatever i see her in, but here she's mercifully unobtrusive. other familiar faces include jane darwell, francis ford and hank worden, playing 'dumb', like he will in the searchers a few years later. it's not any more amusing here.there is some absolutely spectacular b&w photography by frequent ford collaborator bert glennon. not only is there the typical masterclass on the landscapes and horizons, there is also some flourish in a handful of scenes with shadow and (sun)light. the soundtrack features the legendary country music group, the sons of the pioneers. can't get more cowboy than that.***¬Ω out of 4

lackawanna blues is a fine stage play by ruben santiago-hudson and an even finer film as the author adapted his own life story for the screen. this brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors, fine music, brilliant editing, superb direction by george c. wolfe, and a cast so stunning that they make an encore viewing compulsory! yes, it is just that good.the story is based on the author's life as the child 'junior' (marcus carl franklin) raised in the inimitable home of soulfully empathetic rachel "nanny" crosby (s. epatha merkerson), a lady who devoted her life to aiding the disenfranchised by transporting them from the south, from mental hospitals, and from the streets to lackawanna, new york. the boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house - odd characters with painful pasts - and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by nanny. the myriad characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business: terrence howard, rosie perez, mos def, the beautiful carmen ejogo, louis gossett jr., jeffrey wright, ernie hudson, charlayne woodward, jimmy smits, patricia wettig, macy gray, liev schreiber, kathleen chalfant, lou myers, hill harper - the list goes on and on.in the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the infectious joy of african american music contributions to our musical culture, and the courage of one fine woman who battled all the hardships the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact. s. epatha merkerson is wholly submerged in this role, a role she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos. she offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years, and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an hbo movie, she without a doubt would add the oscar to place along side her golden globe award.the entire cast is exceptional and wolfe handles the acting and the story like a master: like riffs in a jazz piece, he pastes tiny moments of conversation with each character and junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues, jazz, dancing, and joy. the production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention lag from the momentum of the story. highly recommended, almost compulsory viewing! grady harp

lackawanna blues is a drama through and through. it details the life of a strong woman by the name of rachel crosby (s. epatha merkerson). rachel is referred to as nanny by all who know her, but she could have just as easily been called wonder woman. she epitomized strength, will power, confidence and resolve. she owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject. her tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputee, and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary. each successive event rachel took in stride and handled flawlessly. she wasn't a dictator devoid of compassion, but in fact she was quite the opposite. she displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to over-extend herself.merkerson did a good job, but i believe this role was right up her alley anyway. the movie had an even keel never straying from rachel. there were of course dramatic moments but they were to be expected. nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than rachel herself.

the creator of donnie darko brings you a twilight zone themed tale of the oddest fashion. the film centers on a middle aged young couple living paycheck to paycheck in 1976. one day a mysterious box appears with a red button. later on that day a spooky gentleman shows up and tells them that they have the choice to press the button and receive a million dollars but someone they don't know will die. it's a disturbing and provocative question suspensefully outlined in the trailer and tv spots. but let it be known that you just don't know what your in for until you see it. at times pretentious and a bit melodramatic the film is ultimately effective because of it's good performances and intriguing subject matter. it would be unfair to ruin any of the plot twists for you but lets just say the film will deliver on the aspects you expect it to and not completely fulfill others it begins to outline. there's a lot of apparent symbolism and subtext in the film which is both interesting and annoying as it wasn't so evident in his other superior film donnie darko. there isn't too much more to say without ruining the film for you. it's meant to inspire lots of cafe chatter afterwards. however, i'd also like to say it's shot well and has an appropriately aged look to it and it's worth a watch. check it out.

forget about donnie darko. i open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews i have read on the box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to darko. it isn't that i disagree with that necessarily, i just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. there are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. in darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential. in the box, the driving force of the narrative stems from a moral dilemma. believe me when i say that i understand the inclination to compare an innovative filmmakers'movies by looking for trends and patterns, but for me it is more important to approach each new film as a self contained entity first, and then broaden my gaze afterwards. the box is one of those films you get mixed feelings about because it seems to be in some sort of identity crisis. it isn't always sure what it wants to be. the twists are numerous, but easy to follow if not to predict. james marsden and cameron diaz play a relatively believable pair of newlyweds who are in financial straits. a box containing a "button unit" arrives on their doorstep and they are informed by a horribly burned man that if pushed the button will cause the death of one person whom they don't know, and they will receive one million dollars. one of the things the box achieves is to conjure up this invisible fear that somewhere out there our actions have moral consequences. before the button is pushed it has an eerie and seductive quality, alluring yet sinister. once it has been pushed, events are set in motion that make the two leads question their own morality and deeply regret their fateful decision. the notion that the box is an experiment is interesting because for me it provides the movie with a paradox. if there are external beings developing an "altruism coefficient" based on data gathered by couples pushing and not pushing the button, then as the conspiracy unravels, we notice that ultimately it is a forced altruism: be selfless or the species will be wiped out. i suppose the couples don't know the consequences of their actions when they are faced with making the decision, but they have no reason to suspect that the box can do anything, so why would they choose altruistically? is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care about it when presented with a problem in our own lives? the psychological hurdles in this movie are everywhere. push the button or don't, it's likely someone is messing with you. take the money or don't, no one gives anything away for free. search for the truth, the answers you find slowly reveal your demise. i propose that the box is an ironic work because it offers the false choice of free will while revealing that we are trapped in many metaphorical boxes. you can only choose to be free at the expense of another's life, is that freedom? no, it is only another box because then you become trapped in the consequences of your own morality. there is no escape for us because we live on earth and that is another box. this is precisely why the external beings in the film are ultimately antagonists. they demand we conform to moral standards which rob us of our freedom. we made it to mars, and we were burned for it and turned into slaves in a sick game. the references to jean paul sartre illustrate this point rather well. "you can only enter the final chamber free, or not free." sure, but no matter the form in which we enter the chamber, it is a chamber nonetheless. trevor nemeth

i'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but i clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. this is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even ms. diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) the sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. it's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's "running the show," so i'm glad the movie doesn't try. it's really irrelevant to the story, which is relatively long but quite compelling and summed up quite satisfyingly in the ending. before you decide this movie is terrible (or really, anything under a ~7.5) read some of the dozens of 1-star "hated it" reviews that are rife with misspellings, lack of punctuation and capitalization, and juvenile criticisms. maybe the trailer was misleading or something -- i didn't see it -- but some of these reviewers were apparently expecting terminator 4 or saw 5 (one reviewer actually compared this movie to saw! how utterly inappropriate and unrelated!) seriously, most of these reviews read like you-tube comments -- according to these "critics" this movie is too confusing yet too predictable, not enough action yet there's too much going on, too smart yet too dumb, explains too much yet leaves too much unexplained... oh -- and it's apparently a "waist (sic) of time." do consider the quality and source of the reviews before taking them to heart. i'm afraid these 1-star kids failed to understand the phrase "altruism coefficient" and were therefore utterly incapable of understanding the movie's premise (despite adamantly claiming that they "get it" right before explaining how confusing it was!) if you know what those two words mean you will have no trouble understanding (and enjoying) this movie.i really wish there were a reviewer reputation system here so i could be sure to ignore the rating of everyone who gave this movie 1 star forever.see it for yourself and enjoy the fine presentation of an interesting couple taking an interesting moral "test" and facing the consequences. it's a good time, in my opinion.

i'm not gonna lie. to say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. and if you've seen cult director richard kelly's previous films, "donnie darko" and "southland tales," you know that's gotta mean something. when i went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. by the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see. i for one could only comprehend roughly 40% of what i saw on- screen, and even then it can only be called interpretation. so why did i give this movie a generous seven stars? because for one, we get some spectacular performances (marsden's great and langella returns as a familiar creepy character), and most importantly two, because it's entirely original and richard kelly, undoubtedly one of the bravest directors alive, uses his creative vision to tell a story that dares to be different. quite frankly, it's the only way - only through kelly's unique style could this story be told the way it's intended.in the end, if you're not willing to spend some serious thought into an intelligent movie (and even then it may all amount to nothing), stay far away from this one. but if you want to watch a deep, rich, complex and thought-provoking piece on spirituality, existentialism, and the predictability of human nature, go see this. be prepared for lengthy discussions with your partner however.*note: if by chance you've read this review, taken my recommendation, have actually seen the movie and still believe you've wasted 2 hours of your life, i'd be happy to share my views on the whole meaning and plot of the film. see, that's why i liked it so much - it promotes discussion! as hard as it is though, i'll try summing it up by paraphrasing a rather depressing quote by langella's character, who explains the significance of the simple box to an employee: "your house is a box which you live in. the car that you drove to work is a box, on wheels. when you return home from work you sit in front of a box with moving images. you watch until the mind and soul rots and the box that is your body deteriorates, when finally you are placed into the ultimate box... to rest under the soil and earth."

the premise is rather original and well thought-of, but unfortunately, siding a good story is very low budget that doesn't even allow for decent special effects. jeff fahey does his best amongst a poor cast, as does the always beautiful linda hoffman. they should make more movies together. the movie, while not worth much praise, warrants at least one viewing.

i wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. it told the story more of robin williams, then mork & mindy. still, thought it was great. we got to see, robin always being 'on', no matter what. the performance of diamontopolous was awesome.the introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. roebuck as garry marshall was wonderful. he was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the williams energy. the little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (happy days, and laverne & shirley), was enlightening. i also thought richmond-peck's harvey was also a nice rock in the pond. (this is a good thing).this movie told the age old story of hollywood folks, going through the ups and downs of stardom. it kept me glued to my tv, and i learned to love robin, well hell, mostly everybody seem to be the super people i sometimes think hollywood is. go figure.i sometimes wonder why the network people are always played to be idiots. we never saw the head of abc. just heard him, like charlie from charlie angels (i wonder if this way planed?). it seems so sad, that a show at number 1, could be so destroy by their own network.i think this story could be told about anyone's life, as they climb the ladder of any job. movie, and tv stars are always loved or hated by so many people, that you grew up with, you just want to reach back in their past, to remember your own past. i remember watching the show, and always wondering what does happen in their personal lives.mork and mindy, will always be part of me, and i got to see part of them. it may not all be the truth, it's also all not a lie, but in the end, it told me a wonderful sad, happy story.

i just want to say that chris diamantopoulos's role as williams for that entire show, was emmy worthy. it was uncanny how well he did. and to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as robin williams really is....wow. there were scenes where diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like robin williams doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. its one thing to do a robin williams impersonation for a couple of minutes. its another to do it for a whole tv movie.i don't know how i felt about the whole show, and i don't know how much they played with the facts, but i do know that it was chris diamantopoulos that kept me watching. so for that, i give him a 10.

great, chris diamantopoulos has got to be the best robim williams that i have every seen.. he acts it up, perfectly. this was like watching robim williams as he really was and is.. it almost made me cry watching him.i had no idea that robin was as close a friend to john belushi as he was. the portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. very sad, what both of them went through.i really felt for both val and robin during his rough times. i am glad that they ended it in a high note!i hope robin puts a $100 bill in this guy's hat !!and it was great that it was filmed in vancouver!

i just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. i liked (not loved) "mork & mindy" as a kid, mostly for robin william's zany energetic performance. this movie made me remember why. was the original show great? not really, but robin certainly was. which brings me to this movie.i was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). but, of course, the real focus was on robin. it was interesting to see robin's journey from struggling street jester to national t.v star, and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife. and my hat is off to star chris diamantopoulos as he portrayed mr. williams with integrity, sensitivity, and heart; not just a cute impression, although it was even dead-on. (on an unrelated note, i noticed that robin's struggles were in some ways similar to andy kaufman, who was under-appreciated by network t.v. and held back creatively, but that's the "taxi" behind the scenes biopic.)all in all, this was a very enjoyable flick, in which i felt i got to know a little more of the man behind the orkan. the acting was solid by all- never melodramatic like i suspected- and the story moved along well. performances that were particularly good were by those who played garry marshall and john belushi (the scene in which belushi heckles robin was a hoot!). not a great masterpiece by any means (i would have liked to have seen a tad more about pam dawber), but definitely watchable, especially for those robin williams and "mork & mindy" fans out there. nanoo, nanoo!

after getting hooked on the mini series, "north & south," i could hardly wait for the continuation, "north & south ii." then years later, along came book iii, "heaven & hell - north & south - book iii." finally, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the maine and hazard families. i was so enraptured by this series that i taped each part off of tv and then managed to get family and friends hooked and i watched it again, each time someone new wanted to see them. my tapes are old and i crave this trilogy on dvd. if you missed book iii, you didn't get full satisfaction and you don't know how it all turned out. do yourself a favor and demand this set on dvd!

this is the best movie i have ever seen. it has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. and a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.the most splendid casting i have ever seen. patrick swayze and james read were top grade in this movie.if you see part 1 you will want to see it all. some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.i am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. any movie that can get children to learn history is great. i have books i, ii & iii and when the girls come up from florida each year they want to see north & south.

north and south is a miniseries from the "golden age" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. it is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although i personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.james read and patrick swayze deliver excellent performances--especially read, whose george hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story. the series also contains top-notch work from kirstie alley, wendy kilbourne, hal holbrook, lewis smith, genie francis, georg stanford brown and others. the costumes, filming, sets and music are all first-rate as well.don't take it as a history lesson, but take it for what it is--a well-made, sweeping epic from a bygone era. book 2, which followed a year later, is also excellent, but i would advise viewers to skip book 3, which came out 8 years after book 2 and was not nearly as good as the first two parts. books 1 and 2 are classics, though, even with their soapier elements, and they are well worth watching.

i really enjoyed north and south very much. i think it is one of the best and most lavish television series i have ever seen. the calibre of the cast is amazing, you have actors from "the golden age of cinema", people like james stewart, gene kelly, elizabeth taylor, robert mitchum and jean simmons with other actors who were the new faces of the 80's like patrick swayze, james read, jonathan frakes, genie francis, philip casnoff and lesley-anne down.at the heart of the story is the friendship of two completely different men,there is orry main (patrick swayze) who is from the south and george hazard (james read) who is from the north. throughout the series, their friendship is continually threatened with the differences in their backgrounds, particularly about the treatment of slaves in the south (especially at orry's plantation) but when each needs the other, they will forget the arguments and go and help their friend. i really liked the chemistry between the two men and was really interested to see if their friendship could survive the war.i liked how the series showed what life was like before the war so the audience could see what were the factors that lead up to the war, what was going on at the time, then the devastation of a nation that was being torn apart and then the nation having to rebuild the country again. the war scenes were very well choreographed and very realistic to me.i think what is great about it, is it has so many elements running through it, romance, history, battles that would interest most of the audience, there is something for everyone. i particularly enjoyed the romance between brett (genie francis) and billy (parker stevenson/john stockwell) especially when she stood up to her sister ashton for the first time. the other romances were interesting as there were not all the same, each had something different to the others which kept me watching particularly the madeline and orry story strand to see if they would be together in the end.it is one of the best american mini series that i have watched, the story had the right balance of romance and the more serious history side that was happening in the country at the time but it is paced just right. the characters are very watchable and the locations are beautiful and the music particularly at the start and end of the episode is so toe-tapping good and works with the mood of the story.

this is one of the century's best tv-series ever with all the great suspense,story,and a cast of absolutely fantastic actors and love and grief that really gets you involved and captivated in front of your tv. if you have seen it once, you will go back to see it again. i have several times and still do it. the 20 th century's best drama.

i first saw this mini-series as a child and though i am a child no longer, i still love it!!! professional copies are hard to find, however, when it's on dvd, it's mine!!! =]great casting, marvellous plots, and plenty of action, romance, and even quite a bit of well-placed comedy. i'm not a historian by nature, but i love this masterpiece of historical fiction!

i have 2 complete sets from time life, this is my favorite movies of all time. love all the actors and actresses.. awsome picture..love patrick swazy..this is the film, that showed his true talent. but yet, he does not get credit for the display he preformed! much credit has been missed in these films.love the way they portrayed the dry and dusty monologs of the civil war..making it into one of the greatest love stories of all time, and showing through all obsticals of life, what true freindship means..how 2 divided countries split.but yet all and all the freindship remained solid, even though the war divided kinships and freindships up.but through it all, till the very end, they remained and taught us the viewer, how true freind ships can still remain till present day! simply the best..gone with the wind doesn't compare to this film.patrick swazy at his best,.after seeing this movie for the one hundred thousand time. i became a big fan of swazy..and have followed his career ever since..have all his movies after he made north and south!

this is a great movie, all 3 were. the last one was not as good as the first 2 but it was made along time after and it was pulling at straws. but you want to watch it cause it tells the end of the story. just not how we might think it should end.these movies made me want to be there to be in all the hardship, love, tears, and laughter that the people in this movie go threw. it is one of the few movies that is good every time you see it no matter how many times that is.there are some parts in the movie that the little kids wont understand and the older ones maynot be old enough to watch. but it is a great movie, spanning over 20+ years.

i agree with with of the messages on here that the book is not like the movie. i read the book as a sophomore in high school in sumter sc. i instantly fell in love with the book and eagerly awaited the release of the mini series. as much as i liked the movie and thought it was very well done, i was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book. i was glad the orry was not killed off like he was in love and war or n&s ii.having grown up in sc and graduating from university of sc, i fell in love with southern history because of this mini series and book. i had the honor of meeting john jakes at a symposium in 1988 at usc. i stayed around afterwards and meet mr.jakes. unfortunately, i did not get to ask him a question. but meeting him was honor enough. i majored in accounting but got my minor in southern studies. in addition, i patterned a lot of my mannerisms after orry main. orry and myself are very much alike. i feel i was born 150 years too late. i am a southern gentleman and very proud of this.well i fell in love with 2 women in the movie....genie francis and wendy kilbourne. man, did i have the hots for wendy!!!! i never quite could find a real life version of her. i hope one day too!!!

north and south (1985): patrick swayze, james read, lesley anne down, wendy kilbourne, terri garber, kirstie alley, genie francis, phillip casnoff, jean simmons, john stockwell, lewis smith, david carradine, inga swenson, jonathan frakes, wendy fulton, erica gimpel, tony frank, jim metzler, olivia cole, andy stahl, william ostrander, george stanford brown, robert mitchum, morgain fairchild, johnny cash, hal holbrook, gene kelly, david ogden stiers, john anderson, lee bergere, olivia de havilland, elizabeth taylor, forest whitaker, robert jones, ....director richard t. heffron, teleplay...paul f. edwards, patricia green, douglas heyes, kathleen a. shelley.based on john jake's successful paperback novels "north and south", "love and war" and "heaven and hell", this was a mini series on television from 1985 to 1987. its success owed more to the success of "roots" a similar civil war era/slavery soap opera televised about a decade earlier in the 70's. patrick swayze, at the beginning of his career and at the time he was doing many films like dirty dancing which would make him famous, stars as orry main, a plantation-born young man from south carolina who sets off to west point. here he meets george hazard (james read) who is supposed to be the hated enemy, the yankee north, but with whom he bonds closely. soon, the mains from the south and the hazards from the north become friends despite the turbulent era leading to civil war. the theme of family, friendship and doing the right thing even when the nation was falling apart is at the heart of this otherwise soap opera full of action and romance. clariss and ashton (jean simmons and teri garber) portray sisters who become enemies when one of them marries yankee billy hazard (john stockwell. garber's bitchy, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and evil ashton is fun to watch on screen. though the series didn't cover everything in jakes' novels, what we see is a condensed version of it and they changed a few things to make it a sort of historical romance with history lessons attached. the characters find themselves in all the major civil war scenes - harper's ferry where abolitionist and feminist virgilia hazard (kirstie alley) loses the love of her life, the ex-slave grady, fort sumter, vicksburg, antietam, gettysburg, appomatox and we are privy to the white house where we see abraham lincoln (hal halbrook) battle out the war in his conscience, we meet all the prominent players including lee, grant, sherman, jackson and davis. several veteran hollywood actors from the golden era - robert mitchum, elizabeth taylor and olivia de havilland have cameos and it's interesting to see them. this is not historical fact, it's historical fiction and purely dramatized entertainment. but it's got cliffhanger endings and beautiful cinematography, costumes and locations. it is like watching an epic movie that runs longer than gone with the wind with with war scenes in it! the script may be bad at times and the acting may not be the best, despite the good casting. swayze hams it up as does terri garber but some performances, like that of kirstie alley, james read (as george hazard)and leslie anne downes as the beautiful and strong madeline are really good performances. they shot in sets and in southern locations.the music is enchanting and this is a feel good film in which we root for the good guys and watch the villains scheme and ultimately get their comeuppance. all fans of civil war movies and the jakes novels should watch this. it's available on dvd and vhs.

this is one of t.v.'s greatest mini-series! it comes to life almost as well as the book did. also the cast was outstanding to play the roles. i'd recommend this movie series for anyone who likes the civil war or the history leading up to it.

even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to dvd was a blessing for all time. north and south truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. i can still remember the first time i caught a glimpse of this series on tv when i was about 8 years old. i though wow this looks exciting. to bad i never had the chance to see book one and two on tv in the netherlands. when book three was broad-casted as a late evening series in the netherlands in the summer of 2004 i just knew i had to see the other two series. to most people book three was a big disappointment as far as i know. well since i have seen book one on dvd, i must say that until now it is the best of the entire 3 books. to all youngsters who just watch the fancy movies like the patriot "oh america for freedom" there is a more realistic view to see for them here.....

this movie is very long, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. it has an all-star cast, and if you are a patrick swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) my mother is a civil war buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off tv), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. we had every line in the movie memorized, lol. pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance. it's a great movie for those that like action, war, blood & guts, but also for those with a soft, romantic side. the clothes the women wore were gorgeous! sometimes i think i was born in the wrong era, lol.

whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. this is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. the story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. the storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie. there are characters you will fall in love with, there are characters you will hate, and you will find yourself emotionally involved.both my wife and i loved it, and we will watch it again in a few years, i'm sure.

having just watched this with my mother (who got it for christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. all of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. the cast is amazing, my personal favourites being james read and lesley-anne down, as george hazard and madeline fabray/lamotte/main. the whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.

perhaps one of the best movies ever made. orry and goerge's friendship runs deep, and the war puts a strain on their strong friendship. as a southerner, i can honestly say this epic is as accurate as it gets. brothers fighting brothers. can you imagine what life must have been living during those times? the best part of the movie, for me, was when the south surrenders; general grant is urging president lincoln to really stick it to the south, he says, "mr. president, a lot of folks want the south to bleed over what they've done..." president lincoln, turns to him and in a very tired voice says, "the south has bled enough...and so have we..." i burst into tears, and take a deep breath. what a president! it's like a father saying his son has been punished enough, and despite his anger he realizes his point has been made. this war was a very dark time for our young country, and it had to be fought. president lincoln knew this. i'm urging everyone who reads this to watch this movie, and add it to your dvd collection. then, thank god that our country was preserved. as jesus said, a "house divided against itself cannot stand."

for me, north and south (books i&ii) is the ultimate tv series of the 80's. just spotting all those cameo appearances was highly entertaining.gene kelly, james stewart, elisabeth taylor, olivia de havilland, robert mitchum, even johny cash¬° no series has come close to this achievement.have you ever seen anyone looking like lincoln? dick smith's prosthetics made hal holbrock's powerful performance even more so. the crafted costumes, the jaw dropping locations, everything. it's clear that nowadays there are excellent and bright tv series (desperate housewives, lost,24) but north & south was, and still is, one of its kind. don't miss it. only david carradine's portrayal of the ultimate villain (you may call him just violent husband) worths the viewing. maybe some characters and situations are too stereotyped, i admit it but the positive sides clearly cast a shadow over them. i'm so glad that finally is available on dvd in spain.

this comment discusses "north and south book i" dealing with 1842-1861 periodthe 19th century history of the usa is mostly identified by people with the civil war (1861-1865). this is a reasonable opinion because that was civil war which put the union under the severe test; that was the civil war which made americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. from the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen. d.w. griffith, in the early 1900s, made his unforgettable birth of a nation. yet, the most famous film about the north-south clash is still, i suppose, gone with the wind (1938). unfortunately, fewer people know the magnificent tv series based on john jakes' novel, "north and south." it is the very best tv series ever made and the time spent on watching it is really precious. i taped it on my video from polish tv many years ago and have come back to it with great pleasure many times since then. why? firstly, the entire story is deeply rooted in historical reality. the two families, the maines from south carolina and the hazards from pennsylvania, represent two entirely different ways of life. in spite of that, friendship unites them. yet, what they experience is the struggle all people do: friendship attacked by "truth" of "political correctness", love attacked by hatred of "legal spouses", gentleness by strength of "social heroes". orry maine (patrick swayze) is my beloved character - someone who finds love and who is quickly deprived of her; someone who cares for friends but political fanatics step in the way and ruin much. finally, he is someone who can see the tragic future for his land but there is nothing he can do about the south's inescapable fate. his friend, george hazard, is similar in most aspects but sometimes he appears to have a stronger character. it is him who shows orry that although there are tragedies, he must get up from despair and live since life is the most precious thing we have. although they represent two different lifestyles, their friendship occurs to be stronger than any prejudice, politics or conflicts.other characters are also particularly well developed. there are villains, like justin lamotte or salem jones who are really wicked but most of the people are ambiguous as the nature of humanity has always been. charles maine is, at first, full of rebellion, prone to fighting, later, however, he learns to be a true southern gentleman for whom southern pride is not courageous words but foremost courageous deeds. virgilia hazard represents the most fanatical side of abolitionist movement striving to condemn slavery and punish the owners of "black breeding farms." her marriage with grady appears to be a symbol of equality but also a symbol of saying "no" to the politics of the south. two interesting characters are orry's sisters, brett and ashton - sisters in whose veins runs entirely opposite blood. brett, in her gentleness but also naiveness, believes in absolute fidelity. she marries billy, even though he is a northerner, because she truly loves him. brett is the representation of all that is precious in any young woman. ashton, however, is a vamp, a tigress, a woman who does not hesitate to do the most wicked things. the clear picture of their world views clash is their chat about men and family...unforgettable moment and how universal! most characters head for their values...yet, war breaks out and they'll have to put aside a lot...secondly, the performances... someone said that not all people act naturally. i wouldn't say that. i'd rather say that all cast do very good jobs in their parts from the main characters who are portrayed by younger staff to the guests that consist of famous stars, including liz taylor, robert mitchum and others. patrick swayze as orry does a great job. i consider this role one of his best ones. lesley anne down as madeleine is also very memorable. her part, perhaps, entails too much suffering but she manages to express all sorts of feelings really well. kirstie alley is very appealing and truly memorable as the abolitionist virgilia hazard. phillip casnoff is worth consideration as horribly ambitious elkanah bent as well as david carradine as a monster husband, disgusting justin lamotte. and, in contrast to him, a mention must be made of jean simmons who is truly excellent as orry's mother whose heart beats for the glory of family life and concord of union. thirdly, memorable moments of "north and south" leave an unfading trace in one's mind. who can forget the first meeting of orry and madeleine - what charm, what gentleness there is in this scene! or is it possible to skip the moment when madeleine's father dies? i found it really powerful, there is a real drama in this moment, a drama of a woman being left by someone who really loved her. i also liked churubusco sequence and george hazard so worried about the life of his dearest friend, orry. then his meetings with constance are terrific. virgilia's speech in philadelphia is a masterpiece of performance. and the final moment of the first part: although north and south may separate, their friendship will never die. orry and george symbolically join hands as the train moves on. simply, there are so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it's impossible to mention even half of them here. and these gorgeous tunes by bill conti and shot in brilliant landscapes. the music in "north and south" is very touching and memorable.what to say in the end? "north and south" is a real must have on dvd, simply an amazing tv series about the victory of all that is precious in us: love, friendship, loyalty, honor, truthfulness, absolute fidelity. 9/10

sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances ¬ñ though some folks are channeling rhett, scarlett, melanie and even lady macbeth. patrick swayze and james read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. splendid villains ¬ñ you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. lots of strong female characters in this one ¬ñ both good and bad. secondary story lines also are well developed. several cameos by major stars of past eras. good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics. curl up on a rainy day with your dvd or vhs player and drink of choice with this one. a lap rug and a cat would be optional.

lackawanna blues is a touching story about nanny, a woman who gives all of herself to help those in need. it's told from the viewpoint of a boy, taken in by nanny when his own mother isn't quite up to the task.i have respect for this movie for three main reasons: 1) it is touching, but not sappy. it's told in a very real fashion, without a lot of the aggravating hollywood storytelling baggage. and the ending is quite good (teary but not over-the-top).2) although it's clearly an african-american film, being set in the post-segregation black community of lackawanna, new york, it doesn't wear its ethnicity on its sleeve. the story stands on the strength of the characters and the dramas (and comedies) surrounding their lives. it's not preachy, it's simply good.3) it has a great soundtrack (can't beat old-school r&b and chicago blues).generally the acting is strong, but not universally so. some of the performances simply don't hold up to the characters the actors are supposed to portray. but considering it was a made-for-tv movie, that's to be expected.8 out of 10. imperfect but likable, good film for a rainy day.

kannathil muthamittal was simply one of the most touching and sincere movies ive seen in a long time. the story of an adopted girl who on her 9th birthday learns the truth about her parentage. she sets out in an endeavour to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is now a terrorist.the greatness of the movie lies in its simplicity. mani ratnam generally has a tendency to create unreal and pompous overblown characters in this movie, every person seems real and their interactions are touching and sincere. this is the reason why this ranks as one of his best movies.the movie is emotionally draining and tugs at the heart of the viewer, keerthana as the 9 year old amudha and simran as her adopted mother are simply brilliant. their relationship is the cornerstone of this movie. there are some notable flaws here, particularly the scene where amudha learns that she is an adopted child is jarring and seems totally unreal. it is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would break such a news in the manner that they did. another flaw is, surprisingly enough, the brilliant songs. they again seem forced and stand out, not gelling with the rest of the script.having said these, this still is one of the most poignant and beautiful movies to come out of india in a long long time. this beauty is not just in the script or characters but in teh technical brilliance as well, ravi chandran's camera work is sheer poetry. all characters perform creditably and the realistic humour, especially in teh flashback scenes are entertaining.a sincere 9!!

in sri lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-sinhalese government and the liberation tigers of tamil eelam (ltte), a separatist organization, has claimed an estimated 68,000 lives since 1983. human rights groups have said that, as a result of the war, more than one million people have been displaced, homeless or living in camps. the impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed tamil director mani ratnam in his 2002 film a peck on the cheek, winner of several awards at the national film awards in india. while the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girl's voyage of discovery, the human cost of war is made quite clear and ratnam gives the fighting a universal context, pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoing.beautifully photographed in southern india by cinematographer ravi k chandran in a setting mirroring the terrain of sri lanka, the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9-year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in sri lanka. played with deep feeling and expressiveness by p.s. keerthana in a memorable performance, amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents shyama (nandita das) and dileepan (j.d. chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out, leaving her in a red cross camp. in a loving flashback, we see amudha's adoptive parents, father thiru (madhavan) a prominent tamil writer, and mother indra (simran) a tv personality, marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker-skinned little girl.young amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday, according to the parents' prior agreement. while she is playing, thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that "you are not our daughter" and the response is predictable. distraught, she questions who her father was, what her mother's name was, why she gave her up, and so forth but few answers are forthcoming. amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to sri lanka to help her find her true mother, now a fighter for the tamil separatists. the family's immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions, handled mostly with skill by ratnam, though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurish.a peck on the cheek is of course a bollywood-style film and that means tons of music and melodrama. the melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors; however, i found the musical dramatizations of songs by a. r. rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick, high production techniques and fast-paced music video-style editing. yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the film's limitations. tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even within the country as being too clich√©d and commercial, yet a peck on the cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues. that it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute.

i am a big follower of indian movies especially malayalam and tamil.shame on india for not sending this movie as their official oscar entry. i have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up with.by the way to all we westerners, tamil cinema is more qualitative and very different from bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion.coming to the point what was india thinking when they sent a movie like 'devdas' to the oscars? that was a really a masochist move. i think they are trying to punish oscar judges with boredom by sending devdas since the judges toppled lagaan last year.'devdas' is just a brigthly colored but stale and predictable melodrama of love, fate and destiny. i would keep away from it. anyway, not sending a movie like kanathil muthital shows how much of a revamp indian administration needs to save them from poor administrators who lack intelligence. now i know why this country has so many issues. they are heavily talented but not showcased properly.

sri lanka... not a country i've ever given much thought to, i have to admit. i didn't even know it was near india, let alone that there has been a bloody civil war going on there since 1983. it seems that the rebels of the tamil minority have been in an ongoing conflict with the military regime that runs the country for many years, causing many deaths and widespread suffering on the island.mani ratman's latest film, a peck on the cheek, tells the story of a young girl named amudha, who is separated from her sri lankan parents by the war and raised by a young indian couple. amudha is a bright and mischievous girl, whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child. although her adopted parents love her as much as could be, and have raised her without prejudice along with their biological children, amudha cannot help but want to learn more about her biological family.mani ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film dil se, which hides a story about terrorism and politics inside a love story (or is it the other way around?). a peck on the cheek inhabits similar territory, but is perhaps more ambitious in the ground it covers. the central theme that binds the movie is of love between all the various members of a family, and especially that between a child and her adopted parents. it's a pretty honest and open look at feelings, that can be extremely touching and heartwarming at some times and quite painful at others. it's an emotionally complex film, with characters that are somewhat idealised but still behave in a very human way.the film revolves around 9 year old amudha, played with charm and vivaciousness by young actress p.s. keerthana in her first and only acting role. she's a princess and a monster, always getting into trouble but so disarmingly charming nobody can stay mad at her for long. the young actress is perfectly cast for the role, and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of her.a peck on the cheek has such an innocent name i was quite unprepared for the intensity of the experience. never has such a small act come with such an enormous emotional impact, i dare say. the film is a bold and artistic effort to explore issues that are not frequently covered on the silver screen.mani ratman's direction is superb, very confident and mature - the most sophisticated work i've seen from this director yet. the film is visually very stylish, with some excellent camerawork and imagery. a.r. rahman provides the film's soundtrack, which is not as good as his classic dil se or bombay music (based on first impressions at least) but still shows his great musical talent.i'm not aware of a dvd release for the film yet - i saw it in tamil with english subtitles thanks to the san francisco international film festival, of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight. the production is a truly world class effort, and i am sure it will be popular with western audiences as it begins to receive wider exposure.recommended.

i saw this film at the 2002 toronto international film festival.this is the first indian film i've seen in the tamil language, and while it does share some similarities with other indian films (wonderful music and choreography, sweeping storyline), the director attempts more than just to entertain. the film tells the story of amudha, a precocious nine-year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted, thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from india to war-torn sri lanka. gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point, though it is a simplistic one. amudha is played by p.s. keerthana, and she is one of the few child actors i've seen who can be precocious and yet not annoying. her charm and beauty held the film together.

reanhauer (bill roy) is the leader of a desert-dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people, only to have a heart attack himself! he ends up dying on an operating table, and for the sake of revenge, his spirit takes over the body of the title character (jill jacobson), who then proceeds to go about hacking and slashing until her fellow nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demon.while i know enough about the directors' filmography to know that it primarily consists of outright schlock, "nurse sherri" is really not all that bad. sure, it's clear that this was very low-budget stuff, yet all that i found egregiously cheesy about it were the visual effects. the acting is not as bad as one might expect, either.there are two different versions available of this on dvd. a much more sex-oriented version featuring bountiful amounts of t & a is the original cut, with such hilariously silly vignettes as the victim and and her love interest sharing their "strangest sex" moments, including one involving fellatio during a college lecture!the movie would then be re-cut for theatrical version with the horror elements emphasized more strongly. some scenes are dropped with new ones added (with stevens, the role played by j.c. wells, expanded). the movies' most memorable sequence in this cut is a scene in a foundry, and it works quite well. this cut of the movie is more interesting overall; i would recommend that a viewer see them both and compare them.both versions hit their stride in the final third, and benefit from a marvelously scene-stealing performance from bill roy as the crazed reanhauer, and a moody climax set in a graveyard (although actually filmed in adamsons' backyard!). marilyn joi is also worth mentioning as the cute nurse who is attracted to football player turned patient marcus washington (prentiss moulden), who's lost his eyes in a car accident, and who incidentally is key to resolving the story with his knowledge of voodoo rituals. the movie also makes amusing use of music from composer harry lubins' personal collection, including compositions for such tv series as 'one step beyond' and 'the outer limits'."nurse sherri" (known by more alternate titles (including "beyond the living" and "hospital of terror") than any other adamson movie) is actually fairly entertaining low-budget fare. i ended up having a good time watching it.7/10

i watched this film during a special advanced preview in reading, berkshire.the two main characters, michael and rory strike up a friendship, when rory is introduced to the care home that michael already resides. michael is amazed to find someone who can finally understand him, as until now his cerebal palsey made people think that he couldn't communicate. rory introduces michael to the life that he's missing. rory is a feisty character, who doesn't let his condition (muscular dystrophy) get to him.they bond and apply for independent living, and find a lovely flat and assistant and have all the fun that they could ever dream of.don't go to see this film if you are after some "entertainment". do go see this film if you're willing to see something a little different.the storyline is strong, the actors are fantastic and despite the sadness that comes with the film the mood is uplifting.i thoroughly recommend it. though if you are anything like me and prone to crying - take tissues, as you'll need them!

this is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you. i found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability, this was represented in a great performance by both two michael and rory. whether the story is based around a true story i feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human. on the whole this film reach into my soul and i too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity. the whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience, but i feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama. certainly one not to be missed!

bring a box of kleenex to this funny, engaging, and moving weeper. the two leading actors give tour de force performances - there was considerable debate afterward about whether they are really disabled (they are not.) i appreciated that for once the filmmakers dared to be politically incorrect by depicting people with severe physical disabilities as fully developed people, character flaws and all. as a result, their believability engages us and makes us grow to like them and care about their conflicts. the story structure is formulaic, and many of the secondary characters are merely types, but the two central characters are so riveting that it doesn't matter. interesting - the original title, inside i'm dancing, reflects the viewpoint of the character michael, while the new title for usa release suggests that rory is the central figure.

a stunning film which brought into the open so much about disability that generally makes people afraid. it showed how minds can be captured by less than willing bodies and how difficult it must be to witness things happening to others that are wanted for the disabled individual.love, friendship, fear, frustration, joy, humour and so many others things were so well captured. the 2 lead characters were very well played by the 2 able bodied actors and invited your laughter, tears, concern, joy and dismay.i approached this film with a mixture of interest and trepidation worrying that it might be too much a play for sympathy or dwell only on negatives. it was however a beautifully crafted story of 2 friends.i loved it.

this is by far one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time. top 20 of my lifetime. i laughed more than i have since hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, and cried more than i have since i saw the notebook. if you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. it is real and powerful. see it and you won't regret it. i was reluctant at first and i only watched it because i had to do a school project about speech disabilities. but this movie is so much more than that. it is about life, free and independent from the way the world would have you held down. its about the disabilities that each of us have that keep us from see ourselves and what we miss but letting everything else get in the way.

''meet sherri..for an evening of pleasure and terror!'' cheap special effects,cheesy lines,yep its the original 1978 movie ''nurse sherri'' starting geoffrey land as peter desmond,and jill jacobson as sherri martin and directed by al adamson.the movie is about an evil ancient spirit that possesses a nurse at a hospital,then she starts killing doctors one by one.the acting was okay but some of the acting was robotic.the storyline was good but the sex scenes were just thrown in there probably to get more views.the directing was bad,and the special effects looked like a drawing,the effects didn't fool anybody.the death scenes were pretty good but the director mixed too many things in there that didn't make any sense like the sex scenes,the nudity,the football player,and many more.overall its a good movie,but not the best.7 out of 10

this is definitely a movie that will make you think about the everyday struggles a person can go through every day. great acting by the two leading roles exemplifies this further, and you will not regret seeing this movie in any way.it's a heartwarming tale of two new friends exploring the ups and downs of everyday life seen from the seat of a wheelchair. their friendship is tested, as well as their spirits when they get their own flat outside the nursing home.i recommend this film to everyone who likes buddy-pictures or just wants to see a wonderful and heartwarming film that steers clear of all the clich√©s and pitfalls and not once gets soggy.

i was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. i was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. i guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. but i hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. the story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. this movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented. hopefully this movie will help us to understand some of their desires better and realize how important it is to have a friend in the world, especially when you almost unable to express that fact.

as a 'physically challenged' person (god, how i hate that phrase) i just happened to catch this on cable where there was absolutely nothing else to watch - overall, it was a fantastic movie. yes, i was a little disappointed upon finding out that neither actor is disabled, and yes, i was a little disappointed that more of the movie wasn't filmed from the 'true' point of view of the disabled (can you imagine what it's like always being the tallest person in the room and then having to live the rest of your life with a view of nothing but other people's asses and crotches? having to always wait for the idiot to stop reading the newspaper in the only handicapped stall, enduring everyone else's rude bodily expulsions while you wait?). and the scene with him driving the car was absolutely me! been there, done that, literally. but the movie was true enough to matter - while i've never lived in a home or assisted residence, there were plenty of times throughout the movie where i found myself nodding and saying to myself "yeah, that's true.... that's happened to me...." what impressed me is that some of the commentors on this board expressed the fact that the movie made them view life a little differently and with a little more insight as the lives of a silent 'minority' - can't ask more than that out of a movie, that it makes you think and view life differently, so by virtue of that alone, the movies was tremendously successful. should be required viewing of every kid in junior high school.pretty much for every person that's severely physically disabled, independence is one of, if not the most important focus of our daily lives, from working to socializing to recreating. for those of you who felt the movie was 'cliched,' try living our life for a single day - you'll see that the movie was 'cliched' because..... it's true. the challenges the actors faced only skimmed the surface of what happens to us every day - if we're lucky, we experience the same emotional and personal growth that the three characters (including the girl) did. every day presents obstacles for us to overcome - it's just that there's no swelling, dramatic music to accompany our lives, unless it's in our ipods.... lol!

i love just about everything the late al adamson directed in his long and varied career, but "the possession of nurse sherri" stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade-z schlockfests like "horror of the blood monsters" and "dracula vs. frankenstein". this film is actually scary! am i saying that you're going to jump out of your seat when you watch "nurse sherri"? no, of course not. but this pastiche of elements from "the exorcist", "ruby", and "carrie" is one of those nice, eerie little horror movies common to the seventies. you can't put your finger on what's so spooky about it, but the film drips with atmosphere. (and what an ending! don't worry, i won't spoil it for you.) adamson and producer sam sherman really nailed it with this one, and it doesn't matter whether "nurse sherri" was a calculated success or a happy accident. jill jacobson is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader (bill roy, who shines in his brief role). geoffrey land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend. there are some blaxploitative elements here (profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive-in flicks, after all) but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing. "nurse sherri" was a poverty row production, and it shows at times (sets, special effects, etc.). still, the film has heart, mostly decent acting and direction, and some genuine chills. sam sherman also saw fit to use harry lubin's theme music for the late '50s/early '60s television series "one step beyond" in this film, which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere. the dvd contains two significantly different cuts of the movie (the early version features a lot of t&a that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff) as well as the theatrical trailer, the tv spot, and a great commentary by sherman. does anybody know whatever happened to bill roy, by the way? next to john carradine, he's the best actor i've ever seen in an al adamson film, and he plays the cult leader like he means it.

what exactly do people expect when they watch an al adamson film? are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories? you'd think so by some of the reviews. al adamson's films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy, not much more, so if you go into them knowing that already it helps, and they aren't necessarily to be taken at face value, especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value. first off, this starts by ripping off the end theme music from outer limits, so you know things are looking promising. this is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body, the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital. of course nurse sherri tends to his needs and all, and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her. and nurse sherri begins to change. no longer the nice nurse, she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects. there's a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of sherri's co-workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo. this is not bad if you're a cult film fan, but it may be bad if you're a "spiderman" fan because you won't like it. at times this actually lurches towards "respectability" (for adamson, anyway) but then it "unredeems: itself with some ridiculous event. if you enjoy adamson's films and similar trash you may well like this, for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure, keep digging. 7 out of 10.

this is one of those games where you love it to bits or hate it to shreds.even being a hardcore mario fan can make you dislike this game.you can hate it because it is 2 short and somewhat boring and easy.or you can love it because it is a mixture of amazing graphics(not a nintendo fan huge excitement) music or game play.i know a lot of people that say it is amazing,and others who think its the worst mario ever.it really depends on the type of nintendo fan you are.i personally love this game and i think it is the best wii game,but you should determine that for yourself.so i think you should absolutely get it if you are the right nintendo fan.but if you love the classics too much,you may not like it.so try it out yourself.

every once in a while a film comes along with characters we all know and love. a film where you see people you know portrayed on screen. it's cinema very at its best.lackawanna blues is that film. set in 1960s upstate new york, the story surrounds a rock- solid woman, who is the foundation for her community. this, based on a true story film, is told from a child she accepted as her own. this child, ruben santiago-hudson wrote the screenplay.*emmy winner, s. epatha merkerson stars as nanny, a woman who has wit, drive and determination for helping others in her boarding home. she does this as she wrestles with infidelity from her young lover, bill crosby, played by the **oscar nominated terrence howard. but make no mistake; see this film for the amazing performance of merkerson, who is brilliant in this role. she encompasses a person we have all known, and perhaps love.lackawanna blues is already on dvd; be sure to pick it up at your local video story today.*merkerson has already won an emmy, golden globe and screen actors guild for this role.**howard has an oscar nomination for his role in hustle & flow.

ever since 1981, nintendo has been making great video games such as super mario and zelda. most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years. games made by nintendo never seem to get boring because they're always adding something new. it went from arcade games to the wii and i hear that there's a new version of the wii scheduled for release in 2011. the thing that makes wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons. and i have more good news. super mario galaxy 2 is to be released in 2010.

(warning: may contain spoilers) let rosalina help mario lead the way and smile because this game will brighten your day. 120 stars will require luck and skill, but 60 will bring you as much of a thrill!blasting through stars show mario and luigi and what travelers they now are! walking upside down has never been more fun, especially a final battle with koopa near the sun! this is truly a super awesome game and it absolutely deserves a place in nintendo's hall of fame!

like some other people wrote, i'm a die-hard mario fan, and i loved this game. this game starts slightly boring, but trust me, it's worth it. as soon as you start, your hooked! the levels are fun and exiting. they will hook you 'till your mind turns to mush. i'm not kidding. this game is also orchestrated, and is beautifully done. to keep this spoiler free, i have to keep my mouth shut about details. but please try this game! it'll be worth it!story: 9.9 action: 10.1 (it's that good!) hardness: 10 attention grabber: 10 average: 10

the mario series is back, and in my opinion, better than ever. galaxy is the most creative mario yet; even more so than super mario 64. the controls are great; some of the best for the wii. beautiful graphical design as well. the levels are very big, and the good old bosses are back. there is tons to explore in this game; definitely a high level of replay value. i only have 2 complaints: 1: the story is a little to similar to mario 64. and 2: the difficulty isn't very high; though it does require some patience. mario fans: the game you've been waiting for. casual gamers: this game is more than worth the buy. 9.8 out of 10.

*this comment will probably have spoilers!! i checked the spoilers box just in case but it might not have spoilers, but be aware anyways if i say something that you might consider a spoiler and i don't!* wow...best game since super mario 64. i got this game the first day it came out, and before i got it, i went on some gaming websites to look at its ratings (yes, they already reviewed it before it came out), and i was shocked. i was expecting something like sunshine because lately all the mario games have kind of been getting worse and worse. but this one totally beat the other games. the scores on this game even beat halo 3! it's simply amazing.story: not the best, mario games are never known for their plots, and this one isn't really much of a difference. bowser once again kidnaps peach but this time invades the mushroom kingdom on a festival celebrated once every century and gets a flying saucer and it shoots lasers on the ground and then they put anchors inside the ground and rip off the castle and its foundation into outer space.graphics: absolutely gorgeous, the best graphics on wii so far. the water effects are really nice too, if you ever see the water, it looks so real because the effects they put in it.music: simply amazing, the music in this game is orchestrated. not all of it, but even the ones that aren't orchestrated still sound very nice.gameplay: very entertaining, keeps you wanting to play more and more, and for me, since usually i tend to be very frustrated with games if i die a lot, i mean, i'm definitely not the only one, but this game for me didn't have that a lot. now it still kind of did, but not to the point like mario 64 where i totally go crazy and end up turning off the game because it made me mad, this one never did that.difficulty: there are two types of difficulty, because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 stars, which i think is kind of easy, but to beat the game 100%, you have to get 120, like always, and that quest is way harder, but at the same time still very fun.length: good length, definitely not too short. it took me around 15-16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars, but 120 took me more like 45-50 hours. now i didn't play it constantly that much, i played first a lot one day, then the next couple of days just a couple hours each day, then the next two days i played it all day. to me though, i think the quest for 60 stars was a tiny bit short, so if you want a long game, i suggest getting all of them.presentation: now, the cinematic scenes in this movie are superb. the way they are, it just looks so much like something i would see in the theaters. they are hands down the best cinematic scenes on any mario game so far.overall: this game is definitely a great game, and i advise you to not wait until christmas, get it as soon as possible. this game also is a good mixture of old and new, you'll have some sidescroller levels where you move just side to side, or up and down because they'll change on gravity, but even the music has some old classics in it. so this game seems to be like a masterpiece. to me, it's my favorite mario game of all time, but others may disagree. but it's still a great game. i recommend every gamer who wants to have fun in a game to get this.

this has to be one of my 3 favorite episodes from the original tv series.what makes it great is the battle of wits between the romulan commander and kirk, as well as the top-notch acting from mark lenard, who later went on to play spock's father in other tv episodes and movies. this is a case where those around rose to the level of the talent around them, and shatner, nimoy, and the whole cast deliver an outstanding performance in this episode.the writing and plot are also excellent, and i love the direct approach used to show us the characters, and the feelings and thoughts of those characters, and how freely they are expressed by the actors. this very entertaining episode ranks 10 out of 10. awesome!! desert-buddha

when the romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. as any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film "the enemy below" from the fifties. the obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an american destroyer & german u-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. in trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, earth fought the romulan wars. after about 5 years of conflict, a stalemate brought about a treaty and the institution of the neutral zone, a boundary between us and the romulan empire. now, on this stardate, the treaty appears to be broken, as our outposts are being attacked and destroyed by some weapon of immense power. yes, the romulans are back, testing their new war toy, and kirk must now earn his pay: he must make decisions that would affect this sector of the galaxy, such as figuring out how to avoid a...oh, i dunno - an interstellar war, maybe? i think what makes this episode so effective is that it doesn't shy away from the grim aspects of war, as one would expect of a mere tv episode from the sixties - especially an episode from a science fiction show. it's all very tense and gripping, like the best war films, such as when kirk sits down with his key officers for what amounts to a war council. the writers and the actors aren't kidding around here: this is all preparation for a ghastly conflict, potentially the beginning of another years-long battleground. in the final analysis, kirk's aim is to keep this battleground to just the two ships - but even then it's an endeavor fraught with peril and probable casualties. in fact, i believe this episode holds the record for ship casualties by the end of it. right at the start of the episode, we see the devastation such battle can produce, in that supposedly well-protected outpost. then begin the cat-and-mouse war games between the enterprise and the romulan ship - it's as exciting as any conflict we've seen on the big screen. of course, if you're not into war films, you'd have to look for other things to admire in this episode.what elevates this episode even further is the revelation of just what and who the romulans are - it's an electric shock of a sort. now we have even further inter-crew conflict on the bridge of the enterprise - war does tend to bring out the worst in some people. due to still nasty attitudes about race in this future, the tension is ratcheted up even further - kirk has his hands full in this one. i suppose the one weakness in the story is the convenient relenting of the bigotry issue by the conclusion. on the romulan side, actor lenard makes his first appearance in the trek universe as the romulan commander; he's terrific in the role, the flip side of capt. kirk or capt. pike, take your pick, done up to resemble spock more than a little. surprisingly, his character is not war hungry as we would expect, another eye-opener for this episode. the actor would next return to this universe as sarek, spock's father, so he's nothing if not versatile. it's also telling how the first appearance of such characters as the romulans is usually their best shot, as it is here. they showed up in "the enterprise incident" next.

"balance of terror" is still one of the best star trek episodes ever made. it was inspired by the film "enemy below" (starring robert mitchum), a movie that deals with a cat-and-mouse game between two captains during world war ii. in this episode, captain kirk and his crew play similar game with a romulan vessel. this is the program that famously introduces the war-hungry romulans, who are distant relatives of the vulcans. it is an incredibly suspenseful episode, tightly constructed for maximum effect. it is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra layers of meaning to the story. mark lenard makes his star trek debut as the romulan captain (he will later play spock's father ambassador sarek). a must-see episode!

engaging characters, nice animation, dynamite songs...all this and cute kitties, too. there's a lot of excellent humor, but no real menace, so don't worry about your little ones. the two farm dogs steal the show, even though they only appear in two scenes. the artwork has a linear quality that may put off some people, but i find it charming.

*may contain spoilers*the first time i saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when i was around 8 years old. now i am 17 and still watch it whenever i get a chance to. "the aristocats" was a cute heart warming film that i immediately fell in love with. i loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. in fact i even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since i loved it that much. all three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats i ever saw. the ally cat had a great voice!my favorite part of the movie is when the kittens are playing the piano. that part is adorable. i also enjoy their journey home. it's incredible. this is one of the best disney films i ever saw and one of my favorites. everyone should see it. i give this film 10/10 stars.

this is one of my favorite films, ever. the story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. unlike the other disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 dalmations, peter pan, robin hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. this is funny, creative, and always on target. this movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. however, this is not the best animated film ever made. that title belongs to the brilliant toy story. but this is a respectable second, immediately followed by the lady and the tramp.just see it and enjoy what one of the cinema's greatest achievements. and by the by, i'm not a little kid, this is for the older audiences wanting to recapture their childhood. an absolute must!

i have seen this movie only once, several years ago. but i remember liking it a lot.**spoilers ahead** an old famous opera singer is retired and she decides to give all the money she has to her cats. her butler hears this and plots to get rid of the cats so he can have the fortune. he puts knockout drops in their milk. when they wake up, they find themselves miles away. they must journey back to their house before it is too late. with the help of an independent-minded tomcat and other animal accomplices, while evading the butler and foiling his plan.could have been better, but it also could have been a lot worse.my score: 7/10.

following the release of 'snow white and the seven dwarfs (1937),' walt disney productions has continued to produce quality animated feature-length children's film, many of which i still haven't had the pleasure of seeing. 'the aristocats (1970),' directed by wolfgang reitherman, was the twentieth film in disney's official canon, and is a romantic musical comedy revolving around a family of aristocratic cats living in paris, france in 1910. in the mansion of the elderly madame adelaide bonfamille (voiced by hermione baddeley), her loving feline pets ¬ñ including duchess (eva gabor) and her three young kittens ¬ñ are the most important residents. when the bumbling butler, edgar (roddy maude-roxby), learns that the cats stand to inherit the old lady's entire fortune, he sets about disposing of the pets, dumping them in the countryside far from the big city. lost and confused, duchess and her children strike up an acquaintance with a sweet-talking alley cat, thomas o'malley (phil harris), who agrees to show them the way home.animation-wise, 'the aristocats' isn't anything particularly notable, with much earlier disney films such as 'snow white¬Ö' and 'fantasia (1940),' demonstrating a similar, or even superior, visual style. however, the story is interesting and exciting ¬ñ particularly for younger audiences, i'll wager ¬ñ and the musical numbers {which i wish were more numerous} are terrific. for the sake of trivia, i'll name my two favourite songs as "thomas o'malley cat" and "ev'rybody wants to be a cat," the latter of which is a psychedelic throwback to the late 60s, with a swinging jazz band and delirious flashing colours, led by a trendy feline called the scat cat (scatman crothers). the family's journey back to paris is eventful and adventurous, and we meet such friendly characters as amelia and abigail gabble {two talkative geese}, uncle waldo {the pair's drunken relative}, georges hautecourt {madam bonfamille's ancient but sprightly lawyer} and napoleon and lafayette {two dim-witted hound dogs with a hunger for the butler's rump}.

after seeing the aristocats: special edition in a two pack with the fox in the hound, i decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.the aristocats is a classic, definitely. it might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. it is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious disney classics. the aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and i think it just about succeeds.the storyline doesn't really make much sense and i don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak. the animation and backgrounds are a bit scratchy in places, typical of disney's 70s films, but it does have a rustic, old fashioned charm about it.the aristocats strongest points are the characters, the music and the humour. the music is very memorable - try getting 'everybody wants to be a cat' out your head in a hurry! the songs are written by the sherman brothers, who also did the music for the jungle book. there was one song called 'she never felt alone' that was going to be in the film, but sadly didn't make it into the final feature. it is a shame, because i think it would have fit in very well.the characters are unforgettable. thomas o'malley is voiced by phil harris, and is basically baloo in a feline form. eva gabor gives duchess this warm and maternal feel and the kitten's voices actually sound like children, and not an actor imitating the voice of a child. the secondary characters are here by the dozen and yet you still end up understanding their personalities. edgar, the 'villainous' butler plays a similar role to cruella de vil, but he's more comical than scary, often ending up in funny situations. even though he's the bad guy, he's still lovable all the same.the two british geese - abigail and amelia really had me cracking up, along with their crazy (and drunk) uncle. i also like the dogs, who tend to argue over who is 'the leader.' i could go on, but i won't spoil it. but i can tell you, the aristocats is funny and will entertain everyone without having to resort to rudimentary toilet humour.the bottom line - the aristocats might not be disney's crowning achievement, or even their strongest film from the 70s (that award is a tie between the rescuers and the many adventures of whinnie the pooh). but it is an enjoyable romp and is sure to entertain. if you are looking for a dazzling work of art, you might be better off watching bambi. but if you want a fun night in, the aristocats is the way to go. it is a charming and lovable film and it's impossible to dislike. enjoy! (and besides, it's good to have a film where cats aren't seen as the villains).

duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. how can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of paris? only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat o'malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. after they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse. as always, it's really the voices rather than the animation that are the heart of the disney magic: phil harris is brilliant as o'malley, eva gabor as duchess is... well... eva gabor; but perhaps the most memorable turns are by pat buttram and george lindsay, who turn the old hounds napoleon and lafayette into a couple of bumbling southern-fried rednecks. their scenes with edgar, and the musical numbers with scat cat and his cool-dude band, are classic. most striking about seeing the aristocats now is how deeply disney's style of animation has changed since this was at the cutting edge in 1970. perhaps the nostalgic, dated feel are just a result of being plonked down in belle epoque paris, but the illustrations are fussier (a pity) and the animation and overall pace much less frenetic (sometimes a relief) than in more recent efforts such as aladdin.

when "madame" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. the snobbish butler edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. an adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat o'malley. he helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.the force of this movie is in its humor and music. edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings. one of the best scene contains him being chased by the two dogs lafayette and napoleon. the score is great and like in "the jungle book" you have scenes that is almost "musical" in the sense that the story doesn't progress and the focus is to let the protagonists express themselves via dance. and of course we like, that the score is quite jazzy.and of course it's not only me but also my children who love this one.regards simon

a group of cats look to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy butler.the aristocats is regarded as one of walt disney's finest 2d animations with its charming script and cool characters, but it doesn't quite have the magic that created snow white or the jungle book.the slow opening will have younger viewers raising their eyebrows but once the cats become established into the story does the fun and entertainment begin.the young cats create the most enjoyment with a charming young hearted rivalry, the special kind of bonding any brother or sister of any age can associate with.not the funniest disney picture out there but there are some great comic moments, especially involving the cats and the dogs. the representation of the gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusing.the story, after the boring beginning, is consistently entertaining and exactly what a family film should be. there are hardly any lapses and no dull moments. the journey to find home is interesting and you get a sense of exploring, not to mention two very strange british swans.with disney, you always get a strong meaningful message. with the jungle book it is where you belong, with beauty and the beast you explore the importance of inner beauty. however with this 1970 picture there seems to be something missing. the film has the importance and relevance of home but is not cemented enough; it seems very far fetched and irrelevant.my sister and i found it very strange watching this as some of the central characters were voiced by the jungle book cast.despite the bad beginning and the confusion of its preaching message, this is a consistently fun family film with a good music score and some cool crazy characters that viewers of any age can relate to.

walt disney's 20th animated feature was the last one to be greenlighted by the great man himself (he died in late 1966) and is not generally considered to be among their very best output. the main problem is that, on the surface, the film seems merely to be the feline version of either lady and the tramp (1955) or 101 dalmations (1961) both of which are certainly more beloved by fans even so, being both an animation and cat lover, i dug this reasonably bouncy concoction in which a pampered female cat (voiced by eva gabor) and her three little kittens are thrown out onto the streets of paris by a wealthy lady (hermione baddeley)'s greedy butler. luckily, they meet a streetwise alley cat (phil harris) who guides them on the journey back and are further aided along the way by a feline jazz band (led by scatman crothers) and two helpful and amiably dopey dogs; meanwhile at home, edgar the butler celebrates his supposed inheritance and the mouse and the horse do their bit to help their fellow feline pets. legendary entertainer maurice chevalier was whisked back from retirement to sing the title song (which includes a verse in french) and scatman's band indulge in a breezy number "ev'rybody wants to be a cat".

the aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on imdb. the songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the jungle book, but they weren't bad at all. the animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of paris in general. it looked beautiful. this is probably disney's most relaxing animation i think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? another great piece of animation was o' malley looking into duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.(a good thing)the plot(about a greedy butler and a fortune, reminds me of bailey's billions) was a little unoriginal, but worked very well, and the script was really funny, especially the fights between the kittens. they remind me of me and my brother and 3 sisters, always fighting. my favourite scene was the chase of edgar with the two dogs, who were always fighting about who was the leader. the voice talents were a delight, most notably phil harris, whom i recognised from the jungle book, and eva gabor, from the rescuers. the supporting characters, namely scat cat, were also well done. in conclusion, a really pleasant film, that is definitely underrated. 8.5/10 bethany cox

"the aristocats" is classic disney at it's best. it's not considered as the ultimate disney classic along side the more well-known disney-films, but it's a well-made and fun film that certainly deserves to be a disney classic. "aristocats" is certainly a sure kids-pleaser, cause it has all the components for a fun kids film. i'll liked it very much as a kid. i'm not sure if this film is a sure pleaser to the adults, who could watch disney classics for the nostalgia sake, but i still enjoy this film as an young adult.storywise, "aristocats" may not be so complex or innovative, but it doesn't matter. this film was made on that period where the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were the story and wise versa, which "aristocats" certainly shows. the characters make the film; they're all likable, fun, have great lines and have a great interaction with each other. the voice actors are also a part for making the characters so compelling (eva gabor as duchess, phil harris as thomas o'malley and etc). a misconception could have been the dogs napoleon and lafayette, since they're showstoppers and haven't so much to do with the actual story, but fortunately they're fun and amusing characters and the scenes with them are pure gold."aristocats" is both entertaining and cute, but it's also a very funny cartoon. the animation style and look fits perfectly for the film's french surroundings (especially the city of paris looks greats). the character animation and design is great. and the songs are really catchy too. my favorite is "scale and arpeggios", but the title song is a cute song, along with "thomas o'malley cat" and the memorable show-stopper "everybody want's to be a cat". and the score by george burns is a perfect fit for the film funny and emotional situations.overall, "aristocats" is in my opinion the best disney cartoon from the 70's and it's a film that deserves to both be seen and remembered. so what you're waiting for? do your self a favor and share this disney classic with your kids. it deserves to be in their memories.

i'm not a massive disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. we first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! ok, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.great characters, phil harris stealing the show as thomas o'malley, but edgar the butler not far behind. the music is superb - my disabled son always insists that i lift him up and dance with him to "everybody wants to be cat" this says it all. and "thomas o'malley" is just as enjoyable.i'm not sure why some people have such a downer on this film other than a dislike of cats! and yes, it does take a few of its cues from "101 dalmations", and maybe "the lady and the tramp" (it's been a long time since i've seen that, so i'm not going to compare them), and while "101 dalmations" is better in some ways, for me "the aristocats" is far more enjoyable. isn't that what these films are about? apart from "peter pan" (now that is a 10/10 film), this is my favourite disney film. my 7 year-old son loves it, his grumpy 41 year old dad loves it, so you can't ask much more of a family film.superb!

oh my gosh!! i love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is so incredible......i loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult. it is my favorite disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! you should watch it, watch it and love it. my friends and i watch it a ton.....it is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. i recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart. my favorite part is the song and dance number with all of the strays and thomas o'malley. the writers/producers/director completely nailed this one.....yeah, nailed it to the wall.xoxo~wolly~xoxo

plot in a nutshell - duchess (voice of eva gabor) is the well polished single mother cat of three little kittens. when their owner, the wealthy elderly woman known as madame adelaide, realizes that her time is running out she decides to write up her will, leaving everything she has to her cats, which will then go to her butler edgar when the cats pass on. edgar overhears this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would get everything before him, and plots to destroy duchess and her kittens; he drops sleeping pills in their supper one night and then leaves them stranded in the french countryside. out of their element, duchess and her kittens befriend a street smart stray cat known as thomas o'malley (voice of phil harris who did the voice of the big bear balloo in the jungle book); after making a pass at duchess, unaware that she is a single mother, o'malley decides to escort them back home, with duchess genuinely falling for o'malley as the usual codependent surrogate family bond develops; chaos and mayhem ensues, culminating in a violent clash between o'malley, his brother cats from the streets and edgar. also features appearances by british geese, american southern hound dogs (what they were doing in france is anyone's guess), a mouse who sounds a lot like the rabbit from "alice in wonderland" (he was in fact voiced by the same guy who voiced winnie the pooh) and a horse. sometimes slow paced but still enjoyable disney venture. features the memorable "everybody wants to be a cat" musical piece sung by the late scatman crothers (better known to 1980s fans as the voice of jazz on transformers). of course, if this was being made now, it would probably be a dark social commentary on class division represented by the divide between well bred & well fed duchess and the street born o'malley.

duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in paris. when the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. so he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. when the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. a street wise cat named thomas o'malley meets up with them and offers to help them. when edgar sees them arriving home, he is furious, and starts to mail them to timbucktu. but thomas' friends arrive to help save the day. the wealthy lady decides to leave her home for every alley cat in paris.this is a charming film. the songs, including "everybody wants to be a cat", are lively and upbeat. the voice cast is excellent, with eva gabor(who would later play miss bianca in disney's the rescuers films) as duchess, phil harris(baloo in the jungle book, little john in robin hood) as thomas, giving interesting personalities to their characters. supposedly walt disney, before he died in 1966, gave the go-ahead to this film. recommended for disney fans or cat lovers everywhere! 10/10.

this movie is great i really enjoyed it.this movie is about a cat mom named dutchess and her 3 kittens.t dutchess and the kittens love music.they have to practice the piano everyday.but the butler named edgar tries to kidnap dutchess and her kittens he tries to make them sleep. but he fails. them dutchess meets a cat named thomas o maily. thomas falls in love with dutchess. the cats break into song. with the song everybody wants to be a cat. thomas gets to love music like the other cats. thomas and dutchess really like each other.i loved this movie and i like the cats to!

this is one of my favourite disney films. it has everything you could hope for in a disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. the story begins in paris, where aristocat duchess and her three kittens live with their mistress in a mansion. life is perfect for them until the mistress' fiendish butler edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. he realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way. an excellent, often forgotten masterpiece from the 1970's - a time when the disney studio made few animations - which features songs such as the title number "the aristocats" as well as "ev'rybody wants to be a cat", this will enchant viewers young and old with its enduring jazziness.

there are a select few cartoon films where animals or something "not human" is portraying human beings and i think that this film is one of them. apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. although - it's good someone did not - i feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)this film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a disney film. it mentions alcohol*, shows a dog teaching another dog how to attack "tresspassing" humans and it shows a male cat called (abraham delacy gieuseppe casi thomas) o' malley, fancying a female cat, in a surprisingly human and adult way.as a cartoon film - or just a film in general, i feel this is pretty good quality - the storyline and characters are especially good. the film (in general) is set in france and you meet a family of cats - the mother duchess and her kittens marie, toulouse and berlioz. you also meet the kind (rich) old woman who adores the cats, the butler edgar and an old man (who has clearly lost his marbles) called george. the kind old woman discusses her will with george and edgar overhears that what he receives from the will he will have after the cats have it. he is incredibly cross with this - and has an evil scheme in mind...a very cute film for every age - enjoy "aristocats"!*not including "basil the great mouse detective" and a few others maybe which i cannot think of at the moment.

i must say one big reason why i thought the aristocats was so great is because i love cats!!!!i love cats,which probably gave this film a big score from me,but not only that,it was definitely a good movie as well,and i love where they make the setting of the film take place.this is one of my favorite animal films,although it's animated,and i really love how the actors\actresses didn't sound so unprofessional behind the animals' voice's.to me this film seems like a classic,but i guess to imdb it's not,because it has,yes i think too low of a rating.you take a peek at all the other "original" disney films and they have a much higher rating than this,but nonetheless aristocats is one of the best animation movies there is and i could enjoy it over and over again!!

the aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. there is nothing wrong with it at all. it's my favorite of the disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. like beauty and the beast, snow white, and peter pan. the reason why the aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. i hate to say this, but i don't blame edgar for what he does. i probably would've had them taken care of too. i'd be devastated of some old bag who i'd been working with for so many years just decides to give her will to the cats. i'd of killed them also. i don't even like cats, so i wouldn't give a damn. i think that the aristorcats is so funny and cute. there are many characters that are hilarious, like edgar. the aristorcats is my favorite of the disney classics, and that's final. the cat's out of the bag.the aristorcats: ****/****

as the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, i adore aristocats. it is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the "best" kids movies these days. the story line is sweet and interesting. the music is great. the love story is quite romantic. the kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. the action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. the characters are quite well-cast as well. i love listening to eva gabor's velvety voice, and there are so many others that are familiar from childhood and also fit the characters so well. it's really a movie about love, tolerance, good manners, and faithfulness. who doesn't want their kids exposed to these values? it is a movie that i don't mind watching over and over, unlike happy feet where i couldn't watch the whole thing even once because it was so irritating. i wish production companies would move toward making movies more like this one.

the first disney animated film without the strong involvement of disney himself, this film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting (this is, i believe, the only animated disney film since the 1940's which is not based on an earlier book or other work, but is rather an original story). as others have noted, the plot is essentially a cross between the romance in lady and the tramp and the kidnapping/journey home story in 101 dalmatians.but to overcome this flaw, the filmmakers have successfully used many of the better features of most of the disney animated films of the previous 10-15 years: phil harris (from the jungle book) voicing one of the main characters, follows his duet with louis prima in the previous film with another here with scatman crothers. the quality visual look of this film is virtually carried over from "dalmatians" (with some nice nods to french impressionism, it appears), and the villain here (the butler) is strongly reminiscent of the henchmen in that film as well. (this is probably one of disney's least memorable villains.) the main story goes back and forth between the cats, and the butler's ongoing difficulties with two rural hound dogs (with great voice work by pat buttram and george "goober" lindsey"). the various animal characters are similarly familiar to those who have seen "tramp" and "dalmatians." the cats' owner, while bearing a striking visual resemblance to the wicked stepmother in sleeping beauty, bears none of that character's nasty traits and comes across as very warm and generous.the real strength of the film is the voice work; after first going toward the use of mostly familiar actors in the jungle book, the tactic is continued strongly here with disney veterans harris and sterling holloway from the jungle book, and eva gabor (who would do a very similar character in the later film the rescuers), as well as crothers and nancy kulp. all are excellent here, particularly harris and gabor in the leads. the character animation is as excellent as one would expect, showing a variety of emotions well.smaller children may be upset by a few brief episodes (an escape from the path of a speeding train, a near-drowning by one of the children), but these are not presented in a particularly frightening or dark manner and are over very quickly. overall, there's very little of the type of more frightening scenes found in many other disney classics.one minor oddity is the way some visual aspects of 60's culture are depicted among the jazz-performing cats in supposedly 1910 paris; one can't help but wonder why the story wasn't set solidly in the present, other than the great deal paris had changed much of its appearance in the intervening time. it really would have made more sense that way.the songs, while being pleasant and sometimes very enjoyably performed, are not particularly memorable. nonetheless, the general energy applied here, the excellent voice work and fine animation all contribute to overcome the relatively few and minor weaknesses. far from the greatness of classic "10"s such as pinocchio or aladdin, and not quite up to the "9"s one might give to sleeping beauty or 101 dalmatians, this is probably a rather marginal 8 of 10; perhaps a 7.

this film promises much but delivers little. the basic problem has to do with the inclusion of charlotte gainsbourg's character in this film. immigrants from sicily did not need a redheaded anglo in any way--the movie may have needed her, but new citizens certainly did not. in my opinion,the decision to include her destroys the continuity of the film. this is particularly troubling since it seems to demean not only the characters in the movie, but also the history of immigration itself. immigrants themselves were heroic figures, fully capable of getting along without having to satisfied what i believer to be a veiled image of "the white man's burden." i wonder if someone will make a movie of irish immigrants which will include a sicilian woman as a major character. the left elbow index considers seven aspects of film--acting, production sets, dialogue, artistry, film continuity, plot, and character development--on a scale from high of 10 for excellent, 5 for average, and 1 for needs help. both film continuity and plot rate a low of 1. the continuity as discussed above is further degraded by the surrealistic ending. does not a film of such important historical significance deserve more than a conclusion which reminds one of marc chagall? the plot is simple enough, until it seems to become entangled with too much time in the old country, too little time on the ship, and too much emphasis on the ending. the acting and character development is average since all the characters are fixed throughout the film, and the inclusion of the anglo-saxon speaking perfect english almost turns the movie into a satire. where's groucho when you need him? the production sets, the dialogue and the artistry are very good, each rating a 10. the sets in sicily, on the ship, and on ellis island are as good as one can find. the dialogue is marvelous, and the ethic singing is superb. i agree with scorsese that listening to the sicilian dialect is a pleasure. note that the immigrants speak of "america", not the "united states"--the ideal vs. the political reality. the are many good artistic scenes, with dreams of america, gold coins raining, and giant veggies among the best. the average left elbow index is 5.25, raised to a 7.0 when equated with the imdb scale. one other notion seems to run through ellis island experience: the tribulations of pass immigrants was grueling, later, in 2006, one only had to pay a coyote or boat owner and sneak into the county under the darkness of night, no questions asked! the movie is worth seeing, but it appears that what one sees is problematical.

this film played in lexington ky for 7 days. i saw it on the last day of its run & regretted that i could not recommend it to others because this is a film that cries out for the big screen experience. the aerial shot where the crowded ship pulls away from the equally crowded dock is a masterpiece as is the scene where the two lead characters flirt on deck--almost a ballet and sexier in its suggestiveness than so many more explicit films these days. i just cringe to think that more people won't have the opportunity to see this fine film in a theater; the dvd experience will not be the same. here's an idea: if you live in a college town, see if you can lobby for it to show up in a campus film festival.

this is a film notable for what is not shown as much as for what is. what is shown is the incredible poverty in sicily as the 19th century gave way to the 20th, a life style that made people dream of the 'new' world of america. the mancuso family live in a place that is not even a hamlet, just a stone cottage set amid the harsh, unyielding stones of a country that cannot offer even a single blade of green grass. an opening sequence sees the mancuso males scrambling barefoot up a craggy hillside, stones in their mouth to offer at a shrine at the top in exchange for a 'sign' that they should set out for the new world or remain where they are. it further shows life aboard the liner, huddled masses indeed, yearning to breathe free, and conditions in ellis island where, their journey still not over, they are interrogated and examined to prove their 'fitness' to enter america. what is not shown is the ship in longshot, or indeed any shot that would identify it as a large, ocean-going liner; what is also not shown is anything that would identify america, no clich√© view of new york harbour and the statue of liberty, so that ellis island could be anywhere in any country. perhaps the most remarkable shot is the one from a camera crane looking down on hundreds of people jammed together; slowly, almost imperceptibly two thirds of the people at screen left begin to separate from the third at screen right and we realize that those on the left are actually aboard the ship and those on the right are on the dock, a powerful statement of society being fragmented. there's a strong documentary feel throughout as though we were following an actual ship full of immigrants even though it has been carefully scripted and is clearly an amalgam of typical families/conditions at the time. with almost nothing happening in dramatic terms it's not for the popcorn brigade at the multiplex but for the rest of us it's a very fine film indeed.

"nuovomondo" was a great experience. many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. emanuele crialese directs his film very visually driven. for everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. particularly european cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young us-american directors are strongly influenced by that). crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me. it has also a very interesting topic that is wrapped up in a quite unusual story and told with humour. vincenzo amato is outstanding as family head salvatore, as well as the amazing charlotte gainsbourg, who i enjoy watching in every single one of her movies. there are many great sequences in this movie. just to pick one: when the ship leaves italy and the people just quietly stare. this scene is great, particularly if you consider the pop cultural references that go with it (titanic!).

the golden door is the story of a sicilian family's journey from the old world (italy) to the new world (america). salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. in short, they believe that by risking everything for the new world their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. the imagery of the new world is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative. silver coins rain from heaven upon salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he'll be in the new world; carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health, and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the new world will yield. all of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience. the contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the sicilian people helps provide hope while they're aboard the ship to the new world.the voyage to the new world is shot almost in complete darkness, especially when the seas tempests roar and nearly kill the people within. the dark reality i referred to is the old world and the journey itself to the new world. the old world is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive. this is shown as salvatore scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has left (donkeys, goats and rabbits) in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the new world. i thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the new world; it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit. the most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the new world. this shot shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another, depicting the separation between the old and new worlds. this shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar, wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were desirous to enter a world that held more promise.as later contrasted to how the new world visually looks, the old world seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy new world. i thought it was particularly interesting that the statue of liberty is never shown through the fog at ellis island, but is remained hidden. i think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the statue of liberty stands for: "give me your poor, your tired, your hungry" seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the new world. once they arrived in the americas, they had to go through rather humiliating tests (i.e. delousing, mathematics, puzzles, etc.) in order to prove themselves as fit for the new world. these tests completely changed the perspectives of the sicilian people. in particular, salvatore's mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the new world, feeling more violated than treated with respect. where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the new world would provide, the reality of what the new world required was disparaging and rude. salvatore doesn't change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the new world would be like versus what the new world actually was seemed disappointing to him. this attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him. their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted.the film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society. cleanliness, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. adhering to these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. perhaps this is a commentary on how america has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct. though the rules seemed rigid, they were there to protect and help the people flourish.

"nuovomondo (2006)" (shown in the u.s. as "the golden door") was written and directed by emanuele crialese. this film is different--and, i think, better--than most movies about impoverished people who leave europe and come to the united states.the film begins with scenes in a poor, rural region of sicily. we always hear that sicily is a rocky island, but you won't really understand the implications of that phrase until you see the first half-hour of "the golden door." the middle section of the film is devoted to the long voyage to the u.s. most immigration films show us ten minutes of people in the third-class section becoming seasick, and then show us the statue of liberty. not this movie--we get a sense for life below decks, and it isn't charming. (we never actually see the statue of liberty, either.) finally, the typical movie will give us another ten minutes of ellis island, and then the immigrants are walking through new york's lower east side. not here--the ellis island experience occupies about one-third of the footage. vincenzo amato is outstanding as salvatore mancuso, who is bringing his two sons and his mother to the new world. charlotte gainsbourg is equally good as lucy reed, a mysterious englishwoman who also speaks fluent italian.there are some strange touches in the movie, especially the sound track with songs by nina simone. there must be some symbolism there, but i couldn't make sense of it.another reviewer has already pointed out that this film will do better viewed in a theater rather than on dvd. still, large screen or small screen, it's worth seeking out.

some days ago, in rome, a young romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. a romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.i'm only 15, but i thought: what idea of affluence does italy give to these poor people? how ever do they regard us as the land of plenty? yesterday evening i finally saw nuovomondo, and my question had an answer. when you have only a donkey and some goats, those propaganda postcards showing united states as a land with milk rivers and huge vegetables, makes such an impression.nuovomondo is really a must-see film. it balances an ethereal symbolism (milk rivers, glances' play, hard and rocky mountains, the name and character lucy/luce) and a cruel realism (the mass of hopeful people on the ship, the procedures at ellis island). there's a mixed cast, going from the angelic charlotte gainsbourg to the realistic vincenzo amato, till a bitter and smashing aurora quattrocchi as the mother. but was it really so hard to enter in the new world?

in this 4th child's play film, chucky gets lucky. it's very funny and there are some enjoyable parts. very good direction. not as bad as it could be. the best one in the series since the first. three stars out of four.

the movie was surprisingly wonderful especially considering the last sequel. the third was dark, and semi-interesting but it wasn't nearly as fun or enjoyable as this. it is filled with comedic lines about martha stuart, doll's anatomy, masturbation, and it was actually done effectively during gruesome and disturbing images. the movie wasn't scary or suspenseful and i'm sure that it wasn't the director's intention. it was fun because of the silliness, jennifer tilly's over the top and sexy performance. the puppetry of the dolls were so well handled, the movement of mouth, lips, tears in eyes, knife in chest, and the costumes. the dolls were just marvelous and it made the gruesome deaths more enoyable considering the fact that they were done by wonderful dolls. the new chucky look was great and tiffany was very cute. a few scenes with chucky hugging the human tiffany even made my father smile. jesse and jade were surprisingly well- very attractive and the special effects were cool. the ending was so unsuspected and the fact that they could make another as good is quite unlikely. it may not be as suspenseful as movies like halloween h2o or urban legend, but it is certainly more fun!!!!

i know this movie isn't for everyone, and i won't push my opinions on you, but what i have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...it was the best i have ever seen!!! it was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie i had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because i didn't know what was gonna happen next. if you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!

it's unbelievable but the fourth is better than the second and the third. after the third that was awful, it's incredible how they could have an unexpected sequel with new ideas. chuck is the same nasty doll of the previous movies. interesting the final that lets know that a fifth can be done....

this is the funniest sequel i have seen in a long time it is much funnier than the other three and not a bit scary. it has some very gory pieces in the film, but not bad enough to make you sick. in this one he has a female doll companion, hence the name. if you liked the first three then you'll love this, go watch it!

i'm warning you -- this movie is not scary. if you're a horror movie fan, especially a child's play fan, you'll think it's incredibly funny, but you won't be scared. it's not a bad movie, but it's not scary.

the success of scream gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. i'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and i liked most of those new horror films. boc is a one big pack of horror. colorful, fast paced and original. i see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like episode 1 and aliens: resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. we have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers. very inventive!

great movie. i thought it would never be as good as it was. great special effects, great story, big laughs. it didn't take itself seriously, which is why i think it worked so well. even the acting was surprisingly good. overall a very funny and sometimes chilling story.

this new installment to the child's play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing chucky giveing him the finger and saying "rude f--king doll" and lots of references to the series: "you can kill me but i'll come back. i always come back". the movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. this is totally different from all other films in the series. it doesn't even have andy, the central character for all the previous ones. chucky seems to interfere with characters from another movie, a soap opera about two teens running off together to get married. there is one cool elaborate death scene involving broken glass and water spilling everywhere. the movie is very gory, very funny, and has pop culture references from martha stewert to jerry springer. do not see this one before you see the other three,. it will really ruin the effect since the first one is truly scary. lots of guilty pleasure fun and silliness. 

this is a great installment in the child's play series. it brought back some bang to the series. great comedy, boy this movie is funny. also there are awesome homages to other horror celebs. beautiful cinematography. great ending! bring on seed of chucky!

this movie exemplifies a certain brand of comedy horror of a strictly adult kind but quite different to the troma movies (with which it shares certain qualities). the humour is rough and ready but fast and furious. if the idea of hideous dolls with evil powers and twisted minds don't make you shrug with boredom, reach for the six-pack of beer and enjoy the best "chucky" film yet.

the child's play series isn't a favourite of mine, but bride of chucky is actually an okay movie. this time we have two dolls chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) tiffany. together they go on a journey to find an object. there are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between chucky and tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre. this made the movie better like comedy does do with many horror movies. all up even if your not a child's play fan give this one a go.

i was expecting this to be just like the others, tries to be scary- ends up looking silly. somewhere along the line the writers must have realised this and so took the film in a totally different direction basically ignoring the other films. this feels like a different film rather than the fourth entry in the child's play series. the new idea works making this the best in the series by far.

seen all 4 installments, this one is by far the best of all. i did'nt have much expectation when i got the dvd(3rd was such a drag), but to my delight this one was fast paced with some slick punch-lines.don't miss this one.

"death wish 3" brings back charles bronson as one time vigilante paul kersey,now retired.yeah,right.before long kersey is back to his old ways.but this time,its not just a few muggers at a time,its a gang who have taken over a run down part of the city(new york again,by the way.)this time its war,so kersy hauls out the big guns(literally) for this.the body count int his one rivals anything stallone or schwarzenegger have come up with.this movie is actually somewhat fun to watch,particularly for a few one liners and of course bad guys die,or get severely injured in creative ways,which is always a good thing.the violence is not as personal in this one,its,obviously on a much grander scale,sort of like bombing your victims from afar,rather than one on one combat.this movie is lighter in tone than the 1st 2,making it easier to watch.there's not much import to this film,its more escapism than anything.its also cheesy at times and pseudo-inspirational,but hose scenes fall flat. they should have left the original "death wish" on its own without sequels,but since they didn't,they should have stopped here. 8 /10

very literate, intelligent drama about a group of international travelers held virtual prisoners in the hungary of 1956 by invading russian communist regime. kerr and robards play lovers, she a british baroness, he a hungarian freedom fighter trying to do his bit for his country. other new york theater stars of the period anne jackson & e g marshall play an american couple traveling with their two young sons, including ronny howard in his screen debut. jackson's character is hugely pregnant and not anxious to give birth in a soon-to-be communist country; she gives an impassioned plea in the third act of this film which presages the naturalistic acting styles we've come to know today from redgrave, fonda, & streep. leading the pack of soviet wolves is yul brynner, magnificent as a commandant and at his sexiest since he played opposite kerr in "the king and i". he is mean and nasty and terribly conflicted by his attraction to the lovely, patrician, & heroic kerr. this is one of the great transition films of the latter part of the golden era of american film. do not miss it.

this movie is not about the soda nor is it quite the french connection.the seven ups are a group of elite policemen that use tactics not in accordance with protocol of the nypd. scheider heads the group with his posse or regular looking joes. they are running surveillance on a local costra nostra cartel and things go awry when a cop's wire is found out.meanwhile, richard lynch, the most evil looking man in film (invasion:america, little nikita) and his partner end up killing the cop by accident and escape from scheider in the coolest chase scene i've seen, bullitt and french connection are not as good as they one up the west side to the george washington and onto the palisades parkway in new jersey. the stunt drivers are terrific and lynch makes it away free though he looks scared witless from the dangerous trip. roy scheider is nearly killed when his car slams into the abutted rear of mack truck ripping the roof of his vehicle off. things come to a head and one has to keep watching to follow up on such a sequence. quick moving and intense, fresh for a thirty years.

while both this movie and the signature car chase have been shown a lack of respect by many critics, both are way above average. roy scheider does an excellent job playing his best type; a tough, courageous cop who works hard to get the job done in spite of the desk drivers and politicians who should be supporting him rather than hindering. (he played a suburbanized version of this same role as the tourist town police chief in jaws. not nearly as gritty, but the same "get the job done despite the politicians" and gutsy approach. if a man who can't swim and is terrified of everything in the water going out on an old boat with an ahab wannabee and a nerd, to confront a huge killer shark, isn't gutsy, then tell me what is...).tony lo bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain; most of the villains, in fact, have some depth and complexity. this is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings. overall, it captures the atmosphere of parts of ny city: gritty, unglamorous, often dangerous, but filled with energy. the story is spare, tight, and subtle; it gets the job done without extraneous elements. it may not be one of the all time greats, but it is an exceptionally good movie.everyone has an opinion about car chases. mine is that this one is right up there with the mustang vs dodge charger chase in bullitt. the pontiac ventura/chevy nova was similar to the mustang in being a compact car chassis with beefed up suspension and a powerful small block v8 stuffed into an engine bay meant for an insipid 6. the ventura/novas got little respect off the drag strip, but with the proper suspension mods, they made affordable performance cars that could handle on both the road and the track. the bawling of those gm v8's as they wind up is music to the enthusiast's ear. i've heard this chase criticized for "imitating" the bullitt chase. the truth is that they are two works by the same master, bill hickman, who also choreographed and drove for the french connection chase. besides driving most of the car chase scenes, he created a brooding, malevolent presence and a good match with richard lynch as a pair of coldly evil killers.yes, the chase has "realism errors" often noted, like the use of 3 different ny roads to represent the palisades parkway, the ending of the chase in a crash with an 18 wheeler on a roadway for passenger vehicles only, and the miraculous timing that allows all pedestrians to escape harm. that's beside the point. let's face it: movie car chases are "unreal" by nature. in bullitt, the french connection, and the seven ups, however, bill hickman and phillip d'antoni crafted chases far more realistic, and therefore more exciting, than the flying, rolling, exploding vehicle fantasy chases so common in recent films.

this movie has a great chase scene, if you listen to the soundtrack when the cars are chasing each other , it sounds very much like the soundtrack from the movie bullet, you'll hear the shifting of a 4 speed and they'll show the brake pedal in roy schneider's car, it's an automatic brake pedal!, i think one of the funniest moments in the movie is when the bad guy richard lynch is looking at the driver of the car they are in, like the guy is nuts!.........the crook who runs the garage is also the guy who in the the first rocky movie, rocky's boss. good movie! also when the door gets ripped off you can see the guy sitting in the car just flinging the door open, the guy who helps him out of the car kind of looks like mr brady from the brady bunch doesn't he?

buddy manucci(roy scheider, solid in a chance leading role)heads a secret undercover police squad called the seven-ups whose tactics don't necessarily follow the exact ways of the law. they get the job done in their own way without anything being leaked to the press, and this gives them a freedom to expand their means of getting to the criminals most working detectives and policeman just can not nab. buddy has a pal from childhood named vito(tony lo bianco)who swaps information with him regarding mob types and shysters working the streets in nyc. what buddy doesn't know is that vito is hatching a scheme using names from buddy's "check list"(he has this book open taking down notes provided by vito, but doesn't know that his friend has copied those very names written within his mind)to set up mob families in a series of mob kidnappings eliciting cash thanks to two cop-posers, moon(the always-villainous richard lynch)and bo(bill hickman)working with him. when this scheme goes awry, with one of the seven-ups being killed, vito becomes fearful because he knows how buddy can be when he's doggedly after someone..especially when one of his own is murdered.extremely underrated cop flick has thrilling car chase through new york city as buddy follows the kidnapping cop-imposter's trying to get them after killing his partner. the film isn't overly complex after the plot is set-up and we realize who is the ring-leader in the scheming of mobsters. scheider has never been given the credit he deserves as a fine lead actor. he has emotional range and we see how losing his cop and friend takes it's toll on him. the film is briskly paced with good action sequences and sets up an interesting plot of betrayal between friends as greed comes before that childhood friendship and how what seems like a smooth crime-spree against evil mob families can get cops killed.

a team of tough rogue new york cops led by the rugged, hard-nosed buddy manucci (superbly played by the always excellent roy scheider) go after a group of nasty mobsters involved in a kidnapping ring after one of their number gets killed by them. director philip d'antoni, the producer of "bullet" and "the french connection," ably creates a potent, gritty, starkly amoral no-nonsense tone, maintains a steady pace throughout and stages the action scenes with considerable rip-roaring vigor. don ellis' rousing string score further pumps up the raw'n'rattling intensity while the scrappy big apple locations and urs furrer's rough, grainy cinematography both greatly enhance the overall grungy realism. moreover, the fine line distinguishing cops from criminals gets chillingly blurred in this picture: the titular squad use harsh, brutish and morally dubious strong-arm tactics as a means to an end for enforcing the law and there's certainly no code of honor amongst the thugs and thieves who populate the seedy urban underbelly that's vividly depicted in this movie. nice supporting performances by tony lo bianco as wormy, sniveling snitch vito lucia the undertaker, richard lynch as vicious psychotic hoodlum moon, bill hickman as moon's equally coldblooded partner bo, jerry leon as funky flatfoot mingo, and joe spinell as a parking garage attendant. an extremely wild and exciting protracted heart-in-your-throat mondo destructo car chase qualifies as a definite highlight. the climactic shootout likewise delivers the stirring goods. a real bang-up little winner.

"the seven-ups" seems like a replay of "the french connection," which was released two years prior. both the late roy scheider and tony lo bianco make appearances, as well as stunt driver bill hickman.but we aren't dealing with french drug baddies; instead, we are dealing with a war against assorted hoods and criminals after a cop is brutally killed by a hoodlum. we get to see unpleasantness and a pre-1990s new york city.i love watching this film because it is exciting to see the action, and it is a reminder of a cooler time. that said, when one compares the car chases, mr. hickman had involvement in the three most compared: this movie, bullitt and the french connection. each chase scene has its own qualities, and this one is simply superb.and i am glad this title has seen the light of day on dvd.

having grown up in new jersey and having spent many a day and night on the gritty streets of new york in the 1970's, watching a film like "the seven-ups", or its kindred spirit, "the french connection", always evokes fond memories of a time and place which, for some, might have been nyc's darkest hour, but which for me, in my early twenties, was always one fun-filled adventure after another. i truly miss those times. as one reviewer remarked, "this film very aptly captures the stark, cold, matter-of-fact feel of the nyc winter season, while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region's infamous underworld of crime and policing. a great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture.". a spot-on characterization of both the film and the city. the stellar attributes of this film -- the plot, the cast, the characters, and of course, the car chase -- are amply described in many of the reviews here, so i won't go into that except to say that one of my favorite moments occurs during the car chase, when the camera focuses on richard lynch riding shotgun to the maniacal bill hickman. the look of horror on richard lynch's face, along with the defensive gestures, are so out-of-character for an actor much better known as a source of terror rather than an object of it, that it is actually comical to watch. i get a chuckle out of it every time.

i was born in '68 with not much parental guidance as far as what i watched on tv (as a kid in the 70's). i always loved this movie (and the french connection) and would always try to catch it whenever it was on (checking the sunday tv guide ahead of time). i bought it on dvd a few years ago and have watched it twice since then and i must say, i still love it!!!! roy s. was a great actor from the 70's (jaws is one of my all-time favs, marathon man etc) and although the 7-ups is not an oscar-worthy film, it puts you precisely in a time a place (ny, early 70's, as did french connection) and gives you some tough characters and a glimpse of life as a cop at that time. and yes, the car chase is one of the all-time best.

octavio paz, mexican poet, writer, and diplomat, who received the nobel prize for literature in 1990, said about "nazarin": "nazarin follows the great tradition of mad spaniards originated by cervantes. his madness consists in taking seriously great ideas and trying to live accordingly". a humble and spiritual priest (francisco rabal in a wonderful performance) attempts to live by the principles of christianity but is cast out of his church for helping a local prostitute by giving her a shelter after she had committed a murder. nazarin wanders the country roads of the turn of the 20th-century mexico, offering help to poor and begging for food. his two followers, a murderous prostitute andara and her sister beatriz who is a failed suicide desperately searching for love, consider him saint but it does not prevent him from hatred and humiliation from both the church and the people he meets on the road. he ends up beaten in prison and begins to question his faith for not be able to forgive his attacker. bunuel tells the story in a manner of a christian parable masterfully and uniquely combining admiration and irony for the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. the film is simple and profound as well as beautiful, ironic, and heartbreaking.i consider bunuel one of the best filmmakers ever. i've seen twenty of his films and they all belong to the different periods of his life but they have in common his magic touch, the masterful combination of gritty realism and surrealism, his curiosity, his inquisitive mind, his sense of humor, and his dark and shining fantasies. with great pleasure i am adding little seen and almost unknown but amazingly candid and touching surrealistic tragic-comedy "nazarin" to the list of my favorite films.

you know i've seen a lot of crappy hong kong movies in terms of production and were good. but running out of time was great.i guess what made it so good was the fact that andy lau and ching wang, have such great chemistry. the film at first is really fast paced but slows down not enough to even notice which is also good, we don't want to have a heart attack,lol. in terms of plot their is enough of other things going on to keep you interested. lau has some pretty good moments as he uses make up to impersonate people from the underworld. also the movie has the best oriental supporting cast since "house of flying daggers".the movie is great because its so unpredictable and leaves you wondering at every corner. definitely a good rental with tons of comedy, action and thrills pact in to one, 8 out of 10

this film is one of the historically most accurate war films ever made in that it displays the reality of soldiers in a battle situation as well as the particular circumstances of the battle of stalingrad, obvious when one compares this film to works such as anthony beevor's book "stalingrad".unlike the better known "enemy at the gates" where the plot diverts into a sniper/hunting story, this film shows what war can do to individuals. although filmed by germans, "stalingrad" is anything but a nationalistic apologetic film. it shows that war films can be something beyond flag-waving, jingoistic distortions of the grim truth of war, like so many hollywood "war" products seem to be.the scripting, acting, direction and other film techniques in "stlingrad" are of the highest caliber.it's a must-see film for anyone contemplating to join an army and to obey orders from any type of "fuehrer".

the people of my generation and those who are older know about the ww ii (or as it is called in russia ‚Äì the great patriotic war) not only from the school textbooks, but from the witnesses and participants of the event. my granddad was a soldier at stalingrad and when i was a small girl i used to listen to his stories of how he defeated the germans. he also told me some anecdotes, not all he told me was gloomy. but it was long ago, and no when i have a conscious interest for what happened there in the battle of stalingrad, i have to turn to books and movies for information. somehow most films i saw were made in the soviet union, only a few in present day russia. and ‚Äústalingrad‚Äù is an exception. in the movie the war is described from the opposite side, and the fact in itself is interesting. all that is shown in the film is quite different from what i‚Äôm used to.the film reminds me a great deal of remarque‚Äôs ‚Äúzeit zu leben und zeit zu sterben‚Äù, because the war is shown through an ordinary german soldier perception. and this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed by repeating he is by no means a fascist. the movie heroes right from neat and enthusiastic europe, from the italian coast arrive in the snow-covered hungry soviet union. they are doomed to die; it is clear from the very beginning.after the elite detachment had taken part in their first fight at stalingrad, one of the soldiers said the phrase which reflected the whole idea for me; he said ‚Äúif you start thinking, you will go mad‚Äù. and to my mind it is true for spectators as well. from the one hand, one may think, ok, i‚Äôll just watch this movie and it won‚Äôt dissipate me, i needn‚Äôt feel sorry for the people on the screen as it were they who attacked my country and not vice versa. however sooner or later but inevitably one starts sympathizing with the characters. probably when the lieutenant chokes back his tears at seeing kolya‚Äôs execution.‚Äústalingrad‚Äù is hard to watch, all these frostbitten legs, dirt, executions, snow, famine, destroyed illusions.as far as i know, lt. hans von witzland is one of the few films where thomas kretschmann played his star roles. i watched quite many hollywood movies where he was given unimportant parts of small fries, such as ‚Äúnext‚Äù or ‚Äútranssiberian‚Äù (why did he do it?!). and after i had watched ‚Äústalingrad‚Äù, i cannot make out the european actors desire to appear in american movies, even second-rated at any cost. the fact puzzles me deeply. i believe thomas kretschmann deserves better parts and much better screenplays than those he is given in hollywood. and out of what i saw with him, ‚Äústalingrad‚Äù is the best, beyond the doubt.in my opinion the worst ‚Äústalingrad‚Äù drawback is the way they speak russian in the movie. i mean of course those who are supposed to be russian. say, the boy who spent some time with the germans or the girl with whom they planned to escape. was it really so difficult to find actors able to pronounce a couple of phrases without that horrible accent? initially i set down to watch ‚Äústalingrad‚Äù just to listen to native german-speakers because i‚Äôm studying the language. i did not expect anything extraordinary of the film. but it impressed me, made me cry when i wasn‚Äôt going to at all. i know i‚Äôm 15 years late to watch it, but ‚Äústalingrad‚Äù is not a run-of-the-mill movie, and after 15 years it is still watchable and shocking.

for the main criticisms of the movie... the love story: that wasn't a love story. those were two people distraught coming together trying to find humanity in anyone. the same thing happened with soldiers and the russian boy. it added a feminine touch, but come on look at american movies...no where close to love story. there was no storyline: does war have a storyline? i think that is a silly criticism. the storyline is this. they start with 400 men and the movie narrowed down to show the lives of about 10 men and how each did their part and died. death is the ultimate end to any story. just because there was no happy ending doesn't mean it has no storyline. there was a horrid truth in this movie. i wouldn't necessarily call it "anti-war". it had a political statement of course, but the movie wasn't all about the politics. in fact, except for a few occurrences when the captain? showed up, there was never a stifling air of nazi germany. they were far enough out of the reach of the main nazi party. the fat cats weren't gonna go into russia!maybe not completely accurate and not a hollywood hit, but it exhibits a fine knowledge of the common soldier (i'd say exactly of almost any nationality and war)and what they must go through. it was a losing battle, of course the movie is going to be depressing. and to the person who said that it was gutsy (and silly) to even portray germans as victims: there are victims on all sides in every war (any real soldier will tell you that).this movie is a fine balance between movie and documentary. a few problems with it when arguing for just one, but it instills the best of both worlds. watch it as such. beware however because it is a hard movie to watch if not graphically, emotionally.i'm waiting til they make a movie about iraq. it will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial, i want to see who has the guts to do it first. (jarhead doesn't count)

this is a film that i keep coming back to, for a variety of reasons. as a testament to the suffering of the ordinary soldier on the eastern front in the second world war, it is a powerful one. there are a number of very powerful scenes in the film which help to capture the horror of war, such as the tank battle for instance. furthermore, from what i can see the experiences documented in the film are by and large 'true' - if you read a. beevor's book 'stalingrad' you will know what i mean. the film is also successful in the sense that it doesn't allow character or plot to dominate it - it is simply a tale of survival, that attempts to depict the battle mainly from the ordinary (german) soldier's point of view. i've read somewhere that the original screenplay had to be toned down, which doesn't surprise me at all - if they tried to really show what the battle was like, it would have been almost impossible to make i'm sure. even so, there are still some moments that are difficult to watch - this was made before private ryan but is possibly even harder-hitting in places. just one word of caution - don't buy the dubbed 'english' version, it's pretty awful and spoils the film - try to get a copy in the original (german) version with english subtitles, it's far more powerful. you may need to buy a region 1 dvd of the film in this case, as i did.

the only reason i decided to view this film is because of the great acting talents of karen sillas,(alyson haywood),"bad money",'99, who is deeply involved with gary cole,(dave),"cry wolf",'05, who is a great war hero and has all kinds of ways to make money and never seems to stop telling lies. alyson and dave are trying to rebuild an old home and restore it to comfortable living conditions. the relationship gets troublesome and alyson decides to find out what is going on and the plot gets very mysterious. if you are a big fan of karen sillas, this is the film for you. i only wish karen would appear in more films, i miss her great talents.

this is one of the best tv movies i have ever seen! the title makes it so obvious and predictable but come on, all tv movies are like that!the story is fantastic. it may seem ridiculous but it is based on an incredibly true story. gary cole plays a military man named dave who feels trapped in his marriage. he abandons his wife and kids and then fakes his death! all so he could be with alyson (karen sillas). how far will dave go to keep his secret? the acting is top notch for tv movies. gary cole especially keeps the movie together as a charming, smooth-talking sociopath who has an answer to everything when his wife gets suspicious. karen sillas does the best she can as a wife who discovers that her husband is a liar and doesn't know what to do about it. teddi siddall, who i believe is gary cole's wife in real life, plays her part well especially when she cries about the "death" of her husband. wendy makkena adds a nice touch as alyson's sister. linda goranson is great in her small role as dave's mother.predictable but the acting and the story take this movie up several notches.

this mostly routine fact-based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole. this is the story of a highly trained military man, unhappy with his wife and children, fakes his demise and runs off with the other woman. to support her in the manner in which she is accustomed he robs banks. predictable, but not a bad watch.

i thought it was an excellent movie. gary cole played the role of a military man who feels trapped and unhappy with his wife who fakes his death fabulously! over all, i thought the movie was great, definitely not a boring plot line! it's sad to say, but i think lots of men might feel this way. i think he should have just gotten a divorce and asked to be transferred instead of the extreme he went to, but he felt there was no other way out so he faked his death. i thought it was neat that cole's real-life wife played the wife he was unhappy with in the movie. i think what the guy did was alittle extreme, but the movie was great nonetheless! definitely recommend it!

he is very good in this role as a disaffected and bored husband, a decorated air force officer, who becomes bored with his predictable suburban life and decides to make a radical change.one evening he meets karen sillas, an attractive woman younger than his current wife. a relationship develops, and cole decides to take it to the next level.not only does he have an affair, he fakes his death to escape his family obligations. lies become increasingly more of a pattern as he begins to rob banks to keep his new wife (sillas) happy, and to project the image that he is a success. a fictional delusion, apparently.this was also based on a true story which makes it all the more intriguing. cole is believable and excellent in these roles. recommended. 8/10.

(some spoilers) facing a mid-life crisis and fed up with his marriage to cindy ,teddi siddall, who seemed to have more say in what he did and where he stayed then the air force,usaf elite red beret sgt. major davis bay, gary cole,decided one morning to just walk away from in all and start a new life as a civilian. david first got this idea when he met at a halloween party sweet and adoring alyson, karen sillas. keeping his background secret from her by telling alyson that he's in a top secret military outfit was the perfect cover for him. back at jackson afb outside of austin tex. david starts to review his life's options with cindy and the usaf and decides to change his identity by running away from it. david then calls alyson, who only met him once, and makes a date with her. before you know it david, now using the name haywood,is engaged to be married to her.faking his death in a bicycle accident dave purposely leave his wife and kids out in the cold and deserts his military obligation to his country.it didn't take long for dave to find out that civilian life just doesn't appeal to him. it's now too late for dave to go back to his first wife cindy and his two boys with him facing the brig and a military court-martial if he comes back to the usaf. dave takes up the only job that he could do to support him and alyson and their infant son chris: using his skills he learned in the red berets to rob banks.based on a true story "lies he told" has dave bay/haywood living three, not two, different lives. one of a hard working family man one as a ruthless bank robber and yet another one as a dead and highly decorated, by the president of the us and prime misnister of gb, all-american hero. gary cole is very effective as both master sgt. david bay&husband david haywood. davids actions are, even though unforgivable, understandable in the case of his depression over his marriage to cindy. the pressure of her nagging him got to the point where he just wanted to get lost and away from her and the kids. but he should have sought professional counseling from the us air force, which he would have been gladly provided with, instead of choosing the easy way out. which in the end lead him straight into levenworth ferderal prison. it may have been that the overly macho dave thought it would have been a bad mark on his career, as well as his ego, to get help for his problems.karen sillas as alyson is the glue that keeps the film together with her at first going along with her new husbands explanation of his frequent disappearances, some for as much as two weeks, as him doing covert action in keeping the country safe from domestic and foreign terrorists. the real reasons for his long absences were the result of him casing out planing and robbing banks. which was the only way he knew how to earn a living given from what he learned, in subversive actions, all those years in the elite red berets.alyson tracking down dave's mom carolyn bay(linda goranson), who he told her was dead since he was a small boy, in portland she finds out the truth about the double, or triple, life that he's been leading since he married her. this lead to alyson finding out about his marriage to linda and the two sons that he had with her as well as his faked death, and now awol, from the usaf. being that it's a true story the ending was anything that you would have guessed it to be in a standard hollywood, or made for tv, movie. that's what makes the film "lies he told, a lot better then what you would have expected it to be.

i don't like boxing, don't understand the attraction. i did like this movie. positive portrayals of latinos, with no drugs, sex or street violence. the plot actually showed stable, loving families. the fight sequences are violent, as is boxing, but not as over the top as rocky films. nothing wrong with attempting familiar themes with a different angle and ethnicity. it's a good rent.

father hoodi can understand why a lot of people hate this tale of a father kidnapping his two children and carrying them across america, but i've seen much worse, and--when i saw this years ago--i didn't think it was particularly awful. patrick swayze is the worried father who takes his kids on the run with him for personal reasons, and halle berry is the cop chasing them down.overall a decent way to spend a couple hours of your life. you could certainly do worse--ever hear of the film "pod people"?** 1/2 out of *****rated pg-13 for some traumatic scenes, adult content matter, violence and language.

father hood is an entertaining tale of an unwilling father who is definitely a hood! patrick swayze plays jack charles who is a hood always on the look-out for the one big "score" that is going to put him on easy street. his wife died while he was is prison and his two kids were put in foster care. when he "got out" he thought they were probably better off in foster care ¬ñ besides he still had to score his fortune. his daughter kathleen charles (played wonderfully by sabrina lloyd) breaks out of a foster care institution that is abusing the kids and misappropriating money that is suppose to be being spent on the kids. she hunts down her father; tells him about how bad the place was and that her brother, eddie charles (played by brian bonsall) , "just a little 7-year-old kid" was being moved to the institution that she had just broken out of and convinces her father to kidnap him. the three start off on an adventure across country, all the while jack keeps telling himself that he has to get rid of the kids! patrick swayze is really good in this comedy, playing a "hood" (probably a little understatement for this criminal character) who is similar to his johnny castle character of dirty dancing except jack is appropriately funnier in this comedy and more optimistic than johnny castle. swayze is funny and rally does comedy pretty well! halle berry plays kathleen mercer who is a reporter trying to get at the truth of the foster care system who becomes sawyer's ally. diane ladd plays rita the con-artist mother of jack charles.

"father hood" is an overlooked little gem of a "road movie". fine performances by halle berry, sabina lloyd and brian bonsall, two really fun "over-the-top" ones by diane ladd and michael ironside,and a downright outstanding one from patrick swayze. the movie is helped by an unconventional storyline, but badly undercut by it's flashback framing which results in a formulamatic, abrupt ending. "father hood" would have worked much better without these "bookends". nevertheless, the movie brings up important issues of "family responsibilities" and the consequences of state intervention. as long as the foster system rewards state institutions for not placing children, such abuses will exist.pick this one up. it's worth the "ride."

044: the big trail (1930) - released 10/24/1930; viewed 4/5/06.births: richard harris, harold pinter, robert atkins.doug: in hollywood, raoul walsh unveiled his latest film, the big trail, a western about the trek west across the frontier, starring up-and-coming 23-year-old actor john wayne. in 1930, we are seeing many "firsts" but few "bests." besides the first john wayne film, we have here the first widescreen film (although we only watched the full-frame version). interestingly, the decision to film in widescreen was essentially the same reason that widescreen became popular later: to compete with television, which hadn't yet appeared commercially but was still an emerging curiosity. all the same, this film was extremely good, giving us a harrowing look at the trek to oklahoma. the opening title cards let us know that this is a western of the most traditional kind, about america, about the land, who should live on it, etc., and is an excellent demonstration of that. walsh gives us some astonishing visuals of the wagon company out in the wilderness (when they reach a cliff, they must rope each wagon down one by one), and we also get a revenge subplot involving wayne pursuing the man who killed one of his friends (i seem to recall something similar in stagecoach). wayne's tough cowboy routine is at least partly there, and would surely evolve further in subsequent films. since this film is representing all of wayne's early 30's work for the odyssey, we will not see his face again until stagecoach, but once we do, we will keep seeing him to the end of the odyssey and beyond.kevin: ah, our first sound western, and john wayne's first starring role. it's raoul walsh's the big trail. this review will be short, since it's been weeks since i watched it. i enjoyed this movie, but it was far from a masterpiece. the mostly predictable adventure had a few surprises, like when the brains of the bad guys, red flack (tyrone power sr. in his last role) is killed half way through; i thought he would be the boss at the end, but that ended up being bill thorpe (ian keith). i remember that i didn't like the way breck (wayne) kills thorpe and exacts revenge at the end. i understood that that's what he was meant to do in the story, but i really didn't like his reasoning when he tells ruth why he has to do it. i think he had a far greater responsibility to the hundreds of settlers he was leading through the harsh west.last film viewed: animal crackers (1930). last film chronologically: soup to nuts (1930). next film: l'age d'or (1930).

this totally odd-ball feature is a typical and prime example of satanically shocking 70's horror. the events are thoroughly confusing and it takes up quite a while before you figure out what the hell is going on, but the brooding atmosphere sucks you in immediately. right from the indescribably bizarre intro, showing a couple of eerie children turning toys into real-life war machinery, you just know this become an uncompromising and gritty shocker. "brotherhood of satan" soon appears to be another installment in the alleged & unofficial "creepy little town hiding a dark secret" sub genre. a young widower, traveling with his new yummy girlfriend and 8-year-old daughter, stops in a remote little town to report a car accident they witnessed on a nearby highway. the villagers behave very hostile and insist the visitors on leaving right away. the town clearly bathes in an ambiance of fear and panic, as local children vanish inexplicably vanished and unnatural forces maintain everyone within the boundaries of town. hillsboro is in the grip of a satanic cult, apparently ruled by the elderly members of the community. i really liked "brotherhood of satan" a lot. the story reminded me of a novel written by john saul, but i can't remember the title. it also dealt with a cult of elderly people abusing youthful villagers for their own greedy merits. the film mainly relies on creepy scenery (like dolls and witchcraft relics) but a slightly more involving and coherent screenplay would have been nice. the subject matter often raises a lot of issues and questions, and director bernard mceveety can't always provide us with answers. the climax is terrific, very seventies (meaning shocking) and unforgettable. beautifully shot film, too.

i had been interested in this film for a long time, especially after reading a couple of online reviews of the dvd edition; however, i kept postponing its purchase because of the excessive price-tag and utter lack of relevant supplements. when it went out-of-print earlier this year, i finally gave in - but the entire order (which included a number of other highly-desirable titles) got lost in transit!; luckily, the dvd has been re-issued at bargain-price - and i'm sure glad i picked it up! anyway, this is one strange film, and a genuine sleeper: initially confusing but striking occult tale which manages to hit bullseye with respect to both its forbidding small-town atmosphere and the inherent eeriness of the sinister goings-on. a small cast responds perfectly to a terse, absorbing and intelligent script: lead strother martin, in particular, makes the dialogue sound better than it actually is with his nuanced performance as the town doctor/head of the witch's coven; l.q. jones and alvy moore (both of whom also produced the film!) offer solid support as the no-nonsense sheriff and his comic-strip aficionado assistant.the plot merges elements of various earlier films dealing with witchcraft and the supernatural, and not only the obvious titles: the fact that the town is held under a spell which can't at first be identified, for instance, brings instantly to mind the similar affliction of one specific bourgeois household in luis bunuel's sublimely surreal the exterminating angel (1962)!; the 'possessed children' angle was borrowed, perhaps, from village of the damned (1960); there have been many films - especially of a recent vintage - where the satanic rites of a witches' coven are shown: from the city of the dead (1960) to the devil rides out (1968) but, since the proceedings take place in modern-day america (albeit in remote surroundings) and revolve around elderly witches (seeking a 'renaissance'), the film they recall most of all is rosemary's baby (1968).the occult scenes (accentuated as much by foggy exteriors as by the shadowy lighting of the garishly-decorated house where the diabolical events take place) are presented in a completely matter-of-fact way as to make them unsettling and extremely effective - particularly the opening sequence involving an army tank crushing a car(!), the rampage of a devil-doll (a concept which has been done to death over the years but, here, it raises an undeniable frisson), a surreal dream sequence (set inside the ice chamber where all the victims are kept, since they can't be buried!), a sequence where the witches attack a doubting member of the coven, a beheading committed by a horse-riding medieval knight(!) and the lengthy 'black mass' finale (with the witches, accompanied by the respective child they will be 'taking over', all dressed in red - except for a black-clad martin presiding over the ceremony) which culminates in ritual mass suicide! the film also has the guts to deliver a downbeat 'curtain'; it's so refreshing to come across a title (albeit a low-budget production) from a major hollywood studio, columbia, that contrives to go so completely against the grain (like, i said, the film is quite weird - extending also to the editing and the score)! it's odd, too, that such a classy - and cinematic - horror offering {sic} should come from a tv director most often associated with westerns and other family fare! by the way, the same theme was dealt with almost contemporaneously in the nth christopher lee/peter cushing collaboration nothing but the night (1972; which lee produced himself!) - a film i foolishly missed out on some 20 years back when it was shown on local tv, and which has been m.i.a. ever since!! p.s. this review of the brotherhood of satan will certainly contain spoilers but, then, the synopsis and artwork featured on the dvd cover manage to give everything away anyway!

i would probably say this was on a par with films like "devil's rain" and that sort of film, although this is probably a bit better made. i love 70's horror and this has most of the elements that make up other movies i like so it was pretty easy to enjoy. a family on their vacation stumble across a small town where the people seem to be gripped by some sort of hysteria. seems like the children have been disappearing. after an initial attempt to flee this place, the family is somehow stopped on the edge of town and find their way back, but not without first finding a house where the kids are gone and mommy and daddy are dead. seems like we have a different kind of twist on a senior citizen community center in this town, they're all satan worshipers and they need the kids to renew their lives so they can continue on in their service, i guess. not that anyone seems too keen on giving up their kids for this enterprise. this is fairly classy considering that it's scary and creepy without buckets of gore or the loud startling events that try to make people jump in films today, which seem to have replaced actual scares. we have hank kimball (alvy moore) from "green acres" as tobey, a sheriff's deputy that reads ufo magazines, and lq jones as the sheriff, and a very familiar character actor as the dad of the stranded family. and strother martin plays the doctor who seems to be doing double duty unbeknown to his fellow townsfolk. this is pretty good stuff but a tad on the confusing side sometimes, but overall works pretty well & is recommended for fans of 70's horror. 8 out of 10.

i had no idea what i was going to see when i decided to view this film and to my surprise its just an extremely well made horror film that is easily one of the best of the 1970's. film is of course low budget and this is an excellent example of how the story and style of a film creates chills, not special effects! strother martin is one of the great character actors of all time and he has a rare starring role here and the film also stars martins good friend l.q. jones and "green acres" alvy moore. jones and moore helped produce this film as well. tv veteran charles bateman is the star and "enter the dragon" beauty ahna capri is his girlfriend. capri is in a bikini at the beginning of the film and she's just gorgeous to look at! film does a terrific job of staying with the story and not adding a phony feel good ending and i really liked the way the film ends. great atmosphere, interesting story and well directed by bernard mceveety. martins performance is top notch also as he doesn't hold back at all and really throws himself into the role of doc. good and underrated film!

this is one creepy underrated gem with chilling performances and a fantastic finale!. all the characters are great, and the story was awesome, plus i thought the ending was really cool!. the plot was great, and it never bored me, plus while the child actors were bad, they gave me the creeps!. this happened to be on the space channel a while ago, so i decided to check it out and tape it, i read some good reviews from fellow horror fans, i must say i agree with them, it's very creepy, and suspenseful, plus strother martin, was fantastic in his role, as the satan worshiper. it has tons of creepy atmosphere, and it keeps you guessing throughout, plus all the characters were very likable, and you really start to root for ben and his family!. it has plenty of disturbing moments, and the film really shocked me at times, plus, it's extremely well made on a low budget!. this is one creepy underrated gem, with chilling performances and a fantastic finale!, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. bernard mceveety does a very good job here, with great camera work, creating a lot of creepy atmosphere, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. ther is a little bit of blood and gore. we get a severed leg,lots of bloody corpses,bloody slit throat, slicing and dicing,decapitation, and an impaling. the acting is excellent!. strother martin is fantastic here! as the satan worshiper, he is extremely creepy, very convincing, was quite chilling, was extremely intense, seemed to be enjoying himself, and just did a fantastic job overall!. charles bateman is great as the dad, he was very caring, very likable, and gave a good show!, i liked him lots. l.q. jones is awesome as the sheriff, he was funny, on top of things, looked very young, had a cool character, and just did an awesome job overall!. ahna capri is good as the girlfriend and did what she had to do pretty well. charles robinson overacted to the extreme as the priest and didn't convince me one bit!, and that laugh of his was especially bad. geri reischl is actually decent as the daughter, she was somewhat likable, and only got on my nerves a couple times, i rather liked her. alvy moore was goofy, but very likable in his role as tobey i dug him!. rest of the cast do good. overall i highly recommend it!. ***1/2 out of 5

every great once in a while, you stumble upon a movie that exceeds even your wildest expectations. given the imdb rating of 4.0, i wasn't really expecting much with the brotherhood of satan. i hoped that at a minimum it might be cheesy fun like the devil's rain or any of the other early 70s similarly themed satanic horror films. i couldn't' have been more wrong. what i got instead was an ambitious and intelligent film with a cast i really enjoyed. speaking in broad terms to avoid giving anything away, the film's style and structure are much more experimental than the straightforward storytelling so prominent in the early 70s. the brotherhood of satan doesn't beat you over the head with plot points and explanations. a lot is left to the viewer to fill in the blanks. as a viewer, you know something is amiss, but for the longest period you're just not sure what it is. the unknown helps make for a far creepier atmosphere than most similar films. the ending is effective with its surreal imagery. i sat in amazement as the final credits began to roll. those wanting a big slam-bang finale will be disappointed with the ending's simplicity. a lesser film would have tried to pull out all the stops and would, most likely, have failed miserably.there are moments in the film where it's easy to forget the director, bernard mceveety, had primarily worked in television before the brotherhood of satan. there are a few scenes that are so well set-up, lit, and shot that even the most accomplished of directors could learn a thing or two. for example, i've seen enough films over the years to realize that directors can sometimes seem to have trouble shooting widescreen shots indoors. not here. the scene where the men are discussing their plan of action in the sheriff's office is amazing. we see all five men at once ¬ñ each doing their own thing as in real life. in a lesser film, we might see all the men at once, but each would be motionless, quietly waiting their turn to deliver their dialogue. it's a small scene, but it looks so natural and is so beautifully shot that it's one of my favorite moments of the brotherhood of satan.finally, i mentioned the acting in my opening, so without going into a long-winded speech, i'll just say that the brotherhood of satan features strother martin and l.q. jones. any film with these two guys is almost an automatic winner with me.

married to the mob was one of the first vhs tapes that i had along with coming to america and grease. i still have fond memories of this film after all these years. hell, i still have the vhs of this film in good condition.the story: undercover cop mike downey(matthew modine)is sent to spy on angela de marco(michelle pfeiffer) the wife of the slain mafia member frank "cucumber" de marco(alec baldwin). he later falls in love with her after he realizes that she is innocent in all this. angela not only has to deal with the unwanted advances of mob boss tony "the tiger" russo(dean stockwell), she also has to deal with his jealous wife connie russo(mercedes ruehl).married to the mob is funny and still keeps your interest when its not trying to be funny. i like the little jabs it takes at mafia life(the jealous mafia wife, the mob boss that doesn't realize that he is not a chick magnet etc) and you like the characters of angela de marco and mike downey. it was the last of the funny phase of johnathan demme before he got serious and gave you gems like philadelphia and silence of the lambs(best thriller of all time). if you're in the mood for comedy, married to the mob is a keeper. its better than the rubbish that passes for comedy nowadays(epic movie, date movie, meet the spartans, disaster movie etc).

the only problem with married to the mob is that it is not funny. it dresses up exactly like a romantic comedy, but almost nothing that happens is funny. but if you can look at it as a film where almost nothing funny happens, then you'll have a really good time. it's a glitzy mob film, too, as per the title. extremely glitzy. but the director, jonathan demme, is one of the few prevailing cult directors who fully and completely embraced the 1980s in his work from that decade rather than understandably pretending it was still the 1970s.the opening credits combine 1980s animation, italian-americanism and mise-en-scene lathered on top of each other at once. from there, despite 1980sness, it feels about right. the lighting by demme's frequent cinematographer tak fujimoto and jukebox soundtrack rife with widely varying pop and alternative jams are gaudy and that is indeed controlled and nuanced as part of the atmosphere. demme is good at colorful instant characterizations in his visual and sometimes seemingly impetuous composition of a fun mix of styles, a plot that could've gone any which way, where a smooth fbi agent, played by a very bland matthew modine, trying to infiltrate a mafia family, sees a chance when a gun moll, played with come-hither allure by michelle pfeiffer, tries to leave the criminal lifestyle after her trigger-man husband, in just what you would hope for in an alec baldwin performance, is wacked.the way it goes works for awhile, because demme seems to have a firm hand on the wheel. he knows the significance of showing us the very subjective and relatable life-at-home scenes with pfeiffer, as well as her cares and longings as a morally conflicted mom, although her relationship with son joey is taken a bit for granted. what mobster's son is listening to party-pooper mom when dad's boss, played with dean stockwell's trademark naturalness and by far the scene-stealing stand-out of the cast, is giving him such awesome gifts? on the whole though, demme's lathered-on stylizations are easily viewed as a novel take on a fun crime thriller tale.ultimately, though, we find we've been going the wrong way, because inevitably, modine and pfeiffer have to fall in love. that's not inherently bad, and every here and there it actually feels bearable, but as a romantic subplot, it is not handled interestingly, or well, hardly at all because it hopscotches across various sundry clich√©s, which fulfill the initial expectation of a cheesy 1980s date flick, and for that audience, i think it has just the right impact. but for someone who has found themselves genuinely interested in the story and the aesthetic approach, it is a let-down into state of tedium.so it's a decent movie with huge missteps at certain points, but as a date movie or a nostalgic piece for those who grew up in the '80s, perhaps saw a lot of date movies in the '80s, the entertainment value is not as likely to fluctuate, except for said deficit in true laughs. there maybe a few scoffs, and it's very broadly tongue-in-cheek, but i wouldn't leave the comedy aisle with the high hopes with which i'd have initially entered. whatever the case anyway, there are additional joys in bit roles by great character actors who have by now begun to fade, like nancy travis, joan cusack and oliver platt.

i put this movie on not expecting much, other than a b movie gore fest. thankfully i was presented with a very well made film, that built up the suspense and managed to maintain it throughout its run time. this was an impressive achievement. the acting was solid, creating characters that you cared about and related to; and although some may find the film slow, it did force you to think about what you would have done in the same situation. added to this there was some fine camera work and the directors pulled it all together admirably. an excellent effort then, that is well worth your time if you prefer development and suspense over gore.

i've read many unflattering comments regarding this film, and the only things i have seen that they all have in common are: "boring" and "unrealistic".first of all, they used real frickin' crocs! how much more realistic can you get? no cgi, no animatronics, no miniatures. just a croc and a piece of meat. have fun, fellas!there is no question that this film gets off to a slow start. character development, what little they had, anyway, does take a bit of time, and i think this is primarily where this film lacks.however, when the film gets going, i found the action picked up dramatically. i don't mean to say that there is a lot of action. if anything, there are more moments where the croc can't be seen at all, and the people are just waiting. however, we know that there isn't going to be any relief, and that the croc is just biding its time. this had a similar eerie feel to other films that achieve their horror through non-action, such as open water (another film that has been criticized by some viewers as being "boring"). personally, i think that viewers who find themselves incapable of feeling the suspense have had their attention spans surgically removed at birth, but that's just me.finally, the characters feel real, and the situation is such that it really could happen to anyone in the right circumstances. furthermore, the deaths are completely real, and at times, it's a little tough to watch.all in all, this one's a winner.

one of the best horror/suspense movies i have seen in a long time. wow, it was a big surprise and stunning at how good this movie was, sometimes a gem like this will surface but is rare. i expected a popcorn monster flick and a mildly diverting way to spend a late night but instead a very well made and directed movie with great acting and made with passion and heart. this is a movie that makes you feel for the characters and what happens to them, and it is filmed like you are there and it is really happening. i know some people in other reviews compare it to "open water", but i disagree because i thought open water was quite boring and mediocre, while this movie was the opposite, although superficially they are filmed in the same "realistic" style.the actors are unknowns, at least to me, but they all are very effective and convey the dire situation with frightening intensity and realism. the story is well done and flows smoothly, the plot is logical and appears to be something that could happen, all the actions and thoughts of the characters are quite what a person would do and think about. very believable and this makes the movie more real because of it.i had tears in my eyes at the end. i must say a movie seldom has this effect on me, this is how powerful and emotional this movie was done and i am suitably impressed by the director and actors of this great movie.

so well made, no cgi crap. has anyone else been on the "jumping crocs" tour of darwin's adelaide river before? black water was way realistic; rogue was a bit cringeworthy.thought the blonde chick was excellent in it - haven't really seen her before. and the other chick is a babe, she is always excellent. v. suspenseful - i would compare it to jaws over any other man eating animal flick. got the hole aussie thing down pat without going ott with struths and crikeys, as well. loved it!

i live up here in croc territory and remember well the true events that inspired this movie. our guts fall out each time we hear of a croc attack. black water is, quite simply, the best croc movie i have ever seen. while i loved rogue last year for all its effects and splashy scenes, it was the local scenes that captured our audience. we laughed in rogue more than anything. black water, however, really resonated with the eeriness and fear that you can experience when you are alone in the mangroves (you guys call them swamps or bayous - but they're mangroves). every tourist should see this film before heading to the northern territory. the ending was a bit of a letdown after the rest of the film, but i'll be adding this one to my dvd collection when it becomes available.

black water, co-directed and written by david nerlich and andrew traucki, is very simple in its execution yet effective. the film is a low-budget australian movie that will unfortunately not get the recognition it deserves because as far as creature features go, this is one of the best out there. the setup is rather basic; grace, her husband adam and her younger sister lee are touring some mangroves in the northern territory when a saltwater crocodile flips their boat and leaves them stranded in the trees. the whole movie is about their survival while the crocodile is lurking below waiting to strike.unlike greg mclean's rogue (another killer croc movie released earlier in 2007), black water is not about the audience having fun guessing who's gonna be eaten next, it is about hoping and praying that the three people will get out safely. the three unknown actors do a great job with pretty demanding roles, considering it was filmed on location with a real crocodile instead of cgi. the characters act realistically in the situation and the dialogue seems natural and not forced. suspense is built up throughout the entire film, we do not see a lot of the creature but just knowing it is near is terrifying enough. this is edge-of-your seat stuff and highly recommended if you enjoy original and (most importantly) scary horror films.4/5

this movie sets out to do something very particular, it also sets out not to do certain things. in short it has a definite premeditated trajectory - to deal with the idea of facing death (with very few choices and all of them bad) as grave and real rather than something casual or amusing. in search of that realism it has eschewed certain conventions such as obvious character arcs and hooks. it not about the characters so much as about the human condition. never mind what the actors would do... what would you do in their situation? open water may have been a starting notion for this movie but it goes a lot further. unlike that film it doesn't cheat the audience in the end when you find out there aren't really any sharks to speak of at all. this has a real monster, not just the idea of a monster and not just an animated stand in. it also has fine production values given what these very resourceful filmmakers had to work with. and again in contrast to that other film it has some exhilarating and brilliantly rendered action at it's climax. and let's not forget the, shall we say 'dazzling', screen presence of its youngest star. she may prove to be quite a discovery.

i'd never heard of this aussie horror prior to michael elliott's enthusiastic review; in fact, after having read it, i decided to check if the dvd was available at my local rental outlet and it was (albeit a german edition i.e. sans the r1 extras), so i opted to check the film out immediately.while i wouldn't go so far as to give it full marks ¬ñ only a select few titles get them from me, let alone an obscure modern flick ¬ñ i have to say that i was quite impressed with black water. rather than looking back to previous crocodile movies, such as alligator (1980) and lake placid (1999), it evokes the memory of two which saw a small group of people who go on a trip, get lost and find themselves at the mercy of the elements and the creatures inhabiting the place ¬ñ namely long weekend (1978), itself a little-seen but impressive australian production, and open water (2005).the compact, simply-plotted film involves a couple and the woman's younger sister who decide to go fishing in a remote and forbidding part of the australian wilderness, known as crocodile territory; very soon (in fact, before even 15 minutes have elapsed!), their boat is capsized and the guide killed by an alligator ¬ñ so our luckless adventurers take refuge up a tree. the dvd talk reviewer believes the film suffers from spending too much time in this one location ¬ñ with the three arguing about what they should do, attempts to retrieve the boat, seeking a way out of the jungle through the trees (only to be met with nothing but water) and the occasional attack by the monster. however, i think the makers take the situation as far as it will go without slipping into tedium: this is due to the palpable suspense and, as michael said, the believability of the characters (particularly the two women)¬Öbut also the fact that the crocodile here makes for one of the scariest and most memorable in recent memory (i wonder how they got it to 'perform')! i also agree with mike that the film contains some really effective shock moments ¬ñ the alligator leaping out of the water to take a bite at the petrified heroes; its head suddenly emerging in front of the women as they're making for the boat; even though one of them does reach the vehicle, the monster manages to lift its massive weight and get in the boat with her!; towards the end, as the same girl manages to find a gun (on the mangled body of their guide), loads it and lies in wait for the alligator to appear, the latter sneaks up from behind her (incidentally, the creature is bestowed with the craftiness of the shark in jaws [1975]). with this in mind, the finale is just as crowd-pleasing (though on an obviously smaller scale) as that of the classic spielberg blockbuster ¬ñ even if it has a downbeat follow-up. another definite asset is the film's sparse score ¬ñ which is generally rather lovely, but becoming unnerving at just the right moments.at the end of the day, black water emerges as a breath of fresh air in the face of the demoralizing slump into which horror cinema has fallen of late; for this reason alone, it deserves greater exposure so as to remind us that there's hope yet for our beloved genre (without the real necessity of resorting to the gimmickry of a cloverfield [2008] to command attention)¬Ö

gore hounds beware...this is not your movie. this little nail bitter has very little blood and guts. its basically a version of open water that is effective and worthwhile. but what sets it apart is that we actually like the three leads (unlike open water) who find themselves up a tree when a crocodile flips their fishing boat and munches up their guide. we don't want any harm to come to any of them. so when they start getting into dangerous situations...we actually care. now i like killer animal flicks but i haven't been too impressed with lake placid up to primeval (although i'm still waiting to see rogue and hoping it is somewhere as good as this one!) but this little bugger did the job and did the job well. it's scares are creative and it only lapses into the run of the mill frantic crying sobbing and arguing for brief stints of realism so i never got annoyed. i remember reading the true story that inspired this where three guys went fishing and two ended up in a tree while their buddy was killed by the crocodile . but the thing that always impacted me that gets left out from the film was that the crocodile didn't eat up the buddy. no. for hours and hours he swam around the tree and shook the dead body still in his mouth at the friends in the tree. seeming to stay, if you come down here this is what will happen to you.

as a kid i loved the song "never smile at a crocodile", and if i found myself in this state of affairs, which is actually inspired by true events. smiling would be the last thing on my mind. from the opening set-up, i've never been so entrenched, caught up and finally exhausted like i was when watching this limited budget independent australian horror film, about three people in northern territory trapped in a mangrove swamp with a very conniving crocodile waiting in the water below them. what really brought the film alive, was how realistic it managed to be in transporting the fear and uncertainty of the characters' situation to the audience. semi-documentary camera-work with a disquietingly eerie backdrop and authentic performances effectively take you out of your comfort zone. what we get is a patient survival tale than just a bloody, all-out creature feature onslaught. think of "open water (2003)", where its budget and time restraint made sure it would stay low-key, but this minimal barrier enhanced the experience.the slow-grinding story might be black and white, but it never seemed to become disposable, or succumb to formulaic patterns. well not largely, and the connection between the characters were emotionally engaging even with a bare, straight-forward script. although you can say "less is more", with the actions and expressions illuminating the lingering thoughts plaguing their minds. the ordeal is utterly terrifying, because the threat is very alive and never seems to loosen up. this is what drives the film's chaotic adrenaline, and in which it lasts (even when its kept buried) through to the very end. writers / directors andrew traucki and david nerlich's economical guidance alienates and smartly strings along the viewer with its taut pacing and harrowing psychological traits. in certain patches the notch goes up, with pressure induced suspense and startling images. the way the night sequence is executed is immensely chilling and pulsating. the menacing crocodile manipulative toys with its fresh-meat in a distressingly suspenseful approach. sure some moments felt unlikely, but never does it get in the way or distract. sound fx is the key, and at times the lack of any just eats away at you. rafeal may's musical score is unassuming and doesn't really enter the mixture much, but when it does it builds an organic sounding quality. the cinematography of john biggins is beautifully devised, and rapidly aggressive when the mood changes. it was always on the move and claustrophobic, but none of this jerky movements. the editing was sharply handled, and the effects were professionally catered by superbly combing live crocodile footage. something like this production would also have to rely on its cast to sell to the story in a believable manner and they do it. diana glenn, andy rodoreda and especially maeve dermody are persuasively good. a lot of the responsibility falls on dermody, and she strongly delivers with an inspired turn. now this item might cop some comparisons with another killer crocodile film "rogue (2007)", but the two couldn't be any different in what they want to be and how they end up. if i had to pick though, i'm leaning more towards this outing for its sheer involvement to snap at you.a remarkable effort on all fronts, with everyone involved showing potential to really look out for.

this low budget crocodile movie really delivers the goods. the fact that it was inspired by true events would mean little if you wound up with a fake looking crocodile, bad c.g.i., or an obvious studio setting. fortunately none of the above are involved with this terrific, very realistic film. the crocodile is real, there is no c.g.i., and the on location filming takes place in an actual australian swamp. the actors were obviously inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performances, and they succeed. you can place yourself in their predicament, which is testament to how realistically "black water" translates as entertainment. highly recommended. - merk

"black water" is one of the most tense films i have viewed in a long time. the story moves fast as it follows three tourists (all great actors) into a swamp on a tour with a butch tour guide on a small boat. soon after dropping anchor in a remote area of the swamp, they are flipped over by something huge in the water.hastily, the three manage to make it into a tall tree nearby as they realize that a crocodile has attacked them. throughout the next two days, they have to desperately try to escape from the crocodile's evil watchful eye, and he doesn't seem to want to go away. the movie drags just a tad bit, but what can you expect from the setting and the limited budget? it's so much better than "primeval" and other recent crocodile/ underwater predator thrillers. the tension is heavy, and all three leads give terrific performances. truly chilling, this movie struck a deep chord of claustrophobic fear in me. apparently based on true events.

while on vacation on northern australia, gracie (diana glenn), her husband adam (andy rodoreda) and her younger sister lee (maeve dermody) decide to take the blackwater barry tour in the swamp for fishing. their guide jim (ben oxenbould) uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote spot. when they stop, they are attacked by a huge crocodile that capsizes their boat and immediately kills jim. the three survivors climb a tree and when they realize that help would never come to rescue them, they decide to try to find a way out of their sheltered location. however, in the muddy water, their boat is flipped and the crocodile stalks the trio under the water."black water" is a tense, realistic and dramatic low-budget movie and in accordance with the warning in the beginning, based on a true event. the acting of the unknown diana glenn, maeve dermody and andy rodoreda is top-notch, giving credibility to this simple but scary story. there are many similarities between this movie and "prey", but in different environments. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "medo profundo" ("deep fear")

warning: i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.this movie was on the shelf at a movie store and since i had seen a handful of very corny horror flicks there i had really low expectations for this one. well, i put it in, and almost immediately i was sucked right in. while watching, i got deeper and deeper into the story and pretty soon i was staring in complete interest. this movie is surprisingly spectacular and i loved every second. the story is about a boat ride down a river in australia. it seems safe enough until their boat is ambushed by a croc who's ready for some food. when i looked at the back of the case i thought that this movie was going to have crappy visual effects like in lake placid 2 and a lot of others, but when i first saw the crocodile it looked amazingly real! don't laugh when i say this, for i am being serious, but this is one of the most creepiest films i've ever seen. it really knew how to build up nail-biting tension and suspense with it's intense situation, i mean, think about it; your stuck, in a tree, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide with a hungry predator in the depths of the water below. you can not tell me that doesn't freak you out just a little. it even managed to give me a few chills down my arms, like when adam was taken by the croc and grace and lee are left baffled. this is a very appealing movie. there were maybe 1 or 2 parts where i found myself slightly uninterested but other than that, i would say this is my favorite animal attack film that i have seen.

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.in the tradition of all good animal centered thrillers ie jaws, the edge, the original cat people, the directors know that restraint and what isn't shown are the best ways to pack a punch. the performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.if you are after a b-grade gore fest croc romp forget black water but if you want a clever, suspenseful ride that will have you fearing the water and wondering what the hell would i do if i was up that tree then it's a must see.

while many people found this film simply too slow and simplistic i really connected with it. there is no plot as such, rather the film takes the form of a human survival story about three people trapped up a tree with a man eating crocodile lurking somewhere in the water beneath them.personally, i thought the acting was mostly very good, despite the roles being quite demanding at times, and i felt a sense of warmth for the characters. the situation they were in was quite terrifying and i really felt nervous for them. i found the whole film quite nerve wracking because of the sheer helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival.the crocodile effects were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget film, and believe me, i have seen my fair share of dodgy croc movies. the creature moved well and had real menace and, although the audience i was with didn't seem too keen on the film as a whole, they still jumped and gasped whenever the crocodile appeared.script-wise, i would have made a few changes, particularly towards the end, but this was not a major problem. for fans of slow-burning survival horror set within the realms of reality this will be an engaging film but unfortunately i think for many audiences seeking a thrill ride and higher production values from their cinema experience the point will simply be missed.

as i am a teenager, i have about one hundred years of movies to catch up on. i try to see a mixture of classics, mainstream, art-house, and other movies. the 70's is one of the most important decades for films: it's when the average, common, classical films changed into full of messages and anti-social behavior. it became like nothing anyone had ever seen before. what a decade under the influence basically shows is how important all of the movies from around the graduate to about star wars.richard lagravenese and the late ted demme are the primary interviewers in this documentary, which interviews such people as dennis hopper, francis ford coppola, martin scorsese, robert altman, and jon voight, among others about how those few years changed cinema forever. it's a very professional, polished documentary, and it's even financed by ifc films. however, as this is a very professional one, i would think that they would at least edit out the noise of someone behind the camera laughing. to me, that took out a lot of how neat and clean the whole thing was.on the other hand, it's a very interesting documentary, about film by the people who make it. of course, they aren't bashing their own films or anything of the like, but they're portraying honesty on what they thought of the films and what they meant. i don't know much about film (but i want to be involved around it when i become an adult), so i feel like to someone like me this movie is a huge asset. i have seen a good number of movies that they mentioned, like chinatown and one flew over the cuckoo's nest, but a little more insight into those movies were very informative.the main reason, however, i didn't love influence is, as slickly as it was edited, it seemed to take its time in the beginning and be quite relaxed, therefore not having enough time to get to everything that they wanted to show. they crammed in star wars and jaws in the last few minutes, when they were two of the most important. it seemed like they tried too hard to show lots of clips, and that's fine, but some of them were unimportant, such as an extended one from network.overall, though, influence is a very enthralling, informative documentary that helped me, at least, learn more about a second `golden age' in american cinema.my rating: 7/10rated r for language, and images of sexuality, violence and drug use.

i swore i would never allow myself to devolve into to the bogus authority figures of the sixties who told me things were better in the "good old days" ¬ñ the current australian prime minister is a sordid example of just such a mind set.but i switched over to "a decade under the influence" because i found watching the much-heralded "sneakers" documentary on the other channel such a dispiriting experience. i found the values expressed by the "sneakers" interviewees too ugly to accept as reasonable. so materialistic! so devoid of any sense of outrage at a society that can countenance killing someone to steal his very ugly shoes! so lacking in any worthwhile purpose that they can report without distaste the exploitation an audience by haranguing them to hold those shoes above their heads to lock in a sponsorship deal for themselves with a company of cobblers was just too much to continue watching."a decade under the influence" depicted a completely different response to the fruit of stupidity, corruption and concupiscence in high (and low) places.i have noted the change in film-making that accompanied the exposure of america's disastrous foreign policy debacles in vietnam and so many less reported places in my www.peterhenderson.com.au website. "a decade under the influence" documents the precise moment at which that change took place.before the seventies, the armed forces were depicted in american films as an invincible fighting force comprised of decent human beings who transmogrified into conquering heroes on the battlefield. after the seventies they are generally portrayed as a dispirited rabble misled by a bunch of bureaucrat clowns in the pentagon before the seventies, the fbi agent and the honest cop tended to be depicted as your friend and protector. after the seventies, the fbi agents were all incompetent and the best a cop could aspire to was to ignore their foolishness and his superior's corruption and uphold justice in his own idiosyncratic manner.before the seventies, the archetypical american "little guy", the "average joe", the jimmy stewart type would face down the problems encountered and thereby gain some insight into underlying wisdom of his elected leaders and justice of the "american way". after the seventies, kevin costner usurps that role, but now he is the voice of one crying out in the wilderness for evil to be exposed, or accepting his lot and making out the best he can.and now those "old time religion" mindsets have been stripped of any honesty and righteousness and portrayed (with a certain amount of justification) as sanctimonious bigotry and self-serving hypocrisy."a decade under the influence" tells it like it was. "a decade under the influence" tells it like it is now. it depicts the redemption of the american film industry from the hands of the artistically, morally and intellectually bankrupt studio moguls. it shows the storming of the hollywood bastille by the independent film makers who promised to get a disillusioned and tired audience back into the cinemas. the fact that their failures were numerous, and at times disastrous, merely underlines the greatness of their achievement. an achievement reflected in the adventurous and questioning attitudes of the big box office stars such as clooney, daman, affleck etc and the directors and producers who provide the vehicles for their talent.

this exploration of a unique decade in us cinema begins with the fall of one ailing, out-of-touch empire and culminates with the unstoppable rise of another, equally associated with escapism and box office receipts. meet the new boss, same as the old boss. or, as peter fonda observed in easy rider, "we blew it." in between, from bonnie and clyde to star wars, the young turks (some under the guerrilla tutelage of roger corman) were creeping under the wires to produce some of the greatest artworks of the 20th century. while the story is already familiar from peter biskind's easy riders, raging bulls directors demme and lagravenese are less concerned with muckraking than in providing a platform for the filmmakers and stars themselves.everyone from martin scorsese to francis ford coppola and julie christie is interviewed and a roster of well edited clips places the decade in a socio-cultural and economic context. if their responses are self-congratulatory (to say the least), they're also highly quotable, funny and revealing, making this something of a cinephile's wet dream. director william friedkin reveals how the original the exorcist poster was to feature a little girl's hand holding a bloodied crucifix and the legend 'for god's sake, help her", before he complained. former warner bros.' head john calley recalls that when he first saw robert de niro in mean streets he assumed scorsese had secured a psychopath's day release for the shoot.happily, a certain amount of hard perspective has crept into the mix, as might be hoped from a politically motivated, consciousness-expanded generation; hopper stresses "there's a lot of real crap in there too". julie christie observes that 1970s us cinema was "not a good time for women". but if demme responds with a spoonful of sops to women's movies - brief clips of alice doesn't live here anymore, they shoot horses, don't they and klute - we're soon dragged back to the usual male wall-pissing contests.the shift from tough, socially-conscious film-making to no-risk crowd-pleasers like jaws for 'nam-weary, fantasy-craving audiences is also documented, though a little rushed. but kudos too, for the inclusion of lesser-sung, but equally relevant films like panic in needle park and joe. "we weren't handsome," muses bruce dern on his contemporaries. "but we were f****** interesting."

what a wonderful documentary - i sat down thinking this would be a rehash of the bitchy stories told in easy riders, raging bulls, but it is, in fact, a clear-eyed, glorious celebration of a strange and twisted era that spawned some truly great movies. what struck me was the lack of bitterness apparent in the director interviews, given that now the movie business sucks in a large fashion - instead, folk like friedkin and coppola's eyes seem to positively glitter recalling their glory days. the footage of an audience coming out of a daytime screening of the exorcist was priceless. 'it was - traumatic,' one guy says. a great epitaph for the late ted demme, a thrilling film, i just wish it was longer - i could have sat through a three hour cut of this.

a surprisingly good documentary. my surprise was mainly due to the fact that i was confused by the title. i assumed this was about the influence of the drug culture on film making but no it is a much more far reaching and intelligent film than could have been expected. demme has done a great job in encapsulating the period from the late 60s to the late 70s. from, 'easy rider' and the collapse of studio influence, through all those introspective 'real life' movies, where brilliant young directors tried to express themselves politically, sexually and artistically, through to the beginnings of the blockbuster and the return of the reigns to the money men and their studios. as someone who saw the 'real life' movies of britain and the rest of europe through the sixties and then the revolutionary us films of the 70s and is sad that the sequel to the sequel is so much the order of the day, this was a most fascinating film. the interview clips are measured (thanks to dvd the full interviews are available as extras!) and the film clips well considered. also, as someone who has only just caught up with, 'joe', i am impressed that this important little film gets its well deserved entry here.

...and my reasons for which are simple- there are so many great films presented and discussed here (most of them by their own directors and stars), so many clips of infamous moments in 70's movie history, and in fact a number of films i have yet to see, that it wouldn't be fair to grade this work. by this logic i shouldn't have given grades to other movie documentaries like martin scorsese's personal journey through american movies and my voyage to italy. but while those films were on the basis of one man's view of cinema, narrating through most of the way, richard lagravanese and (the late) ted demmes' a decade under the influence lets the films and the creators speak entirely for themselves. what makes 'decade' worth at least one watch for film buffs, or just anyone who likes the films of the late 60's-70's in america, are the levels that it goes to, that in the uncut version (three hours, not the theatrical version, which i have no comment on) plenty of ground is covered. interviews include the likes of scorsese, robert altman, sidney lumet, julie christie, jon voight, francis ford coppola, paul schrader, pam grier, bruce dern, peter bogdanovich, roger corman, dennis hopper, robert towne, etc, and there's a constant flow of insight from start to finish. the way the clips and directors/actors pop up, edited together in a flashy and quick style, is also fascinating. the one down comment i have on the documentary is that most of the information presented has been reported on in various books, like easy riders, raging bulls, and though i haven't seen the movie version of that book yet i'm sure it would have covered many of the films and directors and incidents as here (in fact, the book of that is one of the best i've ever read. however, this documentary serves as something special for film buffs and occasional movie goers of the future- they can look at this and learn not only about such well known pictures as easy rider, the last picture show, annie hall, coming home, and lessor knowns like scarecrow, panic in needle park, the landlord, joe, they shoot horses don't they. they can also learn about who influenced them (new waves of europe and asia), who they served as influences for, and how the subject matter that created controversy after controversy still serves as intriguing and chancy material for the contemporary crowd. seek this out!

john leguizamo is a great comedian and storyteller. every time this has been on hbo i've had to stop and watch it. john tells the story of how he grew up (probably some fact and fiction) and adds hilarious stories in the midst. if you like john's comedy i would have to say this is probably his comedy at his best.

this one man show may be the most fantastic show i've ever seen. to call this simply a stand up act is to do it a great injustice, there is a definate reason that this was a broadway show. john leguizamo is a master of making people of every culture feel at home listening to his story of growing up and dealing with his family and life in general. i would reccomend this show to anyone, as long as they can handle the language.

after watching john preform this one of a kind show, i had to share.....it was really something to watch a grown man portray himself as a child. i like the fact that with every character he "became," you could picture what they looked like. it is more entertaining when you can understand the individual. "freak" is what real "stand up" should be. john is real talent.

john has made two one man shows. spic o rama and freaks, and neither one has shown up on dvd... john!!! why do you this to me john?? put it on dvd john, so the people can see,they need to see john!! :d... just in case anyones keeping a watchful aye!!

this was very energetic and well played show. i saw it back in 98 and my friends and i still joke about it. each time i watch it's always as funny as the first. i also love the way that everyone can relate to it in their own particular ways. i am very much looking forward to seeing more of john's own scripts and productions. unfortunately i can't find it anywhere for sale, and i've done quite a lot of looking. if anyone knows a website or store to refer me to, i would very much appreciate it as i am looking for his other live performances as well. please send me a message if any of you have info on the subject. thankyou.

i never saw any of john leguizamo's stand-up before i watched freak, and after seeing it again on hbo comedy recently it was better, more enlivening and with things that, at the age of 14, i couldn't understand quite before. spike lee did a wonderful job directing, keeping the visual angle up to par with leguizamo's theatrics and the style of personal storytelling; it's substance and style merging together but unobtrusively. we get leguizamo's rants about race and sex (the bits about sex are classic), but a lot of it is about family, and what sticks still fresh in my mind is about his father. even when things get dark in some of the stories, there's something fresh or crazy or random that leguizamo pulls out to get a laugh, and it works more often than not. if something does fall flat (for me at any rate) it might be his personality tics here and there. but overall, it's the kind of fun material that isn't heady, but is so true to itself that it stings. find it if you can!

after seeing this routine by john leguizamo, i finally realize why he is such a talent. i enjoy great stage work, and this is stage work at its best. i cannot label it as a stand-up routine, because leguizamo is so intense when playing the different characters. the only time he breaks character is when it is necessary for him to complete his part in which he does so coolly, that you cannot help, but appreciate his talents. i wasn't really sure how i felt about him as an actor, but freak solidified my appreciation of him. for those out there that have not had the opportunity to see this show, i feel for you. definitely check it out. it is one of the nest routines i have ever seen. ranks with eddie murphy, bill cosby and chris rock. four stars and more.

john leguizamo's one man shows are hit or miss: mambo mouth showed off his intense characterizations and great timing but the material was average, spic-o-rama accomplished the former as well but this time the material was funny, freak is a classic followed by his disappointing sex-o-holic. but his stuff in freak showcases his genius and when he's in the spotlight he's without peer.freak's semi-autobiographical look at the journey of a young man has power and resonance i don't think even it's creator knew about. by allowing us the chance to see his soul, mr. leguizamo gives us an opportunity to project our own life onto his and there can be no greater gift a performer can give. the willingness to drop 'the wall', expose and share is too terrifying for most actors-they use characters to hide behind-but jl goes full-throttle and gleefully smashes any pretenses. lenny bruce and richard pryor were our best cultural observers/comedians/actors because they spoke from their heart about whatever they noticed in society and the truth provided slashing humor. combine that with a great actor's gift of mimicry and being in-the-moment (not to mention a sense of humanity) and you'll see john leguizamo has the power to do the same. at least in freak he does.from birth to his first big break and every life altering moment in between, a viewer sees our host and other characters in their most private moments all the while experiencing the pain, hope, and humor that comes with. looking drained and lean muscled-tight jl is ringing with sweat by evening's end having offered up his crazy life for an audience; spike lee's fluid camera work captures the actor's nuances down to the last lip curl and slow blink. the scenarios range from drinking with his machismo-fueled father (when he was 9) to seeing a chorus line with his gay, deaf uncle; his first girlfriend's vicious humiliation when he strips naked, eager to have sex. a nightmarish first sexual encounter with a large german woman in the back of a kentucky fried chicken follows an unsuccessful attempt to pick up a "drunk lapsed catholic" in a bar on st.patty's day. climaxing in a serious showdown with his mother and father, it's here that he shows his true genius: he plays a scene between these two characters and himself and his brother with such a strong dramatic/humourous intensity, you forget you're watching only one person. there's no costume changes, bad wigs, lighting tricks, or makeup. just an actor giving his all. it's simply amazing.other actors/comedians that stand out right now are eddie izzard and chris rock but they don't dive into themselves as deeply as john leguizamo does; that's not a criticism, not by a long shot. i love their work but freak is different. it's moving in a no-b******* way. it's the best one man show out there and no one will be able to touch it for a long time.

definitely not a film to revolutionize the industry or introduce any new techniques of film-making, this is a very handsome and solid production. it's miraculous that we can today enjoy it in superb quality on dvd - probably most of the viewers about a 100 years ago saw a black and white copy, as the stencil tinted de luxe edition was available only at the very best theaters. even if you are not fascinated by this film or the subject of it, you can't but marvel at the copy released by image entertainment (together with another gem, from the manger to the cross, 1912). it's virtually impossible to see a film that is over a century old but shows so little damage. the process of stencil colouring was a very effective one and, compared to the occasionally blurry and smeared images of hand coloured film, the colours are crisp and well defined. filmed within the limitations of the film-making as known back in 1902 when the filming commenced, the static nature of the scenes can today be considered almost intentional, meditative and solemn. the tableaux keep moving at a steady paste, so the film never gets tedious. you might not be fascinated by this film as a work of cinematography, but it sure is handsome as a work of academic, picturesque art. if you are a religious person, the fact that you are watching anonymous, long since departed people playing long since departed characters, adds to the mystery significantly. a proper viewing for christmas or lent. p.s: i've ticked the "contains spoilers" box just for fun. as you can see, i haven't revealed the ending.

i have always been fascinated by silent films. there is something about seeing actors and actresses from 100 years ago performing. jaded by today's high-tech special effects, i always try and imagine what it was like to watch a particular film at the time of it's original release. it helps to appreciate the crudeness of early cinema."the life and passion of jesus christ" is a very charming production from pathe, originally filmed in 1902, but expanded and finally released in 1905. imagine a series of famous religious paintings coming to life, separated by title cards, and you will have a pretty good idea of what this film is like. for example, the scene in which mary and joseph rest as they are escaping to egypt, is almost identical to luc olivier merson's 1879 painting "rest on the flight to egypt", right down to mary sitting on the famous sphinx. while some might find these "living paintings" an unimaginative cop-out, i found them to be very charming, and very nostalgic.the sets and costumes appear to be right out of a stage production of the life of christ. possibly from and elaborate passion play of the day. the make-up on the cast is very theatrical, so much so that a close-up of jesus is almost comical. again, where others might be bothered by the cudeness of them, i was quite charmed.having been filmed over a period of 3 years, the continuity isn't too bad. the biggest flaws are in the casting changes made over that time. the characters of john the apostle and the 12 year old jesus change in mid scene, much to the audiences surprise!the best unintentional humor, of the film, is in the birth of jesus scene. the baby literally appears, as if by magic, in the manger between mary and joseph. maybe it was simply my frame of mind at the time i viewed it, but i laughed out loud! if only child birth were that easy!!!! to top it off, the actress who plays mary looks bored through the whole scene (actually, through the whole movie), as if this sort of thing happens every day! my, how times have changed!as simplistic as this film is, compared to today, it's really a wonderful window into the past. i recommend it!

tempo di uccidere (time to kill) by guiliano montaldo is a bit of a strange film, but it's good in it's own way.i won't bother with a summary of the plot. most that i've read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most people who wrote those didn't really understand the film. and you need to understand it to some level, even if you cannot describe for yourself what it's actually about. this film is strange in a "once upon a time in america" way- only shorter.many 'hollywood' stars (whatever that may mean...) have played in lesser known italian productions. it's known that many actors who are past their prime or slowly rising to it do this. cage was not yet a real star when this was made. i'm not a fan of him. he's very good in some roles (raising arizona, bringing out the dead) and weak when he plays the hero. i don't really know what to think of him in this one, but he sure doesn't portray the typical hero main character. this film could have done without him, but the fact that he starred may be the only reason this one ever made it to dvd.the supporting cast is good. not one of them looks fake and they act as if they are really there. solid support.i have seen 3 films by montaldo (marco polo, sacco&vanzetti and this one) and i think he is one of the greater directors of this time. unfortunately, nobody knows him. this movie was his last in a long time (a break of 19 years). i think that this movie might have failed at the office, but from the way it is done i think that for montaldo it was a personal project that he really liked.the production is great. it's always enough. the dusty army camps, the claustophobic cities and the magnificent landscape all play a great part. it all feels very real. in some scenes you can almost feel the heat. the sound itself is nothing special, but the music by ennio morricone is very good. it's not a piece that you will whistle when in the shower, but it sure works great.so this movie looks, feels and sounds just right. it doesn't serve the lessons learned from it on a golden platter, but that may be the biggest difference between hollywood and euro-cinema all around. it might sound strange to give it an 8 and not recommend it to people, but that is what i do. if you are looking for action; avoid this one! if you are looking for a well made apocalypse now in a different time and setting, but with a bit of similar journey into a 'state of mind'(sorry if this sound corny but i don't know what else to call it) you just might enjoy this one a lot.

in the wake of my personal research into the pending "end cycle" time of 2012 presented by the mayan calendar system, i believe this movie should be seen every bit as much as "what the bleep do we know?" while some may believe that matters of top level science should only be communicated in doctorate level "speak," "the elegant universe" breaks such barriers. the visuals and the select dialog make it easy to comprehend this walk through the history of physics. there are numerous messages in this movie, the least of which is that academic science must always be ready to revise what's being taught. true, pure discovery science is beautiful because there's always something additional and exciting to bring to the fore if we have the courage to seek it out in the face of "established" science.

the elegant documentary -don't watch this movie ... if you're an egotistical know-all student of physics. this much less than one percent (miniscule fraction) of the population may find that this show just tells them what they have already learned and already know.do watch this movie! - if you're one of the massive majority of people that fall into the greater than 99% of the population that does not study or already have a sound knowledge of the theories of physics including relativity, quantum, string and m-theory.what a brilliantly architected documentary. starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a universe of pure magic - and dimensions beyond. i have always had a huge appreciation of mathematics. this movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics is without making you feel like you're about to fail the grade.the show is repetitive at times as the original format was a mini-series split over three shows. it therefore makes sense to give us polite little reminders of the principles being presented. i found this immensely helpful as it kept reminding me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence.we are all (and everything around us) is vibrational-energy with a natural tendency towards harmony. this movie may blow your mind - or at least help you realize that the universe is far far bigger than that which we see around us (even with the hubble telescope) and far far smaller than the protons and neutrons within the atoms we learned about in high-school. m-theory holds many magnificent magnitudes of 'possibility'.it just seemed so appropriate that all of this elegance should by it's very nature move (by admission by the many brilliant scientists presenting) out of the realm of science and into the realm of philisophy.you do not have to be religious at all to feel like this movie brought you one step closer to god.bravo brian greene. well done indeed.p.s. if you're interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place in the universe and would like some more insight into the 'possibilities' quantum mechanics blended with spirituality (of all things) can bring then i highly recommend that you also watch "what the bleep!? - down the rabbit hole". yes i know they make a few silly mistakes by suggesting a shaman may not be able to see a boat if he hasn't seen one before (my eyes process light reflections just fine - i see things everyday that i've never seen before) and brain cells are cells in the body that actually don't divide. but if you can get over these little hurdles and put down the things you don't like and hang on to those that you do - there is a lot to like about this film.then watch "the secret" (2006 documentary about the law of attraction - search for imdb title "tt0846789"). this information just might change your life profoundly - forever. if you search deeper you might even find the universe is talking to us with thought (if you'll listen) - and some are - and that is truly incredible. there is a modern day jesus/mohammad/buddha (those, among others, that history suggests have communicated with the non-physical) alive today and she lives in texas. i know some of you know what i'm talking about.i do not consider myself religious by any traditional definition but i have never felt more at home or as comfortable in the universe as i do now.

ok. on the whole, this three part documentary will bring most interested people up to date with going's on in the world of physics, and the last 300 years of discovery of our universe. if you have read stephen hawkings brilliant book "a brief history of time" and understood it then you might benefit from the visual description of certain concepts..which i did to a certain extent. greene is bearable, but obviously for the sake of the masses, tends to explain things in a slighty patronising way. this is of course deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who watches this series.the guest scientists were good. (no hawking, but i suppose he has his own dvd(s) ) i kept waiting for him to appear but they rotate through the same ones for almost 3 parts... (very american weighted here, with a few brits and one antipodean) i bought the nova 2 disc edition (ntsc) and there were a few inclusions that really detracted from the overall experience.1. the "this is brought to you by.." at the start of each part was a necessary evil for the first part, but seeing it 2 more times before it was over was very ordinary.2. can't be helped i suppose but there is quite a bit of overlap at the start of 2 and 3 which had me reaching for the ffw button a few times.3. this disc set was straight from tv..(ie ads, what happen last show for those that missed it, and frequent "goto pbs.org for more ...." )appearing throughout the presentation. (quite unlike bbc material which is unmatched for presentation..planets, the blue planet, etc) my 7/10 is based on content alone. the niggles were there but i got over them. if this had have been done with that classic british accented presenter( you know the one) it would be a perfect disc set in my opinion.if you have seen this and want more...then i highly recommend hawkings book " a brief history of time"... i wish it was a movie too.happy viewing.

i myself am a physics student, and i have to say i think this is one of the best 'popular' introductions to string theory that's out there. the elegant universe manages to make the entire topic of string (although it's actually m) theory accessible to a wider audience.some 'popular science' programmes feel that the best approach is just to throw the audience in at the deep end, throwing technical jargon at them without so much as an explanation, and presenting the theory in a boring, stale style. this programme goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics, and explains the issues that need to be resolved between the two so we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe on both a large and small scale.i suppose some could say it's slow and takes too long to get to the interesting stuff like extra dimensions and wormholes, but the thing is: that's against the point. explaining string theory from the start is nigh on impossible without at least mentioning the physics at its base, and the way it's explained in the elegant universe is clear and entertaining.whether you'll like this program really does depend on if you're willing to perhaps be initially dumbfounded by some of the ideas that greene presents: extra dimensions and warping of spacetime aren't exactly prevalent in everyday life, are they? but, if you persevere with some of the more exotic concepts in this programme, you'll find that it will give you an insight into the research that drives the world of physics today. and if you're studying physics, well, it's great entertainment as well as you'll be likely able to follow this and appreciate it even more!

i own a video store with hundreds of documentaries. i have seen loads of them and love all of the great info out there. only a small handful though even come close to offering info as important as this one. i have been reading through other peoples reviews of this film and can't help but notice that the main things people are criticizing are irrelevant. such as "it is very one sided" such a pathetic criticism, every where in society that you look you will see the other side, and if you still need help go to globalpublicmedia.com. "it is the same people over and over" uh one might be led to believe that these people are the experts, so maybe they are the best people to interview. "filming style is all the same, head shots with few exceptions" if you want flash and dazzle watch micheal moore if you want info watch real docs such as this one. as you can plainly see none of these complaints have any relevance to the information contained. my guess is that these people are just missing the point and don't wanna give up there suv's.my recommendation: watch it. learn from it, and continue your education about such subjects. it is very important stuff for everyone.

the end of suburbia neatly collects many of the concerns with the coming "peak" of the world's oil supply. as the world population grows, so does demand for oil and power. as we extract oil and power, we come to a "peak" in production. more oil is demanded, less oil is generated. the inevitable outcome is conflict, and major change. this film will be disturbing, and alarming if you're new to the topic. you may react at first with anger and denial because the implications are so grim. it should be required viewing. beyond politics, beyond optimism, the math is undeniable. suburbia is the focus, because our suburban living areas will be the communities most impacted when the price of energy skyrockets. while intuitive logic would tell you that the big cities will be the places to avoid during a time of crisis, the spread out nature of suburbia will make it difficult if not impossible to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles to transport us. peak oil is no longer a topic for discussion by survivalists and backwoods crazies. this issue will be at our doorstep sooner than we think. this film is a lucid, coherent look at it.

i have the good common logical sense to know that oil cannot last forever and i am acutely aware of how much of my life in the suburbs revolves around petrochemical products. i've been an avid consumer of new technology and i keep running out of space on powerboards - so i know that even the energy crunch associated with peak oil will change my life appreciably.the end of suburbia shows, in a rational and entertaining manner, just how much my whole family's lifestyle will have to change in my lifetime. i am particularly concerned for the future generations who will have to pick up the tab for our excesses, however the film-makers do offer a glimmer of hope in that they acknowledge human resourcefulness and determination - and the sense of community that tends to be engendered by shared hardship.there is no point in trying to pretend that peak oil is baseless propaganda - or in treating it like the approaching radioactive cloud in "on the beach" (i.e. with suicide pills at the ready). even with our best efforts, times will get harder all over, and i'm hoping there's enough compassion and humanity to go around.

i always knew the day was coming. we all knew. there's only so much oil in the ground, and one day we'll run short. but isn't there supposed to be enough coal to use instead? and wind power, or something. things for future generations to worry about.then this documentary hit me smack between the eyes. oil makes the fertilizer that is the reason for the first time in world history practically no one lives on farms. when the inevitable oil shortages hit, a lot of things -- air travel, many drugs, plastics, life in the suburbs -- will become impossible. but the craziest insight from the documentary is this: oil gives us so much energy with so little effort, that without it our lives must change. even if substitutes and conservation are implemented immediately, at best they'll smooth our landing into a strange post-oil world which (the documentary claims) could be starting now.despite its gloomy message, the documentary is often highly entertaining. it contains fabulous historical footage (sober images of dark urban factories, and campy funny stuff from the 1950's) which reminds us of why we moved to the suburbs in the first place. it also offers hope that a massive effort started now could both ease our transition from oil and make the world a better place.my only complaint about the documentary is that it does not spend time on the mystery of why we are finding this stuff out now. how can this be a big emergency all of a sudden? we knew in the 1970s we should be preparing for a post-oil world -- and we started to prepare with alternative energy research and smaller cars. if our failure to follow through on president jimmy carter's initiatives 25 years ago has doomed us to a hard landing in a post-oil world, why was no one shouting about it on soapboxes?in the end i found the documentary highly persuasive; and it left me with the terrible chill of being dragged out of a very lovely dream. this is must viewing for everyone not afraid to face a very likely near future that we still have time to do something about.- charles

this documentary was my first introduction to peak oil theory. a fascinating concept that has a lot of frightening consequences if it turns out to be correct. i had absolutely no idea that the effects of oil depletion would come so soon, it literally took my breath away. this movie will probably open your eyes as to how strongly the american way of life is dependent on the "abundance of cheap oil" - a term used throughout the film. a lot of the topics are plain common sense, and they don't go into a huge amount of depth about any of them. but you've probably never put all the pieces together like this movie does. the interviews with the authors and energy experts are all very interesting. i don't think this film is meant to scare people. it's merely meant to inform people about what to expect in the years ahead, and maybe to encourage you to think twice about commuting 100miles to work and leaving your lights on all day long.after watching this film i was no longer able to look at the cars and buses zooming by quite the same. great documentary, everyone should see it.

first of all this movie is a piece of reality very well realized artistically. some kind of combination between "american beauty" and "as good as it gets". and of course something specifically to all russian movies ( of course the valuable one, no dirty propaganda !) : the problem of loneliness of man ... especially recommended for the people which really want to see beyond all vomitive propaganda about communism ( both positive or negative propaganda ! ). a movie about common people, their problems, lack of satisfactions - especially for young ones, fear when touch the real and too dirty face of the society ... and about the fake "solutions" : alcohol and violence ... and probably the only real solution : true love ... of course it's very well "located" in the space and time of "russian perestroika" but it's valid for all the society ( except a perfect one, but don't worry - not possible to find this on our earth !). for the last time - definitely recommended ...

the main point of the movie, imo, is the fact the joanna's whole life has been nothing but a series of facades. the movie opens up with her secretly dying her gray roots, and hiding the used kit in an empty tissue box. what is strange is that she is hiding this from her husband. if she has to hide mundane things from her loved one, one can bet that she is hiding even bigger things from others involved in her life.when joanna accidentally hits cory, she leaves the scene to call the police. by the time she returns, the police and ambulance are there, as well as people from her community, remarking "what kind of person hits a child then just leaves her there?" well-respected in her community, she makes the decision to keep quiet about what she had done. but, she never realized how difficult it would be the keep up her facades...great movie-i have seen it many times!

this is such a great movie to watch and all the actors put together a great film which would be enjoyed by everyone! it is very emotional in parts, so when you watch it grab a box of tissues to keep you company!! this movie doesn't deserve a rating below 10/10!

margaret colin stars as the principal figure in this story; as i watched it, i remembered her bit part in adrian lynes's "√ºnfaithful" as diane lane's neighbor in a tony ny neighborhood.this movie was surprisingly good, and diane stillman deserves credit for an accurate portrayal of class, crimes, and misdemeanors, which actually occur in upscale neighborhoods (perish the thought!!!).it is real but not over-dramatized; the audience lives through her accident, the pain it has caused;denial; and the ultimate resolution.it is more than just a question of "what is a good person" as colin speaks to her husband....is a person's character defined by one single act; and should they be condemned forever because of their action?? the questions are pertinent; it is also amusing to see several cinematic references to martha stewart (i.e. the fussy, bothersome mother);colin is reputed by her sometime friends to be a "perfect hostess, with perfect genes"....(gag); and a scene wherein colin is confronted by police;(the "friends" also betray her, later)....the denial and facades of american society are addressed; (oh, murder doesn't occur here; similar to the theme in "√§ season in purgatory", by author dominick dunne, about the true murder of martha moxley; in greenwich, connecticut); colin is aware of her crime; but consciously finds herself perpetuating the facade, until she finally breaks down;rent or buy this film; she is an underrated actress who does quite well in these roles.

centres on czech ww2 pilots ¬ñ the older frantisek, the boyish impulsive karel and in the background the quiet piano-playing honza. as the film opens, it is 1950, the war is over and frantisek and honza are imprisoned in a former monastery. in their now soviet-controlled native country they are 'enemy of the people'. honza is severely maltreated by his communist countrymen and dies.in 1939 many pilots manage to escape german-occupied europe and make their way to england where they join the raf. notwithstanding their high motivation and experience they face raf reluctance and british stiff upper lip. finally they fight gallantly in the battle of britain. however, frantisek and karel find their friendship severely tested when they both fall for the same woman.in terms of romantic sub-plot, this is very similar to the hollywood production pearl harbour. however, given the context of the film and frantisek's eventual fate, it is also possible to read the english woman's treatment of the two men as symbolic of british treatment of the czech and polish raf pilots: conveniently forgetting them once the war is over.in addition, the film is a lot less clich√© than pearl harbour and the characters are more fully realised. dark blue world also scores in terms of its stunning aerial dogfights, which were seamlessly created using a mixture of models, actual live-action aerial filming and out-takes from the 1969 epic the battle of britain.in short, dark blue world is a well-made, moving, thought-provoking and exciting drama that puts the likes of pearl harbour to shame. highly recommended.

i absolutely loved this movie. great, realistic looking combat footage for one thing and a touching, genuine story also. the calm, understated manner of the lead character, franta, makes him very likable. the human relationships in the story seemed so very typical and possible of what you could expect in war time. the bond between franta and carel shows the loyalty wartime comrades can have for each other and that is often described in books and interviews with veterans. the subtitles do not detract from the story at all and actually serve to underline the problems the czech pilots had in the raf. the postwar storyline is a great reminder that for many the suffering of ww2 did not end in 1945, especially in russian occupied countries. the cinematography was also very good. wish i could have seen it on the big screen.

planktonrules comments must've been written on topsy-turvy day, because everything stated by that simple life form is the opposite of real truth!'bluebeard's eighth wife' is hilarious in every scene, in every way -- the chemistry between colbert and cooper could not have been finer...supporting cast is superb.writing and direction are magnificent!!!like so many other comments on this board again i lament, "why can't films be like this anymore?" this is classic paramount 1930's screwball comedy at its best, folks!

it's all about getting what you want when you want it. and the message of bluebeard's eighth wife is to be careful what you wish for, until what you wish for wishes for you.most men have heard the stories about what happens when your sexual frustration isn't relieved and a certain part of your anatomy turning blue. misogynistic pirates aside, cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very accustomed to getting what he wants whenever he wants it, learning only too late that it wasn't what he expected and never learning his lesson until he runs into the feisty claudette colbert. through a twisted (in soul and in practice) business deal, he ends up marring/buying her with the intent of bedding her, but she will have none of it (literally) and frustrates him at every turn, and corner, and room, and tourist attraction.the film has definite french sensibilities which means it has strong double-entendres and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge you're not accustomed to (and may not enjoy seeing) in either cooper or colbert. the whole reason i watched the film was because they are "likable" actors, and the whole point of this movie is that they're unlikable people, or at least likable people who have developed unlikable traits to protect themselves, they think, from the world. if you can accept it on its own terms you'll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film...and satisfaction, as we said, is what it's all about. such a movie with such a cast only comes around, after all, once in a...ummm...blue moon.

gary cooper, (michael brandon) played the role as an american millionaire who had seven bad marriages, but always divorced his wife's with plenty of money to live on. michael is in paris on business and goes into a french department store to buy a pair of pajama tops and the sales people refuse to sell him just the tops, he has to buy the bottoms or there is no sale. nicole deloiselle, (claudette colbert) listens to this conversation and offers to buy the bottom of these pajama's. michael becomes very interested in nicole and they have occasion to meet and go on dates. it is not too long before michael proposes marriage to nicole and she is very taken back with his request for marriage since she really does not know him very well. however, once she finds out she is going to become the eighth wife of michael she begins to change her mind and this story becomes quite entertaining and funny. don't miss this film, it is great entertainment by great veteran actors. enjoy.

the lubitsch's touch is more than ever in this film. humour at anytime and very subtle. the plot is simple but turned in a delicious way by the director. the film cut is very clever and add to the comic effect. a real piece of comedy that isn't getting so old for a xxist century spectator. the character are finely acted by gary cooper and especially claudette colbert so smart and mean with this poor micheal in the movie. she avoid every traps from her husband and turn the situation to her advantage, very funny. and no problem, with lubitsch, there is always an happy end. a film for men too confident with women. don't let your girlfriend watch this movie...

this film reappeared on channel 13 in the 1990s when they did a series of comedies from hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s. in fact, to the tune of "the jolly fat policeman", they had a montage of scenes from the films to introduce the series of people laughing, including one of gary cooper chortling when watching a film in a movie house - a sequence from this film.it all begins innocently enough when cooper, a millionaire, goes into a fancy department store in france to buy pajamas. but he only likes to sleep in the tops. the clerk (tyler brooke) insists that he cannot sell half a pair of pajamas as cooper wants. claudette colbert hears the argument and offers to help - she only likes to sleep in pajama bottoms. what if brooke sells them each half? brooke has never had such an offer before, so he goes to the floor walker (rolfe sedan) and asks him if this can be done. he is disturbed too - the request is quite unconventional. eventually they contact the store's owner (charles halton). halton is in bed, and gets out - his skinny frame supporting only a pajama top (if a suitably long one for the sake of censorship). can they sell the two customers one set of pajamas (half for each)? properly horrified, halton answers, "no, of course not! that is communism!!". so the sale is not allowed. apparently nobody thinks that cooper can buy the total pair and sell half to colbert.lubitsch's bluebeard's eighth wife has had a reputation of falling flat, most viewers not liking it because of a misreading of colbert's character. she is seen as quite mercenary towards cooper - selling herself to him on her terms.actually cooper's character is the nastier, as he is rich and figures that everything has a price. he is correct most of the time. look at the way colbert's aristocratic pauper of a father, edward everett horton, sees his new son-in-law as a golden goose he can use. cooper's willingness to marry colbert somehow includes an agreement that if he is hesitant or chooses to not marry her he has to pay damages. horton, when he realizes this, takes out a watch, and (in a most reassuring voice) says to cooper - "take your time my boy!", to come to a decision. later we see horton's wardrobe has gotten more modern and fancier.the film, script by billy wilder and charles brackett, compares well with their script for mitchell leisin's midnight (also with colbert, but with don ameche and john barrymore). there colbert is willing to sell herself for a money marriage to (to francis lederer), but it is complicated by a fictitious marriage to ameche. she really loves ameche (a taxi driver) but she explains to him in an unexpectedly realistic moment that her parents married "for love" but poverty made them grow to hate each other. this is not found in bluebeard's eighth wife, where colbert does not have a background like that (she is, after all, the daughter of a marquis). her mercenary plotting is to teach cooper a lesson about his standards.the film has some nice work by the supporting staff, including herman bing as a private eye who turns out to be hiding things that colbert learns about, and a young david niven, who has a set of choice moments as a stand in punching bag and as a willing ear to cooper. coop tells niven about his problems with colbert, and how she is so infuriating. niven listens respectfully. at the end, cooper is touched by his willingness to hear what he had to say. "albert, how much do i pay you?", cooper asks him. niven thinks and says, "thirty five francs a week sir.". cooper looks deeply into his soul, and says (shaking his head), "that's fair!"

ernst lubitsch gave us wonderful films like design for living, ninotchka, the shop around the corner, to be or not to be, and other wonderful films. but people usually put bluebeard's eighth wife as one of lubitsch's weakest films.but i consider this film as an important film. this film began the collaboration of charles brackett and billy wilder. charles brackett, billy wilder, and walter reisch wrote the screenplay for ernst lubitsch's ninotchka. of course, lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process. after that, charles brackett and billy wilder worked together. they together wrote the screenplay for famous films like the lost weekend and sunset blvd.there are lots of funny moments in the film. i thought "the taming of the shrew" was very funny. there is a famous expression called "films are slices of life." and here is a great example from bluebeard's eighth wife (1938).at the first session of the scripting process, lubitsch posed this question: how do the boy and girl get together? billy wilder promptly suggested that the opening scene should be the men's shop of a department store. "the boy is trying to buy a pajama," he extemporized glibly. "but he sleeps only in the tops. he is thrifty so he insists on buying only the tops. the clerk says he must buy the pants too. it looks like a catastrophe. then the girl comes into the shop and buys the pants because she sleeps only in the pants." ernst lubitsch and charles brackett were enchanted. it wasn't till months later they discovered that billy wilder himself is a tops-only sleeper and that he had been nursing the idea for months waiting for a chance to use it.i got this information from a book. i think this film can be considered as the return of ernst lubitsch. right after this film, he made wonderful films like ninotchka, the shop around the corner, and to be or not to be.i thought gary cooper's performance was good. i think lubitsch casted gary cooper probably because gary cooper played long fellow deeds who inherited the fortune in frank capra's mr. deeds goes to town. but this is just my opinion.as for me, i highly enjoyed the film. i rate this film 9 out of 10. lubitsch films are different, because his films are slices of life.

years before pre-nuptial agreements became a regular thing, ernest lubitsch made a screen comedy on which they are the basis. bluebeard's eighth wife involves gary cooper as a multi-millionaire living on the french riviera who's been married seven times and now marries claudette colbert for number eight. but cooper's a good sport about it, he always settles with his ex-wives for a $50,000.00 a year as per an agreement they sign before marrying him. sounds like what we now call a pre-nuptial agreement.of course claudette wants a lot more than that and she feels cooper takes an entirely too business like approach to marriage. she'd like the real deal and is willing to go some considerable lengths to get it.bluebeard's eighth wife has some really funny moments, the original meeting of cooper and colbert in a men's store where cooper is insisting he wants only pajama tops and colbert looking for only bottoms. and of course my favorite is colbert trailing and blackmailing the detective cooper sends to spy on her. herman bing has the best supporting role in the film as that selfsame, flustered detective.i've often wondered how back in the day hollywood could get away with casting so many people who are non-french in a film like this. of course cooper is an american and colbert of the cast is the only one actually of french background. though david niven is charming as always, having him be a frenchman is ludicrous, he is sooooooo british.nevertheless bluebeard's eighth wife is an enjoyable film and a great example of what was called 'the lubitsch touch' back in the day.

for some perverse reason best known to themselves these imdb boards seem reluctant to credit the great billy wilder as co-scriptwriter on at least two (this one and ninotchka) of his early classics when any buff can detect the wilder hand at work. as it happens this represented the first time he was teamed with charles brackett (who does get a credit) and it was a great start. one commenter has noted how satisfying it is to see these type of films in old-fashioned cinemas and i couldn't agree more. in paris one of the smaller revival houses shows in one of its salles a more or less continuous lubitsch retrospective and i'm pleased to report that this played to a very appreciative audience right across the age spectrum though i doubt whether any were actually alive when it was first released in 1938. the famous wilder schtick the meet-cute is particularly tasty here when millionaire but-careful-with-it cooper attempts to buy half a set of pajamas in a department store on the riviera and meets with sales resistance until claudette colbert turns up and agrees to buy the other half. the gag is milked even more when, having exhausted the chain of command at the store itself the manager places a call to the owner, who is in bed and leaves it to reveal that he, too, is only wearing the top half of pajamas. the film is full of sight-gags like this balanced with verbal wit which makes it just about perfect. claudette colbert is only terrific and gets great backing from edward everett horton as her impoverished titled father. david niven in fourth billing has some funny 'business' as does franklin pangborn and if gary cooper is not up to his role lacking as he does the verbal dexterity and sophisticated persona that wilder scripts called for at this stage of his career well, you can't have everything and what you do have is darned near perfect.

there is something about seeing a movie in a good, old-fashioned movie house that adds enormous appeal to every picture. i, fortunately enough, was able to see at film forum in new york city a pair of ernst lubitsch comedies during their three week tribute to the legendary director. the double feature i attended was a screening of lubitsch's 1938 comedy bluebeard's eighth wife and the pre-code classic design for living, neither of which i had seen before. everything i read of design for living praised the film, but i could not find a good review anywhere for bluebeard's eighth wife. leonard maltin disliked it.videohound, too, gave the comedy a low rating.its imdb score was not complimentary.and pauline kael (not a great surprise) blasted the film in her scathing review. so, when i went into the city that day i was expecting to enjoy bluebeard's eighth wife only slightly and love design for living completely. bluebeard's eighth wife (which was showing first) began, as the eccentrics who populate the cinema took their seats and the thirties music subsided. `adolph zukor presents claudette colbert and gary cooper in ernst lubitsch's bluebeard's eighth wife,' the title card read. then the picture opened with a hilarious scene: cooper wants to buy a pair of pajama tops, but he doesn't want any part of the bottoms! he gets into a squabble with the clerk, who seeks the help of his higher bosses, and their seems to be no end to the argument. enter claudette colbert, one of thirties cinema's most beautiful, charming, and talented personalities. `i'll take the bottom,' she kindly intercedes. and there you have perhaps screwball comedies finest `meet cute' ever. the film kept my interest wonderfully.i found myself laughing almost constantly. when colbert discovers, just before a family portrait is taken, that her groom-to-be has been married seven times, the entire theatre broke into histerics. when she bargains for money immediately after she gets over her shock, the laughs (which still haven't ceased) intensify. and edward everett horton milked some hilarious reactions out of the script as well. when cooper takes inspiration from shakespeare's the taming of the shrew in disciplining his wife by slapping her in the face, i could not control my laughter when she slapped him back. and the drunk scene with the scallions is one of claudette colbert's funniest comic scenes. the greatest comic moment of the film came when colbert highers a boxer to `teach her husband a lesson.' in pure screwball fashion, he knocks out the wrong man, instead putting her friend david niven into a cold sleep. he awakes as cooper is arriving. in order to cover up the situation, colbert herself, in a moment of strong sexiness, puts her fist up to niven, asks: `where did that man hit you? here? right here? right here?' and then bam! knocks him out again! the film was wonderful, from beginning to end it was a perfect delight. i loved design for living, too, though i dare say i think for sheer laughs and entertainment bluebeard's eighth wife was the better and more enjoyable film. there is some charm of seeing a vintage film on the large screen. and in the presence of others laughing, one feels more comfortable doing so himself. that is, perhaps, why i felt the way i did about bluebeard's eighth wife.

despite myself, i really kinda like this movie. pauley shore is invariably laugh-out-loud funny, and here is no exception. he is just excellent at playing the weirdo with a heart of gold.his performance in this, although nothing out of the ordinary for him, is so good, it seems to lift other cast members' performances. perhaps this is because he's the kind of guy it's easy to bounce off of.the clich√©s about country life in this movie are hilarious and the way shore's "city boy", crawl is so at odds with the way of life, is funny too, but it's not only he who's a fish out of water; comedy also comes from the fact, that to any "ordinary" person or people, crawl is a freakish nightmare of a person. that's why this movie works in such a great way: we love crawl, he's a breath of fresh air, but we can also sympathise with the warners. he is one hell of a culture shock.although this movie is classic pauley shore, so there's no great brain power needed to enjoy the movie, enjoy it you do, and there's even a "never judge a book by it's cover" type moral here somewhere. not bad, not bad at all.

i didn't expect much when i decided to watch this movie, so i was surprised to find myself thoroughly enjoying it. a couple of scenes had me laughing almost uncontrollably. the characters were engaging (no pun intended); however, the story is predictable. the fun of it comes from watching crawl (shore's character), a ditzy-yet-wise california dude a country college girl brings home for thanksgiving, trying in his awkward (yet endearing) way to fit in to their lifestyle. i was also surprised that in all this there was a message. if you have a chance, see this movie!

i love it! i love pauly shore. it seems some people don't agree. it's humor, and he's not like everyone else. the movie is great. i love the story line and most of the people in the movie. it's funny from the first time she meets him at school. i like the fact that she chooses him over the guy back home. i like that tiffani theissan isn't a bad girl in the end. all the secrets are let out. only the people you want to see are left in the end. (except for those of you who don't like pauly shore.) even if you don't like him, there are funny parts, and her family tortures him through most of the movie. she's country girl gone wild and needs to be heard. she finally makes it. it's got just the right amount of love and romance. i give it an 8 out of 10.

one of our all time family favorites. when we need a laugh...we just put this one in and laugh all way thru like it is the first time we've seen it. this film has good, clean family humor. pauly shore is brilliant! with no plans for the thanksgiving holiday, crawl (shore) is invited to spend the holiday with a conservative coed, becca. crawl, being a big city boy, must adjust to the farm life if he is to fall in love with becca. but, crawl isn't the only one who is learning new things. crawl teaches becca and her parents how to be more open about their feelings and accepting others. this is fun for viewers of all ages.

along with in the army!, this ranks as one of pauly shore's best movies, if there is such a thing. while the whole west coast-meets- midwest-culture-clash isn't anything new, this film proves to make the story a little more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antics of a then fresh shore. while the change in values probably would have gone in the other direction, the whole concept was rather entertaining. not only was shore's interaction with the family hilarious, it also had carla gugino and tiffani- amber theissen (she'll always have the amber in my book) in two ravishing and early roles. one of those films i have no problem watching when it is on tv.

i recently had the pleasure of meeting mr. hauer at the 2005 sarasota film festival for the u.s. premier of this film. not only was he gracious enough to autograph my copy of blade runner, he took the time to answer some questions about the film before screening the room for a packed theatre. i was so impressed by the film that i used it as the yardstick by which to compare all other films i had seen at the festival. it was powerful and moving, yet subtle and brief. the film tells the story of how a young man, (older version played by rutger) one day finds himself entranced by a seemingly ordinary room in an unremarkable building near the street. walking by, he notices a single window, always open, from which a haunting melody can be heard. each day, he passes by the room, sometimes standing for hours outside, watching it through the silken drapes that flutter in the light breeze, hoping to get a glimpse of its occupants. towards the end of the film, we find out how significant this room really is and what has drawn our protagonist to it. the film was cut beautifully. not a second of screen time was wasted on an uninteresting shot. any single frame from the film could stand alone in an art gallery. rutger is amazing. he is mysterious, yet approachable. his dialogue encompasses a series of reflections on a life that has run it's course, for better or worse. his words conjure familiar feelings and thoughts from the audience. i was particularly moved by a scene in which he is looking at some old photos, remembering his favourite dog, his favourite horse and his first love. you get the feeling that you are in his presence, as he allows you into his world to glimpse precious memories of a life that is nearing its end.i loved this film and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something fresh, intelligent and moving. should be required viewing for all film majors.

knute rockne led an extraordinary life and his story is told rather well in knute rockne all american. we follow rockne's incredible journey from young norwegian boy to iconic american football legend. produced in 1940 the film may at times seem a touch dated and at times downright hokey. and the filmmakers do lay it on a bit thick at times as rockne is glowingly and lovingly portrayed. you may come away thinking rockne should have been nominated for sainthood when in fact he was, after all, just a football coach. but it is undeniable that he had a great impact on the game of football as well as having a tremendous impact on the lives of so many of the young men he coached. this film shows the great impact he had and gives you an insight into why he is so revered to this day.playing rockne, pat o'brien gives an impressive performance. it's unquestionably o'brien's movie to carry and he makes the film and the character his own. the real-life rockne was renowned as a great inspirational figure and o'brien's performance will make you understand why. the only quibble comes early in the film when o'brien, in his early forties, is playing the college student rockne in his early twenties. all the makeup in the world wasn't going to make that believable and the effect is rather jarring. but as the rockne character ages and begins his legendary coaching career o'brien fits the part perfectly.as for the rest of the cast one name jumps out and that is of course ronald reagan playing the young, charismatic, but ultimately doomed football star george gipp. in the grand scheme of the film it's not really a large part, with reagan appearing for no more than 10-15 minutes. but the performance has become legendary thanks to reagan's famous "win one for the gipper" deathbed speech. it's a brilliantly-played scene, chock-full of emotion. reagan may not have been on the screen for very long in this film but he certainly made a tremendously positive impact in a winning performance.the rest of the film strikes a balance between football and life in general with rockne having great lessons for his young men in both areas. for football fans (and history buffs) there is a rare treat as actual archival footage from notre dame games of the rockne era is interspersed throughout the film. it's a rare opportunity to see just how much the game has evolved in the last six-plus decades and an opportunity to see rockne's legendary strategic innovations put into practice. if you're a notre dame fan you'll probably enjoy the fact that the notre dame victory march provides a seemingly constant soundtrack for the film. if you're a notre dame hater...well, then you're probably not watching this movie anyway. knute rockne all american is an inspiring, uplifting, emotional film. perhaps a tad overly sentimental but that's not such a bad thing. it's a very enjoyable film, one well worth taking the time to see.

some time ago, we read of the results of a poll taken by some newspaper sports writers. the questions posed were only two, and were brief and right to the point.the question number 1 asked respondent to tell who was his most beloved college football team. question number 2 asked the fan to name his most hated college football team. the answer to both questions was simply, notre dame! nd is tops on both lists! yeah, love 'em or hate 'em, but you sure don't ignore ,em.the roots of this unique position of this indepent* college football powerhouse are found in the life and career of one, grown-up, little immigrant norweigen boy from chicago named knute rockne.as a biopic, the production of knute rockne, all-american(1940), came out relatively close to the death of coach rockne in a 1930 plane crash. it was about 10 years after that the film was released. that would mean that preliminary work on the project started about 8 years after our nation's great loss of mr. rockne.his likeness and voice were well known from newspapers, radio and motion picture news reels. both knute's widow,bonnie skiles rockne, and the university of notre dame had approval rights in choosing the actor to play the lead and okaying the script. we think that they could not have done the job any better. pat o'brien truly looks the part and was himself a footballer in college. ronald reagan is cast in the pivotal role of george gipp**, a free spirited student going to notre dame on a baseball scholarship! he was a "walk-on" football player.the cast runs full of talented players. we have griffith veteran,donald crisp as fr. callaghan, c.s.c., notre dame president. albert basserman is fr. newland, the chemistry prof and rockne mentor. gail page appears as the mrs., bonnie skiles rockne. owen davis,jr. is rockne cohort, gus dorais(the passer in that historic nd vs. army game at west point.)the cast is rounded out by kane richmond, nick lukats, william marshall and william byrne as the four horsemen. real life big time college coaches howard jones, 'pop' warner, bill spaulding and amos alonzo stagg appear as themselves in scenes of congressional probe into college sports and add an authentic touch. as for biopic,knute rockne all-american!,all one can only say that it hits the ground running, and did not slow down from beginning to end. there is no wasted time either. all the screen time is used to move the story along. use of notre dame choir, the campus itself and all that brass band rah-rah march music all ad to the feeling of really being there.**** to this day,even though their basketball team and other sports teams compete in the big east conference, notre dame remains an independent in ncaa football. what this means, that in effect, the fighting irish play a national schedule.** there was no such agreement with the family of george gipp. there was a lawsuit some years ago over the scene portraying young mr. gipp giving the famous "win onr for the gipper speech". television prints of this knute rockne all-ameican were minus the speech in the death bed scene.*** other notre dame themed films were made over the years. the spirit of notre dame (universal 1931)featured j. farrell mcdonald as a rockne look-alike coach. it also featured lew ayers, andy devine nat pendleton, as well as the members of the real notre dame championship teams featuring the real four horsemen. then of course, we have rudy (tri-star 1993)with sean astin, jon favreau, ned beatty and charles dutton, among others, in a fine cast. there was also talk of an unauthorized film, critical of notre dame called golden glory, but nothing has materialized, has it?(let me know, dear reader, thanx!!)**** warner brothers always had great music in their, both in opening themes and in incidental music. in this rockne movie, they have incorporated the notre dame fight song in the score. along with it were step notre dame and the notre dame alma mater, which had its premiere at the rockne funeral in 1930 at the notre dame basilica.

recently was traveling in norway from bergen, norway and stopped in the small town of voss, norway and there was a monument in honor of knute rockne who was born in voss years ago. the people all know about knute to this day and tour guides are proud to stop at his monument. this film is a great history of this great man and his great love for notre dame never realized that knute has such great talents in chemistry and laboratory science and also taught chemistry for years and at the same time coached the football team. ronald reagan played the role of george gipp, (the gipper) who was an outstanding football player; reagan had a short role, but gave a great supporting role in this film. donald crisp, (father john callahan) was outstanding as a priest who always had great faith in knute during his entire life at notre dame. this is a great classic film and will be viewed by many generations to come. enjoy.

the true life story of perhaps the greatest football coach the game has ever known. knute rockne led the game of football out of the "stone age" with innovations such as the forward pass and offensive formation shifts. but he is probably best known for his motivational locker room speeches. along the way, he brought fame and glory to a tiny, little, unknown catholic school in indiana. pat o'brien is incomparable in his role as rockne. terrific cast that includes ronald reagan who gives a great performance as notre dame's first, true superstar, george gipp.for football aficionados, this is the greatest football movie ever made. do yourself a favor and rent the black and white version. (some versions have deleted scenes for some reason) if you got the good version, look for a brief cameo by the immortal jim thorpe as he sticks his head in the locker room telling rockne and the team they only have a few minutes left before the 2nd half begins.

"knute rockne all american", the biopic about the famous notre dame beloved coach knute rockne, is an excellent sports film to watch. not ever having seen it, we were surprised by the technique used in the movie by director lloyd bacon, who shows he was ahead of his times in photographing football games. the result is a vibrant picture about the man responsible for the legacy of the collegian sport, knute rockne.the film presents rockne from his humble origins in chicago to his studies in famed notre dame university in south bend, indiana. he was an ambitious man who had a vision about how the game should be played. luckily, he went to give his beloved notre dame the glory he was after.pat o'brien looks a bit older when he starts as a freshman. in fact, he doesn't change much throughout the film, but he is fine as mr. rockne. pat o'brien shows he could inspire the players under him by just being a father figure. gale page plays bonnie rockne, the wise woman who understood her husband's call in life. ronald reagan plays george "the gipper" gipp, who was a legend that died much too young, but who left a legacy behind. donald crisp makes a good contribution as father john callahan who was rockne's mentor at the university.this film will delight not only sports because of lloyd bacon's direction and the fast pace he gives to the movie.

it's hard to imagine in this day and age how popular and how much of an impact a norwegian immigrant and would be chemist had on the american public and how much of a national tragedy his sudden death in 1931 was viewed. but knute rockne was an extraordinary individual who both revolutionized and popularized college football and put a small obscure catholic college on the map.i've heard clips of rockne's famous pep talks and it is uncanny how pat o'brien got the voice and the inflection perfectly. in what turned out to be his career role, pat o'brien captures the integrity and fighting spirit that was rockne. rockne is assisted by well by gale page as bonnie stiles rockne who complained about her home being a training camp for notre dame, but never threw anyone out of her house.rockne's first impact on football was as a player with notre dame not a coach. one fine day in the second half of a losing football game against heavily favored army, rockne and team mate gus dorais played by owen davis used the forward pass as an offensive weapon. before that football was simply a game where you just got bigger guys for your side and ran through the defense. rockne didn't invent the forward pass, but he popularized and football became a game of strategy as well as brawn after that. rockne knew how to work the media also. those well publicized pep talks of his were not just to inspire his players. they were well publicized and it was in a lot due to him that college football became a major sport in that golden age of sports in the roaring twenties. playing a small, but key role is ronald reagan. as george gipp, the first player rockne coached to achieve greatness, reagan not only got a good performance, but forever after a name that was handy in his subsequent political career. that deathbed scene which rockne swore was accurate became a republican battle cry as many a gop underdog went out to win one for the gipper.i still remember a widely distributed photograph in 1981 that was one of the first of recovering president ronald reagan at notre dame's graduation with his old friend pat o'brien. reagan always credited o'brien and dick powell of all the warner brothers stars of the period as the ones who were the kindest and most encouraging to a young player on the lot trying to make good.notre dame itself owes its prestige to rockne. it's quite possible that notre dame would be an obscure small catholic college without the reputation that football brought to it.though george gipp and the later famous backfield of the four horsemen certainly had their place in the sun it was rockne who had the reputation. it's no accident that warner brothers was able to get amos alonzo stagg, glenn 'pop' warner, howard jones, and william spaulding, rockne's contemporaries and coaches with great reputations in their own right to appear in knute rockne, all american. it was there way of honoring the guy who was number one in their profession.i think more than football fans will enjoy knute rockne, all american. though you might become one after seeing the film.

uzumaki, is a visually stunning film, and i don't think anyone is going to be able to argue that. but, unfortunately, the story somewhat falls flat.the film nevertheless is very entertaining. it uses it's wild style to tell a somewhat non-existant story. the film almost works, just based on it's characters and style, but in my opinion, leaves something to be desired.

i enjoyed this film very much. it effectively combines humor, fantasy, and a few moments of horror with a solid film making effort from higuchinsky. brilliant visuals and a very original story concerning spirals. my only complaints are that it had its dull moments and wasn't as daring as it could have been. still, i give this a solid 8 out of 10. the u.s. should take note of this and other fine japanese horror/fantasy films that have come along recently and have them available on region 1 dvd. actually, asian cinema in general, have some of the finest films that have been unnoticed by the american public because they're hard to find. i strongly recommend people to go look for these treasures, they're hard to find, but once you find them, you'll be glad you did.

this was a movie of which i kept on reading the reviews again and again; and despite it being played at film museum and not at pathe theatres ¬ñ i decided to give this movie a try. the reasons were many ¬ñ in the reviews it was compared with pulp fiction, it had several parallel stories running in the movie and lastly it had already won 17 awards internationally in various categories. i was eager to see this movie and due to my off day at greenpeace i decided to make myself happy by going and seeing this movie.it is a story based in finland. i think it reflected the current life of people in general ¬ñ drugs, crime, sex, anger, anguish, fear and guilt. every emotion was captured brilliantly in the movie. there are several characters and stories interwoven but a few characters come back in the latter half ¬ñ making a link with the beginning sequences and that takes the story forward.the story is about two friends ¬ñ one of whom is computer geek and the other is a drug addict ¬ñ son of an abusive father. the drug addict boy trades a euro 500 note ¬ñ printed by his friend ¬ñ to buy back his music system, and in returns gets huge change of cash back to buy more drugs. the trading of euro 500 note continues to bizarre events ¬ñ from the shop trader to an auto mechanic cum robber ¬ñ to a car dealer ¬ñ to a vacuum cleaner salesman ¬ñ to a prostitute ¬ñ to a police officer ¬ñ then to her family and children. how the beginning of a small thing ¬ñ creates a chain reaction that lead even after 5 years of that first incident to a depressing last note ¬ñ which i won't reveal here.the direction is excellent. the character development in the movie is first rate. the character that sticks on your mind even after you come out of the movie is of the vacuum cleaner sales person. all the departments of the movie are handled nicely. here i would like to make a couple of critical comments. first, during the sequence of one event leading to another i felt that the coincidences were too rapid and forced. but this screenplay writing error is pardon when one sees the whole canvas. second, the trail of one character leading to another somehow leads back to the first two characters and that again i found to be a forced decision by the screen play writer. there was no need to have the same characters showing up again when there are different causes leading to different effects in such a big city.but after saying that ¬ñ it is an excellent movie! it is a dark movie with quite a few sex scenes. the characters are having the black, white and gray shades and emotions that change from facing different situation which is brilliantly captured by the director.a top rate movie! it has all the ingredients of becoming a cult movie. i hope that only such movies should not become and achieve the status of cult movies and win lots of awards, because without crime, sex, violence, drugs etc. too one can make fantastic movies ¬ñ bicycle thieves and pather panchali are its prime examples ¬ñ only thing is that they were a long time back and times are changing and i think movies are reflecting the current times.

i saw this film at the 2006 palm springs international film festival and director aku louhimies introduced his film and was on hand for q&a after. for some reason this movie is titled frozen land in english so i don't know how the distributors got frozen out of paha. this is a very good film. it doesn't for me have enough that i would knock it up a notch to the excellent category but i did talk to some viewers who felt that it was an excellent film. louhimies said that back in finland people either loved this movie or hated it and said a lot of people in theaters walked out on it. i'm sure some objected to some of the violence, swearing, drug and alcohol abuse and sexual explicate scenes. it's a very clever story of how these different lives are woven together because of a trickle down effect. this film has very interesting and strong characters. i would rate it a 7.0 out of a possible 10 and would see it again and recommend it with caution.

this is another of those rare movies one feels grateful to be introduced to instead of the usual hollywood tripe. it really is a roller coaster ride, as we follow the effects of a a forged 500 euro note on a multitude of people. one asks 'what if' all the time but it certainly is a butterfly effect captured on film. it'll have you laughing, crying and biting your lip. i loved every minute of it! and thank you sbs australia for showing films that are truly entertaining, even worth the effort to read the subtitles. the only downside to my mind is that i wont be booking a holiday to the frozen land - they all seem to be far too depressed - must be all that cold weather. either way, watch it - it's worth every second.

for estoninans finland sometimes seems like a land of dreams. a land where many of us want to go and work there or start a business. find love, start a new life etc. but... aku louhimies has made this brilliant piece which shows that everything is not so good in finland as well. that finland can be just as paha maa (the bad land) than any other country. it shows that people there can be just as miserable in their lives than we in everywhere else. that sometimes there's nothing good. this movie nicely shows why finland is one of the top suicidal countries. it's not easy to live in north. cold climate changes us. i've become more and more attracted to finnish movies and this one is very good. the acting is great as well. jasper p√§√§kk√∂nnen has become one of the top finnish stars. beware of the sex scene (if you have little children) and a little depression that might come afterwards the movie! 8/10

before i'd seen this movie i've heard a lot of praise about it and quite many exclamations about how "horrific" it was. not to take any credit away from this movie, i think it wasn't all that horrible or even shocking. it's just a movie about people living in the darker side of the town. and a good one at portraying the point.there's some great acting here and a well-thought of manuscript. paavo westerberg is a renowned writer in the finnish movie scene and he's the best in what comes to describing the contemporary finnish culture (albeit he's not the only one writer for this movie, but i dare say he's the main-writer anyway. correct me if i'm wrong).the casting is excellent, except for jasper p√§√§kk√∂nen (the pseudo-main character, who in my opinion should have stayed in the soap opera scene), and the sets, the cuts and sounds are very well done as well and give great atmosphere to this movie.this movie is a story about loosely interconnected sad destinies that according to a famous finnish band's very well known song (eppu normaali's "tuhansien murheellisten laulujen maa", which very roughly translated to "paha maa") throughout the whole finnish society lead to a sad, dark end accompanied with booze, lonesomeness and the bad choices. and it's the side of everyday finnish life about 80% of the population have no awareness of, unless movies like this are made.

shame is rather unique as a war film (or rather quite the anti-war film) in that it not only doesn't focus on the soldiers or politics involved (there is politics but not how you'd think it'd be shown), it deals with its two main subjects as the only two beings that can possibly be cared about at all in this brutal, decaying society they inhabit. ingmar bergman, in the midst of his prime, and following two other heavily psychological films, persona and hour of the wolf, is far more interested in seeing what the effect of war has on usually civilized beings, that it brings out the worst in them, and also in a cathartic way is a reminder of what is truly crucial in living. his two key actors are frequent collaborators and friends max von sydow and liv ullman (as the rosenbergs oddly enough), who are musicians living on a farm on an island (not too dissimilar from 'wolf' when one thinks about it).they see the tanks roll by, and a couple of old friends already getting worn down, but they try not to put it too much to heart; there's a sweet scene where the couple just talk, rather frankly but with heart (all one shot, as is repeated through the film is to perhaps create a sense of being provoked)...then comes the trouble, including a fake film of propaganda made at gunpoint with the rosenbergs, the psychological turmoil in being prisoners of war, and the terror involved with a 'friend' in the military (one of gunnar bjornstrand's most subtle works with bergman). needless to say this is not one of the easier films to go through in terms of bergman's filmography, however for some it may be one of his more accessible works. his religious themes this time is kept very low key, even as the idea of keeping a sort of faith pervades the film's atmosphere. when there is war action it's shot in unconventional, quick ways (via great amigo sven nykvist).and the deconstruction of the relationship between jan and eva is corresponded successfully with the backdrop of a chaotic kind of war-ground where the lines are never too surely drawn. in a way this film, shot right at the height of the worst times in vietnam, is even more relevant for today; i couldn't help but see chilling, uncompromising coincidences between iraq and elsewhere with some of jan and eva's scenes with the fighters, or those 'in charge'. the very last scene, by the way, is one of bergman's very best, all around (acting, directing, lighting). it's not the kind of war picture (or, again, anti-war, i find little of the john wayne spirit in this svensk production) that i would recommend right off the bat to my friends all into saving private ryan- it has a little more in kinship with paths of glory, looking at the effects of the hypocrisy of war. but in reality, like any of bergman's "genre" films, it stands alone, however one that packs a wallop for the art-house crowd.

a gruelling watch, but one of bergman's finest films. interesting to compare this with the hour of the wolf, as both feature the same lead actors as artists (or an artist and his wife) who have taken sanctuary on an island. in the earlier film it's largely inner demons that lead to von sydows disintegrating personality (at least that's how i read it) whereas here it's very much circumstances beyond his control.much has been written about the unsympathetic central characters, particularly von sydow's. for me there are flashes of a good (if flawed) man early in the film, but one who copes badly with adversity. the flaws become all that is left as his humanity is gradually eroded by one horror after another.i watched a passion (ullmann and von sydow on their island again) soon after this, and was amazed to recognise many of the same locations. and then there's a dream sequence...

first of all the story is not so simple as many earlier reviewers tend to emphasize, it is actually a very complex story, unlike bergman's other movies that are more bend towards character study. in skammen we have two main characters but as we are thrown from the start in the middle of a war we have no idea who is fighting and why, everything is open for any resolution. this creates a huge tension and makes every event meaningful. as the story unfolds we are introduced to numerous characters, that are turned into symbols of humanity, both its dark and luminous sides. we have the example of the innocent bystanders who try to get by during an absurd war, the cynical doctor who makes fun of his patients and provides the only bitter humor of the whole movie, the perverse opportunists who try to make the best of an atrocious event (bjornstrand's character), the innocent dead children, the nameless figures almost turned into animals from the boat etc. all of them are somehow seen through the eyes of jan (von sydow) and eva (ulmann), their characters are more restrained then in other begrman films (en passion) and this is exactly because what is important here is the story, the way exterior events have the capacity to radically change human nature.bergman made this film two years after persona where the main conclusion expressed by the only word uttered by liv ulmann's character is ingenting, nothing. that's it: the meaning of art and the meaning of life, the latter being nothing more than a play that includes all plays. but what about war? and especially the annihilating ones of the xx'th century. in persona, the only real emotion suffered by ulmann's character is when she sees a victim of the vietnam war turned into a human torch. in skammen that idea is extended to a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war. in a nameless region of a nameless country (we only assume it's sweeden) two factions speaking the same language fight an absurd war. jan and eva are two dreamers caught in the middle but their dreams are woven in a sort of counterpoint. jan is at first an idealist, unable to react properly to the world and a subject to his wife's will. towards the end he turns into a radically different personality, capable of unmotivated murder, strong-willed, pitiless (watch carefully the suicidal on the boat..the simplicity of the act is harrowing). on the other hand eva progressively looses touch with reality and at the end she is completely suffused in her own unfulfilled dream.from a technical point of view the whole movie delivers its message in a very effective way. bergman places the viewer alongside the character, putting the camera in the car with the actors, or in an extreme close-up behind the actor. nykvist manages an extraordinary control of the camera, there are some masterful "hand-held" effects, very good in making everything seem "real". the shots when the characters are captured by the army look remarkably documentary-like. the screenplay is minimalist but the story is quite complex for that matter. actually the whole movie is paradoxical, it has an intensity in the subject that is in a sharp contrast to the coldness and lack of emotional involvement with which it is directed and filmed. nothing is melodramatic here, there is no compassion, no hope and no apparent redemption. but, as in liv ulmann's dream at the end it is all so beautiful one cannot help but being amazed at it...it was not so awful since it was so beautiful!

who ever put that review as 'of bad taste' is not all quite there... its so funny, genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square! not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the series...all is as good as morris' standards. if you think that it is 'awful', 'distasteful' or 'sick' then i can only think of one thing to say to you: "go to hell." thanks. it had to be said! i think that the way that so many people complaining was a complete joke...i would like to make a shout out to all the people that actually did that: "haven't you got anything better to do with your time? what are you trying to prove?" thanks for reading my heart-filled review on the matter...cheers

chris morris' brass eye tv series had always generated a large number of complaints, both from the audience and from the people taking part. but, nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this. the 2001 brass eye special. before the hugely overrated jerry springer opera arrived, the brass eye special held the record for the most complaints received about any tv program ever aired.the sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the brass eye special was unbelievable! many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program! the subject that the program handled turned many heads, but the message was widely misinterpreted. the message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program. this was not a show that mocked the subject of paedophilia. the show was purely about the media and it's presentation of the subject. morris, is and always will be, a media satirist. the notion that the program 'makes fun' of paedophiles and children who have been abused is completely laughable! morris never attempts to do either such thing. he merely draws our attention to the overwhelming, and very often stupid media hype surrounding the subject.using many of his established 'brass eye' characters, such as, ted maul and others, morris shows just how much the media over blow every little thing about a subject that they themselves created and built up, and the result is as funny, if not funnier, than anything morris has done previously. using his tried and tested formula, morris manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing that they are working on a serious documentary. in actuality, they are made to look like exactly what they are. retards.all in all, the brass eye special needs to be seen to be believed. and, with one opening line, morris manages to sum up the entire media situation as it stood in 2001: "welcome to paedo-gedden!"

the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic, as the whole point of the programme was to highlight the way the media treat such 'taboo' subjects, such as paedophilia. the newsdesk set, the suits, the smug presenters, the men-at-the-scene shouting about things you can see behind them, the pointless cgi graphs and stats, the whole thing was a satire, a very very funny satire. the way c-list celebrity's will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them it'll be good for their career ("there is no evidence for it, but it is scientific fact"). it may be hard to watch (with milly dowler and the cambridgeshire girls, as well as 9/11), but satire is supposed to be challenging, and we shouldn't be afraid to stand up against the blatant scaremongering and headline grabbing media, just because it's a delicate matter. how this show failed to win any tv awards for it's intelligence, observation, courage, acting and thought provocation is shameful, but, as watching it will show you, not in the least bit surprising.

ida lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy robert ryan in "beware, my lovely," a 1952 film from rko. lupino and ryan did three films together and worked well as a team, both being consummate professionals and strong performers. in this film, based on a broadway play called "the man," lupino is a world war i widow who rents out a room in her home. she's very active and well-liked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years, she's not ready to move on. the man who rents her room goes on vacation, and lupino hires robert ryan to help her with some heavy-duty cleaning in the house. he's friendly enough to start, but later terrorizes her, locking her in the house, and not allowing her to answer the phone or the door, as he grows violent and more out of touch with reality.the character played by ryan is shown in the beginning of the movie running away when he discovers a dead body in another house he's working in. it isn't clear whether or not he's the killer, since he seems surprised to see the body. he might be a split personality, as when his personality turns ugly toward lupino, he seems to have no memory of his activities when he comes out of it. he doesn't know that he has the keys to lupino's house in his pocket and doesn't know why he has tickets to a party that he bought from young children who came to the door."beware, my lovely," is a very suspenseful film, and the two leads give terrific performances. the tension builds to a very high level and ends in a way you're not expecting.

beware, my lovely came on tv on bbc2 recently during the early hours so i set the video to record it and was pleased i did.a man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he don't get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widow's house but she does not know what she is taking on here. it turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer. he starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar. he then cuts the phones line so she can't get help from the outside. a young boy who regularly does shopping for her notices something isn't quite right when he comes to drop her shopping off. eventually, the man leaves, acting as if nothing has happened.i can see why beware, my lovely was given an x certificate when released in the cinemas. some of the scenes are rather nasty for this time. i also thought the man was going to do something to the young boy too.the cast features an excellent performance from robert ryan as the psychopath, ida lupino as the widow and are joined by barbara whiting and dee pollock as the boy.this is certainly robert ryan's most chilling performance i've seen. a must see.rating: 4 stars out of 5.

a terrific b-feature. a virtual two-hander and set over the course of a day, (you can see it's stage origins and even how it must have worked as a radio play), and although only 77 minutes long, played out in sequences akin to something like real time. robert ryan is the psychopath who keeps ida lupino trapped in her own home. both are superb, especially the under-rated lupino whose initial independence and self-control soon crumble before ryan's unhinged intruder. today, of course, it would be all guts and gore but the restraint shown by director harry horner, (much better known as an art director), only adds to the suspense which at times is worthy of hitchcock.

i particularly enjoyed delly's review of this film and agree that howard is not the only "damaged" character. howard is rather ruthlessly "set-up" by the script, but there is no evidence that his previous employer is actually dead or, if she is, that he murdered her. howard doesn't know and neither do we. in terror and confusion at seeing the woman lying there, he bolts. however, he never actually harms helen gordon, no matter how enraged he is. indeed, he reacts with horror at helen's fainting spell and the fact that he is holding a pair of scissors...then he resumes his tidying up and greets the recovered helen with the almost pathetic " i'm very tired now. i think i'll go home". frankly, i don't think he's a psychopath. a sick puppy, certainly, but not a psychopath.the problem with howard is that he has no real male identity. he wanted to serve his country, but his mental condition denies him a place in the army. he is singularly rootless and isolated: no wife, no girl, no home (again, at least as far as we know). and, he does a woman's job - "floor's are my speciality". helen's niece ruthlessly strips away this pride in his thoroughness by exclaiming caustically that she would want a man with a real job. also, although he finds himself strongly attracted to helen, he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass. he is remarkably powerless - can't fight, can't work, can't make love.helen is justifiably terrified, however. she tries to connect to him but, finding that he doesn't respond normally (i.e. way outside the comfort zone provided by her rose-tinted memories of husband ned), unwittingly presses all howard's buttons by lying to him in her attempt to escape.both characters, trapped in the house, trapped by fear, neuroses, rage and memory, deserve sympathy. i know the sudden ending has disappointed some reviewers, but i felt it fitted well, as it offered a kind of release to the characters. helen is freed, i think, from the past. when howard tries on her husband's army coat, helen's disgusted reaction is highlighted. she no doubt feels that the "sacredness" of ned's possessions has been violated but, hopefully, her need to keep everything "untouched" has been lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger. perhaps she can move on.howard is also freed - from his endless cycle of anger, hurt and violence. whether he moves on to treatment or to jail is debatable, but i hope it's the former.great performances from ryan and lupino. i prefer "on dangerous ground", but this is pretty good too.

the subject is world war ii and robert ryan is a rejected soldier whom lupino hires as handyman. she is a war widow.the set is limited but the acting makes up for this. robert ryan is conflicted: one moment he seems nice, then confused about where he lives. at first lupino tries to help him. he seems troubled but nothing more dangerous. but how do we know? the suspense builds. i truly enjoy films like this, which rely on the human element for suspense. what is this man capable of?. there are some scenes with o.z. whitehead and dee pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees something is wrong. we keep thinking she will be helped, then ryan's personality turns again. he becomes like a jekyll/hyde character and eventually chases lupino with a knife.worth watching for these two superb actors. 9/10.

beware my lovely originated from a play written by mel dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women. his first and best effort was the screenplay for the spiral staircase. he also did a loretta young suspense thriller cause for alarm a couple of years earlier. the play dinelli wrote was originally entitled the man and it ran for 92 performances on broadway during the 1950 season. it was dinelli's only effort on broadway and it starred dorothy gish and richard boone. the roles that gish and boone played are taken by ida lupino and robert ryan. for whatever reason rko thought to eliminate the age difference. dinelli himself rewrote his play for the screen so i'm wondering what he thought about that. certainly the frailty issue was eliminated completely from the story.that wasn't the only thing that was eliminated. the people are all wearing period clothing from around world war i yet there's no reference at all to the time this story takes place in. i thought that strange and later on when the telephone company repairman comes to ida lupino's residence, i noticed his truck was a vintage one of the same era.the film is almost entirely set within ida lupino's home where she's hired an itinerant stranger in robert ryan as a handyman. the film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference. it turns out that ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons lupino in her home for about a day.both the leads do fine jobs even with the changes made. films like beware my lovely are the stuff that a small studio like rko did best. if this were done at mgm or paramount the glossy trappings would have overwhelmed a solid story.

we are in a small town, a homely widow (ida lupino) hires a handyman (robert ryan) to look after her house. she soon starts to regret it as ryan grows erratic by the hour, it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic, and now she is unable to escape her house.beware, my lovely is adapted from mel dinelli's {the spiral staircase} story and play called "the man". pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece, the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness. one however shouldn't be fooled into thinking this is a violent and nerve shredding picture, because it isn't. it's clear from the get go that ryan's howard wilton is a dangerously troubled man, but this is a different sort of "peril" movie. one that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist.ryan and lupino are a great combination, they had also done the excellent, and far better, on dangerous ground this same year. so with both actors clearly comfortable together, it brings out a finely tuned character story all based in the confines of one house, re: prison. ryan is particularly strong as his character flits in and out of madness, with some scenes powerful and at times inducing fear and at others garnering deep sympathy. the direction from harry horner is safe {he in truth doesn't have to do much other than let his actors run with it} and george e. diskant's cinematography contains some smart and impacting visual touches. with one involving christmas tree baubles immensely memorable. falling some where in between being average and great, beware, my lovely has enough about it to make it a recommendation to fans of borderline and easy to follow film-noir. for fans of robert ryan tho, it's something of an essential viewing, oh yes, and then some. 7/10

when i first saw this film it was about 1956 and even though i saw it again recently i have not changed my mind about it. i think it was robert ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse. having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt. (my mother and brother had to do this)when i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and i was impressed.

the movie with its single set, minimal cast, and straightforward photography (except for a couple of brief special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during tv's early years. nonetheless, the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow ida lupino as she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic handyman robert ryan before one of his mood-swings kills her. and who better to play the troubled part than that great actor ryan. he wasn't very versatile-- watching him essay comedy is almost painful. but no one was better at wounded idealism (on dangerous ground) or the psychic pain of this movie. few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and towering figure.lupino's problem is that she's locked up in her house with a man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next. the suspense comes from her various ploys to keep him happy while trying to escape. it's a nail-biter all the way. this is not one of lupino's many fine "soulful" parts that she was so good at. instead, it's a role many lesser actresses could have handled well enough. my favorite scene is with ryan and bratty teenager margaret whiting. ryan's already having difficulty with his masculinity and what others are saying about him. then when whiting walks in and finds the attractive-looking ryan scrubbing the floor, she starts getting coy, flirting with her budding sexuality. sensing trouble, ryan abruptly fends her off-- finesse is not his strong suit. insulted, whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work "women's work". that does it. up to that point he's been courteous and professional with lupino, trying to set himself on a normal path. but whiting has hit his raw nerve. now there's heck to pay as whiting bounces out the door, leaving lupino to pay the price. it's a riveting scene, expertly done.anyway, this is one of the dozen or so films produced by lupino and her husband at a time when audiences were moving away from these little black-and-whites in favor of wide-screen spectacles. too bad. what a hugely talented figure she was both behind the camera and in front. she deserves at least an honorary oscar from a movie industry to which she contributed so much.

whenever ida lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30's,40's and 50's, you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white. ida was able to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the very end of her pictures. in this film as mrs. helen gordon,"high sierra",'41 along with robert ryan,(howard wilton),"golden gloves",'40 she keeps you guessing just how the relationship is going to turn out and just how poor mrs. gordon will be able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection. if you liked ida lupino, who could play the roles as a criminal in a woman's prison and prison warden who was hated, this is the film for you to enjoy. i truly believe that ida lupino was not given the true credit she deserved for her great talents in the movie industry!!!

i can see that the ratings for this film aren't all that high for this film, so i must be in the minority for liking this film so much. well, i am right and everyone else is wrong (just kidding). i guess i like it because i am a psychology teacher and i really liked the brooding character played by ryan. while he truly is dangerous as well as very menacing, you can't exactly hate him because he is clearly mentally ill and probably suffering from some sort of brain trauma. and wow did ryan do a really good job portraying this man! you really find yourself feeling for ida lupino as he destroys her life. so with such intense acting and menace, why is the movie rated relatively low? well, probably because it isn't exactly believable,...but boy is it entertaining and creative. give it a try and don't believe the score of 6.4--it's a lot better than that!

intense domestic suspense with the mistress of the house (lupino, excellent as always) threatened by a psychotic migrant housecleaner (ryan). the 2 masters of the genre are at their heady, erotic best as they match wits, emotions, and wills in a bizarre hostage situation right out of the saturday evening post. richly hued b & w photography with an unusual amount of close-up head shots. the young girl who teases ryan is really well directed here. improbable, but satisfying suburban melodrama.

beware, my lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man, harry horner, better known for his set designs. robert ryan plays a handyman who is hired by ida lupino to do some housework for her. the problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and doesn't know it. miss lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win ryan over, to little avail. he is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure. thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well, but one of them can't do well because there is something wrong with him. he suffers periodic blackouts during which he commits acts of violence, which he later forgets. essentially the effect ryan has on lupino is that of the hunter and his prey, or in another sense a sadist. the audience finds out early on that ryan is a mad killer, but it takes lupino much longer. thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor miss lupino try everything in her power to 'win' ryan over in order to make things work, get the job done, get on with life. but getting on with things isn't in ryan's makeup, as he is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality, and as soon as there is an opening his paranoia asserts itself. as a study in mental illness the movie isn't too impressive. what it's superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness, with dangerous psychopathology in the mix, and its effect on a normal person. in this regard the film is realistic and compassionate, though relentlessly logical in that we know lupino can't 'fix' ryan, yet we want her to. the result is that, if one is willing, one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside, so to speak, its melodramatic structure.horner shows us, gradually, the layout the lupino house , a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. we become familiar with staircase, kitchen and pantry; and we come to know which windows miss lupino can use for an escape and which ones she can't.

although this film looks like a crime thriller noir, the plot is actually a bit simplistic and with very few surprise twists or turns at all - and those that do appear, are not exactly shockers.however, if you slip out of 'intense action thriller' mode and into 'mindless entertainment,' then this is really quite a fun movie, with several hilarious moments. most of these can be attributed to the witty dialogue between alan rickman and emma thompson's characters - but that said, sadie said it all in her hilarious opening greeting to friedman, and it left very little else for anything else to develop between these two characters. i didn't find these esteemed british actors version of the southern accents that bad (ok, thompson sounded like she was rolling marbles in her mouth as she tried to spoke southern, but rickman was surprisingly rather good with very few minor lapses into his customary english accent) - if you want to critique accents - lets discuss that of coco - she only spoke southern periodically!

this is one gripping movie, reminiscent of the mgm crime movies of the late 70's. excellent cast, crisp editing and good acting keeps the pace of the movie developing rapidly,. one of the better crime movies of the decade. kudos to the director & cast.

this was the first directing job by sebastian gutierrez, the writer of snakes on a plane and gothika. anyone who has read my reviews knows that i love capers, and this was a doozy. a kidnapping and a woman shot in the process. the fbi has emma thompson on the kidnapping case and the police chief (roscoe lee browne) assigns alan rickman to solve the murder, which happens to be a senator's (hal holbrook) wife. these two make an outstanding pair as they work together.the kidnappers/murderers have lovers simon baker (land of the dead) and the ultra hot carla gugino (sin city), along with a couple of partners. they kidnapped a hotshot computer mogul and they run his accountant all over town before they get the dough. things go fast from there as new twists and turns are brought in. the whole thing is brilliant and definitely a "piss in your pants because you can't go to the bathroom or you'll miss something" thrill.now, to be completely honest, i would have given this movie a 10 if there had been more of the movie the security guard was watching in the opening. i would have loved to see more of beverly hotsprings and yvette lera, but, hey, that wasn't part of the caper; just icing on the cake.thompson and rickman should definitely make more movies together. one treat:agent hawkins: so fill me in. detective friedman: that remark could be misconstrued as sexual harassment, agent hawkins. agent hawkins: let's get it out of the way then: you've never worked under a female superior before. i got to where i am by pushing paper and playing nice - i've never actually fired a gun before, i'm only in this job to prove to my father i'm not a coward. i give decent head, so i got promoted before all the worthy candidates, all of them men, all of them equally gifted at fellatio but there was a gender quota to fill. i'm also stupid and idealistic; you are hard and cynical, and usually right. i am secretly in love with you but i have a hard time showing it. did i skip anything?damn, that's great dialog! gutierrez not only directs a great movie, but he can write too!and, did i say carla gugino was hot?put this on your list.

in the dvd era, you would think you could find pretty much any piece of crap committed to celluloid and for the most part, it's true. so why, why is it so hard to find this great little flick, clearly done by people who love noir as a loving homage (buit never descending into spoof land) of that most cinematic of genres. emma thompson and alan rickman are a hoot in this and superstar-in-the-making carla gugino (karen sisco, sin city) does her now trademark red hot babe/great acting routine. this movie really has it all for fans of film. a b noir on steroids, the clever and steamy judas kiss succeeds on every count.please columbia tristar please release it on dvd soon!!!!!!

emma thompson, alan rickman,carla gugino and gil bellows are a delight in this sexy caper. this film is smart, edge of your seat entertainment for adults, and what a relief that is in these days of big concept predictable cartoons. great music and camera work add to the fun that is this new orleans-set puzzle. highly recommended. ten stars!

came across this film recently after so long hearing about it. it is an excellent not pretentious movie for people who loves film noir literature and films. not "camp" but humorous. great cast! from the magnificent carla gugino and emma thompson to german superstar til schweiger, this movie is a feast for the eyes. alan rickman is very funny as the antagonist of gang. would love to see spin off movie with this character and emma thompson solving cases and arguments between them all the time (much like tracy and hepburn, etc.)intelligent story, nice twists and scope photography (don't watch unless it is scope because compositions are very rich).sexy sexy sexy and very fun time.best use of just like heaven by the cure ever (must see to believe!)********

the efforts of a new group of young talent bolstered by alan rickman and emma thompson, 2 extremely gifted actors, makes for a thrilling and engrossing evening of entertainment. and i might add that hal holbrook shines as the senator. this movie deserves five stars. i give it a ten on your scale. and the ending is perfect. i am constantly amazed at the ability of british actors to master our american accents. i was convinced that all the actors were born in louisiana. and what finer locale for a mystery than new orleans! the big easy, also known as the crescent city, permeates every scene. as writer and director, sebastian gutierrez deserves high praise.

sure, there's stuff here that the coens and elmore leonard have done before, but so what? if you want entertaining, lusty and smart -- "judas kiss" is near perfect. prudes offended by tongue in cheek porn don't get it (talk about getting your sex and violence out of the way straight up -- keeps your investors happy. that's independent filmmaking 101). as for the brits making a bundle, i highly doubt it. this flick is clearly a labor of love and the budget probably not half of mr. tarantino's salary. maybe guys don't like it as much as women. i thought it rocked. go coco!

what's the matter with you people? john dahl? from "rounders" and "unforgettable"? too quirky? knocking emma thompson and alan rickman for having fun playing against type? and somebody liked the gingerbread man?i rented this not knowing anything about it and found it about as nifty a video find as you can get. never insulting, well thought out, funny, scary. i disagree with the naysayers, clearly. i thought the story itself was unremarkable but the great cast, which most likely means the director was paying attention, lifted it to super cool status. good sound design also (much more appreciated in surround, but i'm not bragging). and yes, i'm a girl, so maybe it has a slight female slant (the guys in the gang are pretty worthwhile). all in all, a 9 and a hearty recommend.

loved this movie!! great acting by carla gugino. interesting story about a kidnapping that goes horribly wrong (don't they all?). some surprising twists and turns in the film and the plot was easy to follow without being so convoluted as to be totally incomprehensible. it was a totally unexpected delight. more "quentin-ish" than most films try to be.

i found the movie judas kiss excellent. carla gugino's performance was extraordinaire, probably her best in her career. her facial expressions in many scenes, were unbelievably true to character, and they were exploited to its best by director gutierrez. all actors and actresses were very good in their performances. emma thompsom was, as usual, marvelous. her acting capabilities are way above what would be required for this character, so she actually enhances it in the movie.the story, although sometimes over-intricate, is kept entertaining and pointed towards the end. very, very good. a movie not to be missed. a story well weaved and brilliantly directed. quality of film, excellent.

thirty pieces of silver and a kiss for luck. this one was another totally unexpected gem. usually, i'm not even a suspense/thriller fan. this satisfying 100 minutes has more twists than a boardwalk pretzel. it has titillating erotic romance, reminiscent of "body heat" in more ways than one; it has cops and crime; political intrigue and just a dash of daytime soap. it has just the right touch of gritty violence that any professional "by-the-numbers" crime job must employ. emma thompson, (fbi aic), delivers her role with grace and humor and gets my vote for best fake southern accent by a limey. alan rickman, (local cop), who always seems to steal the show, is excellent but not overbearing. they work well as a pair. lots of plot misdirection that never gets out of control and gets coherently reconnected at film's end. and who is this awesome woman, carla gugino? i want her to bear my children. carla, if you're out there, let's do lunch

and it got it in france ! why not in the rest of the world while the studios keep churning out expensive post-grisham trash (will anyone remember him as a fine writer, and not the most betrayed-by-the-screen author this side of stephen king ?) this one has it all. okay, the situations are not always original, has minor plot holes and it has a tendency to be too clever some (brief) times for its own sake, but it actually delivers and is obviously a work of love. i'd be curious to know what the budget was. and. for once, this is not a cheap tarantino copy ! (well, film noir didn't started with tarantino, you know.) will it once again be saved by europe, like john dahl's movies were, so mr guttierez can make another one like this ? if you ever read this, mr guttierez, thank you and se

carla gugino literally melts the screen in this crime caper. her sex appeal, ample assets and sexy southern accent more than make this film rewatchable. but the film has so many "other" things to make it almost a modern classic. simon baker's performance for one thing. truly that of a great actor. til schweiger is so perfectly cast it makes me wonder why he's not a huge "crossover" star. gil bellows rounds out this motely crew and literally steals this show. other gugino's cleavage easily the best performance in the movie. emma thompson and alan rickman are so utterly brilliant...i cannot even describe it. great chemistry.the music is so powerfully eclectic that it was a character in and of itself. wonderous to behold.people may say it's tarantino influenced...i disagree. it's clearly unique and clever in it's own right. sebastian gutierrez does a wonderful job at directing this tightly woven film and underplaying a lot of scenes that left me reeling. the ending is perfectly sinister and you never see it coming. all in all a lovely film that, to me, is the very definition of what a good movie should be.

more of a near miss than a flop, mr. imperium stars ezio pinza as alex, heir apparent to and later king of a small european nation, who falls in love with a willing american actress and entertainer, fredda barlo (lana turner), but due to machinations by the sly prime minister of alex as king, nicely played by cedric hardwicke, the lovers are separated for 12 years before being reunited in palm springs where their love is rekindled. director don hartman, who also scripts, is not able to fully utilize his talent for snappy dialogue because of pinza's tentative english usage, and the requisite rewriting, coupled with less than total rapport in evidence between the two stars, results in a somewhat raggedy tone to the screenplay, exacerbated by the studio's unkind cutting of many scenes, leading to a confusing ending. the overpowering pinza dominates his scenes with turner, but both performers score with good work, while marjorie main is impressive with her patter effects as written, with debbie reynolds placed on track by louis b. mayer for singin' in the rain as a result of her sprightly performance here; only barry sullivan is heavily victimized by the flagrant cutting. prettily filmed largely in pebble beach, california, and other monterey county environs, the film is endowed with pinza's iron strong operatic basso in solamente una vez, as well as with original songs by harold arlen and dorothy fields, with douglas shearer splendidly handling the sound recording, and notice must be made of the fine set decorations by edwin willis, and the effective costume designs by walter plunkett.

ok, anatomie is not a reinvention of the horrormovie-genre, but nevertheless it is well done. good actors (potente and f√ºhrmann at first) and some nice ideas made me happy. maybe i would have been not so positive if this wasn¬¥t a german movie, but who cares. it is good to see familiar faces in a good, thrilling story, with some gore and some good jokes in it. all of you complaining about the dubbing: i didn¬¥t see a dubbed version (of course) but i believe that it is not easy for you to watch dubbed movies. we (germans) are used to watch movies like that, so it¬¥s not a big problem. but try to watch in german with subtitles. the actors are really good!

(spoilers?)i've heard some gripe about the special effects. but that should detract from the movie. the movie is a suspense film. and it's very good at that. so from that stand point, this movie rocks. franke rocks. enjoy to one's plastic hearts content. so no complaints for this movie. unless you watch the english dub, which is a total farce. it creates the illusion it's a b movie. one complaint i do have is the music video on the dvd. it doesn't say who sings it. i'd love to know. 8/10quality: 10/10 entertainment : 10/10 replayable: 5/10

i liked this film a lot. the actors were great, particularly potente, who is different in every role; f√ºrmann, who is also able to play anyone; and loos, who spices things up (she is also a talented singer - she sings the song "my truth", heard when one character cranks up the stereo in the lab).anatomie is a good horror flick, which pays attention to its characters. it is also very gory at times, and the set design is innovative. it is too bad they had to make a sequel, which is nowhere near the original.on a side note, two other things definitely worth mentioning. the dvd is not dubbed, which makes for a better experience of the film. also, make sure to keep watching after the final credits start rolling.

i saw anatomy years ago -- dubbed at a friends house i don't remember it much, and then i saw at the video store there is a second one -- not really related to the first one franka ponte makes a little cameo. and that one was okay not as good as the first one. i'm seeing the first one again tonight -- not dubbed collectors edition. i really like german movies like this one it's very interesting and people and cults like the one in the movie could exist i think, i dunno. but it's very grossly entertaining and scary. anatomy 2 is a little different and the characters are not as good as the first. but if you really thought anatomy was interesting and good you should see the second one.

to me, "anatomie" is certainly one of the better movies i have seen. i don't think "anatomie" was primarily intended to be a horror movie but a movie questioning the ethics of science. if you watch it with that in mind, it turns into a really good film. the only annoying bit was the awful voice dubbing for the english version. how can you expect any non-german person to listen to these unbearable german accents for two hours? let native english speakers do the talking or use subtitles instead!!

with "anatomy" the german film producers have tried to make something totally new. usually there just drama or comedy movies - in the horror genre is(or was) totally new at that time.the story's also new and shocking. franka potente plays her role brilliant and i bet you won't find out who's the murderer. it's possible, but difficult. a really great movie with a lot of talented actors.

this is a great german slasher, that's often quite suspenseful, and creative, with a fun story and solid performances. all the characters are cool, and benno f√ºrmann is great as the psycho killer, plus franka potente gives a fantastic performance as the main lead. it did take a little while to get going, but it was never boring, and it had some good death scenes as well, plus the music is wonderfully creepy. i was lucky enough to get the subtitled version, instead of the dubbed, and i thought all the characters were quite likable, plus it's very well made and written as well. it has some really good plot twists too, and the effects are extremely well done, plus the ending is great. the finale is especially suspenseful, and franka potente was the perfect casting choice in my opinion, plus i wish arndt schwering-sohnrey(david) didn't get killed of so soon, because he was a really cool character. there were actually a couple of moments where i felt uncomfortable but in a good way, and i must say this film deserved all it's praise, plus while it does have plot holes, it's not enough to hamper the film. this is a great german slasher, that's often quite suspenseful, and creative, with a fun story, and solid performances, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is great!. stefan ruzowitzky does a great! job here with excellent camera work, very good angles, great close ups (see the opening sex scene), doing a great job of adding creepy atmosphere, and just keeping the film at a very fast pace.there is quite a bit of blood and gore. we get cadavers cut open,plenty of very gory surgery scenes,lots of bloody stabbings,people are dissected while still being conscious, severed finger, self mutilation, gutting's, bloody slit throat, lots of wicked looking frozen corpses, plenty of blood and more.the acting is very solid!. franka potente is fantastic as the main lead, she was very likable, remained cool under pressure, was vulnerable, easy on the eyes, and we are able to care for her character, the only time she seemed to suffer, was when she had to spurt out some bad dialog here and there, but that wasn't very often, she was wonderful!. benno f√ºrmann is excellent as the psycho killer, he was simply chilling, and wonderfully ott, he really gave me the creeps, and was one effective killer!. anna loos played her role very well, as the smart slut, i dug her. sebastian blomberg was great here as caspar, he was quite likable, and had a mysterious character,his chemistry with potente was also on, and there was a great twists involving him at the end. holger speckhahn was good as the idiot phil and did his job well. traugott buhre is good as prof. grombek. arndt schwering-sohnrey was great as david, he had a really cool character, and i wish he didn't get killed of so soon. rest of the cast do fine.overall i highly recommend this great german slasher!. ***1/2 out of 5

i was going to use 'the german scream' as a summary but that was already taken lol. it sums up anatomy nicely. provided you're not alien to reading subtitles, anatomy fits in snugly with the scream/urban legend pack. it's a teen-horror set in a medical school where the students are going missing then turning up as experiment subjects in the dissection lab. cue one plucky student investigating herself and uncovering a giant conspiracy.provided you're watching the original german language film (i can't comment on the dub, having not seen the english edition) anatomy is sharply written and cleverly plotted so that the tension never really lets up. in comparison to it's american counterparts, the mystery is uncovered much faster, meaning that instead of being a slasher right up until the final reveal, anatomy evolves during it's running time from a slasher-come-body horror movie into a smart and exciting thriller. it's a gripping ride from start to finish.hats off to the actors involved as well. franka potente proves once more that she's an intelligent, smart actress who can make any role come to life. her central performance as paula is a great foundation for the movie to build from. the spooky lecturers and their teachers pets are equally good, a truly foreboding presence at all times.it's also astounding that the movie doesn't drag much. the pace is fast and punchy, very similar to the earlier urban legend, meaning that there's always something going on to keep your attention high. if there's one downside it could be that some will find anatomy too gruesome for them, but if you persevere through the first half's admittedly graphic dissection sequences, the latter half with it's exciting thriller overtones will reward you. i recommend anatomy to anyone who enjoys a good teen-horror but is a bit jaded with the american take on the matter.

i saw anatomy when it came out and recently bought it and the 2003 sequel and as i watch a lot of foreign films in various genres, you have to watch movies in their original language for sure. not only is it annoying to know the voices don't belong to the actors, but they always seem cheerful, like the whole movie is one big long toothpaste commercial or something. it makes an otherwise awesome movie seem horrible and i have had to convert a lot of my friends who used to think foreign films aren't as good as north american films - that they aren't "hollywood enough". also, they translation is never right, it's too literal, and screws up the vibe of the movie, even if it's basically saying the same thing. i watched anatomy by myself the other week in german then with subtitles with my roommate because he was on his laptop and didn't want to have to miss parts when he couldn't see the subtitles because he was typing. 30 mins in and he begged me to let him finish his work then start the movie over with subtitles. he loved it! both movies are awesome as intellectual horror films! kelly

a horror picture set ultimately to parody but still in it's play out could scare a few of those that are frailed nerved or easily disgusted when they see whats under their skin. i laughed at it though. it was easy to decipher the true killer and his acting didn't help. this only led to potente looking even better. anatomie is not much of a horror picture for those foreign of the genre but those contained should get a few unintentional laughs and an interesting peak at german horror cinema. 6/10

i found the film quite good for what i was expecting. although i weary, because i have a fear of injection needles, i sort of came to expect when they were coming. so if you're not into needles, blood, the human body, and some good medical fun, put this movie back and rent another. as the other user commented, i was also please at the german attempt at a slasher film. i'm an american who just moved to germany to stay with a family and saw this lying on the shelf. i love psychological thrillers, and i'd say this is somewhere along those lines. a character falls into places and feels misconstrued. while trying to dig her way out and find some truth to a situation, things get a little sticky and other aren't so sure she's on the right track. so throughout the film you're kept on edge about who's anatomy you might catch a glimpse of and who's rounding the next corner.

i was shocked at how good this german version of films such as scream was. surpassing all the modern american efforts at slasher films.it as what all those films don't. likable characters, genuine mystery, suspense, graphic murders and a brilliant soundtrack.this stylish horror film is one of the best of its kind to come out in years. german cinema is going from strength to strength just lately. its a shame more people wont go to see such films because they are missing out. it is easily available on dvd so even if you hate subtitles i think you should see it. it will be one of the best horror films you will see all year.

all i can say is i really miss this show!! my wife & i just got married around the time this show started up!! why did cbs take it off the air??? i think it was the best show for the whole family to enjoy!! it made me laugh!! it also made me cry. but when cbs took it off the air my wife & i thought cbs made a big mistake. you know what would be so great?? have a reunion show!! that would be so cool!!!! anybody know if it is on dvd yet?? on the last season of promised land, did cbs show the whole last season?? i think cbs took it off the air at mid-season. my wife & i will never forget it. the opening with that theme song was fantastic!!! this show only comes once in a life time! may we never forget promised land!!

yes. watch this movie if you like brave films. this is maybe the best mexican picture since midaq alley just because the excellent cast, the outrageous direction and a sublime soundtrack. many people did not like 'cronica¬Ö', they think it's very aggressive but they didn't understand that it was just a representation with hyper realism of the mexican society but so similar to all the third world families. i hope that benjamin cann and bruno bichir (who in this movie gives another example of his greatness as an actor) soon get together again with a new film. just remember how los olvidados (luis bu√±uel) was misunderstood when released, but now we consider one of the best movies of all times. please, prepare yourself and watch this film.

excuse me if i'm wrong, but "cronica para un desayuno" could be one of the most gretatest films in tne mexican movie history for a lot of reasons. we can get a lot of ingredients for a perfect mexican middle-class family breakfast: a cup of bu√±uel's surrealistic motifs with a little drop of ripstenian desolated scenarios; a pound of phallus symbols around the film and a difficult psychological complexity, more than todd solondz's happiness and the dogma movement films. there`s a lot of sordidness, black humor, repressed dreams (teodoro's dream of fly), incestual lack of control (the relation between marcos and luzma), no-sense parallel stories, a discrete violence, anachronisms anda little sign of hope (spotlighted in luzma, the husband's home return and "un poco mas" used for leit-motif). marcos (bruno bichir) is a charming character ( i think in a bukoskian way), the king-without a-crown who don't expects for anything, but broken noses. luzma (maria rojo) , the lovable wife , put out a lot of faces, but the only thing that she worried is that her sons had breakfast; she' s a loser in many ways and sensual in few moments , but you will fall in love of her. the soundtrack's drag (too much woods) feeds the lack of technical merits, intentional , of course: out-of-focus shots, overlighted close-ups (in introspective scenes), dizzy pans and sudden edition cuts. "cr√≥nica" is something difficult to digest, it get stuck in the throat and anything helps for it. it tastes bitter, like a rotten orange juice and sour like expired milk, but you want to enjoy it. so i recommend to get some melox before the show, because you won't get hungry after all.

this film has the guts to suggest that it might be best to simply accept your life as it is, and keep smiling anyway. as one who is more excited by the idea of taking charge of one's life and moving forward, i felt slapped in the face, but that's okay: i don't have to agree with a movie to love it and respect it. great acting by streep and hurt, and everyone else really, and some wonderfully quirky scenes. a serious film. and take a hanky.

i hate to say i enjoyed this movie as the subject matter does not lend itself to enjoyment. however, i was moved by the way the family relationships were portrayed and the sincerity of the performances. it was the kind of film i told all my friends and family to experience as a reminder of how important we all are to each other.

i think one true thing is one of meryl streeps finest movies to date. her depiction of a dying woman is perfect. i have recently lived this movie, and it touched me on more levels than i could have imagined. meryl is truely the greatest actress to have ever walked the earth!!!!!

a great story, although one we are certainly familiar with. meryl streep proves that she is truly the best actress in film today. very entertaining, and just what i expected. don't go see this film unless you are prepared to be used and manipulated emotionally, but if you have that expectation, then you will enjoy the ride.....

after renting one true thing the other night, i have learned to respect my family, and not take their health for granted. i have never seen such a real-life portrayal of a cancer victim on screen like meryl delivered. she deserves the oscar nomination, but she has some tough competitors in the running. all i can say is beautiful film, great acting from streep and zellwegger. meryl streep revealed her one true ability in this excellent film!

i saw this movie in september with my mother. i was expecting a good movie, and i saw an excellent one. this is now my most treasured movie. it did not leave me after i left the theater. the situations in this movie reminded me of my late grandmother. meryl streep and renee zellweger were equally incredible. this movie has made me realize how important family relationships are. rent it. i can't recommend it enough.

meryl streep may be the greatest actor working today. her chameleonic portrayals never fail to astonish; she seems actually to be the characters she brings to the screen. in "one true thing," she gives life to a deceptively straightforward, profoundly complex woman doing her best to play the hand life has dealt to her. surviving with cancer is no easy task, and not just surviving but actually continuing to live one's life is even harder--and this is precisely what kate gulden (streep) means to do. renee zellweger ("jerry maguire") not only holds her own in this exalted company but shines as streep's daughter, who learns to see in a new light her parents' lives as well as her own. streep is a powerhouse and deservedly received an oscar nomination for her work here; her "i'm only going to say this once" dialogue with zellweger will leave you devastated. zellweger, though, is the real revelation--her face conveys every emotion, every conflict as she begins to learn the many truths about her parents' strengths and weaknesses. director carl franklin ("devil in a blue dress") handles the extremely difficult story material with sureness and delicacy.

i loved this movie. to be very fair, the movie starts off very slowly, with none of the characters being terribly sympathetic. it continues in this way for a good half of the film.but, if you're patient, you'll be greatly rewarded. what the first half of the movie lacks in character development and/or sympathy is adequately compensated for in the second half. it's a bit like riding a roller coaster - a slow, uphill climb to strat off with, and then speed, twists and turns, and a few surprises.as usual, meryl streep is wonderful. she is the finest actress of our time. william hurt is good, if a bit wooden in spots. renee zellweger does a very good job, showing that her performance in jerry mcguire wasn't a fluke.

"one true thing" is a very quiet film, that opened in the fall of 1998 to glowing reviews but mild box-office. it tells the crippled story of ellen (renee zellweger), a workaholic who is forced to move back home to take care of her terminally ill mother (meryl streep), so that her aloof father (william hurt) can run his academic department. these terms are only general. the strength of "one true thing" lies in the way the actors elevate their characters above hollywood clich√© territory.streep is kate, the perfect homemaker whose ability to light up a room with her charm is evident in her opening scenes at a costume party celebrating hurt's birthday. but ellen has never been close to her mother, and since she graduated from harvard university, has a certain destain about her- ellen almost thinks her mother is a simplistic air-head. while on the other hand, she admires her father- who shares a special passion: writing. ellen writes for an aggressive new york firm, and is almost heartbroken when her latest piece is torn down by hurt, who seems to be a very lonely figure.to get to the point, as kate gets sicker, ellen's perspectives change and she grows closer to her mother and more distant to her father. hurt keeps making excuses not to be there when the family needs him most, and ellen assumes he's having an affair. meanwhile she's given up her desk at work to spend time doing craft activities with her mother's "cult" group the minnies, and also learning that her mother isn't as weak as she first assumed.without giving too much away, "one true thing" is a masterpiece in character study. streep once again turns in a beautiful performance, this time working on a subtle level that starts slow but ends with a brilliant speech on the vows of marriage. streep earned her eleventh oscar nomination for this performance. hurt is also convincing as the father who carries a secret that isn't revealed until the closing moments. but it is renee zellweger who steals this movie. forget "chicago", "cold mountain", "bridget jones's diary" or whatever else you've seen her do and rent this movie. she is remarkable in it. working within her character's bitter resentment at understanding her parents, zellweger manages a realistic portrayal of a young woman fighting to keep her lip up while she's screaming inside.

this movie started out confusing and grew into one of the best movies i have seen... the acting was utterly superb and when i wasn't drying my tears i enjoyed meryl streep, who's performance was extraordinary. the movie deals with the hardships of a distant family coping with a mother who develops terminal cancer. the movie was very difficult to watch and heartbreaking. the soundtrack fits this movie to a tee. brava bette midler!! out of 5 stars, i give this one 4 1/2.

if you are among the imdb audience that put high fidelity in the all-time top 200, then this movie probably is not for you. this film is as unhip as steve frears is self-consciously hip. renee zellweger is excellent as a hip urbane magazine writer who returns to her suburban bucks county nest in order to care for mother streep (who delivers yet another hall-of-fame performance). william hurt is ideally cast and the feckless, faithless, and egotistical husband. if this movie doesn't move you to cry and laugh, then you are much too hip to enjoy it.

i have loved one true thing since the first time i watched it in the theater, and cried my eyes out. i bought it as soon as it was available, and have lost track of how many times i've watched it.to me one true thing is the ultimate family relationship movie. i love watching the relationships in the family change and evolve into what they end up being. i can relate to many details in the movie. my mother died of bone cancer, so it really hits home with me. maybe this is why i love it so much.i like the relationships between the children and their parents, and the relationship of brother and sister, but especially love the relationship between husband and wife. to me it is truly beautiful.i highly recommend this move to anyone who enjoys this kind of movie.

one true thing proves that it's the characters which make a movie. streep will surely receive an oscar nomination for her role. a beautiful drama, one true thing is a prime example of movie-making in the late 1990's - there are still people out there who care about making and watching movies other than the big blockbusters with million dollar special effects. it's no best picture or anything... don't be silly. but the amount of emotion that was delivered by both the actors and the writer hit me like a shock-wave. i cried twice in this movie, which says a lot for a 24 year old man.

"one true thing" puts zellweger in the midst of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to care for her dying mother (streep). somber and plodding, the film studies the adult child coming to terms with the adult view of her parents as they are slowly revealed to be something less than the ideal she grew up knowing as a child. an excellent character study and a find production with little to fault, "ott" offers three fine performances by a trio of top actors and some plaintive reflections on life and death.

i don't cry easily over movies, but i have to admit, this one brought me to tears. although i am not a ms. streep fan, her performance was excellent. the title defines in a sentence what a mother's love is. for the first hour i didn't like any of the characters, but that changed as the movie went on. the movie also explained why certain marriages last even though there are obstacles. a must see film.

written by someone who has been there, you can tell, but only if you've been there. excellent performances by meryl streep (of course!), renee zellweger and william hurt.many people have said that it is about a dysfunctional family, i think every family is dysfunctional when they are facing this kind of torment. to not be dysfunctional would be dysfunctional! you are losing your family as you know it, can anything be worse? people need to see this movie so when they are faced with this nightmare maybe they will change how they do it. maybe they will see that the father is denying himself valuable time he'll never get a chance at again. maybe they will realize how hard it is to die, or to watch someone you love die. they didn't miss much of the nightmare, it's hard to forget.

the dvd jacket in which this movie came describes it as "uplifting and humorous." those are not the words i would have chosen - not by a long shot. i would choose a word like "sombre," sometimes even "depressing." which isn't to say that it's a bad movie. it's actually a pretty good movie, featuring good performances from the leads, with enough uncertainty throughout about what's going to happen at the end that you keep watching. the uncertainty comes from the structure of the movie - it seems to revolve around ellen's reminiscences of her mother's slow death from cancer, as she is interviewed by the da. so, we know from the start that something suspicious happened at the end - the questions are "what?" and "who?" renee zellweger was very good as ellen - the somewhat resentful daughter who has to give up her life and job in new york to return home to care for her sick mother. ellen evolves through the movie - moreso than any other character - as she learns to deal with both the strengths and weaknesses of her parents. her relationship with her father (william hurt) is quite interesting. my initial impression was that they were quite close, but the warts in the relationship start to show after a while. hurt was effective as the detached husband - detached not in an uncaring way, but in the sense of being unable to cope with what's happening to his wife, and seeking escape from it in various ways. finally, meryl streep as the cancer-stricken kate was very convincing in the role, seeking to live out what remains of her life in the most fulfilling way possible, then dealing with the anger she feels at her increasing debilitation. in a way, watching a family deal with this kind of crisis reminded me a little bit of "ordinary people," although this movie was far less emotionally intense. so, not "uplifting and humorous" (with all due respect to whoever wrote the synopsis on the dvd jacket) but very good in its own way. 7/10

"one true thing" is the kind of movie where the audience is inspired greatly greatly inspired performances. i am not necessarily stating that the film is uplifting, because it isn't. in fact, the movie is down right depressing. i am trying to say that it takes a lot for a movie to generate emotional tears from an attending crowd.i cried in "one true thing," enough to conclude that this is one of the most emotionally powerful movies of 1998. the characters were perfectly casted. the performances are all guaranteed oscar nominees, especially meryl streep, who portraits the dying kate extremely well. her acting alone was enough to make the movie excel to the point of recommendation, and gives you a new point of view at her. i also thought that ren√©e zellweger portrayed a realistic single, free-wheeling woman who has to take care of their own mother. the other cast members including william hurt & tom everett scott, were also superb. the script of this movie was really fantastic. it is kind of funny how the movie's concept has to do with the controversial happenings in my local area. you see, i live near lansing, michigan, and right now a big issue here is assistant suicide doctor jack kavorkian's (excuse my miss-spelling if so) ways have just been outlawed. the public will vote on this according to their beliefs in november after watching "one true thing" it really changed my perspective at this topic, although i have always believed in it. without revealing the ending of the film i will simply say that suicide is a distant theme in this movie and i think it fits in accurately with the gorgeous story. overall, this movie does indeed have more emotional impact than "titanic," "saving private ryan" or any other tearjerker released in the last few years. i think that is because the main idea of this movie is that this kind of thing happened every day, so it relates better to an audience. and indeed, that this could happening to you.

meryl streep as kate, a woman dying of cancer, performs her role admirably. no wonder she was up for an oscar. in the part she proves that caring and nurturing housewives are just as important as their sisters out in the business world. and the lesson she teaches about life's expectations and their lack of fulfillment as the relationship grows, that is the most important thing she teaches her daughter. we can expect too much of our mates. realize that there are many slips and forgiveness or understanding are the main ingredients of a happy life. this is a sombre movie and the ending though sad, shows reconciliation between the father and daughter. i give this one a ten.

i wonder sometimes if maybe meryl streep has become so accepted as the most impressive, versatile actress since, well, maybe just about the beginning of the sound era that maybe her talent is now taken for granted. there are probably about three tics that she relies on consistently throughout her performances (most noticeably a pinched lip), but other than that, her performances are amazingly variable and original and fresh expressions of internal workings. even though "sophie's choice" and "a cry in the dark" and "silkwood" may be showier, her work here and in "bridges in madison county" is remarkable, too - just more subtle. in "one true thing", she is mostly sweet and in love with her domesticated life, and streep makes what could be routine, even boring, seem attractive and charming. i think that she must work out these mini-theses for each character and find what things make this person real and interesting. she works from the inside out with each character, and maybe it's this essential quality that has evoked the main criticism of aloofness or self-consciousness. i don't think she's cold at all, but instead has thought out her character's unique qualities. i think her critics are confusing self-consciousness with intelligence. not too many other actors would be so complexly thoughtful and creative as to make kate muldrun lightweight and carefree within her beloved, homey environment, only to later reveal unprecedented depth because of her genuine attachment to that homey environment. her performances are of an unsurpassed consistency, she rarely does anything wrong. i wonder if it's conceivable for any of streep's pictures to not seem diminished because of her presence... anyway, kate loves her home, and her affection for her "family life" is as endearing as her new conflict within the home is jarring. when all of this comes together, and kate starts to recognize that she can no longer function in the same capacity, and she breaks the pie dish and screams out that she is not handicapped, it is painfully sad to watch because this has not been someone prone to emotion. streep is smart enough and generous enough to recognize how much better everything works because she has felt out the dramatic validity of kate and it's really the only scene when she allows her character to go. but how refreshingly true it is to see a character who can really surprise you by displaying something that you wouldn't have thought possible. once again, streep's character has at least three dimensions... god, this sounds like a thesis itself, but as an actress, streep just has a special kind of intelligence, incredible empathy and great expressive skills. the movie itself is probably somewhat mediocre. i suppose william hurt is meant to be an unlikeable jerk, and he does pompousness very well. i think hurt is really kind of creepy, though. script is quite standard - another tribute to streep that she was as touching and believable as she was.

kate gulden, played by one of the most nominated actresses of the last decade of this century, and also one of the most talented actresses meryl streep(out of africa). she is wonderful is every part that she plays. the yale graduate is the pride and joy of the american cinema.kate's health is deteriorating and her husband, george, role well developed by brilliant actor and also oscar winner, william hurt (smoke, kiss of the spider woman) has a hard time with the deteriorating health of his one true thing, and seeks his daughter's help. the poor daughter, ellen gulden, ren√©e zellweger (jerry maguire) has way too much expected of her. no breaks! the story takes a very realistic view on the illness of a parent. in this movie the only daughter has to put her life on hold to care for the needs of others. there is always one in every family who faces that kind of responsibility. ellen is angry the beginning of the movie, but as time passes she ends up understanding her mothers' life time dedication to her family. she even asks her mom: how do you do his, every day, in and out and nobody notices it? that is what women do, a lot of what i call invisible work. moreover we clean, we fix, we mend, we stretch, we celebrate, we are the best friends, we are confidants, the mistress, outreachers, disciplinarians, sensitive. some of us, like both women in this movie, have the perfect education, are the psychological pillar for the entire family and also do all that invisible work! that is kate ellen, and many women in our society. many of us have already gone through that stage of life when our parents age and died. i have been there. they just went too young. i have given my parents my thanks, but i never understood them as well as when i had to play their roles, and had to walk in their shoes. this movie mirrors the reality of life. perhaps it is sad, but that is how life is, at times. george a professor at harvard is complicated person, who appears to think that his work is more important than everybody else, and has a very "master/servant" mentality toward the women in his life. he is not strong enough to cope. if you want to see good acting and the reality of life do not miss this movie. favorite scenes: the restaurant coming to kate, violins and all. the making of a table out of broken china. that i so symbolic! we are all broken vessels! favorite quotes: george: "it is only by going uphill, that you realize that you are really going downhill." george "you have a harvard education but where is your heart?" 

it's not surprising that the majority of higher-rated votes were submitted by females aged 45+. this is the timeframe in women's lives when they become the caretakers of aged and ill parents. i lost my mother, from complications of cancer, in june, and went through most of the same emotions portrayed by zellweger in this film. yes, it made me cry, but the tears were real, the characters were real, and the plot development extremely accurate. kudos to the entire cast and crew for a wonderful portrayal of life and death, and the promises of tomorrow.

one true thing rises above its potentially schlocky material to give us a view of a family of complex relationships and flawed, real people. it opens with rene zeleweger discussing her mother's death with the district attorney; sparing us the cheap cinematic shots of a "shocking" illness and death. from there it proceeds into a look at a family system, in which everyone plays by a set of unexamined rules, and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. william hurt as the self-important father, and meryl streep as the suzy homemaker mother are both superb; nuanced and not what they appear to be. zeleweger is seething, angry and surprised with herself. tom everett scott doesn't have much to do, but he does it well.the story is predictable, and takes at least one badly soppy turn it needn't have taken, but the performances, and the view of family as a place where anger and love are equally mixed, make it worthwhile.

what impressed me the most about "one true thing" was how up-front it was when the daughter mentions her mother's cancer at the beginning of the movie. as depressing the subject matter was, it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blindsided with the revelation about a character's fatal illness 2/3 into the movie ("love story" "terms of endearment", etc.). meryl streep, renee zellweger and william hurt give very strong performances that don't go over the edge. the characters they play seem human; they're not perfect people. (arguably, one might not say that about the "martha stewart"-type character streep plays but throughout the film, i found her character to be noble in a non-sappy way. she's dealing with her plight the best way she knows how.) "one true thing" is an observant, unsentimental family drama in which the tears at the end were well-earned.

the reason i think this movie is fabulous is that it has so many layers of emotion. from the script and the fabulous acting you can tell that there is a history behind all of the feelings that there are. you understand why the characters take certain actions and why the do not make others. you can feel sympathy and joy and love and sorrow for them all at once. you see humanity at its best and at it's worst. you can relate to the characters because although you may have never been in their exact situations before you see qualities and downfalls in them that you see in yourself. to a certain extent this movie kind of keeps you wondering but then at the end it explains itself and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you but for the characters. i will say that i have have never ever cried so much in my life nor have gotten so much out of something. i implore you to watch this movie and take it's meaning to heart. that there is only one true thing and that is... love.

this movie was a very good universal monster movie. it once again stars lon chaney as the wolfman and glenn strange as frankenstein's monster. oh yeah, that jerk john carradine is back again as dracula. i like every actor in this movie. i especially liked onslow stevens as dr. edelmann. (it's spelled with 2 n's) i thought it was a good idea to have the goodhearted doctor himself doomed like talbot was. one scene that i think is very good is the scene when dr. edelmann is in deep thought as he changes. everything that is troubling him flashes before your eyes. the good doctor is saying no while his evil side is saying yes. that's the only reason why i didn't want the dracula character eliminated completely from this movie. i thought dracula had no business in house of frankenstein. if his character was taken out you wouldn't miss him. in this film the doctor's blood is contaminated with dracula's, giving him his jekyll and hyde curse. i hate john carradine and i don't think he should have ever played dracula. i didn't mind other actors playing the frankenstein monster after the great karloff because they all did good jobs. but when they get another actor to play dracula it stops right there. john carradine thought he was so high and mighty. they offered him the role of the frankenstein monster once and he turned it down because he thought he was too highly trained. i could just picture carradine if he did play the monster arguing with the director on the set, "i don't have to take this from you, i've done shakespeare." john carradine wasn't dracula and he never will be. sorry john, bela lugosi is the one and only dracula. thank god they got bela to come back as dracula for abbott and costello meet frankenstein. don't miss this movie. it doesn't disappoint you and you will enjoy it as you did the other. this is a very good addition to the monster movies. if you're a collector, be sure not to leave this one out.

despite all of the comparisons to house of frankenstein, this movie outshines its predecessor and is one of the funnest monster movies in the universal monsters series, and sadly, the last. o.k. so it doesn't exactly stack up to something like the bride of frankenstein as one a classic to revered by fans of all movies, but with a cast of dracula, the wolf man and frankenstein's monster (what? no mummy?) you can't help but enjoy this schlock fest! and unlike house of frankenstein, the monsters in this movie interact a lot more. but this movie also offers some unique story lines for both dracula and the wolf man who both go to dr. adleman for cures of their afflictions. while the wolf man actually does find a cure, dracula injects his blood into the doctor and that's when the real fun begins! i highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies. but remember, i never said it was good, just fun.

this movie has the look and feel of having been put together in a matter of days-kind of like plan 9 from outer space. in spite of this, it's still a classic-ranking among my favorite creature features. *****possible spoilers ahead******* count dracula and larry talbot; aka wolfman, arrive at the laboratory of dr. edelman seeking a cure for their nocturnal anti-social behavior, such as killing people. in the meantime, kindly dr. edelman discovers the body of the frankenstein monster. becoming obsessed with bringing it back to life( a common character trait among scientists, mad or otherwise), he goes against his better judgement, resulting in monster mayhem and madness. one of the final universal classics of it's time (abbot and costello meet frankenstein followed 3 years later), it rates a 10 with this reviewer. onslow steven steals the show as good doctor gone bad after being infected by the blood of dracula and becoming a half- werewolf/vampire creature, coming to a tragic end. at 1 hour 7 min. it packs quite a punch. a worthy addition to my video collection.rating: ***** out of *****

i would say to the foreign people who have seen this movie and who did not understand it that it is normal because it was based on massive plays on words. a person not knowing about the french cultural funny references in this film could not follow all the subtleties. the movie has been a huge success in france and all the actors are well renowned here.

this film is the smartest comedy i have ever seen, a lot of jokes are either a parody of another film, (from star wars to dragon ball to power rangers to kung fu etc..) or somehow related to history of whatever, (otis creates the elevator), a lot of jokes are also related to the modern world and made fun of because it was b.c. (like the wheels of the horse wagon spinning) other jokes are just plain total non-sense but also hilarious (like the famous scene, with the dog running after the roman guy with the little music) in fact in this movies they mix pretty much every kind of humor. i watched this film 6 times already and every single time i watch it i find other subtle jokes. (like the scene where waldo is part of the egyptian crowd). it is the funniest movie i have every seem, finally a laugh-out-loud comedy, that doesn't include toilet or sex humor. numerobis is also what makes the movie, everything that comes out of that guys mouth is hilarious. this movie is nearly perfect except a few clich√©d thing, like the fact that asterix gets his power back because he is kissed, that is plain stupid. but overall an excellent movie!! 9.5 out 10

even a bad julie andrews musical is worth watching and this isn't bad! in fact it's quite entertaining. actually it's a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a star's personae.to break julie's "goody two shoes mold" she plays a german spy/english musical hall actress. she subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie s.o.b. and play a drag queen in victor victoria and other not so goody girls usually under hubby blake edward's direction.the movie is admittedly problematic it is hard to feel for her character because she's a german spy. we want to love julie but she's on the wrong side of the law. probably this is why this movie flopped. julie as a german spy? our mary poppins? our maria van trapp suddenly a german spy?the romance seems to happen overnight and come from nowhere. but never mind, it's a musical and it has jullie. oh and did i mention hunky rock hudson is in it too?julie gives a glowing wonderful performance that any musical comedy buff should not miss. great ww 1 songs and nice tunes by mancini.yes the film has plot holes and at times doesn't seem logical. for example, why is julie and her uncle suddenly pursued by the germans when a minute ago she was spying for them. but on another note, who cares? the musical numbers are fun and exciting. the costumes and scenery extraordinarily lavish. the cinematography quite on the mark.it has the annoying idiot detectives that blake edwards puts in all his movies. (yawn)but it has julie- trying desperately to change her image. (you can imagine dinner with blake and julie - julie: "blake we need to change my image." blake: "i will make you a german spy, then we will take your clothes off in another movie and then play a transvestite in a another movie. they won't recognize you. it will be the death of maria von trapp"fascinating study on changing an image. wonderful julie. a must see for musical comedy buffs. much more entertaining than star!

after i read that ''at the time of its release in 2002, its budget of $47 million, or 327,000,000 frf, was said to make it the costliest french film ever. however, ast√©rix et ob√©lix contre c√©sar (1999) had a budget of $48 million, or 274,620,000 frf, which supposedly made it the most expensive french film ever'' i discovered the reason why i found this movie to be one of the most beautiful and colorful of all i have ever seen. i loved the scenarios,the clothes(specially the ones from cleopatra) and the atmosphere of the movie! it's so happy and cheerful! i found the jokes smart and hilarious and i have to consider this movie to be in my favorite comedies of all times!the cast is also excellent, with monica bellucci(who is very beautiful as cleopatra)g√©rard depardieu,(great obelix!!christian clavier, jamel debbouze(that i saw for the first time in ''am√©lie poulain'') among others!:)i recommend this movie even for people who doesn't know asterix and obelix comics. you are going to have a great amount of fun!:)aka "asterix e obelix: miss√£o cle√≥patra" - brazil

wow! the french are really getting the hang of it. if we look at their first asterix movie we see a good story with nice actors (especially thanks to gerard depardeu)but very lame special effect. in a fantasy story like asterix special effects are really important. well.. they did it right this time! it looks terrific. i personaly think mission cleopatra is the best asterix story ever written. in the movie there's not one moment you're bored. go and watch this! one thing! they didnt go exactly by the script which i think is a little bit pittyful. for example, in the comic obelix breaks the nose of the sphinx, immediatly all the little storekeepers start breaking of the nose of their miniature sphinx. (really funny to see)..well they didnt put it in the movie, instead they burried the nose under the sphinx. asterix: "they will never look for it here" (guess again). was funny but not as good as the original. another thing i disliked about the movie was their choice for music. it maked the film to childies. but never the less... it's a must c!grz da jean holland

i have to confess that i slept in the cinema while watching the first asterix movie... but this one is simply fantastic! it is really funny and it leaves the first one miles away. it has enumerous gags and funny situations that made me laugh since the first minutes of the movie and i only stopped laughing when i reached the car to return home. i repeat: this movie is spectacular... obelix is really funny and cleopatra is a real babe!!

i loved this film, the audience i was part of loved this film, and the little 7 year old girl who was with me loved this film. we all laughed at the puns, the visual humour, and the good feeling you left the cinema with when it ended. i could easily see why it was such a huge box-office success in france. i am planning on buying the dvd, so i can see it again and laugh at all the bits i missed as i was laughing so hard the first time.

i was lucky to see this sequel before the original because i'm not sure i would have gone out of my way to see it if the contrary had been true. i found "mission cl√©op√¢tre" better than it's predecessor for different reasons, but the major one is this : it was almost word for word an adaptation of one book not an amalgam like the first movie. the physical resemblance of some characters to their animated self were very funny especially the bad guy (who's name is escaping me, but he's the other architect). i don't know how this movie played in english; my first language is french so i didn't have that problem... i imagine some of the jokes weren't that easy to translate. i've learned something with years it's better to watch a movie with the subtitles than with the dubbing maybe you wont understand what is said, but you wont lose the rhythm and i think that's important too. i would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves "ast√©rix et ob√©lix".

making a movie about a comic is hard to do. making a good movie about a comic is extremely hard to do. making a good movie about asterix & obelix has been done.this movie shows that the french do know how to make an : a) funny , b) hilarious , c) beautiful , d) superb movie. the acting is no less than superb , the sunny feel to the whole movie is perfect .. a must see ! this just has to be the funniest thing to come out since we started the new millenium.. 10/10

this is definitely a "must see" film. the excellent director alain chabat (also acting as ceasar) has managed to capture the very essence of the "adventures of ast√©rix" (the french comic books it's based upon) and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy, which is also an homage to the world of animated films. this movie is so funny, so full of jokes (both visual and spoken) that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all, between your bursts of laughter. the only drawback is that a non-french audience (or at least a non-french speaking audience) might not get all the "private jokes". there are so many dialogues impossible to translate, so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the french way of life, that the fun might be lessened. however, it's still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture, the amazing stunts, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting. all actors are great, but the film would not be the same without jamel debouze, g√©rard darmon and edouard baer. and please don't ever compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books : "ast√©rix et ob√©lix contre c√©sar" and directed by claude zidi.

for those not in the know, the asterix books are a hugely successful series of comic books about a village of indomitable gauls who resist caesar's invasion thanks to a magic potion that renders them invulnerable supermen. there have been several animated features (only one of them, the twelve tasks of asterix really capturing the wit and spirit of the books despite being an original screen story) before a perfectly cast christian clavier and gerard depardieu took the lead roles in two live action adaptations that proved colossally successful throughout europe but made no impression whatsoever in the english-speaking world. the uncut french version is great fun, but sadly does not appear to be available in a version with english subtitles outside of the uk dvd. while there's still no sign of a us theatrical or dvd release, the miramax version of asterix et obelix: mission cleopatre is also on that dvd (and has played on uk tv), and you'll never guess what - it's been completely re-edited (at least 21 minutes gone) and dubbed into english. maybe harve mistook it for a hong kong movie - after all, he never saw a foreign film he didn't think couldn't be improved by heavy re-editing and shelving for a few years.whereas asterix et obelix contre cesar was lovingly dubbed into english from a particularly good translation script by terry jones but otherwise left unaltered, that sort of thing really isn't the miramax way. the results ain't good. the film was the best attempt to get the books mixture of slapstick, anachronisms and highbrow classical humorous asides to the screen, but a lot of the classical references are gone (such as the great raft of the medusa sight gag or the cyrano de bergerac references from depardieu), alongside anything that seems too french or might slow the picture down, with the result that the first 20 minutes are now a real slog. several punchlines to sequences are missing, depardieu's part has been trimmed (his part was already fairly small because of his serious health problems during the shoot: the us version has been partially digitally regraded to change the unhealthy pallor of his face in the original!), and as usual with dubbing, because literal translations into english don't fit properly, lines are either rushed so much they're not funny anymore or the dialogue has been changed completely (a couple of these changes are admittedly funny, like one character dreaming of a world in which he could move his lips in french and hear the words in english).not a total disaster, but very disappointing considering how good the full-length version is. it would be nice to think that miramax would do a shaolin soccer and release both versions, but since they've shelved both films for two years since paying $45m for them (another classic case of harvey's notorious chronic buyer's remorse: gee, wonder why disney were so p****d at their overspending) and still have no release plans, that may just be too much wishful thinking.it's a real pity that such an accessible and entertaining film will now only be available to non-french speakers in such a clumsily bowdlerised version. it seems the plucky gauls may have been able to defeat caesar's legions but are no match for the miramax jackboot.

not for everyone, but i really like it. nice ensemble cast, with nice contributions from better known players (like stockard channing) and strong eye candy (from sheila kelley). what really works is the bond between the three brothers! try it, you'll smile a little.

it's the story of three brothers pulling together in the midst of hardship and loss, and learning that the really important things in life are family, love, trust, and forgiveness. the entire cast manages to pull in a powerful performance despite a few lousy one-liners. a great film for fans of true to life problems befalling believable families. also worth a look for fans of dermot mulroney or sean astin. they both do an astounding job, often bringing you to tears. take my word for it and rent this today!

if you've never been "tromatized", this is the troma movie to see first. amazing acting, supercharged soundtrack, and bust-a-gut humor blend perfectly with troma's unique brand of storytelling and special effects. despite straying from a word for word retelling of romeo and juliet, the fact that it stays in iambic pentameter gives you the odd feeling that it's closer to shakespeare than that overdone music video with dicaprio and danes. i assumed i'd seen the ultimate shakespearian comedy when the cast of moonlighting overhauled the taming of the shrew, but nothing comes close to tromeo and juliet. i strongly recommend the dvd version, which contains a second audio track with director lloyd kaufman which is just as entertaining as the main track.

can this really be a troma movie? some scenes almost have an "a" movie look. the acting is generally competent (the two leads and the nurse-surrogate were especially good, and i liked some of the confrontations between the young capulets and ques); the scenes were smoothly edited; the plot is coherent. it's funny. it has a hip, original sound track.it does have the usual troma gross-outs and low humor, but i don't think shakespeare would have minded so much. in fact, i think he might have gotten a few good laughs out of this.it's a good dvd. there is an alternate sound track with a very informative commentary by the director, several deleted scenes, and the usual collection of troma self-deprecating silliness.i'm not going to tell you this was citizen kane, but it is some pretty inspired low-budget filmmaking.

these guys combine low-brow with low-budget. it's glorious.look- if you want bergman, rent "7th seal" or something. if you want to see gross-out humor and exploitation sex, this is the one.i think jane jensen as julia makes it all watchable. she can actually act (really well), she's a complete dreamboat, and she doesn't seem to feel above it all.

superb! even the author was laughing at the end. and what a "balcony" scene! this film has it all. wickedly funny and yet strangely faithful to the bard of avon. (but not for the faint of heart!) and... the best credits since monty python and the holy grail! i am "troma"tized!

i think it was fran√ßois truffaut who said that the best movies either involve the joy of making movies, or the agony of making movies. this flick is definitely of the first type. tromeo and juliet is a pleasure to watch from start to finish. the zany zeal fuelling this shakespearian shenanigan is infective. i don't think i've laughed so hard since i saw monty python and the holy grail. it's that good!

this was the best movie ever has seen on "germen's cine club" (buenos aires) this movie is a realistic critic of the society of the past and the next century. it cause a very good impression to all the partners of "germen's cine club". i recommend this movie to all the fans of troma and to all the people who like the good movies, not the commercial movies.

this movie is amazing. it is funny, sexy, violent and sick, but it all holds together for a brilliant troma rendition of romeo and juliet. if you don't mind being grossed out a bit (ok a lot, but it's funny grossed out), see this movie. it's worth it!there's not one level on which it doesn't deliver. i've seen it thrice now, and it is still amazing. i recommend it. go! get it!

i found it real shocking at first to see william shakespeare's love masterpiece reworked into a gory, violent and kinky sensual movie adaptation. but after you watched it once, it sort of grows on you when you watch it the second and third times, as you come over the shock and start appreciating the movie on its own merits - solid acting, good dialogue, nice sequencing and choreography, not-too-bad soundtrack and some of the (special) effects that go on. oh, and also the ending. what a riot!

this film is a brilliant retelling of shakespeare's classic love story, complete with "kinky sex, body piercing, and dismemberment". it does follow the same spirit as all the other troma movies [except combat shock...that sucker was depressing] but it's not only for troma fans. anybody who appreciates lowbrow visuals and a hilarious script will without a doubt fall in love with this movie.don't expect pretentious, artistic-wannabe crap like the version of r&j with claire danes and leo dicaprio; this one knows its a silly movie and draws its humor from that. the acting is also surprisingly good, and you can just feel sammy capulet's pain as he tries to put his brain back into his head.the soundtrack, which contains many original and high-energy bands like the wesley willis fiasco, supernova, and the meatmen is also four-star. this movie should be viewed by all, because it remains faithful to the original story while still being jam-packed with troma's trademark gore/sex humor.

what can i say about tromeo and juliet, other than if you like twisted troma machinations, then you must see this movie! this is my absolute favorite troma flick, and i have seen almost all of them! penis monsters, cecsarian births to live rats and popcorn, lesbianism, steamy sex scenes in plexiglass boxes, incest, nipple piercing, dismemberment, shameless troma plugs, and computer masturbation...how can one go wrong? it amazingly follows the original story very closely. you must see this movie!!!! oh, and speaking of shameless plugs...check out jane jensen's "comic book whore" cd on interscope records. it is awesome!

i don't think the world was ready for this film. i know i wasn't. i'd been expected a standard low-budget schlock exploitation potboiler. instead, i got the most intelligent reworking of shakespeare since peter greenaway's "prospero's books". this should become the definitive film version of romeo and juliet. it won't of course. but that's the world's loss.

this movie is a absolute masterpiece!, 'tromeo and juliet' has all the kinky sex, car crashes, mutations and a penis monster that shakespeare always wanted but never got! this is shakespeares classic retold, troma style! tromeo and juliet is about two rival familys named; the que's and the capulet's, non of the familys ever got along ever since cappy capulet (juliet's father) screwed monty que (tromeo's father) in the filmmaking business. two rival familys grow apart, until tromeo and juliet find true love together and when each side hear of this..blood shed is the least that happens!..yes! tromeo and juliet is the troma classic adored by fans world wide! witness harry balls (the penis monster) first feature film! and also has lemmy's first troma appearance...what are you waiting for?? now go out and rent the movie!! 10/10

one of the more interesting films i've seen. lord montague isblack, lord capulet is in charge of the porn industry that washanded down to him by montague, not to mention the dismemberment of fingers, the squishing of heads, etc. etc. another troma hit, this beats the toxic avenger. this is by far myfavorite troma flick... and there's a priest who fights like bruce lee. nothing can beatthat. -joefro

romeo and juliet had been interpreted in so many ways, but very few of the versions captured the essance of the play. the ony ones i can think of that really nail the romance's spirit were west side story and, beleive it or not, troma film's tromeo and juliet. at first glance, this is another mere splatterfest, and many would think it bastardizes the shakespearian classic. however, the film has an honest feel about it. updated to appeal to the sick-minded youth of today, of course, but not without merit. yes, the frequent dismemberments, body piercings, car crashes, lesbian sex scenes, masturbation and incest are in bad taste, but what's the harm when you have such a sweet love story as the foundation? as bad as most of the acting in this film is (i mean, it is troma, after all), the two leads have some genuine chemistry, more so than in big-budget monstrosities titanic and star wars episode two. there's a great deal of modernization, but much of the original text is in tact, especially when tromeo and juliet are together. there's a great scene where juliet utters the famous, "parting is such sweet sorrow," and tromeo quickly follows, in mid-nineties grunge fashion, "yeah, it totally sucks." i think it's truly unfortunate that this film isn't going to get the recognition or the wide release that it deserves. i hop that people who see this on the video store shelves won't be turned off by the grossmess in the movie, because they'd be missing out on quite a subversive expereience.

tromeo and juliet is perhaps the best shakespeare modernization i have ever seen, not that there's much competition, but anyway...all in all, tromeo and juliet is definitely one of troma's better movies, one of the little pearls hidden in a towering heap of dung. it's a funny, action-packed, gory take on the world's greatest love story, but still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as one can except from this kind of movie. well, except for the ending, where tromeo and juliet kill juliet's abusive father, and live happily together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their hideously mutated children.this is the movie high school literature classes should show instead of making poor students read through hundreds and hundreds of pages of shakespeare's scripts. thumbs up!

yes, i am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill! julie andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the "whistling in the dark" production number. the sedate-to-outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that rock hudson has been seeing a dancing/call girl is eye-popping and will certainly make you giggle.i only wish that this film could be found in video or dvd as i would surely purchase it in a heartbeat for my home library!

darling lili is fantastic! its by far one my favorite films! it certainly didn't deserve the poor reviews it received. julie andrews, playing the title role of lili smith (schmidt) is the best part of the whole movie. she is entrancing and spectacular! as julie andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far, i was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is. this movie is just...great (i'm running out of adjectives!), it's magnificent, marvellous, amazing, funny, terribly romantic, sad, and just an all-out thrill and its all thanks to dame julie andrews!and to her husband, director blake edwards. oh, yeah rock hudson was ok, too :)julie andrews is the beautiful and well-loved singer, lili smith. rock hudson portrays major larabee, who quickly falls for lili, and she with him. but their affair was not coincedental. there meeting was planned by the german government (i'm not sure if that's exactly what you'd call them, but you get the point), because the warm, happy, singing entertainer lili is actually a german spy. lili is told to seduce major larabee in order to get information of the new top secret opertaion (later know as "crepe suzette"). though lili is on a solemn mission, she falls in love with bill (major larabee), for real, making her original quest challenging. but lili pulls through and completes er task, after she finds out something that is not really true about bill. the ending will remain unsaid by me as it is wonderfully layed out. if anything, you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie, i most certainly did!!!!!!!!

i first saw this film by chance when i was visiting my uncle in arizona about 3 and 1/2 years ago. the vhs print was a little faded looking, but i was very haunted by what i had watched. did it all make sense? well, honestly, no it didn't. however, this is a film that requires more than one viewing to understand all of its aspects. the beautifully tragic score haunted me and the bizarre images made quiet an impression.well, when i found out that anchor bay had released this oddity on dvd, i picked it up immediately. i was very pleased by the transfer, though i felt the extras rather lacking. though the film concerns the "o" and sir stephen characters, it really has nothing to do with pauline reage's original novel or the 1974 film the story of o. however, the film does pay attention to artistic detail and symbolism of an almost mystic kind. "o" decides to prostitute herself for sir stephen in violent 1920s hong kong. her mission is to prove her unending devotion and love for her master through giving her body to other men. naturally, sir stephen enjoys watching her during her unpleasant sexual escapades and even finds himself a mistress. however, the tables are turned when "o" actually finds a kind of love with a young male admirer. suddenly, sir stephen feels the threat...i feel that the deep meaning behind the film (including the tragic score and artistic direction) really make this film a classic. the viewer is introduced not only to the lives and pasts of "o"'s fellow brothel mates, but the turmoil of 1920s hong kong is also explored. like the political setting, the prostitutes all find themselves in need of belonging. no one is happy in the film, even if they believe that they are. (however, "o" does find a sense of happiness with her young admirer). one prostitute tearfully remembers how her father used to act like a dog when she was drunk, naturally leading to a fetish for having her customers act like a dog. another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress. she cannot let that vision go. she treats her clients as co-stars and even swears she hears a piano in the river. as for "o", she has a flashback about her father leaving her in a chalk circle. when he leaves, she feels a sense of abandonment. of course, in that same flashback kinski suddenly becomes her father. i was very, very disturbed by this image. i truly felt for "o" at this point in the film. she hardly ever smiles and this scene really explains why. her fear of abandonment is so great that she sees sir stephen as her father and caters to his every obscene demand in hopes of proving her love. another curious aspect of the film is the young child (that ages at the end) that sells fortune in a box. it is a very random character, but somehow it just adds to the sense of loss and emptiness in the film. at one point, the director even uses painted cardboard figures to represent people. now, if that isn't symbolism for you! (laugh) all in all, i really love this film. i feel that it is a very deep and somewhat moving experience. it has erotic scenes, but the scenes aren't really meant to arouse. like the lives of the characters, the sex acts are empty. they are motions, but lack feeling and tenderness. (once again, the only tender scene is between "o" and the young man). "o" believes she is in love and that lowering herself is an honor, however, she finds in the end that she has choices. she too can be her own person and pursue her own happiness, however, she also has the option to stay in that circle that her father drew. the director leaves a lot of unanswered questions, however, some things don't need answers. the viewer will make the judgment that works for them. i must say that i wish a special edition of this dvd would be released that had director commentary. i think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion of the film and its message years later. it is a shame that the soundtrack was never released. this film has a truly haunting and heart breaking score. there is something about the lingering vocals that send a chill up my spine. i can truly feel the sense of loneliness in the film by just listening to the music.

i agree with the posters before that the characters were exceptionally strong and believable and all the actors at their top form. i especially loved david boreanaz stretching in a part so unlike anything else he played proving once again his amazing gift for comedy. the first part of the movie was light and funny, the blackmail part was a bit surrealistic but interesting - and it was all downhill from there.i found it frustrating that at least two out of the 3 girls (keira and lisa) get out of the blackmail&betrayal scot free, nary a trace left on their psyche. i know the movie amended the darker ending of the play - and i am not saying i missed the murder part. but i surely needed to see those two getting their comeuppance somehow and i was left groaning in frustration with the ending. (it's why i gave it only a 9)but definitely an interesting film.

finding the premise intriguing, and reading the reviews, and being an angel fan, i watched this movie. it's sexy and original, and quite entertaining. david boreanaz is keith. he's a hunky married man, stay at home dad, and he feels a little inadequate in his marriage. he makes the mistake of penetrating a close circle of teenage girls who are fascinated with the idea of doing it with an older man. they'll do anything to get into his bed, including beg, lie, and blackmail, but they mostly try to push his buttons. the nuttiness that ensues sends keith reeling, and pushes friendships to the edge. david boreanaz shows a little skin in this one-- and he's looking hot. yes-he plays a sleazy cheat - but he shows enough vulnerability and tenderness toward the goofy teens that you end up cheering for him in the end. one more thing, when someone moans "oh yeah, oh..oh..yeah!!", it's hard to see them as a victim of rape.

this is a great movie. i read the brief synopsis and was unimpressed but as i watched it (mainly for caroline dhavernas) it grew on me.it's such a nice change to see a movie where girls/young women are not punished for their sexuality. the girls are given full license to explore and even the chance to make mistakes without ridiculous repercussions.some of the scenes are absolutely hilarious - and many of them the supposedly erotic scenes - which were not over the top or distasteful. the male characters in the movie were brilliant - david boreanaz was great as the fickle hunk - and what is great is that the movie doesn't make us hate him all that much. the other two younger male characters were good too, without being overbearing.this is one of the best movies i've seen that has girls growing up and is quite empowering to see how the they realise their mistakes but eventually come through and carry on with their lives rather than drag their mistakes along with them.

i am really amazed how little fame this film had. i think it has to do with distribution companies and etc.don't be idiots - if you are looking for a good fun take this movie - this is very nice movie to pass few hours with and the music is great.it's about ..... well girls and boys and whats between them with not too much story but not all movies should be pulp fiction should they?? it's nice and cute and gives good time . the girls are also very good looking and this makes the whole movie even more enjoyable.why i gave it only a 9? well the story could be little more convincing from the middle and on. in some point you start to see events that are little less reliable. small spoiler: the baby is crying and the father goes in and tries to relax him. now i am not talking about some small cry but- no - hysteric cry and 30 sec after that the father goes out and "baby is sleeping"- excuse me , when and how exactly did you make him calm and sleep and be able to leave his room in 20-30 seconds. but ignore this kind of small picking because the film itself is not docudrama - it's fun and this should be overlooked.

my friends and i rented this movie simply to satisfy a friend who was very bent on renting it despite having no idea what it was about. we all thought it would be like "a canadian american pie" but when we watched it we were completely surprised, we were all silent throughout the movie and loved it! it was nothing like american pie and had a plot that teenage girls are sure to adore (seeing as the guy gets the crap beaten out of him at the end), after that night it became my favorite movie for not only it's plot but the actors and the great writing. there wasn't a moment where i thought that it was unbelievable. everything is very realistic and relate-able for anybody living in a small town with little prospects. i absolutely adore this movie and would recommend you to rent it next time you have a chance, it's worth it.

this movie starts out a little slow but kicks into comedic gear quickly. each of the three "teenage girls" offer their own believable, distinct, assertive and entertaining personalities. i particularly enjoyed the dialog and interaction between keith and lisa. if one looked beyond the superficial "action" that was taking place, keith's character treated lisa's "deflowering" with tenderness and consideration. the comic development that followed was also pulled in expertly in my opinion. david boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle. dialogue was sharp, quick and flowed nicely. the director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters got to claim the moral high ground after all the shenanigans they pulled. although the movie appears light on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas of becoming an adult, human emotions and desire.

i had the honor this evening to see a screening of the movie "these girls" at the philadelphia film festival. going into the movie, i knew very little about it and just took a chance on it because the film's plot sounded interesting. so as i entered the theater just hours ago i wondered what the final verdict would be thumbs up or thumbs down."these girls" is the story about three best friends from a small town. keira (caroline dhavernas) is the ringleader who basically doesn't know what to do with her life after high school but her father keeps pushing her to go to college which is something she doesn't want to do. lisa (holly lewis) will be going away to a christian school after the summer. and finally, glory (amanda walsh) who plans on spending her summer babysitting. but this summer is going to be a special one as they all blackmail keith clark (david boreanaz) the sexy older hunk who they baby-sit for. fun times and a lot of laughs ensue¬Ö i normally don't like movies like "these girls" but there is something about this movie that i really liked. i think the quality i liked most about it was that it seemed rather realistic. three girls who want to explore their sexuality pick a hunky guy who lets all of them have sex with him only to be blackmailed by them later. it's a pretty funny tale about growing up, friendship and sex but even though it sounds pretty cheesy i can see majority of this film happening in real life.the subject matter here is probably a main reason why this film didn't get a mainstream release in the united states. all the girls in this film are suppose to be under 18 which if i remember correctly two of them are 17 and one is 16. now in the usa even though underage sex occurs on a daily basis many production or finance companies won't finance a film like this because of the sexual content. this information was actually confirmed by the director himself john hazlett at the q&a after the film. the thing that gets me is that the sex scenes in this film aren't graphic and the nudity is minor. not to mention that all the actresses in this film are way over 18 in real life. go figure.what the movie does best is it provides a lot of laughs as well as very strong characters. i liked all the characters in this movie and each character seemed to have a "now & then" characteristic to them. the jokes were funny because they were cleverly written not because they were dirty or over the top. everything seemed to flow together nicely both the comedy and the drama. the script was very strong.the acting was very good for the most part. i thought all the three girls were great. caroline dhavernas who also starred in one of the most underrated television series of all time "wonderfalls" was just terrific; as well as holly lewis and amanda walsh who both did a fine job as well. david boreanaz did a good job and he looked like he was having fun while shooting most of the scenes. the guy played a pot head so it was funny seeing him play that role.i had the pleasure of meeting john hazlett tonight who seemed like a very nice guy and was very appreciative of the comments made about the film. i am shocked that this movie didn't go anywhere. i think with a little marketing behind it, it could have taken off. sadly it's going to be one of these direct to dvd films which so few will ever have the pleasure to see. i think with what little budget mr. hazlett had to work with, the film turned out well and i think he did a fine job directing this little gem.for someone who typically hates teen sex comedies i can honestly say i really enjoyed this film. the character development and witty script allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and be amused. this is a fine comedy because it has heart and spunk to it. i know i will be sure to buy this film when it comes on dvd on may 16, 2006. if you're a fan of coming of age stories, teen sex comedies, or romantic comedies be sure to check this film out because it's one of the funniest films of its kind to be released in years.moviemanmenzel's final rating for "these girls" is an 8/10.

i had the pleasure of watching this two chairs down from (one of?) the executive producer at the atlantic film festival, which was interesting because he laughed at very different times than the rest of us.filmed in atlantic canada, the movie is about three teen-aged girls who in one of their last summers of their youth, devote a large deal of energy to sleeping with a married 30-year old man, despite much protestation.it's definitely worth a watch, but the humour was geared a completely different demographic than the one i inhabit (male 18-25), so i was shaking my head at the character's antics rather than laughing. inspite of this, the story is strong enough to hold up for itself make it entertaining, without so much laughing.

this film is outstanding! on this date of apr, 8 2007 it was on on demand from show time. it had been a while since i seen it, but it does feature thomas jane in the first role i seen him in. at first you see a normal guy that seems kind of henpecked, with a wife that seems close to going her own way. the directors cut which i just watched has a opening scene that is cool. paulina porizkova is dressed as a cheerleader type, looking very fresh and hot. trying to buy a coffee late at night with no small bills turns violent in a hurry, paulina shows that her name on her letter jacket is the real deal. meeting up with his old road pal nick played by aaron eckhart was cool at first, and he even loans him his wife's car to take care of some business. then he spots nicks silver briefcase, and the day changes for the weird and violent. there is a cast of real characters that parade through the next series of scenes. but, paulina's dallas steals the show i think. her telling of a casey story to the doctor that is there to get a personal interview in a adoption application, is outrageous. as a rule i have never thought tall women were that sexy,but as with any rule there are exceptions. paulina is as one has never seen her before in films. sexy and lethal, like in the one movie with tom selleck, but with a never seen before malevolence. if your looking for film to add to your collection, this one is worth the price. paulina in the nude is worth the price alone, but this story has everything one might hope one has. love,friendship,sex and violence in a terrific mix. when i first seen it years ago it blew my mind, and i know you will feel the same way.

very tightly written, acted, and filmed. violent, but not too much so. whoever edited this knew exactly what he wanted to portray. there isn't a wasted scene in this movie. "the usual suspects" was superb ensemble acting; this is a collection of outstanding individual performances. i rarely buy movies, but this one is worth owning.

i watched the movie yesterday and for me it was a stunning combination of movies like pulp fiction and reservoir dogs. the best of the best. it was never any dull and always moving, every hour there's another character bothering (trying to kill) him. you never know what's next. in one word terrific !!!

truly a great film... i stumbled onto it at the video store and rented it because aaron eckhart (in the company of men and your friends and neighbors) was in it as well as paulina porizcova... the lovely former si swimsuit model does get nude in the film, but that is only one of the many reasons to rent it... it's very exciting, and the character development is fantastic... eckhart is one of the most underrated actors working, and he steals this film... it is very dark and violent, but i enjoyed in immensely....

i saw this movie yesterday. i must admit - i love it! it's like early tarantino, but better. really a must, but... don't show this movie to anyone younger than 18. it's full of blood and sex (rape scene is great :) ). now i'm just waiting for other movies of this director and a dvd release.

i don't know what the critics were viewing when this movie was released, but it slipped by them unnoticed. it is well written, witty, satirical, and thoroughly enjoyable. it's like a video game brought to life. you never know who's behind the door or what will happen next. the violence is not gratuitous nor overdone for splatter effect.one last word: for you mickey rourke fans...the mickster is back and at his coolest in the cameo performance at the end.

i saw this movie by accident while in paris. i went into the wrong theater by accident and by the time i realized it wasn't a preview or a short film, i was hooked. paulina does a phenomenal job of holding your attention with her acting. i can't say enough how impressed i was with her portrayal of this real femme fatal. the rest of the cast performs very well too. don't get me wrong, this is not the greatest film ever made but given i knew nothing about it i was left with a lasting and very positive impression.finally, not speaking french in france paid off for once! i didn't stop talking about this film for 3 weeks after seeing it.

i turned over to this film in the middle of the night and very nearly skipped right passed it. it was only because there was nothing else on that i decided to watch it. in the end, i thought it was great.an interesting storyline, good characters, a clever script and brilliant directing makes this a fine film to sit down and watch. this was, in fact, the first i'd heard of this movie, but i would have been happy to have paid money to see this at the cinema.my imdb rating : 8 out of 10

how 'thursday' managed to avoid attention remains a mystery. a potent mix of comedy and crime, this one takes chances where tarantino plays it safe with the hollywood formula. the risks don't always pay off: one character in one sequence comes off inappropriately silly and falls flat. in the lead role, thomas jane gives a wonderful and complex performance, and two brief appearances by mickey rourke hint at the high potential of this much under- and mis-used actor. here's a director one should keep one's eye on.

this movie was excellent from start-to-finish. i was riveted by the action, the black humour and the incredibly bad luck our hero encountered at every turn. thomas jane is a great actor and i hope to see him in many more movies to come. reading through other people's comments, i have to admit i never once thought about tarrantino while watching "thursday" but now that i think about it i guess there are some similarities. i guess i don't spend much time trying to relate everything to everything else. the rape scene between porizkova and thomas jane is one for the record books - sexiest scene ever.

i loved this film! fantastically original and different! a solid, intense, hard-core and suspenseful movie that has just the right touch of (dark?) humor. if you're tired of the typical, overdone, ridiculous hollywood b.s. movies, how many big explosions and awful and unrealistic shoot em up gun fights that insult your intelligence can we take, then this film is for you. fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and believable, and solid performances by all actors, not a weak character or performance in the film. skip woods' film is a breath of fresh air and i applaud his originality and efforts, his film has the feel of a cross between a quentin tarantino and a cohen brothers film (not a bad mix at all in my opinion). this movie grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go, there's nothing boring or bubble gum about this film. the only disappointment is that nobody seems to know about it, everyone i've recommended it to has thanked me and shared my opinion on it. this film is a welcomed change/alternative from the canned hollywood mainstream garbage being produced today, even with their big name actors, big explosions, special effects and huge budgets. it's a terrifically wild, intense, violent, graphic, humorous and raw (i mean that in a good way, no phony hollywood polish here) ride. thank you to everyone involved in making this film happen, you did an incredible job!

is thursday an original film? heck no, but it is a lot of fun! i just caught this buried on the movie channels one night and it was an enjoyable flick. i was expecting much but what i got was some interesting scenes (i really liked the first seen at the convenience store), some amusing stories as told by the characters and a little bit of action thrown in the mix as well. some good performances from young actors, paulina porizkova was good and i was particularly impressed with aaron eckhart (who has gone on to impress me further in ¬ëyours friends and neighbours' and ¬ëerin brokovich'). so if you want 90 minutes of easy going fun go ahead and check out ¬ëthursday'.

very violent and nicely filmed movie. paulina is a bad sexy girl who will show that men can be raped too. this movie has lots of black humor. this guy will kill anybody just to forget he used to be a gangster. there will be sometimes when you wouldn't know whether to shiver or to smile and think "am i laughing at someone who is killing people?"

i love the premise, but it's replay value is only for certain parts(the opening scene of course). some characters are a bit outrageous, but they are entertaining none the less. i think the ballping sh-t was pushing it. i know it was to show that nick and casey were living foul out in la and to show why casey quit the lifestyle, i just think that the flashback's story could have been better. also the jamaican guy rapping on the phone is clever and entertaining, but once again i think the story was told sloppy. it really seems unbelievable. i actually believe swordfish (the other movie woods has written) more than some of the parts in thursday because the government keeps sh-t a secret all the time, and has organizations set up that the public will never know about.thursday is the best quentinesque movie i've seen. i think woods is imaginative,clever and has witt; however, his work needs more maturation to even to get to the natural born killer script (not stone's movie) level. how old is he anyway?

i was referred to this movie by a friend. i had never heard of it but i thought it had christopher lampbert so i rented it, and come to find out that wasn't christopher lampbert it was thomas jane who was great it this film. i love that almost the whole movie is set in this suburban house. the characters were great everyone of them and the script was amazing i really wish skip woods would write and direct another movie. in my book thursday is the flawless tale of this guy trying to do the wife and kid thing after a shady past but then his old drug dealer buddy shows up and it becomes quite the thursday. this is one of my favorite movies and it shows some real potential in thomas jane. but this movie is very rare but i have found it in a couple of hollywood video's on vhs. so dust off the old vcr and pop in thursday because it gets pee wee's seal of approval

thursday is clearly derivative of the 'new wave' of crime films released since quentin tarantino took the genre by storm with reservoir dogs and pulp fiction in the early nineties, but it has enough ideas of it's own to ensure that it remains an interesting little film. thursday utilises a few characters mostly within a single location. it works because each character is quirky enough in their own right to be memorable, and when put together what you've got is a very amusing little thriller. there is little substance to be found within the plot, but it doesn't matter because nobody goes into this sort of film expecting a life-affirming experience. the plot follows casey; a former drug dealer who has gone straight and is now living as a successful architect in suburbia with his wife. the pair wants to adopt a child, but things turn awry when casey receives a visit from his old partner in crime, nick, who brought with him a case of heroine and a load of money stolen from the cops. thursday is going to turn out to be a very interesting day for our former criminal...the first scene sets the film up rather nicely and ensures that we know what to expect. we see a coffee order go wrong, which turns into a murder scene that the culprits promptly cover up when a cop comes in for refreshments. the scene is soaked with dark humour and witty dialogues, and that is carried on throughout the rest of the movie. thursday is a very funny film, and scenes such as the ones that see the adoption visitor turn up at an awkward time ensure that the film is difficult to dislike. it's true that the film doesn't bring anything new to the table, cinematically or plot-wise, but the fact that it's happy to wallow in its derision ensures that there's more time for the absurd situation to build around the central characters. the acting is decent enough, with the entire cast clearly having fun with this plot. thomas jane holds the film together well in the lead role, while amusing portrayals from james legros, paulina porizkova, michael jeter, glenn plummer and mickey rourke back him up nicely. this film is unlikely to impress the seasoned film fan, but if you just want an amusing little movie with a few enjoyable twists and performances; thursday is likely to suffice.

hey community! my question is about the song, the pizza man wants casey to play right after smoking that weed. not his "ragga application song" but the cozy one! thanks this page wants me to write 10 lines of text to be allowed to submit my comment. i don't know what else to ask but i'm just writing writing writing.hey community! my question is about the song, the pizza man wants casey to play right after smoking that weed. not his "ragga application song" but the cozy one! thanks this page wants me to write 10 lines of text to be allowed to submit my comment. i don't know what else to ask but i'm just writing writing writing.

we are taken to a convenience store where nick is looking at coins in his hand figuring if he can get the special, a 69 cents 20 ounce cup of coffee that comes with a free pastry. he decides to go for the larger size, which of course is more expensive plus it doesn't qualify him for the cake. he tries to argue with the indian clerk at the register, who keeps her ground. with her it's a matter of principle. well, nick gets irritated not getting his own way and proceeds to kill her. the tone of the story is set from the start. the people we are about to meet are not nice guys. there are nick, his girlfriend, dallas, and their partner billy hill. they are drug dealers. nick decides to visit casey, his friend, and former partner in crime, in houston. he wants to do one more transaction and then go to paris with the profits from selling the drugs he is bringing. what he doesn't realize is that casey has gone straight. he is an architect, married to christine, and wants to adopt a baby.casey doesn't appreciate his former friend bringing drugs into the house. he decides to get rid of the stuff by flushing them down the kitchen drain. the untimely arrival of ice, a pizza delivery man, takes casey by surprise. this man has been sent to kill him, but before that, casey brings out some weed to share with ice, who has a talent for rapping.it is at this point that dr. jarvis, the man from the adopting agency, arrives. casey's application shows a two year gap that he can't justify. jarvis begins to doubt about the prospective father. at this time, dallas makes an entrance. she is a woman that asks questions point blank, like when she demands to know whether jarvis enjoys watching porn. jarvis, who is aroused ends up leaving in a huff. dallas has decided to seduce casey at all costs. there is a surprise in store as billy hill enters the picture and he doesn't like what he sees, shooting dallas in the process. billy hill has also come to off casey, but he is overpowered.casey gets the visit of kasarov who wants to get his money from nick; in his absence, he'll take it from casey. kasarov gives a deadline and casey makes up his mind to outsmart all these low lives. he has all the parties come to his house at an appointed hour and the different factions will take care of themselves. in the end, casey has a better plan that includes taking christine for a stay in paris.never having heard about "thursday" we were drawn into it because of the talent in it. skip woods directed his own material. this seems to be a film with good intentions. at times the film remember others of the same genre, not a sin by any shape, or form, which seems to be the main objection of the negative comments left here in the imdb site. for starters, "thursday" shows a witty skip woods that has gone to write other films, notably, "swordfish". the screenplay is divided in chapters with suggestive titles, pertaining to the action. denis lenoir does wonders with the mostly interior photography. thomas jane makes an excellent contribution to the film with his casey. although hard to imagine, he has beat the odds and made something out of himself. this actor, seen recently in the television series "hung", is one of the actors we don't tire of watching. a dark haired aaron eckhart is a welcome addition to any film. he is a greasy criminal that shows no redeeming qualities, or anything close to remorse and doesn't hesitate to involve his former friend in his scheme. james legros has nothing to do. same goes for paulina porizkova, a gorgeous creature that is only a distraction, or an afterthought to add a sexy angle. we enjoyed glenn plummer, who appears as ice. he does a mean audition on the telephone. michael jeter and mickey rourke also appear.

this movie is excellent. not because it does anything special or new, but because it is consistently great in all of its parts. no part stands out as being "ground-breaking" or "stellar", but all parts are far above mediocre, and that makes, to me, an excellent movie.i own several copies of this movie, and may acquire it on collectors dvd or blu-ray, someday (holding off right now due to high blu-ray prices, and of course the face that i don't have a blu-ray player... but that's beside the point of this review).it stars off sort of ordinary, but quickly turns into a drama filled with tension, some action, strongly portrayed characters, and a well though out plot which keeps you interested until the very end.wait, no, it does not start out ordinary.it starts out sort of like what a qun. tar. movie wishes it could be. with an awesome scene where an attempt to buy coffee and a donuts goes... very, very wrong.by the end of the movie, nothing was as it seemed, and a few people are dead, and a few people are very rich. i won't tell you who... watch and enjoy! overall rating: 10/10, a**, excellent!

a vehemently cynical, sarcastic and intense film, mocking and imitating the style of pulp fiction and stylized gangster films, thursday is an entertaining, off-putting and hilarious thrill-ride. an amazingly eclectic mix of over-the-top characters and bizarrely entertaining situations, this day-in-the-life of a gunman trying to go straight proves to be a worthy addition to the series of films that attempts to mimic the genius of tarantino's dark-humored masterpiece pulp fiction.nick (aaron eckhardt) stops by casey's (thomas jane) house to catch up on old times. casey was a former gunman for drug dealers who has since reformed, become an architect, married a successful businesswoman (paula marshall), and is now contemplating adopting a child. nick, who still has ties to the gangster underworld, leaves a briefcase full of drugs at casey's house while he borrows his car to run a few errands¬Ö a.k.a. unfinished business. disgusted and angered by the introduction of drugs into his home, casey flushes them all down the kitchen sink. that's when, one at a time, nick's double-crossed accomplices, rapping rastafarian drug messengers, and crooked cops all come a-knocking for the unsuspecting casey, who is about to have one unbelievable thursday.the film opens with a hilarious sequence in a gas station in which nick is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee. after pondering which size cup to get, a fiasco breaks out with the cashier when he demands a free snackie cake and uses a $50 bill to pay. resulting in comically brilliant bloodshed, the situation goes from bad to worse when a cop intervenes and is caught in the most unusual of circumstances. this opening segment establishes the perfect mood for the rest of the film, which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters that seem self-aware of their own existence in this nonsensical gangster flick.the film is broken into segments based on various events and times during the course of one day. this effect is much like pulp fiction, which is a similarly given chapters, although thursday doesn't mess with chronological order except for the occasional flashback. also like tarantino, music magnificently introduces each scene and each character. oddly humorous creatures, such as the jamaican hit-man pizza delivery guy that raps over the phone and shares his hashish, and paulina porizkova's narcissistic dallas, who attempts to rape casey, add humor to each event regardless of how horrifying and unnerving some of the coincidences are. when mickey rourke's calmly spine-chilling crooked cop kasarov is introduced, the careful staging and intricate setup is fully assembled, and casey's sticky situation becomes even more daring and laudable.definitely a wannabe pulp fiction, with plenty of violence, witty dialogue and extremely creepy antagonists, thursday does some things right, but other attempts at homage may be going just far enough as to suggest rip-off. a flashback sequence that shows casey shooting up baddies and sporting a hairstyle that exactly matches john travolta's do in pulp fiction is easily one step too far.- mike massie, www.moviepulse.net

one good thing: this hidden treasure of a crime drama is incredibly entertaining from beginning to end. an example of low-budget film making at it's best, writer/director skip woods uses seemingly everything he could find (ex: lamborghini, super model, cow phone) and an ear for dialogue to add levels of satire to the plot and all of his camera set-ups.another good thing: this movie seems to be made for the dvd era, with several segments that comprise a larger story (similar to the work of tarantino and robert rodriguez's desperado). each "chapter" of the film features thomas jane's main character spending one day at home encountering quick and memorable performances by aaron eckhart, glen plummer, mickey rourke, michael jeter, james legros, and an unforgettable role by paulina porizkova.even another good thing: not exactly a "good" thing, but incredibly shocking and memorable... every person who sees this movie remembers one important scene. much as deliverance will always be remembered for it's awful rape of ned beatty, thursday will go down as the movie where a woman forcibly rapes an unwilling man. unforgettable.one bad thing: the title makes people think it is somehow related to (or derivative of) the "friday" series of films featuring ice cube.grade: a+

it resembles so much to movies like pulp fiction or reservoir dogs that is impossible to think that tarantino's films weren't a source of inspiration to this thursday. however for a low cost b-series movie it's not bad. the plot about gangsters is captivating and funny and it also has a bit of dark humor and sarcasm we can find in pulp fiction. the resources weren't many fore sure but the film is well produced. the acting also is good. i enjoyed the scene when the girl was sat on the sofa teasing the doctor... it was hot and funny at the same time! the soundtrack is nice too. i didn't hear too many songs but the ones i heard i liked. i score it 7/10.

the movie is a riot - hilariously funny yet graphically violent. just when you think you can't take any more it gives you more. great thiller. the cast is excellent and the plot is very convincing. the past does indeed catch up with our hero, but right(?) prevails.

when i watched this movie i had no idea what it was about, and i had never heard of it before. but i must say i was positively surprised. the first few minutes are almost the most funny of the whole movie. the store clerk from india is just too funny! anyways, the story isn¬¥t really too much to talk about, but i think it¬¥s ok. the acting on the other hand is quite good, and still the only actor i recognized was mickey rourke who wasn¬¥t really in the movie until the ending. and the ending is where the turn-off is i think, it¬¥s not bad but i don¬¥t feel like it really ends. i feel like there should have been something more. a final battle in some way. i don¬¥t know. all in all, this was a good movie and i recommend it to anyone into tarantino-type movies with loads of violence and dark, sinister humor! i rate it 7/10.

this film is hard to knock. it follows in the tradition of pulp fiction, yet succeeds further by stamping its own unique style. the cast is awesome, the script is great - and things like the odd (pulp fiction-esque) time-sequencing is done brilliantly. i particularly like how the images provided in flash back vary dramatically depending on who is telling the story at the time. when it is one of the indoctrinated criminals everything is flashy and cool, but when it is the hero's recollection everything is skanky and disgusting.this is an awesome film - and so i am extremely annoyed to find that i cant buy it anywhere!

it is a damn good movie,with some surprising twists,a good cast and a great script. only a couple of stupid bits,like the rasta hit-man scene (this guy's a professional?) but that has been commented on already. the fact i had only heard one guy at work mention it before, and did not have many opinions or reviews to go on, made it even more entertaining. this gets a higher score than maybe some people think it deserves, but i have to factor in the low budget and the good effort from the cast. it sickens me that some movies get made whose budget equals the gdp of a small country,with a hyped up release,good reviews,an oscar winning director and/or actors, and turn out to be so disappointing,with actors sleepwalking through their roles and uninspired directing,with predictable plot lines and a story with holes in it so big,sandra bullock could drive a bomb-loaded bus through it. (examples in my opinion are the terminal,castaway,matrix:revolutions) extra points are awarded for the wardrobe department choosing great clothes for the cast,especially paulina porizcova,who wears a rubber dress in one scene,and a jacket with "c*nt" on the back in large letters in another!a sex scene which shows off her tight ass and a good soundtrack are added bonuses! and please,enough with the tarantino comparisons,this did not remind me of a tarantino flick at all.... and tarantino borrows virtually every idea he has ever had from other movies! even if that is your opinion,are we saying once a certain film or book is written or directed one way,no-one can ever use the same ideas again? get real. this film has it's own style.

'thursday' is a good movie but we recognize too much from other movies in its genre and therefor it lacks originality. if you have seen 'goodfellas', 'reservoir dogs', 'pulp fiction' and a bunch of other movies that were inspired by that last one you have seen almost every part from 'thursday'. there is a scene that involves torturing that has even the same dialogue as in tarantino's 'reservoir dogs'.still, it is a good movie. because not every part is taken from the same movie the complete thing has some new ideas and some nice touches. the opening sequence to begin with, is quite impressive. we meet nick (aaron eckhart), dallas (paulina porizkova) and billy hill (james le gros). they get into a fight with a clerk in a gas station over a cup of coffee and it ends with the death of that clerk and the arrival of a cop. we've already glimpsed at a suitcase with a lot of money in it.then we meet casey (thomas jane) in houston. he is married to christine (paula marshall) but used to be working with nick. she doesn't know a thing. then nick gives him a call and says that he is coming. we learn that he has screwed his friends over and the problems are about to start.what happens exactly is not for me to reveal but we meet some other characters, all interested in the money or the drugs nick also had with him. casey has flushed those down the drain.very funny moments, a lot of blood, a very funny sub-plot involving actor michael jeter and some surprises (although if you really think about it you see them coming) this is a good movie with some very fine performances, nicely directed by skip woods.

ok,so this film is not very well known,and wasn't very well publicised.i discovered this fairly brutal gangster gone good movie by complete accident on one of skys millions of movie channels late on some boring evening,but i'm glad i did!the opening sequence to this film is fantastically comical in a very dark way.this in fact sets what i think is the general tone for the movie.i think a lot of critics and movie fans that have actually seen this film have been a bit unfair to just write it off as a lower budget gangster movie in the reservoir dogs vein.ok,so there are undeniable similarities between thursday and some other crime genre films that it has been compared to,but in all fairness,i think this film takes a much more darkly comic look at this type of film,and the end result is a engrossing,well made,funny,if not totally original film.tom jane is good in this,and deserves the recognition he will now hopefully get thanks to the the punisher.his performance as the bad guy gone good is realistic,funny and just cold enough to make you believe casey really was a bad ass before he reformed.thats another thing that makes this film stand out for me,the characters.in nicks gang you get the strangest trio of criminals ever assembled,a smooth,charismatic but very cold leader(nick),a trigger happy blood loving sexually predatory bitch of a woman(dallas)and a psychotic hill billy with brains with a penchant for torture(billy hill).throw in the most bizarre police detective ever seen on screen,beautifully over played by mickey rourke,and you've got a recipe for...well for thursday really.its at times darkly comic,sometimes brutal,sometimes unoriginal,but always engrossing and worth watching.8/10

this often maligned movie is a must for fans of blake edwards, julie andrews, henry mancini, or hollywood musicals. other writers have commented on the shifts in tone, the confusion of plot, etc., but the film has many things to recommend it. the score is one of henry mancini's best (and he has written many wonderful ones), several songs are sung to perfection by andrews, julie's performance is nuanced and she is decked out in some beautiful clothes, (she is at her absolutely loveliest here), the on-location shots are breath-taking, and there are some funny inspector clouseau-type sight gags to boot. rock hudson basically phoned in his performance, but he is passably good. a real curiosity item in that it was the last major film julie did for about 10 years and, in many ways, is a precursor to victor/victoria. it is lovely to look at and listen to. when will it be available on dvd??? when it is, i for one would like both versions--the longer and shorter, director's cut. since it was lampooned in s.o.b., they would make a great two-pack!

a wonderful movie about people. i first saw four friends when it was originally shown in theatres and i've seen it many times since. if i'm not watching it when it's on tv, i'll get together with friends and rent it. invariably, the people i've watched this movie with find it enjoyable. it deals with friends from childhood to adulthood, in the 50's and 60's. it's very funny and touching, dealing with first love (and first sex), racism, war, politics- the whole 60's shebang. it can also be quite dramatic. if you enjoy movies about people, this one is definitely worth the time.

film follows four friends from the 1950s (when they're in high school) up to 1981. they are danilo (craig wasson) a yugoslavian immigrant; georgia (jodi thelan) a "free spirit"; david (michael huddleston) who has no personality and tom (jim metzler) a big, strong, handsome, rugged guy. all three of them are in love with georgia but she only loves danilo. the film mostly focuses on those two--it chronicles their lives, love and attraction to each other over the years. it also gets into danilo trying to win the love of his tough immigrant father. i love this film but it's not without its bad points. thelan's high, squeaky voice is annoying (but you get used to it); the story jumps around very quickly; tom and david's lives are never explained (tom shows up with a vietnamese wife and kids and david has a wife we never meet until the end); some crucial scenes are badly written and there's some obvious pre-release cutting (probably to keep the film at 2 hours).but everything else is so good you can easily forget the problems. the story is compelling--you really get to know and understand the characters and always get caught up in the lives. with a few exceptions, the script (by steve tesich) is good--in fact, tesich was a yugoslavian immigrant himself and based much of the script on his own experiences. all the acting is great--especially thelan and wasson--also reed birney throws in a strong, likable performance as louie, danilo's college roommate. and lois smith is very interesting in her role. and look quick for mercedes ruehl and glenne headly!basically, it's a real great story about immigrants, coming of age, love of america and covers the 50-80s perfectly.this film was (unjustly) maligned on its release. the studio didn't know how to advertise it (it is a hard film to market) and the critics stomped on it (pauline kaels' review in "the new yorker" was particularly harsh). it barely played in theaters (i was lucky enough to catch it in 1981 in its short theatrical run) and has simply disappeared. that's a shame. this is a movie that is just ripe for reissue. i'm not betting on it--but you never know! a definite 10 all the way!

...that maybe someday people will wake up to. people who can resist the urge to separate each and everything, and who see the 60s for what they were. people who can see that it was the individuals who made those times; not the other way around.the "forrest gump" comparison is a good one. both films look at the 60s, but "four friends" is about human beings, as opposed to caricatures. ff delves deeply into the very thing that fg (quite successfully!) tries to condense and classify as nothing more than a backdrop. but while "gump" files the 60s away in an attic like old toys in a box, "four friends" picks up and embraces each toy, thus blurring the lines between what you hold dearly and what you are.if you associate romance with shoe polish, you'll hate this film.

a great look at the 60s through the eyes of four friends from their student days in 1960 to their reunion 10 years later - a yugoslavian immigrant in love with the american dream and struggling to cope with the often violent reality; a prematurely balding undertaker's son; a soldier; and the crazy hippy girl they all love. good direction and a strong cast do justice to steve tesich's brilliant script; the dialogue isn't as snappy as in "breaking away", but the themes of growing up and father-son conflict are dealt with just as well, and there are still a few wonderfully comic moments among the shocks and drama.

i had borrowed the three sarah movies from a friend, and had watched them while sick in bed during one weekend. i thoroughly enjoyed every one of them. i enjoyed how the last movie gave a glimpse of what caleb and his sister were like when they grew up. in addition, i liked the carry-through of the "billy-boy" song that first was heard during the credits of the first movie, the title "sarah, plain and tall." however, the one thing in winter's end that i didn't like was the youngest daughter. she was a very cute little girl, but she just had too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to the other kids, even compared to talkative but still good-natured caleb when he was younger.

i love sarah plain and tall:winters end. its such a good movie. it tells of the hardships of living on a farm.i live on a farm so i know what its like to have hardships.i love the setting in kansas. its such a beautiful place. my favorite country star is from kansas. i love the country in kansas its just so beautiful. i would love to live in kansas.sarah plain and tall:winters end i think is a love story. i love love stories they are so fun to watch. i like to watch them because it is nice to watch people fall in love. falling in love is not as hard as most people think. i've fallen in love once. sarah plain and tall: winters end is my favorite love story

jack palance,(john witting), was usually a bad guy in most of his films and in this film, he showed his great acting talents above and beyond my expectations. john witting unexpectedly returns to his son's farm after years and years of separation. christopher walken,(jacob), has a hard time trying to accept his father's appearance after he spent the night in the family barn. jacob's son and younger daughter greet their new grandpa and accept him just as he is, a very old man, at the end of his ropes. glenn close,(sarah witting), delves into the character of john witting and starts to bring out the truth about what happened to him during his years of absence from the family. this is a very warm and loving down to earth film about real events that happen in most families for generations to come and go.

sarah plain and tall's winters end was the best movie i have ever seen. the person in the story that i liked best had to be cassie played by emily osment. just because of her energy and how she speaks her mind. for example when anna calls from town cassie wants to answer and she says,"hello? anna guess what. grand father was lost but hes back now and he is not a good man!" i loved all of the sarah plain and tall movies for my rating i think sarah plain and tall was #3. skylark was #2. winters end was #1! if i could live in any family from the past it would have to be the witting family. i think there are so many good parts in this movie i can't name all of them. i think they picked the best and perfect actors to play all these people in the movie so if you ever want to watch a movie from the past i would highly highly highly recommend sarah plain and tall's winters end.

excellent story of lives that need repair....one of those rare films that i could watch with my 7 and 8 year old daughters... glenn close was excellent in the title role. it was also nice to see christopher walken in a more normal role.

what a joy to watch this family grow up and see the same children acting in this series eight years later. anna (lexi randall) is a beautiful young lady, working for a physician in town. she is in love with his son justin, who went away in the army and was injured in war. and the newest daughter of jacob and sarah, cassie, is an outspoken cutie, so transparently honest she often is embarrassing.on a cold winter day a stranger shows up at the farm. he is slow to reveal his identity. when they find out he is jacobs father, john witting, thought long ago dead, hard questions about the past are difficult to get answered.glenn close is magnificent as a loving mother, who wants only the best for all her family, and is constantly wrestling with the forces that tend to separate them. sarah talking to jacob said, "it's all so fragile, this life. anything can happen in the blink of an eye. i could have died in that blizzard. think of justin, and john. probably more ill than we know. time moves on. the moment passes, then it's too late. it's a shame, don't you think?"life lessons on honesty and forgiveness make this a meaningful evenings entertainment.

horses on mars is a wonderful journey taken by very small creatures. it doesn't have to work hard to hold your attention and the characters are truly memorable. most of the credit must go to eric anderson for his choice of visual style and for writing an interesting story, but credit is also deserved by anuj majumdar for the narration and the wonderful music score. these choices were obviously not an accident. if you can, see it in 35mm scope for the most impact. it is quite a beautiful film!

i have seen over 2000 studio-era sound films-- including lots of judy garland, lena horne, shirley jones, and deanna durbin's own universal features-- plus a decent amount of live and studio-recorded musical comedy and opera. and i assure you, no one tasked with singing in front of a camera and microphone, or maybe anywhere ever, has ever touched durbin's solo here...mono soundtrack and crap 1930s microphones and all. the kid from canada sings this bit from "il bacio" like she lived and wrote it herself and then happened to show up for a retrospective in italy late in her career, not like a child who learned it from her music teacher.if you skip this extra on the dvd-- or skip ahead to the garland solo-- you are just depriving yourself, since this cheap mgm teaser just happened to capture one of the greatest performances of the 20c.

having previously seen this short on vhs tape with the feature summer stock, i just rewatched every sunday on the tcm site. it marked the film debut of 15-year-old deanna durbin and of 14-year-old judy garland outside of her two older sisters. these two teens showcase their musical talents with a solo from deanna of "il bacio", then one from judy of "waltz with a swing" before the two climax with "americana". the slight plot of this 11-minute film concerns the possible unemployment of edna's (durbin's real first name which is the way she's addressed here) grandfather's conducting job at the park because of low attendance. with the two girls' help, you can probably guess what happens from there! contrasts are marked not only with garland's and durbin's musical choice but also with their height, poise, and movement. despite all that, they perform quite well at the end and it's almost surprising that m-g-m chose garland while durbin was already contracted at universal as this short was made but was briefly allowed back in since her feature debut (three smart girls) was in the early preparing stages. judy herself would make her first feature (pigskin parade) at 20th century-fox as m-g-m was deciding what movie she would next star in. that would be broadway melody of 1938 where she would perform the show stopping number, "dear mr. gable (you made me love you)". but back to this short, every sunday provides a warm and wonderful glimpse of two star singers at the beginning of their legendary careers unaware of what the future holds for them...

i suppose i like this film as well as any i know; it is not perfect, but under the title "the americanization of lily" this charming and memorable semi-musical satire might i suggest have been appreciated more, and still loved by those who recognized its special blake edwards'-produced spirit of gentleness, clever humor and solid narrative. the improbably but delightful story-line follows lili smith, a fringe-type spy for the germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; lili schmidt passing as smith is helping her uncle who is patriotic too, for germany but neither cruel nor political, merely opportunistic. lili's target is william larrabee, a charismatic u.s. squadron leader who can supply her valuable information. the plot thickens comes when lili falls in love with larrabee, has her eyes opened to the consequences of her playing spy, and sees the effects of combat on wounded men at a hospital and realizes what it might mean to his men whom she has met and likes. she gets jealous of a rival for larrabee's affections, then realizes she can no longer do what she has been doing and gives up the spy business. the logical end of the film comes when after the terrible wwi has ended, as she sings the theme song of the film, "wishing" in a darkened theater, one by one the members of larrabee's squadron appear, including her lover himself, indicating they have forgiven her and their former opponents; and even uncle kurt enthusiastically joins in the singing of "it's a long to tipperraree", to indicate all is well with the world again. this is an audacious and sometime brilliant story idea, written by director blake edwards and william peter blatty of "john goldfarb" fame; and it is a delightful narrative. larrabee's squadron, including an inebriate who keeps crashing and other lovable types populate this lively film; and the feel of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic, both in its scope and realization. credit must go to jack bear and donald brooks for their costume creations, reg allen and jack stevens for sets, fernando carrere for another beautiful production design, henry mancini for his sensitive and appropriate musical score, and to russell harlan for his shining cinematography. in the beautiful footage, the principal actors are julie andrews as lili, rock hudson as larrabee, keremy kemp outstanding as lili's uncle kurt, michael witney, lance percival as the inebriate pilot, gorgeous gloria paul as lili's stripteasing rival, and many other fine actors in smaller parts. it is hard to say enough nice things about the pace, or the cleverness of the just-this-side-of broad comedy; this element is introduced by edwards to leaven the horrors of actual warfare, to example the almost comic-opera approach with which men made war back in a more innocent-minded era of human civilization.. this comedy also helps prepare the way for lili's conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the german state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing. this is a rare "sense-of-life" film about lili's "americanization", her assertion of herself in the real world and then among others before tragedy can happen. it is haunting, i find, and beautiful in many ways. i consider it to be blake edwards'masterpiece of directing; and under the title "the americanization of lili" i believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film it is by every standard i know.

julie andrews plays a german spy who falls in love with an american pilot rock hudson, while on an assignment for germany.the songs are beautiful. the two are well-paired. julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays. a half-german, half-english girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in ww i, julie sings some endearing mancini songs. i loved the film. some will say it's a "chick-flick," but so what. it's wonderful. supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped. it may not be up to rock's performance in pillow talk, magnificent obsession, or giant.blake edwards shot the film in ireland and authentic ww i -type planes were used in the film. scenery for england and france is absolutely gorgeous.

there are several ways to misunderstand this movie and a couple of them have been shown in some of the past comments. this is a movie to be analyzed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not to be compared with the opera, the book or other carmen movies seen before. it just stands for itself and i must say that this carmen does it very well. it is a mistake to compare because that is the first step to deny movies the chance to be autonomous creative works of art. vicente aranda is a master of atmosphere and the art direction, the costumes and the photography are extremely well put together to achieve a pleasing aesthetic experience. let's take it as it is.and that brings us to the next misunderstanding. someone complains about the typical spanish clich√©s in the movie. well, historically the movie is extremely well researched and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene. it is not only an accurate portrait of the "black spain" of knife and espadrille that goya portrayed so vividly, but it's also of that part of history as seen by a foreigner fascinated with the folkloric side of that society. honestly, anyone who doesn't want to see any clich√© about spain shouldn't buy a ticket to see carmen, but in this case those clich√©s are presented before they became one and the way to see them is getting rid of our own prejudices.another important requirement to understand this movie properly is to speak the language. it is not acceptable to criticize any actor performance for not having understood his or her lines. if all the rest of the audience did, the problem most likely lies somewhere else. paz vega has an immaculate diction with her andalusian accent and all she says is understandable and credible. her argentinian partner, leonardo sbaraglia, gives also a convincing portrait of the basque officer that became a "bandolero", and her accent is very well learned.no less important is to have a minimally open approach to the material. to say that paz vega is "horrible" suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons. we already had in spain a critic in one of the most prestigious papers that used to recommend us pictures he found homosexually arousing, without mentioning it explicitly. and that was not totally fair for the rest of us, especially for the ones that hadn't detected that the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers didn't necessarily had to care for. i'm not suggesting at all that the reviewer had the same motivation, but the expectations must have been different as the ones of those among us that went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role, because that's what we got. paz vega is carmen, and an excellent one, in vicente aranda's movie.

excellent movie in many aspects. vicente aranda has succeeded in depicting the time (1830) with meticulous care. the light, the places, the feeling, are perfectly perceived from the very start of the movie. and along with it -in opposite to what happened to "mad love" (juana la loca), a rather episodic historical movie- all of this beautiful photography/ music/ clothes is wrapping a very fluid screenplay that reaches its climax in the only possible way.concerning the actors, paz vega as carmen is outstanding: liar, seductive, agressive, totally sexual, so beautiful carmen. sbaraglia is a little less convincing the audience about his instant mad love for carmen, but he succeeds in conveying the proper tragic mood to the whole movie. i recommend it to everyone: the best spanish movie of the year.

i really liked this film - not so much for the story (which was okay, but was a bit slow-moving in spots) but moreso for the incredibly beautiful scenery of greece and the greek isles! susan sarandon is utterly engaging as the carefree love interest of john cassavetes - a man "on the edge". but the scenery! oh oh oh!

an extremely gentle retelling of the shakespeare play (and much more overt about it than forbidden planet). cassavetes is always a joy to watch, and even more so with gena rowlands sharing the spotlight. his take on the prospero role is well suited for the sort of craggy all-knowing expression he brings to the story. this especially comes to the forefront in a scene when, upon spotting his estranged wife and her lover in a speedboat, he conjures up a storm (accompanied on the soundtrack by an appropriate selection from stomu yamashta's "go"). this is only one of the moments throughout the film where the line between reality and fantasy becomes nicely blurred, and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more possible than one might believe. add to this an excellent performance by raul julia, plus good work by susan sarandon, vittorio gassman and molly ringwald, and the film becomes a nice little treat to occupy the space behind your eyes.

just lovely. it is long. no climax. don't wait for anything to happen. great for a rainy day. about a man in a mid life crisis who takes his family to a secluded area of the greek isles. i saw this in my teens and still love it 20+ years later. i have been unable to find it in video stores however. molly ringwald is a cute average teenager who basically wants to go home and then kind of settles into the place. there are no phones, no tv, boredom, which when hit with quietness like that, the human condition is to be bored and then to reflect. and each character does so. susan sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually involved with john cassavetes' character, but he is unable to, well, you know. gina rowlands, is the wife that loves him but is just about to give up on their marriage. he is demanding and frustrating to everyone. there is another character in the movie, a greek who talks to molly ringwald inappropriately about sex, but things that she is curious about. but he is irritating and horny and i didn't like this character. the locale of the film is what makes this film so so good. it wouldn't work if filmed anywhere else. i recommend this film and give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.

i saw this film much like skywalker02 did, but when i could manage to see it again and with formal film training, psychology, and life has had the time to really take me by the hand and start beating me about,..i really click with the film. i remember the pay for service cable channels played this thing almost to death, much like poltergeist when it first came out, and many other popular films. i felt back then it wasn't worth the fuss and constant "airtime" (i know cable isn't really on air) given it, but i was very young and adult situation drama wouldn't have and shouldn't have worked. however, recent viewing of the film has enlightened me on the film. i think that susan surandon and molly ringwald were likely studying the script together, and i would be a bit surprised if surandon had coached ringwald during this project. ringwald's other projects, while good, do not have her exhibiting the potential depth as this role. surandon nailed hers, as raul julia did also. cassavettes and wife delivered acceptable performances, but i will admit at times first class acting turns to mediocre. a steady ebb and flow to the acting does take place during many scenes, but overall i can see why the story might call for the dynamic to become more subtle.all in all, i don't find this film to be the "take me out and drown me" kind of boredom fest as skywalker02 would have you believe. i think that perhaps with the right psychological training and a bit more hardship in one's domestic life strategically placed, coupled with some film courses perhaps this film would appear different. i would say if you are feeling a bit melancholy and yearn for a simpler life, and you have had your share of marital discord amongst dysfunctional family units, then perhaps this film might provide more insight and entertainment than you might think. i do feel it is a classic and find it much more entertaining than mainstream films that are supposed to share many of the same elements, such as terms of endearment which as far as i am concerned could be stripped of a few extraordinary performances by jack nicholson, then ceremoniously burned until nothing is left. (how could a film like that get more attention than this one. talk about boredom.)best thing, don't take my word or anyone else's, see the film and support our industry.

i just cannot believe the low scores for this movie. probable reason has to do with the low number of votes meaning few people have seen it. this is simply a fantastic movie! there are so many stories inter-wined within but it's not complicated. each character grows with the movie and we experience with them undergoing life changes. the scenery is simply amazing and the end credits are the best ever in any movie i have seen (just like a shakespeare play). yes, it's a little dated (filmed in 1982) but the issues the characters face are very current. it could have been filmed in 2002 without modifications to the story line. raul julia is amazing, best role ever in a movie - this is his signature piece. a young molly ringwald is excellent as she matures from girl to young woman. susan sarandon is perfect as a young carefree woman and john cassavetes is the force that puts this all together. do yourself a favor, find this movie, view it & enjoy it. come back to imdb and score this movie into the top 250 of all time where it really belongs.

paul mazursky's tempest - interesting,odd and strange movie about a mid-life crisis.set in nyc and a remote greek island with john cassavettes as world renowned architect who decides to drop out.he is accompanied by his daughter(molly ringwald) and a lounge singer(susan sarandon).a beautiful transfer of this 25 year old movie on the dvd- but without any extras-not even the theatrical trailer.tons of great scenery and razor-sharp dialogue make this 2 and a half hour movie an interesting trip.raul julia and gena rowlands round out a strong cast.a good drama mixed with comedy and tension and near insanity.this recent dvd release is worth renting. b+

william shakespeare probably didn't envision stephanos as a gay doctor, antonio as a faithless wife, or caliban as a goatherd with a trinitron, but the bard's had worse done to his good work over time, and might even enjoy the sumptuous pageant of life that is his "tempest" as re-configured by paul mazursky and co-writer leon capetanos.this time, prospero is philip dimitrius (john cassevetes), a manhattan-based architect tired of designing atlantic city casinos for the amiable mafioso alonso (vittorio gassman), especially after discovering alonso is carrying on an affair with philip's wife antonia (gena rowlands). along with daughter miranda (molly ringwald), philip escapes to a remote greek island with miranda and his new mistress aretha (susan sarandon), a nice catholic girl who struggles with philip's celibate lifestyle. will a sudden storm bring all right in the end?here's a thought on the career of cassevetes: how many other actors could make a film so confused into something so riveting? a darling of film critics for his earlier work, often with his real-life wife rowlands, he presents a central character who really suffers for his art here, but seems to enjoy himself and makes us enjoy him, too. it's not prospero, but something rich and strange that makes for a terrific sea change all his own."it's all here," he tells one of his faithful companions, aretha's dog nino. "beauty, magic, inspiration, and serenity." that it is. "tempest" transfers 1611 london to 1982 manhattan and finds some nice resonances in philip's displaced life. "show me the magic", he calls out to a storm-tossed city skyscape, and mazursky's version, augmented by donald mcalpine's sterling cinematography of purple seascapes and naturally sun-burnished greek landscapes, does just that.it's not a perfect movie, by any means. in fact, the big finale, which is the only part of the movie that follows shakespeare's storyline to any faithful extent, is a mess. rowland's character is hard to care much for in this film, and after meeting sarandon in all her braless glory, it's hard to understand philip's continuing concern for his wife, let alone his left-field desire to make an unhappy "sacrifice" in order to restore the natural order of things.but there's a lot to love about "tempest". in addition to cassavetes, there's ringwald's film debut as his loyal but restless daughter, here as in the play an object of desire for the primitive rustic "kalibanos" (raul julia). ringwald here is very much the same teenaged muse of privileged adolescence that would inspire john hughes, but with an emotional depth those later hughes films didn't delve into. ringwald and julia never got any oscar attention, but they both would win golden globes for their playful work here. he tries to woo her in her island isolation with his tv reruns of "gunsmoke" in greek, tempted by her 15-year-old body."i want to balonga you with my bonny johnny," kalibanos declares, getting shoved aside but winning our sympathy anyway, especially after performing "new york, new york" with a chorus of goats. (when "tempest" hit the screens, julia was the toast of broadway as the lead in "nine".)it's mazursky's show, even if it feels at times that cassavetes is running things with improvisational line readings and emotional breakdowns galore. (philip introduces himself to aretha by telling her "i'm right in the middle of a nervous breakdown".) he plays his character as an amiable obsessive, seeking to crystallize his happiness by building an theater in his otherwise uninhabited island.adding to the enjoyment is gassman's rich performance as the other man, who is as completely amiable as julia while telling a youth-obsessed philip: "boys don't have half as much fund as we have. they're nervous...and they make love in the back of an old sports car." despite being overlong and pretentious in spots, like so many art films, "tempest" is entertaining in its excesses and a trip very much like shakespeare intended, even if his dreams didn't involve smoking pot backstage at a go-gos concert.

cheers to all the wonderful fans of this film that have not only seen and appreciate it, but (based on the many literate comments) actually get it! i for one have always considered paul mazursky's "tempest" a musing on the shakespeare play of the same name, as has been noted in a few of the other reviews here. on the other hand, if you're looking for a more straightforward adaptation of the play, you should look elsewhere. as an experiment, however, it succeeds just spectacularly. charming, moving, funny, sad, dramatic ... it's all of that and much more. cast, locations, script, music are just fantastic. cassavetes and rowland were never better. susan sarandon's turn more than hinted at the great work to come from her in the future. molly ringwald makes her film debut memorable and you just have to love raul julia's performance ... he steals the show in several scenes. what's more, the always great cassavetes was confident and assured enough a performer to have let him! a study on what the thematic elements of shakespeare's classic might be life if updated into more "modern times," mazursky's "tempest" burns brilliantly!

i love this movie despite the fact it just misses being great. it's an adult entertainment, full of issues that a grown person can relate to. the acting is superb. it's fun watching john cassavetes and gena rowlands as a feuding middle-aged couple. who knows how much of it came from their own marriage? susan sarandon has never been sexier or more appealing than as her freewheeling character, aretha. raul julia is a hoot as a lusty goatherd. the scenery in greece is spectacular; the new york settings cause me to squirm due to many shots of the world trade center. fantastic score by stomu yamashta. with so many things going for it, why isn't this a great film? it's a bit rambling and overly long, unfocused, and uncomfortably imbalanced between humor and drama. still, it's engaging, entertaining, and deeply thoughtful.

what will be prospero in the twentieth century, what is his life? why a man would need to choose to live on an island with his daughter and girl friend? because it is too hard to live and love in good conditions in "civilisation". this man (john cassavetes) is a broken hearted giant, he can command the storm. he's got the power, the strengh but he is human. deep love of life is the subject of this extraordenary movie. the acting is incredible, all the genius of john cassavetes, gena rowlands, vittorio gasman and shakespeare and paul mazursky of course. don't miss it it'll be a mistake this film is one of the most beautiful i've ever seen.and i've seen a lot of movies.

i've often heard people express disappointment that mazursky's "tempest" has little to do with shakespeare's original. in my opinion, that is both true and false, but most of all, it's a bad starting point for offering critique. a work of art should never be criticised for what it isn't, but for what it is. the movie "tempest" is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play, but to my mind, it is faithful to shakespeare's work in spirit. what "tempest" is, then, is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time. no, not experimental as in hand- held camera and mumbled dialogue, but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story without undue regard for box office earnings. mazursky's tempest is epic, sad, realistic, joyous, full of life, but most of all, it is imaginative. cassavetes portrayal of philip/prospero is in itself worth a 10/10 rating, and when you add gena rowlands, susan sarandon, a wonderfully deep molly ringwald, raul julia, the dialogue, the music and the exquisitely suggestive little tableaux scattered throughout the picture... i rest my case. one of the best movies of the 80's. don't miss it.

i love this movie and all aspects of it, well directed as a comedy and as a drama. the acting is tremendous, performed by an all-star cast who play the high society new york perfectly. the scenery is incredible, totally breathtaking. i also love the story: a successful nyc architect who is going through a midlife crisis leaves his cheating wife and runs off to a greek island to hide out with his daughter who chooses to go with him.i just cannot express my love affair enough regarding this movie. "show me the magic".

i can't say what knowing the source for this movie adds, but this is one of my favorite films from paul mazursky (director and co-author). this is a retake on the shakespeare "comedy", but utterly removed from the stage. without much text, mazursky and star cassavettes make visual a mid-life crisis of passion and purpose. desperate to re-center himself, cassavettes retreats to a remote greek island--where the locals and the island itself weave a little magic. with raul julia especially, susan sarandon and molly ringwald, this is an adult fantasy that is emotionally satisfying and visually gorgeous. and funny. it wasn't a big box office hit, but whenever it does come to dvd, it will sell.

robert mckimson's 'acrobatty bunny' is one of the director's finest shorts. although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of mckimson's dreadful 'big top bunny', 'acrobatty bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty. pitting bugs bunny against a ferocious lion, 'acrobatty bunny' is fresh and funny from the outset, not to mention extremely attractive to look at. there's a classic scene in which bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion. in a brilliant disney parody, he hollers "pinocchio" down the lion's throat! this brilliant opening is a sign of things to come. there are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lion's cage to begin with, followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of 'laugh clown laugh' which, as a child, i used to impersonate regularly! all this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name. i've never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but 'acrobatty bunny' breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst mckimson's best.

here you see mr. eastwood in all of his glory (i.e., at the top of his form as an actor and at the height of his physical appeal), but the "ladies" depicted are hardly typical of the south, then or now. the young girls at the boarding school are incredibly naive, some showing signs of developing into really depraved women, and geraldine page, full-blown in her corruption, hardly represents the mean when it comes to head mistresses of girls schools, either then or now. (that is not to say that there isn't the occasional bad apple in any barrel.) mr. eastwood has said this is one of his own two favorite films."the beguiled" does have an original plot, a lot of attractive characters and many surprises in store for the viewer. it's thoroughly engrossing and entertaining but not really realistic. (i know, having grown up in the south and attended a girls' school and college. moreover, i have been acquainted with innumerable girls who did the same, not to mention their laid-back teachers, or you might even say "repressed professors" who were a far cry from the headmistress depicted here.) she is downright comical in her depiction of a southern gentle woman who is not quite what she seems.this movie was a little outrageous when it first appeared and still is, i think, but you won't be sorry you spent your time watching it.

another well done moral ambiguity pieces where the anti-hero makes it hard to decide who to root for.if nothing else "the beguiled" silenced anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in movies-at least in 1971. there were four excellent parts for actresses in this film and all were well cast and well executed.pamelyn ferdin did a fine job as amy and would go on to play "wanda june". this must have been the first time an adult male box office star shared an extended kiss with a twelve-year-old girl on camera, wonder if there was much controversy about this at the time. it was probably polanski's favorite scene. given the fate of amy's turtle "randolph", it is no surprise that ferdin grew up to be a hardcore animal rights activist.geraldine page was likewise excellent, playing a complex character with just the right amount of restraint. it is interesting that she died just three days after elizabeth hartman committed suicide (throwing herself through a fifth floor window) as they had also worked together in "you're a big boy now".hartman (who looks like she could be blair brown's sister) was wonderful as edwina and should have gotten an oscar (no other performance was even close that year), but given what we now know about her you wonder just how much of her performance was a studied effort and how much just came from inside her. edwina shows such raw pain it is difficult to watch. like marilyn monroe's incredible performance in "the misfits", the viewer is probably seeing a whole lot of her own demons in the character she is playing.finally there is jo ann harris who is stunningly perfect as the flirty carol. for my money harris was the sexiest actress of the 1970's, combining sensuality with intelligence and humor. she was the best reason to watch the "most wanted" television series and the only reason to watch "wild wild west revisited". hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star.

this is a wonderful film taking place during the romantic period of the civil war. this film is a must see for eastwood fans and eastwood claims this is one of his most favorite films that he did. i couldn't agree more. watch out! this is a spoiler- eastwood does die in the end. eastwood and director don siegel rightfully argued that the ending should be unexpected and should be unhappy for a few reasons. they wanted to stick to the book, for one. secondly, there can't always be a happy ending. thirdly, this was written during the vietnam war- they wanted a negative statement to this terrible struggle of war where people were needlessly dying. i agree with all of this. it is a wonderfully shot film and i love most films involving the civil war. it is more of a portrait of how deceptive women can be- that they can be more dangerous than men, hence the title has much to do with the statement of the film beguiled- to be deceived. the song sung by eastwood at the beginning and the end of the film is another statement against not just the civil war but the vietnam war and maybe indirectly the women he comes across during the film. wonderful story of love and deception and many memorable scenes- note: this film is rated r for no reason. there is hardly any language, it is probably some of the subject matter involving sex- but there is no nudity really. excellent film- 9/10.

the beguiled is one of those under-seen films in the careers of a director &/or actor that ends up playing better than expected. in the same year that clint eastwood and don siegel collaborated on dirty harry they also worked together on this little psycho-sexual drama set in civil war era confederacy country. it's almost a 180 from what 'harry' had for audiences. here is a film that is under the radar, and with a low-budget to almost no business when compared with what dirty harry pulled in. it is also a story where eastwood is not surrounded in a world full of dangerous men but women who, despite their first appearances, have darker sides to them. and there's even romance in it in between some of the rougher and more complex scenes. but in this kind of framework to make the film, siegel therefore actually has a little more freedom to do things with the style of the picture that roams into something more european; i'm reminded here and there of polanski's work in the 60's. it all works though pretty well even with the initial doubt that these two figures of masculine film-making (eastwood the obvious and siegel having made his niche in b-noir and low-budget thrillers) can pull off material that could possibly be made for a lifetime movie.it was also captivating and really darkly comic here and there to see eastwood's performance working off of these girls. he's doing something a little subversive in his performance by still having the sort of eastwood machismo- if there is such a thing close to his clich√©d movie image- by being a step ahead of this little school for young women at times and not at others. to see eastwood in a performance like this, as with play misty for me (the other eastwood work of 1971), shows how cool he can act believably with very good actresses. particularly here are the four main female characters, each of varying ages and each with varying attractions to their 'yankee' man. while siegel's work directing all of the actors has its moments in the first half it's really once the story crosses the half-way mark in the dream sequence (less successful than the director could be capable of) that the real juicy scenes start to pick up. a lot of this is the best that siegel directed dramatically, pushing the psychological and emotional edges of scenes where not expected.it's a difficult film, all of this praise aside, as it doesn't paint anyone as being too respectable- only the character of hallie the slave on duty played by mae mercer is sort of separated from what transpires between the all-too-curious women and mcburney. along with this, eastood here is acting in a role that is and isn't what he's usually seen as during this time of his true formative years in the movies. he's an anti-hero here, which was his trademark of the westerns and other thrillers he was doing at the time. but unlike those films he's not really in a mode where he's 'larger than life', to put it in a way, as he is both deserter and womanizer, deceiver and tricky even in his most charming and affable moments. if it's not one of his best acting jobs, which is hard to really put together considering his catalog, it is one that is worth a look for fans who might want to see another side of him. it's a credit to him, but also to what clicked with his collaborations with siegel, as they both took chances at this time in hollywood.

the beguiled is a pretty satisfying film for those who are after the things above. for clint eastwood's die-hard fans, it will be a disappointment. although eastwood does his best here in his so atypical role (except for the fact that his character is a charming womanizer, which he isn't so unacquainted with), the ambiguous nature of his character, which goes from being a sort of fallen hero to a manipulative and insatiable woman eater (to put it that way) will eventually be too much to handle for anyone used to see him play heroes in the best western tradition, morally a bit unclean but still without that dark side. i think he manages to pull this unlikely part off, but those who really steal the show are the two rivalising women, the schoolmistress geraldine page and the head of the students, played by elizabeth hartman.we see that there is a potential devil in every man and a potential witch in every woman, especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire. hartman's edwina is the sweetest, most innocent girl in the world until she becomes infatuated with john mcburney and becomes possessive of him. this is what causes tragedy, as well as the headmistress' secret lust, the forbidden fruit. she carries a great and ugly secret about her incestuous relationship with her brother, whom she clearly idolizes still. the fourth factor in this "unholy" love spiral is the wicked carol, played by jo ann harris, who lures john away from his crush on edwina and into her bed.the whole nature of the story gives this film a sort of gothic feel, which makes it a pretty rare thing in the western genre, but a popular thing in the movies of the 70's. a unique achievement by the siegel/eastwood team and a movie not for the faint hearted.

alexander nevsky is rightfully held up as a cinematic masterpiece. it has however aged very badly. people decide not to mention this and talk about the great battles and the great music. the sound effects may have been good then but apart from the foreboding organ all the sounds are risible. i may be shot by film buffs for this but i'm sure the modern viewer of alexander nevsky will agree that the blatant propaganda and the appalling music to detract from the film. i gave this film 10/10 because it is undeniably a master piece. it does have its great bits however. the costumes of the teutonic knights are superb and the battle scenes are fairly good for the time.it is however a master piece that is showing it's age.

"alexander nevsky" marked director sergei eisenstein's return to film-making after a period of exile, and what he produced is a bald-faced propaganda film proclaiming russia's superiority over germany.there's very little plot: russians unite to battle germans; russia wins. the film is really an extended montage of mostly battle scenes, mixed in with some moments of german brutality (like a rather shocking scene that shows german soldiers throwing russian children onto a raging fire). this was eisenstein's first sound film, and it's clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium. indeed, this film really looks more like a silent film with some sound added. there are some dialogue scenes, but they sit rather lifelessly on the screen, and the pacing is all off, as if the actors weren't actually on the set together at the same time when they were filming them. eisenstein mostly uses sound as an excuse to overlay a rousing prokofiev score over the proceedings, and indeed, that's one of the film's biggest assets.say what you will about eisenstein's ability (or lack of) to direct actors or tell his film in a more narrative format, he certainly knows how to edit images and music together for maximum effect, and "alexander nevsky" over all shines through its deficiencies.grade: a

a stunning piece of art.you can watch every image of the film and see the beauty in it.first i would like to say that ¬¥when i saw the german¬¥s soldiers helmet¬¥s i understood that it was from here that "star wars" hade been inspired.the scene were they kill the baby is frightening and when i saw it i did not like it.but when the film was end i thought about that scene and i changed my mind and thought that in the world war 2 that was exactly what the german¬¥s did.the ice-battle scene is some of the best war scenes i have seen(if not the best).they way this film combines music and so superbly stunning visual images is really excellent.then the prokofiev score is one of the most famous sound track¬¥s in history and i thought it was some of the best to.what more can you say then a work of art.eisenstein have created a stunning masterpiece,a propaganda film and a beautiful work of art. i am very happy because i have just got the criterion collection eisenstein set.

when i first saw this film around 6 months ago, i considered it interesting, but little more. but it stuck with me. that interest grew and grew, and i wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual vhs quality rather than the film itself. i purchased the criterion dvd box set, and it turns out that i was right the second time. alexander nevsky is a great film. it is rousing, and i'm sure it succeeded in its main aim: propaganda against the germans.that is the most common criticism against this film, and against eisenstein, that it is merely propagandist and nothing else. it's untrue. he is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived. by now, the world is far enough beyond joseph stalin to be able to watch eisenstein's films as art.

alexander nevsky (1938) is a brilliant piece of cinematic propaganda. the people of russia are threatened by two major enemies, the mongols and the teutonic knights of the holy roman empire. in ordered to unite the warring, rival princes in the russian realm, nevsky takes charge and fights the lesser of two evils (the teutonics). this influential film was copied many times over and it still holds up to this day. the soundtrack by composer prokiev and eisentstein's direction are a sight and sound to behold many years later, john milius used many of the movies scenes, set pieces and costumes from this film and incorporated them into conan.one of my favorite lines from conan was taken from this movie. "it's not the strength of the iron in a weapon but the strength of the person that wields it is what matters." the comparisons are unmistakable. the armor that james earl jones and the leader of the teutonic knights wear are virtually identical. a true tribute paid from one director to another.i give alexander nevsky one of my highest recommendations. the movie plays like the final act of richard iii. the presence of prince alexander on the screen is truly amazing.

along with cops, the goat is one of keaton's two funniest shorts. which makes it one of the best shorts ever made. this has an decent "plot" for a short, and it forms a perfect line on which to hang some great gags. keaton is mistaken for an escaped convict (how the mistake happens is a classic) and then must elude the authorities. best gags - the bread line and t he "elevator".

i hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem, except to say that it represents young buster keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the half-dozen best short comedies ever made. the goat is twenty minutes of smoothly paced, expertly photographed, beautifully executed gags; two reels of non-stop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending -- which wasn't always the way with buster's comedies. (see cops for one case where fatalism ultimately got the better of him, or one week for the victory of defeatism.) if i had to describe this film in one word i'd call it "effortless," but if i were permitted two i'd call it "seemingly effortless," for surely a lot of hard labor goes into the making of any comic opus that unfolds with such sublime ease. still, they didn't call him the great stone face for nothing: buster never let the public see him sweat.a sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is set "along millionaires' row," i.e. on a bread line in a grim urban setting, where buster waits patiently at the back of the line and, as a result, doesn't get fed. but it needs to be emphasized that not for one moment does he play for pathos; buster has our sympathy, but he never asks for it. before long, through a series of accidents, coincidences and absurd misunderstandings, buster is believed to be an escaped killer named dead shot dan and is being pursued by every cop for miles around, and yet while he's clearly dismayed by this turn of events there is never a hint of self-pity or even surprise; we get the sense he always knew that this is what life would have in store for him, and that he hasn't time to feel sorry for himself anyway, he has to figure out new ways to dodge those cops and escape from the latest trap.just as buster refrains from playing for sympathy he never seems to strain for laughs either, which is especially impressive because the goat must be one of the most laugh-packed short comedies in existence. this is the film that features that iconic shot of buster riding a train's cow-catcher right up to the very lens of the camera, which isn't a gag exactly but sure is laugh-provoking in its own strange way. meanwhile, there are gags involving guns, dogs, cops, an incredibly furry mustache, and a clay statue of a horse that melts under buster's weight (a surreal sight indeed), but some of the biggest boffos are saved for the finale when buster is trying to elude his primary nemesis, big joe roberts, a rotund cop who also happens to be the father of leading lady virginia fox. trapped in big joe's dining room, buster leap-frogs over him and sails through a transom, turns a phone-booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear, and eventually uses the elevator itself to rid himself of his pursuer and win the girl in time for one last fade-out gag.to say more would be a disservice to first-time viewers. i only wish i could see this film in a theater full of people who'd never seen it before, and float on the laughter. live musical accompaniment would be nice too; and incidentally the musical score supplied by kino for their home video/dvd version of the goat is first-rate, serving as icing on an already tasty cake.

ok i am a huge traci fan so her just being in the movie automatically makes it rank at the 8.5+ rating. but even besides her being in it i thought it was a good movie especially for it being an hbo movie. but i am afraid if you take traci out of the movie it would just be ok. but a person can't do that she is in it and she is a wonderful actress. she just keeps getting better and better.

i really like traci lords. she may not be the greatest actress in the world but she's rather good in this. she play the dowdy, conservative, reporter to a 't'. it's a great little thriller which keeps you guessing for a good while. jeff fahey is also good as traci's boss. i think given a decent break traci could be a top actress. she's certainly no worse than some of today's leading ladies.

a very good offering from hbo. traci lords is becoming a much-better dramatic actress with each effort. i hope to see this attractive lady in more challenging roles in the future, instead of the "flighty" roles she has been stuck with in the past.

many of us find art agreeable only when the masterpiece itself touches something deep inside us. that is, the completed creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can somehow personally relate to it. it was winter, here in australia 1992 when i had seen batman returns at the cinemas and it blew me away. both "me's". i was supposed to belong to an ideal, a standard, but at the same time i was living another life. tim burton was the first film maker to say its ok for a comic movie to be dark and to confess that darkness can happen to us all. after tim burton's batman interpretations, many other dark comic book heroes and anti-heroes flooded the cinemas. comic book folklore for decades had told of friendly, likable heroes with dashingly handsome smiles and magical superpowers who fly in the sky, and spun powerful webs from their wrists and wore red boots and had the strength of a locomotive. but what happens when you are only ten years old and you see your parents coldly executed in front of your very eyes? you snap. somewhere in your psyche,your young tender psychological make up breaks apart. the only way such pain and hurt can be managed is to create an alternate persona.you make a promise. your other self will be stronger, harness all the anger all the rage to use whatever means available to avenge the innocence of your parents onto that criminal, those criminals, any criminal. this is life seen through bruce wayne's eyes. both pairs. the world he sees is dark, gloomy, and cold. although he patrols the streets and people hear him cruise by, they don't rush out to get his autograph. he is their saviour, not the winner of a personality contest. batman returns is about losers. batman, for yet another christmas, remains "the only lonely man beast in town". bruce wayne never gets to lawfully arrest the vile max shreck. the penguin never gets to unleash his pain of being discarded by his parents onto the citizens of gotham, and selina kyle is forever lost to being mentally fragmented and traumatized. and the hero doesn't get the girl- or cat.this movie delves into the desire in all of us to want so desperately to belong, to have a home, as expressed by bruce wayne and oswald cobblepot.the film brings out a need in all of us to be heard, respected and not ignored as desired by selina kyle , oswald and of course bruce wayne. but sometimes we are all suppressed in one way or another, we are told to be an ideal, to behave to a certain standard. that is until we finally snap. only hope remains at the end of the movie as we see catwoman rise towards the night sky. but come what may we all must wish good will towards all men and women. as for me , i cant say that i will reach a point where i will believe my problem with duality will be reconciled. but thats ok. we all have a dark side. batman returns is not only the best of the batman films ,it is truly a stand out exceptionally fine masterpiece of storytelling.

ah, batman returns, is it possible to have a sequel to be almost as good as the original? with batman returns, it came pretty close! we have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains, catwoman and the penguin. we have michael keaton back as batman and he's still awesome than ever. michelle pfieffer, the perfect choice for catwoman and was perfectly cast into place. as much as i love and is such an incredible actress annette benning, she couldn't have been catwoman, she doesn't really have the look. danny devito, who could have imagined him as the penguin? he was just great and terrifying! batman returns with a more loving community of gotham city, they are celebrating christmas time with, max shrek played by a creepy christopher walken. the perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary, selina who happens to hear too much at his office causing him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never reveal the information of knowing the penguin and the attempt to make him loved in gotham. when she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go at it with her cats! but there is also another active villain, the penguin who is in search of his parents that abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of gotham city! can batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their hanous acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city as well?you'll have to see! batman returns is just as good as the original batman, despite the first one remaining the true classic, this one still takes you for a ride. and come on, i mean we've got michelle in leather! her classic moment of just meeting batman and the penguin "meow" is classic! there are memorable characters, lines, and sets! you'll have a blast! trust me! 9/10

and a perfect film to watch during the holiday season as the winter/xmas atmosphere that burton creates for gotham city is way cool. it's weird that warner decided to release this as a summer film. it doesn't fit.but what's even weirder, when you consider the content of this film, is that it was aimed at families. an upper-class family throws their mutant baby down the sewer, a socio phobic billionaire dresses up in leather as a flying rodent, a lonely secretary dresses up in leather as a feline and a freak runs for political office. and s&m and bondage are presented in a very perverted way. but burton got away with it. his visual style in this film is at it's best.this and batman: dead end are the only true live-action incarnations of the comic-book character. true, the animated series was the closest to the source material, but compared with batman forever and the un-nameable one after that, batman returns is the best of the four.darker and more violent than the first movie, the sense of gothic pathos reaches a new high. i was quite keen on michael keaton as bruce wayne (don't even get me started on george clooney!), he displayed the right balance of weirdo loner and cool crime fighter. michelle pfieffer is great as catwoman (much sexier and more 'realisticly' cat-like), she wears that leather outfit better than halle berry. and danny devito was so convincing as the penguin that his scenes became disturbing to watch. and christopher walken is brilliant as the spooky max shreck (if you think you recognise chip shrek it's none other than a very young leatherface/butterfinger).danny elfman's score is also even better than it was first time round. his powerful and engaging themes are way better than the dross that followed in the later 2 schumacher movies. this movie is the batman phenomenon at its zenith. forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after this. let's hope that christopher nolan and christian bale can bring some integrity back to the live action batman with their movie next year.this dvd was one of the first ever dvds released by warner (almost 7 years ago!!!) and as a result there are no features and the case is a snapper. pick it up cheap like i did and hope for an se in the future.

the regard of flight and the clown bagatelles as performed by bill irwin are some of the funniest (both in terms of physical comedy and verbal and visual gags) performances i've ever seen. my father taped this special when it first aired in the 80s and my family has loved it ever since. we quote it back and forth fairly constantly. it's a crying shame that copies are not readily available for purchase. i have a bad vhs copy that i acquired from a specialty distributer a few years ago, but mr. irwin's performance deserves a proper dvd treatment with a restored version of the original performance and interviews with the performers/producers as well as more examples of modern clowning.bill irwin's talent deserves more exposure to mainstream audiences than it has enjoyed in his limited wide release appearances. i share "the regard of flight" with friends quite often and though i am always greeted with a small amount of skepticism when i mention that it is a mixture of clowning and vaudeville i have yet to have anyone come away from seeing it without loving it. in case the powers that be ever happen upon this imdb listing, please consider releasing this and other bill irwin work.

the regard of flight, written and performed by bill irwin, is a true classic theatre piece which translated quite well to the small screen. full of quick and sparkling dialog and some of the best physical comedy of the decade, it is head and shoulders above 99% of "comedy" as it is presented today. i am sure it will one day take its rightful place with such great shows as "the fantastiks", and "waiting for godot." why it isn't available on dvd yet is a mystery and a tragedy.

ronald coleman had been a star of the screen for several years when talkies came in, and what a boost it was to his career. his oxford english accent is so enthralling i could listen to him recite the farmer's almanac and not be bored.coleman plays willie hale, a 30ish playboy from a wealthy family who spends his time womanizing and gambling. yet, he's a likable rogue - not only likable from the standpoint of the audience but by family and friends too. he has yet again gone broke due to his constant gambling and sells off his possessions in a foreign location to settle his debts and provide passage back home to england. when he gets there, he at first is met by a father who insists he'll kick him out - he's had it with willie and his layabout ways. however, five minutes alone in a room with willie and his charm, and willie is not only forgiven by dad, dad has given him one hundred pounds to boot.willie then goes for a day's recreation with his sister and her friend, dorothy hope (loretta young). dorothy is set to be engaged to the grand duke paul that very night, mainly just because her dad wants royalty in the family, and there is nobody else special in her life. that changes after her day with willie, and soon there is a scandal brewing as dorothy refuses to go through with the marriage as planned.ronald coleman is always a delight to watch in these early talking films he did for sam goldwyn where he is playing the confident adventurer or cad or both. he has a demeanor akin to errol flynn, but he is unable to display flynn's physical agility due to a disabling wound he received during world war i. however, what he lacks in physical agility coleman always made up in agility of soul. loretta young, only 17 when this picture was made, shows the beginning of her trademark sweet girl that can erupt into a ball of fire when the occasion calls for it. myrna loy plays willie's girl from the past - mary crayle - a showgirl. here myrna is still playing a part similar to the exotic vamp parts she got stuck with so often over at warner brothers when she was a contract player from 1926 until shortly before this movie was made in 1930.this is pretty much a light and breezy romantic comedy from start to finish. if you're in a mood for the kind of escapist entertainment that lightened the hearts of audiences during the great depression, this little film fits the bill.

i'm so happy i recorded this on vhs tape when it was featured on master piece theatre. this is a movie i can watch again and again. like living in the early 1800's in england isn't hard enough, prue is born with a "hare lip" and is outcast from birth. the people in her village accept her somewhat but always fear that she is "from the devil's smithy" and are quick to turn on her. especially when a lot of bad luck befalls her family. she is strong and courageous but shies away from kester woodseaves, a traveling weaver who catches her eye. partly because she fears rejection and also because she thinks he is so virile that he should have a wife who is as lovely as a lily. kester is a modern man who does not believe in the superstitions of the time and he speaks his mind and follows his heart. the movie stays true to the original story by mary webb and is riveting from beginning to end.

when this was first aired on masterpiece theatre, it had a profound effect on me. it's beautifully filmed and acted. i immediately read the book by mary webb, and it remains one of my all time favorites. janet mcteer is wonderful as prue, and i fully expected her to become a regular on the british drama scene. i guess she chose to focus on the british stage instead. i was hoping that with the american success of janet mcteer years later(with tumbleweeds) this film would again become available to us. alas, it has not yet been released on dvd. if anyone out there is listening, please make this available again!

this is a charming movie starring everyone's favorite cartoon chipmunks. in this feature we follow the band of rodents on an unforgettable balloon race around the world. although there are lows, including an orphan penguin, all in all it's a great family film.

plot in a nutshell: dave seville, father figure & manager of the chipmunk brothers alvin, simon & theodore, has gone off to europe on a business trip, leaving the boys at home with miss miller as their watcher, much to the chagrin of alvin, who wanted to go to europe. while playing against his female counterpart, brittany, the leader of the chipettes, comprised of her younger sisters jeanette (the female counterpart of simon) and eleanor (the female counterpart of theodore) in a fierce arcade game of around the world in 30 days, they catch the attention of two evil foreign siblings who need to smuggle money & diamonds around the world, but need a way to do it that won't draw the attention of their arch enemy, jamal. the 2 evil siblings, claudia & klaus, overhear the banter between alvin & brittany and decide to use them as the delivery boys & girls for their loot (more claudia's idea than klaus's, the latter initially objects feeling that it's too dangerous for children). the 2 siblings make an offer to the boys & girls - travel via air balloons to 12 drop off points to leave dolls (which resemble the kids) that contain diamonds and/or money to indicate their arrival, with the promise that whoever wins the race will get an obscene amount of money. but as the two different set of talking animal siblings make their rounds, they are stalked by the henchmen of jamal - but who is jamal? is he friend or foe? overall: enjoyable, lighthearted farce based on the 1980s tv series version of alvin & the chipmunks. beautiful animation is a highlight, lacks the crude humor that keeps creeping into today's family films and engaging songs (boys & girls of rock & roll being a stand out). eagle eyed fans will probably notice that brittany's character design has been tweaked from the animated series, giving her a less round face while adding a seemingly permanent blush to cheeks (which jeanette & eleanor also display).keep an ear out for nancy cartwright, the voice of bart simpson.

i was -unlike most of the reviewers- not born in the 80's. i was born on may 14th 1994. despite this, my life was very much in the style of the 80's. when other kids had playstations, i was playing zelda on my nes etc. now, this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review. i, because of my 80's style early childhood, watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didn't see, and this movie was one of those, and one of the greatest too.it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville, simon seville, theodore seville and david seville. david, the chipmunk's adoptive father, is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe. his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack. while they are talking, alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world (even though, technically dave is only going to europe, so to alvin, apparently only america and europe qualify as ''the world''). david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller, much to the displeasure of the boys. soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller. later, at a local caf√© the chipmunks are playing a game of ''around the world in 30 days'' against the chipettes(brittany, jeanette and eleanore). after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile, alvin get's in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world. two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and, needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world, decide to fool the children into delivering them for them. they set up a race around the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness (secretely filled with diamonds) at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team's likeness (secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds) to ''varify that they were there''. the winning team would then receive a 100.000 dollar reward. they do this because they believe that jamal (an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (however, this seems to be redundant, because on their travels, the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls, i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally.) and so begins a great adventure. this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it. it features great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention the kick-ass music (pardon my french :p). my favorite song is without a shred of doubt ''the girls and boys of rock and roll'' an amazing rock song that cannot be topped. it's also my favorite moment in the film. other notable songs include ''getting lucky''(kind of suggestive for a kid's film eh?) and ''my mother'' as well as ''wooly bully'' and ''off to see the world'' not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra. the scene with ''my mother'' still brings a tear to my eye. in relation to the song ''getting lucky'' i first didn't think anything of it, but when i grew older and learned about life, it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive. that song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties. this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian prince's men, when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film, it's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. anyway, a bit after that scene, the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home. the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband, ross bagdasarian jr. know the characters better than anyone. they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes. ross doing the voices for alvin and simon (as well as dave) and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore. speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses, nancy cartwright (the voice of bart simpson) makes an appearance in this movie. she plays the part of the arabian prince, a very small, but important role. the ending is of course, a happy one. the crooks have been caught, the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children, dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset, alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100.000 dollar reward for winning the race, which annoys dave until he finally yells ''alvin!'' and the screen fades to blackclassic ending, by the way. i hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven't seen this flick, give it a watch, it's worth the money. this nostalgic classic from the 80's gets a solid 10 out of 10. ''headin' for the top, don't you know! we never stop believing now''

the feature length cgi movie has just been released this year, but whilst it will provide kids a lot of entertainment, for die-hard alvin fanatics and followers who grew up with the 60s and 80s versions of the cartoon shows, the chipmunk adventure is probably the best alvin and the chipmunks based animated movie, ever.for starters, the animation is as ever terrific, the character designs are as they should be in the cartoons- unlike the motion picture film itself, it is just sheer fun to watch. there are no celeb voices, no cgi generated effects, just pure quality 2-d, hand drawn animation and the colours are fantastic- bright, bold and beautiful. the jokes and humour is typical chipmunk standard and the narrative is spot-on. in truth, the chipmunk adventure is everything the live action movie ought to have been, but isn't. alvin, simon and theodore compete with the chipettes, elenor, jeanette and britney in a hot air balloon contest and along the way, the kids encounter all manner of problems and dilemmas that they have to resolve in their own way. and no chipmunk movie is complete without the odd renditions of classic rock and pop anthems.the chipmunk adventure is for kids and adults alike-, which is another advantage over the cgi movie- as whereas, the 2007 version will gain a few new admirers, the 1987 movie will appeal to both young and older chipmunk fans. bagdarasian and karman provide the helium-like voices of the film's trio.overall, this film is a must for fans of the cartoon shows themselves- you will not be left disappointed. if you have seen the live action version, then you'll feel that this movie is a much better effort in contrast. if you haven't then you should go and see it still, or even still forget the jason lee movie and as an alternative, stick with this

if your a child of the 80's and have not seen this movie you have failed to be a true child of the 80's. how can you not love those great chipmunks (don't forget about the chippettes), lines, and songs. years later i can still sing every word to every song. the story line is great and much better then the films for kids today. it's just pure fun and worth the rent, even if your all grown up.

i have been an avid chipmunk fan since the late 70's - early 80's. when this movie came out, it was a must to see it. and after seeing it, i went right over and bought it! the movie is great, i love the animated action it brings, and the music is great (yes, i bought the soundtrack on cd...) a recommended video for everyone to watch and enjoy!

this movie is a classic. kids now will love it, and people like me, who were kids when it first came out, still watch it for its nostalgic value as well as for its humor and great story. it introduces kids to different cultures and inspires them to adventure. it's not just a cartoon, it's a masterpiece. i love it.

i think it is great one of my favourite films as a kid and who said there songs were unforgettable they were mint i can still remember them now word for word the film remains a favourite with my family and my younger cousins are now addicted to it too they even know the songs this film is great and a enjoyable film for kids it has a moral lesson so don't say its not good because it shows how lying gets you nowhere ill leave with a parting comment: this film is amazing love me xxx p.s i would like the soundtrack but i cant and yes the animation is good the jokes are humorous and the action never stops.this film will go down in children's film history and in my opinion one of the only remaining safe films to show children.

i loved this movie and i never knew it was this old it came out the day n year i was born in and now i am 19 now i still love this movie especially the songs like "my mother" and "boys and girls of rock n roll" and i remember as a kid i believe i was 5 n my sister was 6 and my cousin (boy) was 6 as well we used to pretend to be the characters in the movie i was eloner and janette and my sister was britany and my cousin was alvin simon and theodore those were good times and i miss it and having this movie reminds me of the good times since my cousin is old for this stuff and so am i and my sis we are not going to forget about the chipmunk and the chipmunk movie i still even remember the songs and the words off by heart even though i haven't seen this movie for 12 years but now starting to love it again alvin and the chipmunks and chipettes <3<3<3<3

this was one of the best movies you could find as a child. i lived with the chipmunk adventure from 4 years old to 8 years old. the story of this film was: dave's going on a business trip to europe and sticks the boys with miss miller. while playing an around the world in 80 days video game, two villains, klaus and claudia (brother and sister), round the chipmunks and chipettes into an adventure in which the kids must hot-air-balloon their way across the globe. what they're unaware of is that the "game" is really a diamond-smuggling ring. and when found at the airport by the villains, a chase ensues! and which ends in klaus and claudia off to jail and alvin, simon, theodore, brittany, jeanette, and eleanor safe with dave and miss miller. but i am warning you now, this is a musical and quite a damn good one at that. most people hate musicals, but i am not one of those people, i frigging love musicals like rocky horror, grease, sound of music, cats don't dance, and just about anything (except for my fair lady). if you see this, share with your kids (if you got any)!

when i first saw this movie i was only a little kid and i fell in love with it, they really don't make movies like this anymore,i just watch this again now slightly older and still love it. the humour is perfect and fits into the movie really well, all the gags are kind of childish but will make adults laugh as well,and in a kids movie is really very rare. the animation is amazing and to watch hand-drawn animation is a real breath of fresh air to all the computer animation we see today. the backgrounds are stunning and the coloring is amazing.the characters are just the kind of characters that you fall in love with the moment you start watching girls will think the chipmunks are adorable and guys will think the chipettes are really kinda sexy.the songs are fun to listen too and some just really make you wanna cry or get up and dance, its also fun to watch visual humor to go along with them. the voice acting is great no doubt even if most of the voice acting is high pitch, but an interesting thing popped up and it one of the songs from this movie but the slowed down to show the real voices behind them and its really kinda fun to watch. if you see this movie in a store or somewhere to rent i say check it out it's really worth seeing and is a perfect family movie its absolutely amazing, words can not express this movie.

awwww, i just love this movie to bits. me and my cousins enjoy this movie a lot and i am just such a huge fan!!! i hope they bring the tv series out on dvd soon. come to mention it, i have not see the tv show in a long time. such geart times! where i come from australia the chipmunk adventure is only known by people in their late teens and adult years which is kinda sad because the young kids don't know what there missing.the songs in this film are ace the ones i love the most boys/girls of rock n'roll, diamond dolls and the song that ls sure to make you want to cry my mother.this film is sure to excite both young and old get the chipmunk adventure today!!! 10 out of 10, such an excellent movie.

"the chipmunk adventure" is one of the greatest animated movies of the 1980's. alvin and the chipmunks have always been of some interest to me, since they were what really got me into rock and roll. neither one of the chipmunks has any bad traits. alvin's really the star and has all the cool looks. theodore is the lovable sensitive one. then there's simon (my personal favorite), the smart one who is often a party pooper. i also like the chipettes a lot. there's brittany, who, like alvin, is one who is always trying to be so popular. then there's eleanor, who, like theodore, is sweet, sensitive, and loves food. janette is the only chipette who is not much like her counterpart; she's very naive and really clumsy.in the chipmunks' very first full-length movie, david seville is going on a business trip to europe, and he's leaving the boys with miss miller while he's gone. while playing an arcade game, alvin loses against brittany and then says that if he had the money, he'd race brittany around the world for real. unbeknownest to the kids, a man named klaus furschtien and his sister, claudia, who have been trying to come up with a sneaky way to deliver diamonds around the world in exchange for cash, overheard this conversation and said that they'd let them race around the world for $100,000. alvin and brittany accept it and go on the race.this adventurous movie has a lot of great songs. "off to see the world" made for an appropriate theme song for the movie. then there is "getting lucky", one of my favorite songs in the movie. "my mother" is most likely the sappiest song in the movie, but it always makes me cry. "wooly bully" is the only cover song used in the movie (the rest were completely original). then, of course, there's "the boys and girls of rock and roll", which, in my opinion, has to be one of the greatest musical numbers in movie history.i used to watch this movie very often, until my recorded tape of it died. i still watch the movie, though. this is actually a fun movie for people who are about to go on a vacation to a foreign country for the first time. it'll give you an idea of what kind of stuff you'd expect out of world travel. definitely one of my childhood movies, and one that i'd recommend to 80's fans and alvin & the chipmunks fans.

although it is more of a kids movie, it still holds its own, especially when compared to the more recent assembly line animated films being made. the music is fantastic!! i don't care how old you are, you will still find yourself rockin to "girls of rock and roll" and diamond dolls." definatly a must for animation lovers.

i loved this movie when i was a kid. i saw it theatrically. randy edelman did a good composition of the soundtrack. david seville is the chipmunks' father and recording manager. the chipmunks consist of alvin, who is best known for playing the harmonica, simon, who is a bright and studious chipmunk & theodore, who is the youngest and is always hungry. there is a lady known as miss miller, who looks after the chipmunks and has 3 daughters known as brittany, jeanette & eleanor, who all have the same character as the chipmunks. my favourite songs from this soundtrack include "diamond dolls", the girls of rock & roll", & the touching "my mother". alvin really wanted to see europe when dave had to go there for business. the chipmunks meet the chipettes playing the around the world in 30 days video game which led them to race each other doing the real thing.

to this day, there isn't a movie i've seen more times than the chipmunk adventure, nor has any movie brought me more happiness. this is by no means the greatest film or even the greatest animated film, but to an 8 year old girl in 1988 it was the coolest, funniest, most exciting film ever! i'm still equally as impressed today with the musical numbers, each one a standout song with wonderfully dramatic lyrics in the epic tradition of 80's pop (think pat benetar on helium, only catchier). controversy has stirred over the blatantly suggestive tone of the chipette's song "gettin' lucky with you", which to me seemed much more innocent at the time. however, looking at it as a rational adult, i can totally understand the concern; you've got three young girls in skimpy harem outfits passionately proclaiming "getting lucky is what it's all about". the chipettes' were definitely sexualized tenfold for this movie.but this controversial issue doesn't even come close to overshadowing the chipmunks' otherwise fabulous feature length animated adventure, i encourage parents and childless adults alike to check out this movie. especially if you were a child of the eighties/early nineties like me. :-)

the chipmunk adventure there are some movies that i could watch all my life and never grow tired of them, and this nostalgic favorite is one of them. the chipmunk adventure was a 1987 attempt to bring the old favorites back to the forefront of animation, this time on the big screen. in an age when disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation quality and box office, the chipmunk adventure stands as one of the best animated films that disney didn't produce in the 80's.the story is simple and elementary, having alvin, simon & theodore compete in an around-the-world race with the chipettes (janette, eleanor, & brittany). however, as the chipmunks encounter exotic dangers, they are unaware that they are the pawns in a major diamond heist.the chipmunk adventure never was and never will be a film that soars thanks to an engrossing plot. and to people who didn't love it as a child, the film will probably never be more then an enjoyable, yet forgettable, animated movie. but for me, it will always be a little known masterpiece. something about the film just clicks for me in a way few films do.every song is fun, upbeat, and harmless. highlights include the chipettes in a slightly risqu√© arabian dance to calm snakes. there's also a very sweet song in which the chipmunks sing about traveling the world and we get to see them at major landmarks throughout the globe. one thing about the chipmunk characters is that, despite the potentially annoying vocals, the songwriters always managed to write songs that were catchy without ever being grating. this film is no exception... it actually boasts one of the best animated movie soundtracks of the 80's if you ask me.every joke is cute, sincere and amusing. the bits between the bad guys and a pampered puppy are very amusing. and the shock of seeing the chipettes nearly forced into marriage by a child emperor is as well. the comedy manages to constantly play to the kids so that they don't miss anything, but everything remains charming for the adults with enough nostalgia to keep them entertained.it's really just a fun trip that is completely humble in it's ambitions. the chipmunk adventure never aims to be anything more then it is, harmless fun. i'll be the first to admit this is a biased review because i have such a nostalgic fondness for the chipmunk adventure that i would never be able to give it a bad review... but nonetheless, it fills me with such a childish contentment while watching it. everyone has their random favorite from childhood that no one knows, and for me it's this movie. and any film that i can watch over and over whether i am 5, 12, 23 or older is a great film in my eyes.... a- ...

one of my absolute favorite childhood films. the chipmunk adventure packs incredible fun geared for young and old alike. the animation is lively and colorful and the film itself boasts some of the best songs ever put in an animated feature. who could forget the dynamic "boys/girls of rock n' roll", the exciting "diamond dolls", and the heartrending "my mother"? this should be considered a nostalgic classic animated gem from the eighties. it's too bad they don't make them like this anymore. most animated films today resort to violence, crude humor, or sentimental mush... except of course the folks from pixar.bottom line: an amazing and unforgettable adventure for all ages.

i've loved this movie for a long time. i hadn't seen it in a while, so i again checked it out and actually found it even more enjoyable now. i loved the chipmunks cartoon when i was young, so naturally i adored 'the chipmunk adventure.'i honestly can't think of a better plot to this movie. it's not wildly creative, but i've always wanted to travel all over the world, and so i just have so much fun watching it as my longing to travel grows even more. the part with elenore singing to the little penguin always makes me cry...'the chipmunk adventure' will remain a favorite of mine forever, i'm sure. i guess it's because i saw it when i was so young. i don't think it would make quite an impact on someone older seeing it for the first time. (unless, of course, they have a young heart)

yes, let's get this out of the way before we begin: *this is the one that sean connery returned to in 1983 after the stint we had of roger moore. *it's connery's last film. *and yes it's a (kind of) remake of thunderball, but more of a film inspired by it. if all you bond purists out there think i'm gonna get controversial, you're right. bond is one of the greatest movie series ever, but that doesn't mean that a series should go on forever. this, i think, is one of two films where they could've done themselves a huge favour and ended the bond saga. not offended yet? then i'll continue... hey, if you're thinking i'm indifferent about bond flicks, you're wrong. i grew up with my mum being obsessed with them. any spare moment, bond and his antics would be on the tv. bond rules, and 'never say never again' (directed by irvin 'empire strikes back' kershner) is one of the best. it may not be 'goldfinger' or 'from russia...' and may not have been done by the same production house as all the others (which i hear is why they refuse to accept it was ever made!?), but still stands head and shoulders above the recent brosnan outings... (if you haven't spat at the screen, read on). characterization!!!!! something so many blockbuster films forget about these days, but something which is essential to telling a good story. 'never' played a superb hand by treating 007 like he had been ageing since 'dr. no'. he's 'getting on a bit' and so has to do things like go to a health farm - a direct order from 'm' (!). yeah, if you haven't seen this film, i won't give too much away with the plot because a) loads happens and b) obviously, i want you to see it for yourselves. don't be put off by my 'old bond' revelation, connery still get plenty of superb set pieces to charge, swim, punch, speed, smash, and snog his way through. the man is a legend, and this film is one of his most enjoyable outings as bond. high tech gadgets galore, some great villains, and an excellent supporting cast (including a fantastic cameo by rowan atkinson) lift this movie high above audience expectation.this could've been the last bond film ever, and it would've been a party to remember. playing the secret agent as someone nearing retirement was refreshing stroke of genius - the last scene wraps things up perfectly for the series.... ...but still we had more, and then more, and more still, and one more moore. still, if you fancy finding out what "fatima blush" is all about, get this film. then you can at least pretend 007 spent his last moments as a wisecracking secret agent, in the arms of kim basinger, and smirking at mr. bean. (p.s. * that other film that i think could've finished it all off? the gritty 'license to kill'

many have disparaged never say never again because it is not an official bond movie. nevertheless, it is manifest that the producers adhered to the fruitful bond formula. although the film does not have a pre-credit sequence, it is clear that the training exercise at the commencement of the film is meant to be the introductory scene. it would have been impossible for eon to stop the producers from including a pre-credit and title sequence, albeit without the gun-barrel introduction.sean connery is on fine form as the immortal secret agent and this film is certainly better than dr no, thunderball, you only live twice and diamonds are forever. although, nsna is meant to be a remake of thunderball, it is a vast improvement. 007 spends more time on terra firma and a more diverse range of exotic locations are included in the film. there is some resplendent acting in this movie. barbara carrera is impeccable as the bizarre fatima blush. one of the best scenes in the film is the coup de grace between bond and fatima in nice, which is preceded by a dynamic motorcycle chase through the city. klaus maria brandauer plays the psychotic largo and max von sydow is free of the melodrama that other actors portraying blofeld have indulged in.nsna tends to centre on connery rather than the character of bond. at the commencement it is stated that bond is ageing and has been out of action. this seems to refer to the 12 year hiatus in connery's portrayal of bond. bond promises "never again" to work in the secret service; an allusion to connery's portrayal of bond. it appears that the producers were trying to hurt the official bond franchise. nevertheless, this film is definitely worth watching. this is the last time that sean connery played james bond, but his performance convinced me that perhaps he should have never have said "never again".

i'm sick and tired of people complaining that never say never again is just a weak remake of thunderball. yes, that movie's influence is unmistakable, but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of re-made films is reserved for such thoughtless and unintelligent films like the 1998 re-make of psycho. while it's true that the opening theme of the twelfth (and connery's last) bond film is one of the worst of the entire series, the film itself still manages to stand on its own, despite many other weaknesses. besides that, even the weak title song is made to blend pretty nicely with the closing dialogue in the film.sure, sean connery was getting a little on in age when this movie was filmed (at least by james bond standards), but there is plenty of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this was not exactly unknown to the filmmakers. james bond is near retirement before he is handed his assignment, having spent most of recent time teaching, not doing, and there is even the tongue in cheek insistence from m that he pay more attention to his health, dieting and training and getting more exercise and whatnot. besides, this is james bond, remember? this guy is supposed to be some kind of super human, and all of his fans are getting all upset because he's got some gray hairs. when this guy retires at the end of the film, m sends poor `small-fawcett' (in a hilarious cameo from rowan atkinson) to tell bond that without him, he worries about the safety of the free world, and all of you people can't get over the fact that he's not a sprightly young man anymore. come on, sean connery could still play james bond just as good as he ever could, or at least better than anyone else ever has been able to.the majority of the film deals with the elaborate plan to steal nuclear missiles and hold the world hostage (as dr. evil would say, `oh hell, let's just do what we always do¬Ö'), so there's clearly not much new there, but this is one of the bond films that had the better one liners. there's the amusing scene where bond is asked for a urine sample ¬ñ `if you could just fill this beaker for me¬Ö' `from here?' there are a lot of good one-liners, but the sexual innuendos aimed at mr. bond are especially prevalent in this installment. but then later he happens to throw that very urine sample into a villain's face, making him scream as if his face were burning off. not a very good attempt at comic relief, especially since this guy had been kicking bond's ass with some sort of super-spring device that could cut through pretty much anything. and of course, kim basinger stars in this film as one of the best bond girls of the entire series.it's no secret that never say never again has dated badly, and one of the things that has dated the worst is the special effects ¬ñ with the one exception of the flying missiles, which were obviously fake but still impressive for 1982. the colored contact lens at the beginning of the film was totally without effect, and the laser watch was one of the worst things in the entire movie, second only to those damn sharks. evidently, fatima blush put some sort of device on his scuba tank that attracted sharks (granted, they did have weird guiding mechanisms of their own), in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line, `i have one simple request. and that is to have sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads!' and then, of course, there is the exploding hotel room scene which was redone in an episode of the simpsons, and which was obviously followed by another obligatory and overly casual one-liner from james.the domination video game created by largo, the film's villain, is an especially memorable scene, and the film also boasts what is probably the best motorcycle chase in the entire series (far to superior to the laughable one in tomorrow never dies). but despite many strengths, the film's weaknesses are left clearer in the audience's mind at the end of the film due in large part to the anticlimactic underwater conclusion (one of the more obvious parts borrowed from thunderball, and inferiorly recreated). never mind the fact that largo revealed some crucial information to bond as he left him in the tower alive (dr. evil's brilliance, once again, `i'll just leave him there without actually witnessing his death and just assume everything went to plan. what?'), the climax of what is expected to be a fast-paced action film should never take place in a muted underwater atmosphere. all in all, never say never again ranks very highly on the james bond scale, and connery's wink at the end of the film (as well as the two closing lines) suggested at the time that he may still return for another turn as bond. clearly, this is no longer very likely, so we can only hope.

you got to love this movie! i mean, what other swedish splatter movie could be so evil, bizarre and totally cruel...the whole movie is stuffed with some kind of weird humor, like: the old cencoreguy just blows his head off and the boss just wipes the blood off his glasses and says with a mean voice: - your fired!!! wouppie!!!

i thought this movie was brilliant. it was so funny and so true too. a great idea for a movie. five groups of friends on their way to schoolies. i've got to say that matt newton as mason was probably my favourite character. i wish i could give this movie more than a 10 rating.

all i can say is that, i was expecting a wick movie and "blurred" surprised me on the positive way. very nice teenager movie. all this kinds of situations are normal on school life so all i can say is that all this reminded me my school times and sometimes it's good to watch this kind of movies, because entertain us and travel us back to those golden years, when we were young. as well, lead us to think better in the way we must understand our children, because in the past we were just like they want to be in the present time.try this movie and you will be very pleased.at the same time you will have the guarantee that your time have not been wasted.

i saw a test screening of blurred recently, and i am surprised to say that it was actually pretty good! its a film about different groups of kids, your hillbillies, your rich snobs, your typical teenage couple, plus two geeky guys and one post hippie babe. together, but as separate storylines, each group is travelling to the gold coast for schoolies week. australia has never had any problems writing comedy and australia is never short or actors who can play comedy with subtlety and just the right amount on quirkiness. the cast is full of stellar aussie actors with enormous talent and loads of screen presence. keep your eyes on craig horner, a young graduate, who's optimism for a week long party gets lost in his friends shenanigans. travis cotten and mark priestly, who successfully tackle some tricky physical comedy as two bummed out bogans and jessica gower as a cutie but confused teen angsting about love. veronika sywak makes her film debut as every adolescent boys dream girl, and holds her own amongst an array of considerably more experienced performers. look out for matthew newton, cleverly cast as a seedy limo driver. fantastic aussie

algernon4's comment that ms paget's "ultra lewd dance in (this film) is the most erotic in the history of films" is certainly one doozy of an exaggeration. it isn't even debra paget's most erotic dance. her near nude gyrations in fritz lang's "the indian tomb" make this number look decidedly tame. as for being the most erotic in the history of dance. well! where do i start? salma hayek's performance as santanico pandemonium in "from dusk to dawn" (1996); jamie lee curtis in "true lies" (1994); jessica alba in "sin city" (2005); rose mcgowan in "terror planet" (2007); sheila kelley in "dancing at the blue iguana" (2000), blah, blah, blah.don't get me wrong. i love the sequence and have included it in my "cheesecake dance" series on youtube. i just think that making a claim like "most erotic in the history of film" is really going out on a very fragile limb.

i watched princess of the nile for the first time when i was about 10 years old. i am 63 now and have never forgotten the movie. nor have i gotten over my fascination with egypt. i have searched the internet trying to buy the movie, but have not been able to locate it. it makes me wonder if this is one of the lost movies in hollywood. i loved debra padget and jeffrey hunter together. they have such charisma together. if you were to ask me anything about the movie i could not tell you anything other than who was in it. i vaguely remember a scene by the nile with debra padget a bunch of other women.i have always wanted to see it again. i never thought of it as an escape movie back then, but i can see now where that was probably the case. i do hope they will put it on dvd and i will be able to see it again before i die. it was a wonderful movie.

this is one of my favorite films for many reasons. to begin, there are standout performances from lovely debra paget as a princess/dancing girl, from michael rennie as the villain, handsome young jeffrey hunter investigating crime in her city/state and others. the film is an unusually colorful adventure, and we even see the princess rehearsing the dance she later performs (for once). she manages to skewer hunter before she learns he is on her side; also the photography, the costumes by travilla, lionel newman's music and the film's style are unusually fine. add to this rousing action, intelligent characterization and fine direction by veteran harmon jones of a gerald drayson adams' script set in 1249 ad, and you have the ingredients of an enjoyable grecianized near-eastern. but there is much to praise about the unusual and well--developed storyline here, as there is much more to praise other than the film's swift pace, well-managed physical action sequences and superior technical aspects. classically-trained actors such as michael ansara, edgar barrier, wally cassell, jack elam and dona drake are not commonly found in one "b" film together; nor are there fascinating sets, a variety of locales and a mystery of the quality that is supplied here. one way of assessing a film is, "if i were guaranteed to live through the experience, would i choose to undergo these events and perform these actions?" since my answer is a resounding "yes" in this case, this film remains one of my choices as a favorite and very-underrated cinematic work. could it be that us critics' all-too-frequent disdain for females as warriors and thinkers that as in so many other cases has caused closed minds to misprize this estimable film's obvious anti-tyranny and pro-entertainment qualities?

for the most part, i only enjoy the kind of movie that allows one to escape the current time into the future or past. this movie is pure escapism. the dancing starts almost immediately, and debra paget in her "purple harem" bikini dress simply has no equal in film in my opinion. her dancing, while sultry, is surpassed by her dance in fritz lang's tiger of eschnapur, available on dvd, where she played the temple dancer seetha.one problem with the movie is the closed setting. there are few outdoor scenes shot, and they as well as other scenes are a bit claustrophobic. the same locations are used over and over again, but with some interesting secret passages and waterways. her secret double identity is totally unbelievable with beauty of that magnitude. debra even wields a sabre and holds 2 enemy soldiers at bay on a staircase, she could do it all.what does work is debra paget as a princess. with her beauty, she certainly would be the center of attention anywhere at any time in history. this movie, when hopefully it becomes available on dvd, will be a must buy. overall, taken with a bit of humor, i loved it.

this is one of my all time favorite cheap, corny, vampire b movies. calvin klein underwear model...oh, i mean, stefan the good vampire, returns to transylvania to ascend the throne of vampiric royalty, but manicure-impaired and eternally drooling half brother radu has other plans. having killed their father the vampire king, radu now sets his sights on stefan, stefan's new mortal girlfriend michelle and her two pretty friends, and the all-powerful bloodstone.okay, the scenery is beautiful, and it should be as it was shot on location in transyl-fricken-vania for gosh sakes. the actresses are no great shakes and stefan the heroic vampire is about as charming as a refrigerated fireplace poker, but who cares? there's only one reason to watch this movie, and his name is radu! he's a physical homage to nosferatu and he has the best lines in the movie, all spoken in the raspy voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day. the cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film, as radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his grinning, slobbering face for the world to see. i found myself cheering him on as he collected victims and taunted his perfect brother. but maybe i'm just a sicko. questionable taste in men aside, i highly recommend this film to vampire enthusiasts. it's original, it's fun, and radu is one of the best vampires i've seen in a long time...much more fun than the stiff, tragic, whining undead brats that endlessly grace the horror screens these days. radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes. he's what a vampire should be.

this is one of the best and moodiest vampire tales ever! i love this movie really. the character are great, even the locations and the story. indeed the picture isn't a big budget production, but it is absolutely worth seeing.ok there are some faults (especially the names of the castle and the locations) in this movie, but such mistakes are typically and are almost in every horror movie.the scenery fits perfect to the story and is close to reality,i can say that honest, because i visit them once when i was in romania in my vacations.in my opinion this is the best part of the subspecies series.

words fail me whenever i want to describe my feelings about this movie (and the sequels)... does it have flaws? sure it does... starting with the "subspecies" themselves,which were not executed well enough for a special effect.so why do i glorify these movies??? for the herd of movie mass-consumers out there,who care more about quantity than quality,about cheap fun more than about depth, crap like "blade" (it doesn't even deserve a capital letter),"underworld","dracula 2000","dracula 3000" and so on are good movies to munch popcorn to and drink a couple of cokes... what makes subspecies a superior effort for anyone claiming to be a vampire fanatic,on the other hand,is obvious: the vampire himself is romanian,the story is set in transylvania (the scenes filmed on location are more than convincing),and the atmosphere is not based on any "action-packed" chases or expensive orchestral music.radu himself is the source of the atmosphere... this is what a vampire should look like and this is how he should behave! add a breathtakingly gloomy castle with dark passageways situated in romania,include some typical vampiric elements ( such as the movement of the shadows on the walls when the vampires take to flight) and you have a work of art! in short,if ,like me,you 're fascinated with vampires and feel that their appearance as well as the setting should be sinister and dark,there's no better place to look in than in a subspecies movie... or in vampire journals,the brilliant spin off of the former...

a sparkling movie. bb is a marvel. she's sultry. she is a feminist. she is still very much in love.the movie features paris in the 50's. it is wonderful to look at the sites, the cars (ds!) and orly.a simple but very enjoyable romantic comedy. the music is horrendous. it almost dissonates. on the other hand it is hilarious. but it is probably the only thing amiss, at least looking at it with 21st century eyes.the movie comments on the french manner of treating infidelity. it is that sense modern. a movie like un elephant se trompe enormenent did it in an 80's way. but the basic premise stays the the same.thanks to makers for providing bb with this opportunity.

traffik is an excellent miniseries dealing with drug trafficking in europe. this is the european produced pbs series on which the oscar-nominated movie traffic is based on. if you loved traffic then traffik is a must see.overall i would highly recommend this miniseries to anyone that is interested in seeing drugs from a social point of view. the screenplay is exciting and unexpected as it weaves through the lives of drug dealers, traffickers, farmers, policians, and police officers. unlike other movies that sensationalize the issue of drugs, traffik presents it as is.

i remember watching this when it was made and thinking it was brilliant at the time. watching it for the second time nearly 20 years later, i still think traffik is brilliant and much better than the us film that was based on this drama.it should also be watched by all our come today gone tomorrow politicians who think they can win the war on drugs, as the issues raised in this film are as pertinent today as they were back then at the end of the 80s, and unless they change their policies, will be so in another 20 years.well written, well made, beautifully acted and superbly filmed. a thought provoking drama that entertains as well as brings to light some of the hard realities of the criminal drug trade.

i've read innumerable reviews talking about the superiority of the mini-series. i certainly can't agree on such a blanket statement. if you analyze all of the aspects of a video/film production, there are numerable areas where the film is arguably vastly superior.certainly, many of the comments are valid with regard to particular areas of the mini-series. specifically regarding more threads (customs officers) and more developed threads (such as the pakistani farmer and family). that said, i found catherine zeta-jones' character much more compelling as the desperate women, from poverty to riches who "won't go back." that's a much more likable character than this cold women who didn't seem to have as much reason for her quick turn to evil. (and yes, i understand...her children. she was desperate; i just didn't see her as being as desperate.)further, while i appreciated some of the more fleshed out story threads in the mini-series, benicio del toro's character was very compelling. an anchor for the film. that thread was changed (as an alternative to the pakistani family) in nothing but good ways. a fantastic adaptation. (of course, i'm skeptical that someone so pure can exist within such a system, but i don't know enough about the politics of the nation to argue).after watching the first episode of the mini-series, i actually rewatched the film. why? i kept reading about the fantastic acting. i found the performances in the first episode of the mini-series to be borderline laughable. certainly, this improved as the mini-series progressed. now having just finished both versions in a few days, i can't agree that the performances in the mini-series reached the same level as, say, benicio del toro, who was brilliant in the film, though ormand, paterson, shah, and lindsay duncan were very good. i also feel the police in the film far outclassed the mini-series. i was not impressed with the germans throughout.finally, the dialogue, as delivered in the film, is much more nuanced. especially in the scenes which are almost verbatim. "careful, you're beginning to sound like your husband." as opposed to "hahahaha! you sound like karl." again, i found some of the acting in the mini- series very unconvincing. this was a prime example.other superior aspects of the film, in my opinion: score, cinematography, editing.should i complain that the film wasn't longer? no. i think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format. the changes made stood on their own. i mean, would you sit in a theater for 5/ 7/10 hours. of course not.mini-series: 8 out of 10film: 9 out of 10

this is a wonderfully gritty drama, detailing the various sides of the international heroin drug-trade--from the hills of northern pakistan, where the tacitly allowed cultivation of opium-poppies occurs on a vast scale; to the jetsetting "euro-trash" in germany and england who arrange the importation of processed heroin in multi-kilo smuggled shipments; to the end-users caught up in the web of addiction and the crime needed to support their growing habit; and finally all the levels of international government corruption and hypocrisy surrounding police efforts at controlling "the drug problem"---this drama is sketched out with a wide array of in-depth well-rounded characters, fully evolved plot, and excellent character acting and location shooting.this puts hollywood epics like "the french connection" in their place!traffik is a deeply thought-provoking and suspenseful tale of modern drug-related espionage, and the international efforts of many people to try to eliminate it.unlike many "crime dramas" revolving around drugs, traffik focusses strongly on uncovering the societal *reasons* that people slide into drug addiction... as one of the characters puts it "...until we, as a society, construct a world that people want to participate in, instead of wanting to escape from, we will not be able to stop people from taking drugs..."this is a fascinating and fully engrossing drama. i highly recommend it!

i was disappointed with the recent (2000) american remake of this english mini-series. though it followed the plot line very closely, it seemed to leave the heart and soul of the original out. not to mention adding shallow preachy heavy-handed 'messages'... so my advice is to skip the modern remake and stick with the original. it's much longer, but gripping and totally well done. interesting, complex and textured, without the preachy self-righteousness... and it's beautifully shot, as well.i find it galling that these heartless remakes of great overseas films get so much hollywood fanfare at the oscars. (though i did like benicio del torro getting some deserved praise...)

i haven't seen the more recent 'traffic' which is based on this, but i'd bet on this one as the better creation. i know of no other movie that has so well portrayed the intricate tragedies of the drug trade and the 'war on drugs." i've watched this one at least four times and am enjoying it again as part of masterpiece theatre's 30th anniversary presentations.

compared to the acclaimed hollywood remake, this film is less flashy but much stronger at providing an overall picture of the drug problem. the remake loses the most interesting of the three plot threads, that of a farmer whose meager livelihood depends on drugs as a paying cash crop and whose increased involvement with the drug trade in an effort to better himself destroys himself and his family. additionally, the story of the daughter's addiction goes into the problems not only of withdrawal but the high likelihood of relapse. this original miniseries makes good use of the additional time to go into the issues more thoroughly and remains stronger meat on this controversial subject.

what an awesome mini-series. the original traffik completely stole me away from anything else that was on. far more engaging than the american remake, the original traffik boasts an amazing cast formed of lesser known actors to north american audiences. juliette binoche being the mainly recognizable actress who plays a drug addicted teenaged daughter of a government official. but it's not star power that carries this film (though i enjoyed the american version, i felt it was dimmed by the famous americans in the picture). unfortunately, i saw the american version before i found the original bbc mini-series. of course there were no picture filters, lush locales, and the big name stars/director. however, the grit and grime of europe (through the drugworld) perfectly compliments the impending sense of danger, which permeates throughout this film. the problems, such as getting addicts off of drugs by giving them more, poor anti-drug campaigning, and the resistance of foreign governments to assist with destroying their drug cultivators from within, all make traffik bold, immersive, and horrific all at the same time!the truly incredible portions of the movie all come from pakistan. my god, i never knew how bad the problem really was over in europe...even all over! for a real education on the problems of drugs, beyond how they affect the human body you must watch both this and the american version. each show one very clear and undeniable fact. those countries, which are leaders in the eyes of the world, have a culture that has led to the death and suffering for many. drugs are worse than war. they work in the shadows, the dark secrets of any "successful" society.

contains spoilers i had it recorded a while ago when it was on pbs but never got a chance to watch it (probably due to prejudice about having to sit through 5-6 hrs of masterpiece theater, with its bbc made for tv production style (no music, settings all in one room, no outdoor scenes flat tv look...)) but after watching the movie traffic (which i thought was pretty good at that time,) i couldn't help digging up the traffik tape to see what else could they have dwelled into with the extra 2 1/2 hr.boy, was my preconceptions wrong about this tv series. it is so much more involving than traffic. the characters are fleshed out better so that their actions are more believable. and the whole subplot involving pakistan completes the whole point of view of everyone in the whole supply chain, from the farmer to the end user. in traffic, the pakistan story was rewritten and reduced down to a good cop vs bad cop plot.there was alot more meaningful discussion and debate about alcohol and other forms of drug, whereas in traffic they mostly became passing references of no significance. same with social issues, which in traffik, were conveyed realistically w/o sounding preachy. whereas in traffic, the characters jus t blurted it out as a statement like the way they do it in those made for tv "issue of the week" movies.there was no bad guy vs good guy in traffik, even the dealer is portrayed as a junkie that sells to support his habit instead of the "nobody messes with me" type of person in traffic.the only down part is that since i watched traffic not much before watching this, it was hard not to compare scene by scene, and even though the scenes were not the same, i knew what the outcome was going to be already. thank god for the pakistan story, which is different enough that it allowed me to enjoy it completely w/o thinking which scene it compares to. although i was thrown off thinking the drugs were fused into the ceramic of the statues in which helen brought back to germany (as in the storyline of traffic.) thank god traffik was not that hokey and far-fetched.

i enjoyed this programme immensely. it is exceptionally well written, with finely judged performances and clever visuals.it is also very frank and honest, refreshing compared to the sanitised representation of drug use in films and television.unmissable - one of the finest television shows of recent years, and triumph on all scales for channel 4.9/10

brilliant. ranks along with citizen kane, the matrix and godfathers. must see, at least for basset in her early days. watch it.

the best thing one can say about the film "traffic" is that it brought attention to the superior british mini-series "traffik". as many people have noted, the current film suffers from truncating the story to accommodate the short attention span of cinemagoers and the turn-around time of the theater owners, who measure a film's success by the overpriced food sales.i first recorded this mini series in 1990 when it was shown on public tv and have watched it many times. the whole documentary-style series has a strong element of tragedy and doom about it, as the characters are all moving toward their eventual fate. the strongest of the three tales is that of the pakistani family forced into the city to find a way to keep body and soul together after the poppy crop is burned by the army in a staged show of force put on for the benefit of western politicians. the hardships of the family are similar to that of the rickshaw pullers family in "city of joy". eventually the farmer finds work, but he compromises his pride and honesty.the pakistani segment of the film has a particular relevance to today, with the fight against the supporters of al quaeda, and gives some understanding of the support for such movements among the disadvantaged poor of pakistan and afghanistan who rarely receive any of the money going into those countries. the film makes a point that the farmers see barely 25% of the aid which is supposed to encourage them to grow other crops.with the american inability to see anything other than in terms of black and white - good guys v. bad guys - it is interesting to see another view where there is no black and white, only shades of grey. possible spoiler ahead. the only problem i had with the story was that rather than things continuing as they did before, as they would in real life, being a work of fiction they had to wrap it up with the "bad guys" getting what was coming to them. other than that, this was a fine piece of work of the kind we see all too rarely. the cast was outstanding and the german and pakistani locations helped give the film a "different" feel (what a change it made seeing germans as something other than the villains in a wwii film).

i remember seeing this in the early 90's on uk tv and was hooked. the international scope of the production is breathtaking and watching how the characters develop through the five hours it runs for is magnificent. the scenes set in pakistan and afghanistan are of particular interest, and as a viewer you get a real sense of a grounds-eye view of the culture and vibe of these countries during the closing stages of the cold war. the characters of fazal and helen develop really well throughout the series and rivals modern shows like the sopranos and six feet under in this area. in the uk, the vhs goes for about ¬£6 and the dvd about ¬£10 - a quality bargain. i thought soderbergh's version was great too - but clearly owes this masterpiece a huge debt.

traffik is a really well done 6 hour drama about drugs (circa 1987). it tells three stories, in parallel, about how opium is grown in north-east pakistan, how drugs are smuggled from pakistan into europe, and finally, how people addicted to drugs spiral out of control. all three stories are told realistically and with empathy. you see enough of the characters lives to understand how ordinary people can get sucked into a life that is really immoral.these aren't card-board cutouts, the opium grower is trying to feed his family in a dry area filled with guns and other opium growers. the drug smuggler is a rich german with no heart but his wife (one of the three main characters) is just an ordinary woman who has to choose between leading her life "the old way" or giving up. finally the main character, the government minister has the toughest role as he must deal with the emotional devastation caused by his own daughter. she slips into the world of drug addiction and starts stealing, suffering from ill-health, attacking her parents emotionally, all so she can continue to satisfy her craving for the drug (heroin) that is destroying her life.traffik is one of the best dramas i have ever seen on tv. the scenes in this show will remain with you for a long, long time. highly recommended. -- colin glassey

i had been very curious to see the original six-hour miniseries that steven soderbergh's latest movie was based on, and now that i have, i am happy to say that one is not better than the other. they are both intelligent, involving and extremely entertaining. the only real advantage that the miniseries has over the movie is that it is three and a half hours longer, so we get to know the characters more in depth.there isn't a false note to be had in this production, one that you should definitely make time for when pbs re-broadcasts this miniseries sometime in 2001. you won't regret it.

four stories about the drug trade in europe become intertwined over the course of this 6 part miniseries. in germany a businessman is arrested on drug smuggling charges, and his wife attempts to save her family by continuing her husband's illegal trade. meanwhile the british home secretary travels to pakistan to negotiate an aid package that he hopes will stop the drug flow from that country. even as he does this however his own daughter succumbs to heroin addiction, tearing their family apart. this is the miniseries on which the american film and miniseries were based. the original is far superior to its two decendants. the poverty and desperation of the third world are portrayed very well. it is stark, uncompromising and brutal.

i can only agree with many observers that traffik is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television. i saw traffik when it was on tv, and i have just watched it again. i am particularly moved by the haunting original music of tim souster, and especially by the dolorous strains of dmitri shostakovich's chamber symphony in c minor ( the music over the credits and in parts of the film). the music intensifies the desperation of the characters as they pursue their sad fate. the music is powerfully emotional. this arrangement combines two of the movements from the symphony, but i recommend listening to the symphony per se.

if you've not seen this then look out for it. it is available on dvd. it is a channel 4 (uk) production, possibly, in conjunction with german and danish tv. if you've seen the film it is basically the same plot. several interleaved stories are connected through the drugs trade. the story jumps between the housewife (played by the excellent lyndsay duncan) trying to complete a deal on behalf of her husband, who to her surprise is an international drugs dealer (and generally dangerous man).a minister, who is embedded in his job to the detriment of his family, is investigating the whole state of affairs with international drugs trafficking. he gets a few eye openers to the reality of heroin when his daughter turns out to have a 'problem'. he then visit pakistan, officially, where he seems to be taught that the abuse (not simply the drug or its casual use) is the problem and also gets to sample some produce (an excellent scene where he simultaneously realises what the attraction is and why it is and why it is such a problem). in pakistan we get to see the other side. the desperation of farmers who can barely survive turning to opium production and crime lords. the pointless attempts at subsidy resulting in the system getting rich. and a country so drenched in drugs yet only a relative fraction of the abuse we have in the west. around all this a customs official/interpol agent tries to catch the 'dutch' connection in heroin smuggling. seeking justice for his murdered partner. this really is a masterpiece. super, understated performances from all the main actors in a way only european cinema can really do.a must see. especially if you have seen the film, they compliment each other abd present some subtly different opinions/attitudes from both sides of the pond.

"traffik 1989" is an emmy award winning six part miniseries out of the uk which was the inspiration for the oscar winning "traffic 2000". the five hour film breaks down the opium/heroine trade for the viewer from the handcasting of poppy seeds in an afghanistan field to the "head rush" of a mainlining junkie in a flat in england. not only does "traffik" offer entertainment value through interleaved dramatic stories it also provides an overview of the international drug trade at all levels answering the who, where, how, and why questions of the age old and unstoppable narcotic supply/demand machine. synergistically entertaining and educational, "traffik" will prove to be time well spent for teens and up. (a)

beautifully constructed, "traffik" tells the story of narcotics usage and commerce from multiple points of view. from a policeman view, from a politician view, from an addict view, from a smuggler's view, and from a farmer's view. in a carefully contructed storyline, one gets the impression on how everything is inter-related. from beautiful on-location shots in the poppy fields in pakistan, to downtown karachi, to the entry points airports of frankfurt and london, to the delapidated buildings where the smuggling takes place, one sees the massive dimension of narcotics consumption.

it is hard to put the devastating beauty of traffik to words, partly because i am still grasping to comprehend it myself, several hours after my second viewing. first, it must be said that traffik contains some of the most incomparably and unforgettably haunting scenes i have seen in a film or television production. the acting is excellent, particularly that of bill paterson as a british minister grappling with his heroin-addicted daughter and an aid deal to pakistan that hinges on drug issues. another plot line describes these drug issues at a ground level in pakistan, and revolves around a struggling opium poppy farmer and his interaction with a successful heroin smuggler. the third main storyline involves the prosecution of a hamburg drug importer, and the conflicting efforts of his wife and two german detectives while he is under trial. it is a profound accomplishment that the interaction between these stories feels natural, transcending the forced plot entanglement often found in hollywood movies. it is an even greater accomplishment that a work spread over three countries and half a dozen main characters can be so focused and enthralling, without having to oversimplify. it is devastating--bleak and brutal but never apathetic. in short, traffik is a rare work of film that handles challenging subjects with unmatched compassion and clarity.

'traffik', despite its title, is not really about drugs. in the best tradition of crusading british tv drama, 'traffik' analyses and moralises about its ostensible subject, which is not some mythical scourge, but a matrix or process with identifiable social, economic and historical roots, causes and effects. there is something almost scientific in the way the film takes four sets of characters from spectacularly separate global and class backgrounds - a poppy grower forced into the pakistani underworld by poverty and a cynical government; the english, ex-olympic swimmer wife of a drugs baron on trial for trafficking; two shambling german policemen whose determination to convict the latter arises as much from class anger as any faith in the law; and a tory junior minister whose cambridge-student daughter has become an addict.'traffik' is unapologetically didactic - from the early scenes of jack lithgow in pakistan, investigating the government's success in eliminating drugs before sanctioning more british aid, we are bombarded with facts about the problem. but these 'facts' come from a variety of sources - dissembling government representatives; left-wing lawyers with vested (ideological and domestic) interest in the corruption; poor farmers who need to grow poppies to survive. facts, normally reassuring markers on a map, are clearly not enough - the more facts we get, the less controllable the situation seems. it is not until jack, the film's moral centre, the man who connects all the narrative threads, actually journeys into the heart of the drugs darkness, learns to shed his tory hypocrisy (deploring the use of drugs, but refusing to put any serious money into tackling the problem, and creating the conditions, through various free market initiatives, where drug-traffiking flourishes. just as the anti-heroes of the old warners' gangster films were actually model american capitalists, so the traffikers are the ideal being espoused by thatcher and reagan) that at least the reality of the problem can be acknowledges. like i say, 'traffik' isn't really about drugs. as jack finally recognises, after being sacked as a tory minister, drugs isn't really the problem. it's a society dismantled by a woman who said there was no longer any such thing (as proved by jack's non-existent family life), systematically depriving the vast majority of people of hope and happiness, increasing numbers of whom turn to drugs. what is most frightening about 'traffik' is not the graphic, numbing depictions of drug abuse (the technical detail of which ironically reflects the presentation of more 'legitimate', verbal factual information), but the dystopian vision of a britain stripped of any joy, beauty or community, a bleak wasteland of derelict tenements and soulless modernity, a society of defeatists ready for the thatcherite smugglers and barons to ply their trade. this isn't just a contemporary british story - it records the decline of an empire built on trade reduced to lawless drug traffiking. it is surely significant that the other sites in the programme are germany and pakistan, crucial agents in the empire's decline. here the old imperial amorality comes home to roost, the formerly enslaved victims, their bodies abused by their masters' power, returning to the imperial centre, london, the seeds of its decline literally carried in their bodies, embodying the fears of all those late 19th century gothic novels.'traffik' is one of the great achievements of british tv, and is in many ways superior to the recent hollywood remake. the political focus is obviously sharper - jack's decline is much more effective than wakefield's because he, as agent of government policy, as well as a bad father, is very much part of the problem, whereas the american's only real political flaw is complacency. in almost every case, characterisation is tighter and much more plausible (compare lindsay duncan's steely helen, already bitten by experience and failure, and her risibly superficial counterpart). unlike the dubious racial undercurrent of 'traffic' (making mexico dark and other; the ultimate wasp horror being sex with a black man), the portrait of pakistan is richly, tragically drawn, with disconcerting arguments about drug protection punctuated by scenes of gruesome violence. throughout, the inextricable linking of public and private is expert. visually, the film is remarkably inventive, without ever being flashy or 'cinematic' - especially in the last episode, where the buildings and decor seem to move as the system closes in. if 'traffik', like its remake, feels the need to shore fragments, then the prevailing sense of waste and loss is much more damning, jack's speech bitterly despairing.

saboteur is a 1942 film, partly aimed at getting american support for the war against nazi germany. propaganda or not, it's great entertainment. the leading actors are robert cummings and priscilla lane, although director alfred hitchcock wanted gary cooper, and barbara stanwyck in the roles, which would have given the movie more stature. this is a good movie anyway with robert cummings and priscilla lane bringing their own style to the characters. as in other hitchcock movies, we see the director's disregard for the socially suave and the well-heeled. he often portrayed spies and foreign agents as nice upper-class folk who at the same time sneered at democratic values and concepts such as guilty until proved innocent. these upper crust traitors are the last the police pursue or even suspect. hitchcock had a lifelong distrust of the police. he wanted to elevate the regular guy, the bungler and the fellow who doesn't take himself too seriously. one can see him wanting gary cooper as an icon in the frank capra mold. nevertheless, bob cummings puts his own stamp on the boy-next-door and works well in the role. priscilla lane, as the spunky female lead, comes off as the all-american girl who can handle herself quite nicely when put to the test. robert cummings, as defence plant worker barry kane, is framed for a bombing that kills his best friend. this leads to a cross-country chase scene reminiscent of other hitchcock heroes on the run. hitchcock repeats some of the well-established formulas from previous films - the reluctant female who is drawn into the action, e.g. madeleine carroll in the 39 steps, and risking his life to evade the authorities who are on his heels. we view scenes of america as kane tries to find the real culprit in the bombing he stands accused of. we see rivers, bridges, backwoods cabins, truckers, the hoover dam and finally, new york city. new york is a fitting backdrop for the climax as we go from rockefeller center to the ocean liners (with a cut to the ship normandy) and the grand finale on the statue of liberty. great movie with uninterrupted action. don't miss it.

barry kane is an aircraft factory worker.suddenly sabotage takes place at the factory and starts a fire.his best friend is killed.they accuse him of the deed but kane knows it was a man named fry who was there.he becomes a fugitive and goes to find this man named fry.he's helped by a kind blind man.he lets his niece, the billboard model patricia martin take the man to a local blacksmith to have his handcuffs removed.they don't end up there for the woman doesn't believe barry and wants to take him to the police.but soon he changes her mind about barry and they find out about another sabotage attempt that's going to take place soon.there's a group of anti-american fascists.and frank fry is a member of that group.saboteur (1942) is another example of the fact alfred hitchcock could not make a bad movie.robert cummings plays barry kane and he's really good at that.priscilla lane with her good looks plays pat martin.also really good.otto kruger makes a great main villain as the leader of the fascist group, charles tobin.norman lloyd, still alive at 94, plays fry and makes a very believable crook.vaughan glaser is the most sympathetic character as the blind man philip martin.the dance hall sequence is fantastic.and also the moments on the circus train.in the end we're at the statue of liberty.

the subject is banal, even in 1942. it is war propaganda. the fascists are among us and they are doing all they can to sabotage the war effort and to prepare their victory and their seizure of power then and their establishing an effective totalitarian state. but hitchcock has to make it a real thriller. so he invents a first sabotage that succeeds but one of the victims, the friend of the one who dies in it, becomes the prime suspect and run-away for the sabotage. that enables him to so-to-say visit the country and discover the tricky organization of the local nazis who have acquaintances and support in the top benevolent society and use the small little dissatisfied whites to do the dirty work. the chase after the real saboteur takes our young false suspect from los angeles to new york and to the top of the organization. he meets a blind pianist who believes his senses to know the chap is not guilty, his niece who is a star of the advertising billboard but also a frenetic and fanatic patriot who only thinks of going to the police. then the rich rancher and his nest of plotters. then, on the road some sympathetic and friendly truck driver, and the long caravan of a circus going around and their dwarf, bearded woman, siamese sisters, and a few other grotesques of that type. and he discovers the target in a soda city, an electric dam that provides los angeles and its war industry with the energy they need. he takes part as a gravel in the organization in the sabotage of a uss alaska military ship when it is launched. and finally with some inventiveness, creativity and elbow grease he and the pianist's niece manage to get the whole lot cleaned up, most of them arrested and the first saboteur, a certain fry, falls down from the torch of the statue of liberty. that one won't fry on the old electric sparking chair. but hitchcock is not yet in his habit of having a personal cameo appearance in his own films, so don't look for him. it's well built and well performed, but it is only a propaganda film with an extra style.dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines

excellent hitchcock thriller with robert cummings proving once again that he could really act up a storm.this time he is a defense plant worker caught up in a horrible plot when his best friend is killed at the plant.priscilla lane is the girl who suddenly becomes interested in cummings as the plot thickens and he is pursued from california to n.y.there is a diabolical plot by a group of wealthy 5th columnists to destroy from from within. hitchcock was known to play up the upper echelons of society involved in mayhem in his long career as a director.ironically, the film implodes at the very end. while we see what happens to the guy who killed cummings' friend, we don't see what happens to the rest of the gang, again, many of whom represent the upper crust of society.

from the opening drum hit of "we're gonna groove" to the last guitar hit of "whole lotta love", this two-dvd set might be one of the best music dvd's ever to hit the shelves since the beatles anthology was finally released earlier this year.one of the best things about this dvd is that on disc 1, a whole concert and many television appearances can be found. for instance, the whole royal albert hall concert is on the dvd, as well as some of the best performances from the band's last concert at knebworth.in the royal albert hall concert, for instance, the band had a lot of room to improvise. jimmy page's guitar solos make "dazed and confused" a huge rock power ballad as opposed to the laid-back blues song it was on led zeppelin i. next, on dvd 2, is a promotional video for the led zeppelin iii hit song "immigrant song". one of zeppelin's hardest rocking songs, the video is about as sketchy as a pre-mtv video was, but it displays a lot of guitar power by jimmy page, as it was taken from a live performance. after the video ends, we are treated, in transition, with a short picture of fans filling the seats at madison square garden. the following are performances that were supposed to be part of "the song remains the same", but did not make the cut. excellent riffs like those in the songs "black dog" and "the ocean" were both present.after the madison performances, we are treated with earl's court. most of the led zeppelin iv material was played here, like the most popular song that zeppelin ever recorded, "stairway to heaven". it is brilliant as always, even more so than the version on iv.finally, to end the 5+ hours of live material, is led zeppelin's final concert in knebworth in august of 1979. as the viewer watches this, they have to admit that robert plant's voice is getting throatier and deeper from all of the screaming he has done in the past, and it is evident here. on songs like "kashmir" and "in the evening", plant does not have his vocal boost of old, yet, on "whole lotta love", it returns for one more song.overall, one of the best musical dvd's ever released, only next to the great "beatles anthology" boxed set that was released earlier in 2003. the sound, both in 5.1 dts and 5.1 dolby digital, just like the beatles dvd, gives you a feeling of being on-stage with the performers, standing right next to them, as you would feel on the beatles dvd when they are jamming in the studio. even though the beatles and led zeppelin are different bands, though, they each received different dvd's. even though this set comes on only two discs compared to the five disc beatles set, it still feels very filling to the viewer after they have gone through all of that content. it is also a pleasure to watch again and again, not only because of the sound quality, but because of the sheer energy on stage when robert plant begins to sing.a brilliant effort from atlantic.

buy this if you like rock, led zep or just want an amazing experience. world class! i love this band, and the dvd was even better than i had hoped for, believe me, if you took the time to read this thread, you need this dvd. period.

after seeing this dvd, i was floored. it is so wonderful. not only does it capture led zeppelin during convented performances, they span a few years. this only shows the growth of the band, and the growth of their great music. this dvd is a must have! the dvd is over 5 hours long, with extras. the extras are also great pieces, some are of the band performing in denmark, and other various promo spots. this contains footage that was once thought lost, thankfully recovered, and carefully restored to 5.1 dolby digital, under direct supervision of jimmy page himself! includes many timeless classics, such as, stairway to heaven, going to california, what is and what should never be, moby dick, and so many more. great acoustic songs are also included. this will correct any forethought that jimmy page isn't a supreme guitar legend!

i am a professional musician who was inspired nearly 20 years ago to begin playing guitar after hearing jimmy page on led zeppelin ii. while i don't play in the same genre or style, the impact of that man has been huge. now, nearly 20 years later i finally got to see something more than the not-so-good the song remains the same. again, i have seen so many bands perform, some small - some the current 'masters.' no band, no where, no way has ever been able to pull off the magic that you can actually taste by watching this dvd. robert plant can be a bit much at times, and you can nearly sense page's annoyance for him forgetting lyrics, but that didn't matter i guess - especially for the era. bonham's genius shines more on this dvd then on any album with zeppelin, the band of joy or lord sutch. jpj is pretty ordinary - but the magic of this dvd is how well the four of them perform together. the world loved to imagine that they were into black magic(k) etc. - that was only a matter of interest to page. the magic (notice i say this a lot), is that this dvd captures a rare glance to the rawness of 4 young boys who can play brilliantly, no matter how sloppy they are actually playing. it didn't matter. a quick breakdown. the first of the two dvd's is where the true magic is. you should be able to sense the power and rawness zep had in their early days. by the end of the second dvd page is struggling with his sanity during the knebworth songs. (it's no secret that by this time he was severely addicted to heroin). so, i'd recommend the first disk to any music lover, and the second for the only true zeppelin fan.i may be going too far here for some guitarists, but i would say after watching this, page is certainly more creative and inventive than hendrix. yup, i said it. and if you disagree - watch the dvd.

what can i say about this band, i was hooked in 68, i was a ten year old kid, i grew up on the blues though my dad, then these guys from the midlands came along, a fusion of country rock, heavy rock and blues, i wish i could have got to see them live in the early years, i was lucky enough to be there in 79(knebworth) that was the best concert i've seen to date, i hope a full version of that hot august night will be realest soon. this cd gave me a chance to see the boys over and over again, the song remains the same is great but this cd gets down to the nitty gritty.long live the zepp.

this two disc set is incredible! if you're like me and never had the opportunity to actually see the band live, then this is the next best thing. jimmy page, who in my opinion is the second best guitarist ever to walk the face of the earth (second only to slowfingers himself), he puts on an amazing show in every piece of footage in this film. john paul jones, although not as up front as page, puts on one hell of a show. although in the live atmosphere, his rythmic bass lines aren't as defined as they are on studio recordings, except of course in songs like dazed and confused, or what is and what should never be), but his wide array of instumental talent is well displayed in these dvd's. john bonham is john bonham, what can i say? there is no comparison, his beats stand out like no other, and this dvd is proof. last, but not least, robert plant wails like no other can wail. if you've ever read hammer of the gods, you'll be wondering the same thing as page was when he first met robert plant, why the hell isn't this guy already famous? and so concludes my review, sorry about and spelling or grammar mistakes, zeppelin rocks.

the only footage of zeppelin i've seen prior to this dvd is 'the song remains the same' movie from 1976. we used to spend hours round a friends house watching this, but i never really liked it and hated the fantasy sequences....so what of this dvd? i didn't know it existed until browsing for the physical graffiti cd.....'when did this come out?' i thoughtfor some reason i thought that page wasn't a great live guitarist, but to say that watching this dvd has changed my opinion is a massive understatement. there's 'white summer' from 1970 - 10 minutes of guitar wizardry.there's an acoustic set from 1975 - 'bron-y-aur stomp' has a brilliant finger-picking improv section.the 'in my time of dying' and 'trampled underfoot' performances (also from '75) are breathtaking - with page and bonham tearing things to pieces like no one else ever has. demonic possessions of rawk!!the magic continues into the knebworth 1979 section. the rendition of 'achillies last stand', considering their various drug-addled states just beggars belief! a song of complex guitar overdubs, page arranged it in a way that lets him just 'punk it out' live - the effect is totally mesmerising. 'in the evening' - i never liked this on disc but it zings along here. 'sick again' - great piece of sleaze-rock. the footage from knebworth is very interesting, cutting between big screen, various rostrums and bootleg footage to great effect.plant is amazing throughout all the performances. page, despite being painfully thin, looks like a six-year old kid having the most fun of his life at the knebworth concert - and makes infectious viewing.one thing that puzzled me - the 'black dog' performance from 1973 sounds very 'camped up'!! robert plant always did love a little 'mince' and those jeans are absolutely ridiculous - and would warrant an arrest nowadays. all very different from the muscle-bound kick-a$$$ studio version.i love this dvd. it has reminded me how good zeppelin were and remain.

zeppelin is my favorite band, so when i heard that this double dvd was coming out, i was understandably excited. i'll just cut to the chase here, and say that if you are any kind of zeppelin fan, you must run out and buy this right away! it's absolutely spectacular! it blows 'the song remains the same' completely out of the water. why this material was never released before is beyond me. the footage presented here really shows zep at the peak of their game, which i never really felt that 'song' quite did. jimmy page is the best ever without a doubt, and these performances make jimi hendrix look like a chump! be on the lookout for the live jam 'white summer'... whew!viva jimmy page!viva led zeppelin!11 out of 10

just another showcase of led zeppelin at their finest and their absolute rocking best . every band member is at their best jimmy page and his bow and guitar jpj with his thunderous bass bozo pounding away and robert singing like theirs no tomorrow . i have to say when we get into the first song where gonna groove it is the beginning of something very special . this dvd follows zeppelin through their 11 year carree starting in 69 in the royal albert hall then madison square garden 73 followed by a much older and mature band in 75 at earls court and finally a different looking band at their last english show at knebworth in 79. this dvd is fantastic showcase of zeppelin and if your not a fan you will be after . n

i bought my first zep album in 1974 (at 17) and have been hooked ever since. this dvd has now taken pride of place in my music collection. it is not often that a band can boast 4 virtuosos in their lineup but here we can. each member made their own contribution to the band but on the stage together, the electricity they generated was bigger than the 4 individuals. this masterpiece covers the band's entire career from led zep 1 to coda and this is captured magnificently on this dvd as each concert shows how the band became bigger and bigger over the years. recently my copy disappeared, but i'm happy to say was found in my 17yo son's room as the new generation discover just how great these guys were. this is a must have for anyone who has an appreciation of rock music. long live led zeppelin.

this is my favourite kung fu movie. it has a very authentic flavour, seasoned by an eerie music score (of tradition chinese instruments, i think), and some wonderfully over-acted melodramatic moments contrasted by heavily affected comedy. indeed, while attempting to create their own "western" (i.e. cowboy film) genre, the chinese concocted a whole new animal, marked by kung fu fighting and its associated sound effects.the story of five fingers of death is simple, a story of revenge (for killing a loved one) and the pursuit of the main character to master the "iron-fist-technique" that will enable him to wreak holy vengeance on his enemies. there is even a love interest, though the awkward, polite kind (found in most chinese films of the period). the end result however is great and much more authentic than any bruce lee movie.

i saw five fingers at the drive-in in...what, 1973, '74? it was the the first kung-fu movie i'd ever seen and i was greatly entertained. i recently bought it on dvd and watched it again. i was greatly entertained the second time, too. i believe this is probably the one most kung-fu movies are modeled after. rival schools, different styles, revenge, "white hat" good guys and "black hat" bad guys. they even threw in the japanese (very bad guys) styles of karate and judo. i remember being amused by the dubbing dialog, along the lines of "hey you! you are a very bad guy!" and "they should not get away with this! i will have a go at this bad crowd!" this time it wasn't so distracting, i guess i'm used to it. if you have even the slightest appreciation of this genre, this is one you should see.

i consider myself a huge horror movie fan. one night i wanted to just rent some newer horror movies to make fun of. then, i rented milo. i was so surprised by this movie. it scared the hell outta me. that's not something i can say very often. usually halloween only scares me.two other friends watched it with me, and were left with a disturbed feeling. a good feeling, if you ask me, after watching a horror movie. if you are unaffected, then what's the point.this movie was original. it didn't follow the normal guidelines of a horror movie. that's why movies like valentine bombed for me.of course, many are left with unanswered questions, as most horror movies do. it is worth the rent though.

bobby and mikey are two little boys who move across the country with their divorced mother to start a new life. soon after the family settles in, their mom marries "the king" who ends up being an abusive stepfather, especially to bobby. so bobby decides that he will "fly away" from the abuse in his birthday present.this movie was difficult to watch, especially the abuse scenes. it was hard to watch an innocent, playful little boy become abused and turn into a sullen scared, and withdrawn young man. the acting is excellent.i cried throughout the last half of the movie. there were some funny scenes in it too like the monster brew and the dog that finds the pop bottles.i wouldn't suggest letting little kids watch it. it was a movie that was painful to watch and yet it really really flew away.

this is just my all time favorite movie. nothing special. it's just so incredibly detailed. makes me cry just thinking about it. geronimo bill is the nicest guy i can imagine. money is not important. bamboo spears are important. you don't need money to get what you need. if you need something it will just come to you. if people would realize that the world would be a much better place. whatever you do, don't do it for the money.

ever sense i was a kid i have loved this movie. i have always been a fan of joseph mazzello. the kid had pure talent in both this movie and jurassic park. i have been looking for the dvd or vhs to purchase at a store near me i cant seem to find it i hope it goes on dvd! well anyways great movie. if anyone knows where i can find this please contact me at wrp24@adelphia.net . also can anyone really explain what happened with bobby. was her real or was he fake and was he mikes imaginary friend and his escape? lol i'm clueless. my favorite part had to be definitely where they made the monster juice and spilled it all over the kitchen its funny but also a sad part as well because of what happens to bobby due to the mess.. i would've liked to see the boyfriends face because he played his part pretty good. i think the mother was a great actress i think her name is lorraine bracco or some sorta name like that.. well thats all please contact mewrp24

simply an amazing bittersweet movie that portrays a side of life often skipped over in feel good movies. i saw this as a child and came back to it very recently and fell in love again.as a child it sparked my interest purely for the building of a plane, as an adult it captured me in the dark world and a young mans escape from that world. the portrayal of the king was great, the camera style chosen with low shots and shots focusing on actions and hand movements was i thought well done, i personally can not recall anything quite done in that style and adds to the character and portrays him as a force almost not human (which may not be far from reality) it makes for interesting developments worth a watch any day

everything about this film is simply incredible. you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.i do feel it is important to note this tale is about child abuse. don't rent it for your kids thinking it is a fun, disney-esque film.

in reply to "state of confusion" the dogs injuries do seem to disappear rather abruptly, but that may have only been an error in continuity. but, as for the kids trying to build a plane out of junk, it's just a simple matter of imagination. these are two very young kids who have extremely active imaginations and they must rely on those imaginations to keep themselves from being exposed to the reality of the level of abuse that goes on in their home from their stepfather. as for the stepfather, it's very interesting that the director chose to no show his face. that makes him seem more monstrous. if you show his face, then that character becomes a person and not just this "monster" who is terrorizing the childhood of these two innocent children. by showing only the concequences of his abuse and not focusing scenes on the abuse itself, the children then become the main focus of the movie. this film has no loose ends, but runs just as a father's tale to his children would. it has embelleshments. this is a fine american classic.

this is not a 'real' james cagney vehicle since his screen time is unusually slim. frankie darro plays tough kid jimmy smith, the leader of a gang of street thugs that is sent to reform school with a few of his hoodlum friends. cagney plays patsy gargan, a gang leader himself, who is given a token position as a deputy commissioner. when he finds out first hand of the brutal treatment dished out at the reform school, he is compelled to make some major changes with the help of the reformatory nurse(madge evans). the mayor of hell is fast paced and is still entertaining after all these years. the cast is well rounded featuring: dudley digges, arthur bryon, 'farina' hoskins, g. pat collins and allen jenkins.

frankie darro was a wonderful child actor who excelled at playing pugnacious little toughs with gigantic chips on their shoulders. he appeared in a couple of top films of the early 30s - "the public enemy" (1931), a ground breaking crime drama and "wild boys of the road" (1933), a topical depression era movie about kids who ride the rails. he was essentially a younger version of james cagney. although short of height, his willingness to do his own stunts kept him employed in a series of programmers when the bigger studios had no more use for him."crime school" was supposed to be a remake of "the mayor of hell" but it had far more humour in it and featured the dead end kids and humphrey bogart as a very laid back deputy commisssioner. "the mayor of hell" is really a combination of "hell's house"/"crime school"/ "boy's town". even though cagney didn't make his appearance until around the 25th minute his impact (as usual) was immediate. he plays a hot headed gangster who is on the payroll of a political group run by the mob.jimmy smith (frankie darro) and his gang (including "farina" from "our gang") run a car washing racket but bite off more than they can chew when they rob a general store and push the owner through a plate glass window. they appear before the juvenile court and are sentenced to go to the state reformatory. it is painted in glowing terms - a model school where boys are given a chance to learn a trade. in reality, it is a hellish place run by a sadistic warden, mr. thompson (outstandingly played by dudley digges). the only compassionate person is dorothy griffith, the live-in nurse (played by madge evans)."patsy" gargan (james cagney) has been given the job as the new deputy commissioner, as a favour. on his arrival at the school he witnesses a failed escape attempt and after talking to dorothy, realises the school needs sweeping reforms. he is soon running the school and brings in a system of "self government" - rather along the lines of "boy's town". even though cagney doesn't have a lot to do, the picture is carried along to it's gripping climax by the energy of darro. after "patsy" is temporarily out of the picture (he accidentally shoots a mobster and has to leave the state), thompson returns and his brutal treatment, resulting in the death of a boy ("skinny") turn the rest of the boys into an angry mob. they burn down a barn and thompson falls to his death - "patsy" returning just in time to quieten the mob with some sobering talk.sure, all the boys seemed to get was a stiff talking to for their crimes but i do disagree with one of the reviewers - thompson was more than just a "meanie". his sadistic treatment resulted in a boy's death. there is a scene at the beginning where the boys are served some inedible slop - thompson orders ham and eggs and keeps piling the butter on his bread while talking to dorothy. allan jenkins plays "uncle" mike and sheila terry, although billed only as "a blonde" has one of the most memorable lines when she pouts and says "i thought there was going to be young boys here, where are they?"!!!highly recommended.

"the mayor of hell" has the feel of an early dead end kids film, but with a much harder edge and very few light spots, preceding the first appearance of the dead enders by four years. james cagney has a full screen opening credit, even though technically, the 'mayor' of the movie's title is actually portrayed by frankie darro, one of several boys sent to reform school during the opening scenes. darro's character is jimmy smith, a young tough who's befriended by 'patsy' gargan (cagney), and is elected to the position when gargan takes a chance at humanizing conditions at a state reformatory.warner brothers made a lot of these types of films, attempting to provide a conscience of sorts in an era that only too well knew about the effects of crime and poverty. this movie is quite gritty, with no apologies for ethnic stereotyping, as in the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a jewish kid gets to run a candy shop in the reform school. the rules at the reformatory are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut; step out of line and you answer personally to warden thompson (dudley digges).cagney's role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous, since even though he makes a serious effort to improve conditions inside the reformatory, on the outside he's still nominally in control of a criminal racket. the film's attempt to juggle this dichotomy falls short in my estimation, the finale attempts to wrap things up in a neat package as gargan awaits the outcome of a near fatal shooting of one of his henchmen. not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a film like this.warner brothers would sanitize some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake titled "crime school", featuring humphrey bogart in the cagney role, and billy halop in the frankie darro part. if you're partial to the dead end kids you'll probably like the latter film better, since it also offers familiar faces like leo gorcey, huntz hall, bobby jordan and gabriel dell. however the ending is somewhat muddied in that one too, with bogart's warden character involved in a cover up of a prison breakout. both films offer a romantic interest for the lead characters, in 'mayor', madge evans is a reform minded nurse that falls for cagney's character.curiously, a lot of james cagney's early films aren't commercially available, so you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for a screening on turner classics, or source the film from a private collector. personally, i can't get enough of this kind of stuff, and find intriguing points of interest in the films of all genres from the thirties and forties.
