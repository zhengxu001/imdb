i saw this film on september 1st, 2005 in indianapolis. i am one of the judges for the heartland film festival that screens films for their truly moving picture award. a truly moving picture "...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life." heartland gave that award to this film.this is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century. at that time, it was the game of upper class and rich "gentlemen", and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs. with this backdrop, this based-on-a-true-story unfolds with a young, working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world, harry vardon.and the story is inspirational. against all odds, francis ouimet (played by shia labeouf of "holes") gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the u.s. and great britain at the 1913 u.s. open. francis is ill-prepared, and has a child for a caddy. (the caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in.) but despite these handicaps, francis displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event.and, we learn a lot about the early years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the layout of the short holes, the manual scoreboard, the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths, the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways, and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain.this film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing. and with no big movie stars, the story is somehow more believable.this adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of "miracle" and "remember the titans."fyi - there is a truly moving pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years.

maybe i'm reading into this too much, but i wonder how much of a hand hongsheng had in developing the film. i mean, when a story is told casting the main character as himself, i would think he would be a heavy hand in writing, documenting, etc. and that would make it a little biased.but...his family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about hongsheng's life. i think the best view would have been told from hongsheng's family and friends' perspectives. they saw his transformation and weren't so messed up on drugs that they remember everything.as for hongsheng being full of himself, the consistencies of the jesus christ pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, he's obviously still alive as he was cast as himself) for his family's happiness. huh?the viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex. he lies on the grass coming down from (during?) a high by himself and with his father, he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window, he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all while outstretching his arms, his head cocked to the side.it's fabulous that he's off of drugs now, but he's no hero. he went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middle.this same device is used in ted demme's "blow" where the audience empathizes with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero.however, "quitting" ("zuotian") is a film that is recommended, mostly for its haunting soundtrack, superb acting, and landscapes. but, the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of jia hongsheng is actually a stage setting for a play. it makes the viewer feel as if hongsheng's life was merely a play told in many difficult parts.

i felt this film did have many good qualities. the cinematography was certainly different exposing the stage aspect of the set and story. the original characters as actors was certainly an achievement and i felt most played quite convincingly, of course they are playing themselves, but definitely unique. the cultural aspects may leave many disappointed as a familiarity with the chinese and oriental culture will answer a lot of questions regarding parent/child relationships and the stigma that goes with any drug use. i found the jia hongsheng story interesting. on a down note, the story is in beijing and some of the fashion and music reek of early 90s even though this was made in 2001, so it's really cheesy sometimes (the beatles crap, etc). whatever, not a top ten or twenty but if it's on the television, check it out.

this movie is amazing because the fact that the real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job it's like they're almost living the past over again. jia hongsheng plays himself an actor who quit everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and searching for the meaning of life while being angry at everyone especially the people who care for him most. there's moments in the movie that will make you wanna cry because the family especially the father did such a good job. however, this movie is not for everyone. many people who suffer from depression will understand hongsheng's problem and why he does the things he does for example keep himself shut in a dark room or go for walks or bike rides by himself. others might see the movie as boring because it's just so real that its almost like a documentary. overall this movie is great and hongsheng deserved an oscar for this movie so did his dad.

"quitting" may be as much about exiting a pre-ordained identity as about drug withdrawal. as a rural guy coming to beijing, class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents' acting success. troubles arise, however, when the new man is too new, when it demands too big a departure from family, history, nature, and personal identity. the ensuing splits, and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other. hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim.but what an exceptionally convincing particularity, honesty, and sensuousness director zhang yang, and his actors, bring to this journey. no clich√©s, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no requisite sex, romance or violence scenes, no requisite street language and, to boot, no assumed money to float character acts and whims. hongshen jia is in his mid-twenties. he's a talented actor, impressionable, vain, idealistic, and perhaps emotionally starved. the perfect recipe for his enablers. soon he's the "cool" actor, idolized by youth. "he was hot in the early nineties." "he always had to be the most fashionable." he needs extremes, and goes in for heavy metal, adopts earrings and a scarf. his acting means the arts, friends--and roles, but not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input. and his self-criticism, dulled by the immediacy of success, opens the doors to an irrational self-doubt, self-hatred-- "i didn't know how to act" "i felt like a phony"--and to readily available drugs to counter them. he says "i had to get high to do what director wanted." so, his shallow identity as an actor becomes, via drugs, an escape from identity. hongshen's disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual, intermittent--and doggedly his own. solitude, space, meditative thinking, speech refusal, replace therapy. the abstract is out. and a great deal of his change occurs outdoors---not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways, bridges, and high-rises of beijing. the physicality is almost romantic, but is not. the bike rides to ritan park, the long spontaneous walks, the drenching sun and rain, grassy picnics, the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific. he drifts in order to arrive, all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity. "i started to open up" he says of this period in retrospect. and the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancer's positioning (clumsy, graceful, humorous, telling) in a current circumstance. if mind or spirit is lacking, his legs can compel him to walk all night. central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles. to punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity, he smashes his videos and tv, and bangs his head till bloody against his "john lennon forever" poster. he has let down his iconic anti-establishment artist---but he's the only viable guide he knows. he even imagines himself as john's son (yoko ono), and adopts his "mother mary" as an intercessor in his "hour of darkness" and "time of trouble." (the wrenching, shaking pain in the park--hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals) "music is so much more real than acting" he says. and speaks of lennon's influence as "showing me a new way." in the mental institute, the life-saving apples (resistance, nourishment) reflect lennon's presence, as does hongshen's need to re-hang his hero's poster in his redecorated room.if lennon's influence is spiriting, hongshen's father's influence is grounding. although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drink), it is fegsen's differences from his son that underwrites his change. for the father is more secure in himself: he accepts that he's chinese, a peasant in a line of peasants, a rural theater director. and he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions. it's this recognizable identity that drives hongshen to treat him like a sounding board, sometimes with anger and rage, sometimes with humor (the blue jeans, beatles) and passivity. in his most crazed, and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar, and a fake, he exposes more of himself than his father: "all the acts i acted before were bullshit... life is bullshit." and to hongshen's emphatic "you are not my father," he softly replies, "why can't a peasant be your father?" under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother, sister, friends, inmates at the rehab inst., he makes some tangible connection to a real (not whole) self. as the long term drug effects recede, so does his old identity. indebtedness replaces pride, trust distrust. integrity banishes his black cloud. all his edges soften. "you are just a human being" he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap-down incurred for refusing medicine. back home, lard peasant soap is fine with him now. and his once "rare and true friendships" begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back-to-back fence scene with his musician buddy. hongshen says of this movie: "it's a good chance to think about my life." and i might add, become a new actor, one bound to art and life. like lennon, he has gained success without a loss of identity.

i loved this movie from beginning to end.i am a musician and i let drugs get in the way of my some of the things i used to love(skateboarding,drawing) but my friends were always there for me.music was like my rehab,life support,and my drug.it changed my life.i can totally relate to this movie and i wish there was more i could say.this movie left me speechless to be honest.i just saw it on the ifc channel.i usually hate having satellite but this was a perk of having satellite.the ifc channel shows some really great movies and without it i never would have found this movie.im not a big fan of the international films because i find that a lot of the don't do a very good job on translating lines.i mean the obvious language barrier leaves you to just believe thats what they are saying but its not that big of a deal i guess.i almost never got to see this amazing movie.good thing i stayed up for it instead of going to bed..well earlier than usual.lol.i hope you all enjoy the hell of this movie and love this movie just as much as i did.i wish i could type this all in caps but its again the rules i guess thats shouting but it would really show my excitement for the film.i give it three thumbs way up!this movie blew me away!

i first saw this movie on ifc. which is a great network by the way to see underground films. i watched this movie and was thinking it was going to be pure drama and a story line that doesn't hold water. but it really was a worth while watch. the main character is in such rough shape, and you hate to see him deny help, but no matter what you just can't hate him. his devotion to the beatles and john lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels. the atmosphere of the film is also great. at times, you feel like you can see what he sees, feel what he feels in some situations. this movie does not leave you wanting to know more, or disliking a loophole in the plot. there are no loopholes (in my opinion). i have always been a fan of foreign films, especially now with movies being made so poorly in america. i really enjoy the foreign settings because i feel it can take you on a trip, and sometimes understand a different culture. this movie did all those things to me and more. please watch this movie and if you're new to foreign films, this is a great start.

i must say, every time i see this movie, i am deeply touched, not only by the most painful four years of hongsheng's life, but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction. it is also true that getting addicted to anything, such as drugs, alcohol, or pornography, cannot only hurt you, but also hurt your most important people in the world: your family. since family is the #1 priority in the asian culture, it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves him/her. this is actually the first chinese movie that i actually enjoy, not for the fun of it, but the elements surrounding it (superb acting, touching story, great direction) make this movie worth watching. what stands out the most is that hongsheng and his family act out the story themselves instead of having some b-movie actor trying to imitate the real person. it shows the genuineness of the movie.

my wife is a mental health therapist and we watched it from beginning to end. i am the typical man and can not stand chick flicks, but this movie is unbelievable. if you want to see what it is like for someone who is going through these type of struggles, this is the movie for you. as i watched it i found myself feeling sorry for him and others like him. ***spoiler*** plus the fact that all the individuals in the movie including the people in the mental institution were the actual people in real life made it that more real.a must see for someone in the mental health profession!

i saw this film at the rotterdam international film festival 2002. this seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival, however, as it turned out, all the more interesting.the story, of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction, is based on actual facts. moreover, the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again, this time for the film, which is partly set up as a stage play. not only do they all happen to be good actors, jia hongsheng's parents are actors in real life as well, the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards jia are very effective.jia hongsheng is the actor of some chinese action films late eighties start nineties. later you can see him in great films such as frozen and suzhou river. in between these two career paths jia becomes a drug addict and looses all drive to act or even do anything productive, except for making somewhat futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso.i like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after withdrawal more than on the horror of drugs. we really feel the pain and struggle jia is in. at the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him.the film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern jia seems to be caught in, dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him. because there are personal 'interviews' with the characters we feel like we are getting to know jia not only through himself but through others as well.the film has a heavy feel, but scenes of jia cycling through bejing and partying with his friends lighten the tone. so does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film. the music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after. this is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and modern chinese film this is a strong recommendation.

"night of the hunted" stars french porn star brigitte lahaie.in fact,many of the cast members in this slow-moving production were porn actors at the time of its frantic filming.this film is certainly different than rollin's usual lesbian vampire flicks,but it's not as memorable as for example "lips of blood" or "fascination".lahaie plays an amnesiac hitchhiker who can't remember who she is or where she came from.most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex,where lahaie is being held by some kind of medical group that's treating a number of people with a similar condition.anyway,she escapes from the monolithic office tower where the affected people are held.on a highway outside of town,she meets a young man,who stops and picks her up."night of the hunted" offers plenty of nudity,unfortunately the pace is extremely slow.the atmosphere is horribly sad and the relationship between brigitte lahaie and another asylum inmate dominique journet is well-developed.still "night of the hunted" is too dull to be completely enjoyable.give it a look only if you are a fan of jean rollin's works.7 out of 10 and that's being kind.

even if you're a fan of jean rollin's idiosyncratic body of work, you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory. for once, there's not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight ! true to tradition, the budget proved way too tight to realize the director's vision entirely. yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema, dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity. jean-claude couty's atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and philippe br√©jean (a/k/a "gary sandeur") contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesn't resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcore.shot in and around a paris office block before and after working hours, the film was largely cast with porn regulars rollin was already quite familiar with from his "michel gentil" cash-gathering xxx efforts, most notably french f*ck film royalty brigitte lahaie in the demanding lead. playing elisabeth (rather well, i might add), she's picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by robert (vincent gard√®re), driving home at the end of a long work day. barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there, elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur, even forgetting robert's name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment. prior to making love, she rightfully describes herself as a virgin (further credit to brigitte's thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly, being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the '70s) because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his. because of this nifty bit of context, the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other "commercial" interludes rollin has had to include in other works to assure funding.when robert leaves for work, he's inevitably erased from elisabeth's feeble mind. a mysterious doctor (comedian bernard papineau effectively cast against type) and his menacing assistant solange (striking porn starlet rachel mhas) move in on her during her protector's absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from. here we get one of the movie's strongest scenes as she's re-introduced to her roommate catherine (the late cath√©rine greiner a/k/a hardcore performer "cathy stewart" in a quietly devastating turn), both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared "memories" for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate. that deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and catherine's unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup. it's also catherine who gets to voice the filmmaker's compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted them.several rather explicit - if not quite hardcore - sex scenes make up the movie's mid-section and french porn aficionados should recognize the likes of alain plumey (a/k/a "cyril val"), jacques gateau and elodie delage, along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess marilyn jess whose rape at the hands, mouth and member of plumey was only present in the film's rarely screened xxx version filles traquees. the pivotal part of v√©ronique, a girl elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with, is beautifully handled by the exquisite dominique journet - in her unforgettable debut - who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in franco zeffirelli's la traviata. the six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill, the quarantined "patients" ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell, unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace. the final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of chaplin's modern times as elisabeth, approaching complete meltdown by now, and a wounded robert stumble along the railroad bridge, clumsily clasping each other's outstretched hands.

i was surprised how much i enjoyed this. sure it is a bit slow moving in parts, but what else would one expect from rollin? also there is plenty of nudity, nothing wrong with that, particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous, brigitte lahaie. there are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead, bit more dodgey, perhaps, but most effective. there is also a sci-fi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end, but i wouldn't bother too much with that. no, here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still 'alive' without memory. my dvd sleeve mentions david cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films, there is some similarity here, particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space. as i have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller, it is a captivating, nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations, including a stunning railway setting at the end.

i went into "night of the hunted" not knowing what to expect at all. i was really impressed.it is essentially a mystery/thriller where this girl who can't remember anything gets 'rescued' by a guy who happens to be driving past. the two become fast friends and lovers and together, they try to figure out what is going on with her. through some vague flashbacks and grim memories, they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool.i really liked the setting of this one: a desolate, post-modern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings. very metropolitan. groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity.surprising it was made in 1980; seems somewhat ahead of it's time.8 out of 10, kids.

i have certainly not seen all of jean rollin's films, but they mostly seem to be bloody vampire naked women fests, which if you like that sort of thing is not bad, but this is a major departure and could almost be cronenberg minus the bio-mechanical nightmarish stuff. except it's in french with subtitles of course. a man driving on the road at night comes across a woman that is in her slippers and bathrobe and picks her up, while in the background yet another woman lingers, wearing nothing. as they drive along it's obvious that there is something not right about the woman, in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen. still though, that doesn't prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to paris & his apartment. the man leaves for work and some strangers show up at his place and take the woman away to this 'tower block', a huge apartment building referred to as the black tower, where others of her kind (for whom the 'no memory' things seems to be the least of their problems) are being held for some reason. time and events march by in the movie, which involve mostly trying to find what's going on and get out of the building for this woman, and she does manage to call robert, the guy that picked her up in the first place, to come rescue her. the revelation as to what's going on comes in the last few moments of the movie, which has a rather strange yet touching end to it. in avoiding what seemed to be his "typical" formula, rollin created, in this, what i feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film. i like this one a lot, check it out. 8 out of 10.

since this cartoon was made in the old days, felix talks using cartoon bubbles and the animation style is very crude when compared to today. however, compared to its contemporaries, it's a pretty good cartoon and still holds up well. that's because despite its age, the cartoon is very creative and funny.felix meets a guy whose shoe business is folding because he can't sell any shoes. well, felix needs money so he can go to hollywood, so he tells the guy at the shop he'll get every shoe sold. felix spreads chewing gum all over town and soon people are stuck and leave their shoes--rushing to buy new ones from the shoe store. in gratitude, the guy gives felix $500! however, felix's owner wants to take the money and go alone, so felix figures out a way to sneak along.once there, felix barges into a studio and makes a bit of a nuisance of himself. along the way, he meets cartoon versions of comics ben turpin and charlie chaplin. in the end, though, through luck, felix is discovered and offered a movie contract. hurray!

fun story of a regular guy with big dreams, this low budget film really hits home showing what it is like trying to become an acting success. great performances by lou myers and brian's neighbor, alex. i giggled alot and even cried a little.

i thought this was a really cute movie - inspiring (makes me want to try acting)- i love kelly ripa and it's nice that i can watch this in addition to all my children - i've already watched it 3 times! of course i also loved seeing joe barbara - especially since another world went off the air!

this movie was so heart warming. a true testament to an actors real life everyday ups and downs.it was truly a wonderful experience to share the passion of the actor on film and respect for what it must have taken off screen. this film is a reminder to everyone to go for there dreams!never give up!hurray for the stand -in!!!

a superman cartoona huge shipment of gold is being sent across country by train. using ultra-modern techniques, a sophisticated gang of hooded thieves try to waylay the gold. with intrepid reporter lois lane as the only passenger on board, it's superman to the rescue. but now that it's become a runaway train, can even he stop the billion dollar limited?this was another in the series of excellent cartoons max fleischer produced for paramount studio. they feature great animation and taut, fast-moving plots. meant to be shown in movie theaters, they are miles ahead of their saturday morning counterparts.

millions in gold is traveling by train to the us treasury. traveling along is lois lane to report on it. along the way the train is attacked by masked thieves. they detach the car with the armed guards in it and attack the remaining ones. this leads to a vicious fight between the remaining guards and the thieves. the thieves overpower them but then lois lane jumps in. she beats the thieves off the train (at one point using a gun) but the train starts to careen out of control. lois can't stop it and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold. good thing superman is on the way!fast, exciting, non-stop action. probably one of the best of all the cartoons. just great.

shameless screen entertainment is a relatively new and british (i think) dvd-label, specializing in smutty and excessively violent cult movies ¬ñ mostly italian ones - from the glorious eras when everything was possible, namely from the late 60's up until the mid-80's. the label's selection feels like a crossover between the oeuvres of "mondo macabro" and "no shame" (they probably even borrowed the name of the latter) and they already released some really rare sick italian puppies like "ratman", "my dear killer", "killer nun", "phantom of death" and "torso". "the frightened woman" was completely unknown to me, but since fellow reviewers from around here, whose opinions i hugely value, described it as one of the greatest and most mesmerizing psychedelic euro-sexploitation movies of its era, i didn't hesitate to pick it up. this is a very weird film and probably not suitable for about 99% of the average cinema-loving audiences. if you're part of that remaining 1%, however, you're in for a really unique treat. the style, atmosphere and content are similar to jess franco's "succubus" and massimo dallamano's "venus in furs", yet they're both widely considered as classics whereas "the frightened woman" is virtually unknown. it's all a matter of profiling and good marketing, i guess. the story revolves on a literally filthy rich doctor (he lives in a gigantic secluded mansion, owns multiple old-timer cars and has a very impressive collection of artsy relics including a life-size mannequin doll replica of himself) with a bizarre and slightly offbeat attitude towards women. he considers them a threat for the survival of the male race and thus spends his days kidnapping, humiliating and sexually abusing random he picks up from the street. dr. sayer then abducts the ambitious journalist maria with the intention to completely crush her female spirit, but he slowly falls for her. just he starts to believe in actual love, she strikes back with a vengeance. this really isn't for everyone, but if you can appreciate moody & sinisterly sexy ambiances, bizarre scenery toys and psychedelic touches that seem utterly implausible and surreal, you can consider this one a top recommendation. it's slow, stylishly sleazy and totally bonkers¬Ö shameless entertainment, all right!

dr. sayer(philippe leroy), a wealthy physician with psychological issues regarding the opposite sex, kidnaps an employee, maria(dagmar lassander), a free-thinking liberal woman who believes men must be the ones "fixed" instead of females. sayer retreats to his palatial estate, running maria through a humiliating series of mind games, threatening to molest and kill her. sayer's desire, it seems, is to dominate her body, mind and soul, making her his sexual slave, obeying his commands, adhering to his every wish and whim. after resistance, at first, maria slowly teeters towards his objective, but has plans of her own..she says she wishes to help sayer relinquish his sadistic behavior towards women, so that he could love and not feel such yearning desires to harm. it seems that sayer has her under his grip, agreeing to certain rather embarrassing scenarios(..such as lotioning his toes, "making love" to a blow-up doll which is a recreation of himself, often spending time topless, and even getting hosed down when she slaps him hard across the face bringing blood from his nose)which almost break her, but something happens as the troubled doctor slowly falls in love with maria..and through what appears to be a desperate attempt to end the madness, maria gains an upper hand, toying with sayer's lust for her body.more of a battle of wills, a kind of sexual warfare where it seems one is in charge when in fact the other truly has the upper hand. through a great deal of the film, sayer mistreats maria, forcing her(..it seems)to submit to his series of psychological games of a sexual nature. her attempts to escape fail because his home is such a well designed fortress..it's a typical european art deco kind of palace, fashioned and orchestrated by a man who has kept to this weekend retreat of his for quite a spell(..it features walls and doors opening at his command, with an area quarantined off for his "victims"). but, once maria seemingly downs a bottle of pills as a result of her anguish at his hands, the tables are turned and she has him where she wants him. he finds that he actually craves her and maria uses this to her advantage, playing hard to get when sayer wishes to embrace and ravage her(..and, i could understand his frustration because she has this allure that can drive a man crazy)i felt the film works, ultimately, as a war cry for women, their empowerment and uprising against men who have the notion that they should always have control, sexually and mentally. the "twist" finalizes this ideal. i couldn't swallow sayer's fate because of his rigorous cardiovascular activity and exercise regimen..we see how he develops his toned athletic figure, and how this regimen is part of the normal routine every weekend before the true mind games with his victim begin. if he is so well fit, and spends such time developing himself for the extracurricular activities which follow his regimen, how could he suffer the fate which follows his finalizing the deal with maria at the end when she stops resisting his advances? maria, he would later admit, is the first he's actually kidnapped; others from the past, call-girls, were paid for their services so that sayer could feel the power of dominating a woman, even if it's all a fictitious charade brought about by a deeply troubled individual with an inability to connect with the opposite sex. the spontaneous decision to do so, to take a leap from the norm, costs him more than he could ever know.all this psycho-sexual sub-text is rather fascinating to see unravel, but dagmar lassander, such a yummy sex kitten, was my reason for enjoying it so..without her, i couldn't have liked it as much because she's vital as a victim worth striving to obtain. perhaps the film's highlight, the delicious dance as lassander, clothed in gauze(!), unravels the wardrobe exposing her breasts to a jazzy score..it's the kind of sexually seductive moment that makes your mouth water and forehead sweat. dagmar lassander must've been a joy for fashion designers because she wears those clothes so well..she has this kind of cool, a sophistication and screen presence along with her beauty and seductive powers, dagmar transcends the part to create an iconic character which would define her career..even if the film isn't well known(..i found about through word of mouth). the provocative nature of the script and risqu√© subject matter might not appeal to certain crowds as it deals with sex(..and pain) in many different forms, the dialogue quite illustrative and elaborative. at times, i couldn't help but chuckle at sayer's comments towards an imprisoned maria, regarding how he enjoys making women suffer, and the thrill he gets at forcing them into a type of slavery(..in an attempt to make the words poetic, it all feels rather hokey). but, dagmar is the real reason to see it, and the film, to me, works at it's best as a fetish film, a possible male fantasy with this seemingly prim and proper idealist, captured and held against her will, forced into a precarious situation, her fate possibly at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist. her submission, and how she reacts towards his aggressive behavior with her(..there are times where she unfolds to a wavering desire to embrace him, unveiling a possible attraction towards him which, in itself, might startle some who watch it)are among the most fascinating highlights of this exploitation feature. my other favorite scene, besides the dance, is the piano concerto with sayer fondling maria as she plays a soothing melody.

if you need that instant buzz that only late 60s/early 70s euro sex movies can give off, then look no further for you have just stumbled across the mother lode ! subsequent tv director schivazappa's exercise in psychedelic porn (of the soft core variety) may not generally be considered as a classic of its kind but it knocks many better known titles from the likes of tinto brass, jess franco and joe d'amato for a loop. radley metzger sure was hip to this way before anyone else when he picked up this marvelously twisted little number for us distribution through his company audubon. gorgeous cinematography (favouring symmetrical compositions) may elicit cries of 'pretentiousness' from those who swear by shoddy skin flicks shot in someone's backyard. hey, as far as i'm concerned, it's their loss for this is one thrill ride of a movie with twists so, well, twisted that you may not even believe them after you have actually witnessed them on screen ! dagmar lassander (immortalized as the gone to seed landlady from lucio fulci's house by the cemetery) has never looked more exquisite than she does here, subtly portraying the innocent (?) researcher held hostage by mad medic philippe leroy (with all the art-house favorites to his name, you wonder whether he has the good humor to mention this one on his c.v.) as their initially violent 'relationship' turns to s&m-tinged love story. nothing is what it seems however in this sick and imaginative gem of a movie with several truly erotic moments achieved with surprisingly minimal nudity. i for one was completely baffled and enchanted by the way schivazappa chose to suggest oral sex during one scene (i'll let you find that one out for yourselves...) and lassander's gauze-clad boogie to an impossibly groovy 60s tune should have become iconic in a way similar to the image of sylvia kristel reclining in that wicker chair in her emmanuelle days. you may not know this film just yet, but trust me, once seen you'll never forget it !!!

it could not have come from a different country nor from a different time. this movie simply oozes psychedelia influenced late 60s italian cinema. so, pseudo serious and sexually free. sumptuous settings and dreamy music make this a visual and aural delight. plus we get the lovely dagmar lassander, surely at her very best looking. the kinky goings on make for a wild ride and if the romps amidst the mimosa towards the end seem overlong it is but another rather charming trait of the time. you were probably expected to split those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and it does of course herald a twist in the proceedings. it might have been better if philippe leroy didn't look quite so odd with his fraying red hair and twisted facial expression. he does well though and has many silent moments where dagmar is cavorting and he has to show a mixture of love and hate. not an ordinary narrative film by any means but for those who like that something different, this is certainly that.

i had a great time watching femina ridens a couple of mornings back, somewhat hungover. for most of the film its pretty much a two hander, showing the games and weird relationship of crazy doctor philipe leroy and stunning dagmar lassander. i'd seen her before in a couple of fulci films dying gruesome deaths, but here she is young hip and beautiful. the film is pretty predictable and certainly mild on the exploitation front, but entertaining throughout owing too its marvellous colourful kitsch feel. the set design, music, lighting and cinematography are all classic late sixties italian style, a surreal feast for the eyes and ears and though the general thread of the plot is not too difficult to foresee there are more than enough unusual events and memorably bizarre sights and sounds to keep things interesting throughout. both leads are pretty good, and it bears repeating that dagmar lassander is really, really fine. the music, by stelvo cipriani is gnarly too, perfectly suited to the images. director pierro schivazappa has come up with quite a cracker here, but its not perfect. though very alluring, there's little substance here and the exploitation elements are about as mild as can be. i guess this gives it a sort of charm and innocence but i can't help thinking that the subject matter could have done with more sleaze, more threat, that sorta thing, especially since its pretty simple to figure whats going to happen. this is i suspect a bit pointless for stronger exploitation fans and certainly not for people wanting sex or much nudity. its more of a light, fun pop art affair, lovable but insubstantial, like bubble bath. recommended mainly for those fond of the 60's, dagmar lassander, or sweet set designs.

as with footprints (1975), i became aware of this one purely by accident: it was mentioned in a review of the libertine (1969), which i researched when that film turned up on late-night italian tv, as being in a similar vein; incidentally, i missed out on that screening of the libertine (though i acquired it via the same channel later on) but did manage to watch the film by way of a rental of the english-dubbed r1 dvd during my sojourn in hollywood in late 2005/early 2006. actually, in view of the enthusiastic reviews for it, i was let down by the libertine ‚Äì being too light-hearted in nature for what was essentially a serious theme (the sado-masochistic relationship between a young couple)!; to be honest, for much of the time, i was afraid that the frightened woman would go the exact same route‚Ä¶but was subsequently amply redeemed by a wicked (if not exactly unpredictable) final twist.the film concerns the freethinking social attitudes and dazzling creative arts prevalent in this era: an eminent philanthropist (philippe leroy) invites a female journalist (dagmar lassander) at his fashionable home for the week-end; however, it transpires that he‚Äôs a misogynist who distrusts all members of the opposite sex and would rather dominate (or even kill) them! therefore, for the first half of the narrative, we see the heroine enduring pain and humiliation at leroy‚Äôs hands (including being forced to make love to a dummy in his own image!)‚Ä¶until the tables are subtly, but unsurprisingly, turned: she not only emancipates herself from his control, but teaches him that man and woman can co-exist harmoniously ‚Äì except that lassander‚Äôs following her own personal agenda as well!! the leads are perfectly cast, and the film itself often darkly comic for those in the mood; furthermore, it‚Äôs greatly abetted by a typically effervescent ‚Äúeuro-cult‚Äù score (from the ever-reliable stelvio cipriani) and the imaginative ‚Äì even outr√© ‚Äì look (the giant structure depicting the lower section of the female form, with a steel-trap where its sexual organ should be, seems to emanate from freud: incidentally, this prop figured prominently in stills i‚Äôd seen previously from the frightened woman‚Ä¶but it barely registers in the film proper!). other bizarre touches include the preposterous radio program ‚Äúsexual aberrations and the stars‚Äù, and an idyll at a castle belonging to leroy‚Äôs family complete with secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarfish manservant. one of the highlights, then, is easily lassander‚Äôs erotic dance virtually in the nude ‚Äì an episode which actually spearheads the ‚Äòhumanization‚Äô of leroy; eventually, the two characters have a ‚Äòshowdown‚Äô in the latter‚Äôs pool ‚Äì amusingly set to a spaghetti western-type theme! in the long run, for all its stylishness, the film emerges as inferior to the similar but much more extreme contemporaneous japanese masterpiece by yasuzo masumura blind beast (1969). finally, it‚Äôs worth noting that the frightened woman was distributed in the u.s. by film-maker radley metzger‚Äôs company audubon films; he would even employ its production designer (enrico sabbatini) for his own camille 2000 (1969)! to get to the edition i watched: apart from the usual shortcomings in the english-dubbing department, the presentation here was further marred by a rather washed-out appearance and brief instances of distracting extraneous noise on the soundtrack! by the way, there seems to be some confusion with respect to the film‚Äôs running-time: its length given on various sources ranges anywhere from 84 to 108 minutes ‚Äì all i can say, however, is that the copy i own ran for 87 minutes!

from today's point of view it is quite ridiculous to rate this film 18 (or x in the us). the film has a sexual, yet sublime erotic story to tell, but the pictures are rather innocent. throughout the movie you feel and see the spirit of the late 60s and early 70s in the fashion, the dialogues and the typical experimental cinematography and lighting. and this is exactly the part that makes it worth seeing.

one year after 'love thy neighbour' made its i.t.v. debut, it followed the route taken by 'on the buses' and 'steptoe & son' by graduating onto the big screen, in a picture made by hammer films. it opens with a stirring patriotic speech lauding the virtues of england's green and pleasant land, then cuts to a shot of eddie and bill walking up a street, arguing furiously. this escalates into a strange sequence of white and black neighbours vandalising their each other's homes. at least the original theme tune is retained ( even if it is sung by someone other than stuart gillies ).the local paper - 'the gazette' - is holding a contest to find the best neighbours, the winners landing a mediterranean cruise. barbie suggests to joan that they should enter. the thing is, can bill and eddie stay friends long enough to win it? that's the main part of the plot. the film is by and large episodic. one chunk is lifted directly from season 1, namely bill and eddie going to the club pretending to be on 'union business'. in reality they're going to see a stripper ( not meeting two girls ). another portion of the movie has bill, along with other black factory workers ( in the series he was the only one ), breaking a strike eddie has helped bring about by various ploys ( including being smuggled in through the gates in beer barrels ). while another ( seemingly inspired by powell and driver's 'for the love of ada' ) sees eddie's talkative mother ( the magnificent patricia hayes ) getting friendly with bill's father ( charles hyatt ).the climax to episode 1 season 1 reappears in an expanded form. bill once more puts on paint and a towel to terrify eddie, but his friends join him, and they dance round a drum containing a naked booth, so that they can pretend to cook and eat him. eddie then has to make his way home in the nude ( surprisingly, there is less nudity here than there was in episode 2 season 2 ).the film ends with the reynolds and the booths winning the 'love thy neighbour' contest, and taking the cruise together, but there's an unexpected twist involving joan's sex-mad brother cyril ( james beck - 'private walker' of 'dad's army' ), who is working as a steward.this is your typical '70's sitcom-into-movie, with all the faults usually prevalent in such films. the laughs are scattered about, and interest wanes after about half an hour. the cast is augmented by familiar faces such as melvyn hayes ( cast as 'terry', a character from episode 2 season 1, played on that occasion by leslie meadows ), bill fraser ( as the factory manager ), anna dawson, andria lawrence ( who seems to have been in every '70's british comedy film, mostly cast as nymphomaniacs ), and arthur english. the director, john robins, was also responsible for the 'man about the house' movie.funniest moment - while eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory, bill paints his face black. the first he knows of it is when the manager's secretary screams in terror. the tables have been turned!

this is a great comedy, highlighting what it was like to live next door to racist bigot. but also shows that both main characters are actually as bad as each other. based on the hit itv comedy, this is very politically incorrect. and its all the better for it, comedy after all is to entertain. the movies only real drawback is there isnt much of a plot. however the cast are as great as usual. jack smethurst and rudolph walker make one hell of a team, playing off each other in a oneupmanship kind of way.it's been many years since i saw this movie and last week was finally able to buy it on dvd. the fact that the movie still contains genuine laugh out loud moments, means that i can recommend this movie, just like i would of back in the 1970's.

a slick production which holds the interest from the very first scene where max is choosing a ring in a jeweller's shop. much of what follows reminds us of shakespeare's "a mid-summer night's dream" in which demetrius and lysander fall in love with each other's girl-friends. here max and lucien both prone to love at first sight get mixed up with lisa and alice, and alice complicates things when she calls herself lisa. on top of the merry mix-up, max is inclined to get involved in incidents which bring back memories of two years ago. and because max has a lot of these dreamy episodes we are subjected to one flashback after another,too many in my opinion because at first viewing of the film , i wasn't quite sure if i was in the present or the past.there is much running down corridors, stairways, through doorways, into elevators etc. i accept all that in a fast-paced film but do we have to have so many people colliding with each other? after four collisions it ceases to have any impact, if you'll excuse the pun. high marks for art design! the apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor, but i do ask myself how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in paris. saving a person intent on suicide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it is in this film too when max almost exits at the same time. however a kiss or two soon makes him feel better. if you can manage to find your way through all the flashbacks, you'll finally find yourself at the airport where max's devoted sister gives him a most affectionate kiss. it can be said it is she who resolves the complications of love, like puck in a "mid-summer night's dream".

a movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot. the film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actor's innermost feeling. max, who has lived in new york for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there, comes back to paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend. non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well. the three women max has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations. his fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see. she gives him also no love but only stability. true love also cannot be found in his relation with the ex-girlfriend. merely a fantasy for him to escape - many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems amenable. the one who really animates max's life in fact is her best friend. the equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because max has understand much more about his innermost feeling. the nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated. not equally ingenious as "pulp fiction" but things seem much more natural in "the apartment". max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to romane bohringer. the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful. a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing. 

this is easily my favourite film. a tragic romance intertwined with a complex mystery whose threads are all but invisible until they all unravel at the end in one fantastic rush. sheer brilliance.i'd love to see some more of gilles mimouni's work, but at least according to imdb, he hasn't made any other features. has the high quality of this work made producing another too daunting a task? has he moved (back) into some other sphere of creative endeavour? i certainly hope this won't be his final feature but i can't really blame him if he decides to stop with this gem as his only contribution to the world of feature films.

so here's a bit of background on how i came to see this movie. as you probably know, this is the original french film, that was then remade (quelle surprise) by hollywood as wicker park. well i avoided that movie like the plague when it was first released, simply because, a) i knew it had absolutely nothing to do with wicker park, and living in chicago, i didn't see why they called it that - it was filmed in fricking canada for a start! - b) i have a very hard time bothering with pointless remakes, done purely because hollywood thinks we're too bone idle to read a few subtitles (i am dreading the remake of infernal affairs by the way) and c) i can't stand josh hartnett, 'nuff said there. however, i came across wp on tv the other day, probably about half an hour in, and i have to say initially, it made no sense at all, until about half an hour from the end, when it started coming together. by the end, i was really surprised to find myself really into it, and then the ending just seemed so good - a perfect combination of story, passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices i've ever seen (heard??).since then i've heard a lot about the l'appartement vs. wicker park argument and looking at wp, i still say it has bugger all to do with chicago, but there seemed something about it that i liked, so when it was on again, i watched it again - unfortunately, still missing the first chunk (i've still yet to see it!), and i still thought it was pretty good. heck, even josh hartnett seemed good! but i was curious about l'appartement and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. so i waited and waited to catch l'appartement somewhere somehow. netflix let me down, so i ended up getting a copy from some website in ireland. and i've just watched it. it's really kind of weird, but a good weird. a classic french film. great acting, romane bohringer is an absolute gem - sorry, but she acts monica bellucci off the screen in every scene. vincent cassel was a weird choice for the lead but by the end he works. and i've seen jean-philippe ecoffey in a lot of movies and i just love him - the scene where alice dumps him in the restaurant and he just looks like someone's told him his puppy's been run over was excruciating! but, i can honestly say, having seen wp and pretty much expecting that to have been a scene for scene copy (as about 75% of the rest of the movie had been - maybe in a different order, but come on, the scene with the coffee in the glasses?? word for word!!), you can imagine my surprise when i watched the ending of l'appartement!! i can literally say i was blown away - hmm, a bit like poor old lucien was through the cafe window really! so, be prepared, if you've seen wicker park and you fancy taking a look at the original like i did, do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie, because you'll either be disappointed, or exhilarated at a piece of french movie history - a prime example of how you can watch a movie, think you're going to watch a pithy happy ending, and get whiplash from the total spin in the opposite direction right at the end. definitely catch this movie. oh and while you're at, maybe not too near the same time, but down the road, take a look at wicker park, it'll surprise you too.

gilles mamouni is playing with the audience with the story of max (vincent cassel) in search of his biggest lost love (monica bellucci) just before to get engaged to another woman. mamouni uses many flashbacks sequences without warning so the best way to know where we are in the story is to watch for the actor's haircut. oherwise it can get very confusing... still a strong film debut for mamouni, beautifully photographed by thierry arbogast (the 5th element, the messenger), and monica bellucci is a darling to watch ... i felt a little disappointed near the end so i gave it 9 out of 10.

i loved this. it starts out as a fairly normal, slightly ponderous french art movie and then all of a sudden, halfway through it's turned on it's head. this part is brilliant as you realise you have been watching 2 plots not one. sadly, the ending doesn't make much sense, which is a great shame. oh yes, and it's brilliantly filmed.

this is a wonderful thriller i watched many times and never can get enough of.it's all about the obsessive love 5 people have for eachother in paris, (un)lucky coincidences, false identities.the music makes it really gripping.there are hardly any flaws in the characters,just the end is not very credible,but a definite "must-see" still.

a very enjoyable french film. this film has many twists and turns in the plot and is superb. i have found that when i lend this dvd out to a friend it seems to do the rounds before getting back to me!! it is really all about a man making sure he finds the right girl to settle down with.

several years ago i saw this film, without subtitles, on television, and despite me not understanding a word of what the characters were saying i still got the general idea, and the mood of the film fascinated me no ends.at long last i saw it again a few weeks ago. my heart skipped when i saw the picture in the television guide, and for 8 days until the film was really shown i told everybody i knew to go and see it. the story reminded me a bit of alfred hitchcock's vertigo. a slow, brooding film about a guy who one day believes he sees the girlfriend that disappeared years before. what follows is a wild rollercoaster ride of flashbacks, changing perspectives and really inventive twists in the plot, and at the end of the film i was left breathless. i had definitely not got what i had expected (and i had actually already seen the film!). be prepared to be confused.9 out of 10

not all movies should have that predictable ending that we are all so use to, and it's great to see movies with really unusual twists. however with that said, i was really disappointed in l'apartment's ending. in my opinion the ending didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie and it basically destroyed the story that was being told.you spend the whole movie discovering everyone and their feelings but the events in the final 2 minutes of the movie would have impacted majorly on everyones character but the movie ends and leaves it all too wide open.overall though this movie was very well made, and unlike similar movies such as serendipity all the scenes were believable and didn't go over the top.

magnificent, original, beautiful movie. the acting is great, the settings en decors are superb (paris at its best- but then the real paris, not the famous settings) and the music will do also. a brilliant storie, very detailed, which i just very much love.the best french movie i've seen (and french cinema is very good)!

i think the film makes a subtile reference to rouge of kieslowski, as the whole atmosphere gives me a feeling of red. it seems to be that a lot of the backgrounds contain red, think of the tea-room f.e. i also think this is one of the greatest movies of the last years.

l'appartement is, i think, a very purposeful hitchcockian film. the plot was rife with symbolism (ie the white and red roses) and plot twists which wrapped themselves up neatly. the look was very parisian and pulled you closer to the story. i saw it in london and very much regret that it is not out on video in the states

an obsessive love story, where the characters have been extremely convincing. i think this film highlights the talent of professional actors. specially for vincent cassel who wouldn't (at the time it was filmed) be the first character you think of for such a role. and yes he did succeed to seduce the beautiful monica belluci, beyond the film, during this creation. i can only say, that this film should have been released at it is in the usa, instead of thinking of doing a remake. it is simply so french, almost perverted....and yet so true...this film should stay untouched...a director that should definitely get more projects as this kind of subject requires the right amount of ingredients to not make it a flop..

in this tense and character-driven romantic tragi-comedy, we are given an insight into the intertwining lives of four thirtysomething parisians. at the centre is vinz cassell's portrayal of max. a starry-eyed romeo, he falls head over heels for beautiful stranger lisa (bellucci). encouraged by his put-upon best friend lucien (√©coffey, in an understated but effective performance), he wins her heart and they live happily ever after... that is, until the scheming, neurotic and obsessive alice (the versatile romane bohringer) becomes very involved in the lives and loves of the other three.the rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological jumble, and the movie emerges as an intricate jigsaw, the eye-candy of picture-postcard paris at the heart of it all. the use of colour does not go unnoticed, particularly in lisa's spectacular apartment (presumably accounting for the film's title), where the reds and yellows provoke the fires of passion and lust.the audience can relate to max: he truly wears his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by irony and circumstance for it. in one memorable scene, our fated lovers (agonisingly separated by a 'choreographed' misunderstanding) narrowly miss out on the chance meeting that would surely reunite them. independent of one another, they travel to the same destination: her on the metro, him in a taxi, practically t√™te-√†-t√™te. yet fate seems to have it in for them, and the audience is captivatingly teased.the performances in this film are really what make l'appartement stand out. i still cannot understand why vincent cassell is not a big star outside france. he has presence and diversity in abundance. monica bellucci (cassell's real-life spouse at the time of writing) has recently found fame in the anglophone film industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - true, she is divinely beautiful, but behind that is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in classic 'leading-lady' style, which many british and american actresses dismiss in favour of the all-too-easy 'subtle' approach.all in all, watch this film! i doubt you'll be disappointed. it is gripping, satisfying, amusing, sad, lavish, and a lesson in artistic film-making.

...means "take up and read", which is precisely what i felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film.von ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of tobias wolff's 1995 new yorker article of the same name. the incredible performance by tom noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired. the nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle, clever, and make the film cinematically more dynamic. it's lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again.watch out for this young director...he's going places.

her excellency madam shabana azmi has worked in countless movies over life time. i think best is yet to come.fire is ok.but still good days are yet to come.hopefully, in water i will be able see her better.thanks and regards.ps: india doesn't have a director to make best use of her.

this movie embodies the soul of modern "elite" foodculture, even though the movie is 17 years old. the standing principle in the movie is: food is more than just nourishing matter. it is also a powerful symbol and a medium for culture itself. the main characters literally get drunk on the finest wine and food, become inspired by idealistic thoughts and culture, as they let go of their puritanism and passion-denying table manners. karen blixens shortstory makes use of the difference between north europe and south europe, to point out their inherently different approaches to food. as the strict and and rather dull scandinavians get infused with "eros" from south, the party gets going. so what are you waiting for? go watch it.....again!

for a moment, let's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie, even if it is a very important side of it, and let's look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story. two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation, caused by two selfish husbands. they have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope. if each one of these two women had been alone, imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept. they found each other and they fell in love. that this love was against all the social, religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant. they loved each other, found relief in each other, that was sufficient. the reaction of the individuals around them is but a small fact that they have to accept, suffer even, and then they can go on with their lives, their life. very nice.

set in bam margera's hometown of westchester pa, 'haggard' is a semi-true story about the life of ryan dunn and his buddies falcone and vallo.dunn has been dumped by his girlfriend of 2 years, glauren, who is now seeing a beer swilling, long haired metal head named 'hellboy' and this is driving dunn insane with jealousy.in a desperate attempt to find out the truth about what is going on between glauren and hellboy, dunn pays his friends vallo and falcone to break into her house and produce evidence of the affair, with somewhat disastrous results for all concerned! i found this movie very funny, maybe partly because i am a total jackass and cky fan, and it has to be said that a lot of the humour will probably be lost on those that do not have prior knowledge of margera insane brand of 'comedy'.the movie contains much that will be of interest to skaters, not least the cameo appearance of skateboarding legend, tony hawk as a police officer. there are also cameo's from bucky lasek, brandon novak, jason ellis, and bam's long suffering parents, april and phil.the dvd extra's include music video's from cky (featuring bam's brother jess on drums), and bam's favourite band, him (bam's character in the movie takes his name from him frontman ville vallo) there is also a documentary and a "too hot for jackass" skit.in summary, as i said before, this movie will mainly be of interest to skaters and jackass/cky fans, but i do feel that margera and co have made a great effort with 'haggard' and i for one, thoroughly enjoyed it.

i had been waiting to see this movie for so long and finally got to yesterday. in summary i'm glad i finally did. the humor is off the wall hilarious. the plot is so unbelievably believable that it has to have at least some truth for it . if anything stood out in this movie it is most definitely the coffee shop scene. i have been there every guy has . you get dumped. you find out that your ex has fooled around with some guy who you are sure is an asshole. now every time you see anything for the next few days you just get horrible thoughts of this placed in all the wrong areas . she is screwing everyone and everyone knows it. i could probably watch that man lick and finger his wallet all day long and look back at myself and laugh for having been there too .

the movie was fantastic. if your a fan of bams' cky videos, jackass, or his show viva la bam, you cant help but like it. i have a few friends who aren't fans that enjoyed it, and others who thought it wasn't that great. those who didn't like it were mostly female friends, they really didn't appreciate some of the crude humor, that personally i think made the movie so funny. i'm pretty sure the entire movie was filmed in bams home town, which includes a lot of his regularly visited locations. the cast of is made up of all his friends and cky buddies, and also includes some big name pro skateboarders too. the soundtrack is phenomenal, with music by him. in my opinion, haggard has it all. a great plot, characters you'll never see anywhere else. plenty of humor great music and a cast that was dedicated to the project.

as well as being a portrayal of a lesbian love story, fire is also a comic satire of middle-class (?) indian culture. i find this is a quality which is little appreciated about the movie. these two genres (i.e. deep meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire) usually mix together just as well as oil and water do, but mehta (somehow) manages to achieve the balance to near perfection. the servant jatin's behaviour, the family's treatment of him, the bedridden grandmother's constant inescapable presence, ashok's obsession with a swami's teachings: coming from a culture much like india's, these are things i can immediately identify as being typical. they have been crying out to be pointed out and ridiculed. while developing her primary subject matter, mehta manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully. in fact, much of the humour in the film which provides essential relief from the heavy subjects of taboo lesbian love and gender issues, stem from this satire of the seemingly ordinary. the film flows from the comic to the serious with great subtelty.all in all, brilliant use of symbolic devices (radha compared to sita of legend and coming out of fire unscathed and, therefore pure; the lifelong desire of the young radha to see the ocean finally achieved when she gains freedom). kudos to shabana azmi(radha), the lighting crew and deepa mehta; their very un-hollywood-like (and un-bollywood-like!) talents made this movie special. one criticism: the first scenes seemed rather disjointed to me in that they did not flow into each other very well.the verdict: 9 on 10. nothing less for a movie with scenes so burned on my mind.

marigold is by far the best "outsider's" take on bollywood i have ever seen. (i didn't grow up with bollywood, but i've seen a few hundred of them now.) i'd say it leaves gurinder chadha, mira nair, and even merchant and ivory (of bombay talkie) almost in the dust. willard carroll, the director, really loves bollywood, and he has the self-confidence to allow us to know it - there's humor, but no arch, ironic distancing, no "of course i don't really mean this" stuff. as jerry lee lewis would say, he "gets it," and so he can let us have it too - the joy of a bollywood movie experience, along with touches that are supplied by a westerner's stepping into the story-teller's role.it's a story about a caustic, bitchy, beautiful american b movie actress (she's only been in movies with numbers in their titles, like fatal attraction 3) who finds herself in a different bollywood movie from the one she went to india to be in (kama sutra 3 has folded its tents while she was en route, apparently because its producers are now in jail). salman khan, in real life a bollywood mega-mega star, is the dancing master of the delightful written-on-the-fly movie she has now been pulled into ("is this before or after i go blind?"), and through the sweetness of his mildly psychically gifted character, she learns more than how to find her inner ecstatic dancing ability.the strong beginning gives you both bollywood - a super-energetic troupe of dancers in front of the taj mahal (both funny an familiar to the western viewer, as well as providing the high-velocity musical thrill we love in a hindi movie), and salman on screen from the outset - no bollywood 20 minute wait for the hero. he has on an indian costume embellished with kit carson-style western movie fringe (all in white).ali larter's actress character is pleasing to the western viewer - she's blonde, which is "traditional" for a "white" person in a bollywood movie, and visually understandable casting - but she's a robust girl, not the ethereal kind of blondie we're usually presented with, and she's a more or less three-dimensional total bitch, carrying on profane and abusive cell-phone conversations with a boyfriend and agent in the us.we also have scenes of women who are having problems with each other going out to a bar to deal with them - the capacity for people not getting along to relate and have emotional conversations is traditional in hindi movies, but we seldom see much of any such thing going on between women (other than the discussion between mother and daughter about the daughter's choice of groom), let alone "strangers" - unrelated people - let alone bar-going. so the spirit is the same, the details are fresh, and i was completely delighted by this.i only saw it once, at a preview showing, attended by the director, a fine speaker and question-answerer - he and salman got to be "brother-like" good friends over the making of it, he loves india, he has plans to make a wizard of oz movie in india. i can't get too detailed about songs when i've seen them just once, except to say i liked them all. they range from a happy parody of the bollywood number in the movie-within-the-movie - the ladies' costumes, with leghorn hats and seashell-cased bodices (it's a beach scene) on flowy dresses - are worth the cost of a ticket alone -- to a lovely reflective many-scened romantic song in a sadder and more serious part of the movie.mix of hindi and english in the music, and it works.salman khan gets a lot of credit from me for openness to unusual projects - this and jaan-e-mann - and good judgment about which ones to be in. carroll said he was full of suggestions and ideas all along the way, and totally fine (i.e. not narcissistic at all) whether carroll accepted or rejected them - clearly just a pro who loves being involved and collaborating.

it's a unique film, as it gives us our only chance to see the young noel coward in all his ironic glory. because he seems so reserved & detached he's perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter-of-factly uses all those around him. however in the deadly serious (no pun intended) last act, when coward must make like the flying dutchman, he's much less comfortable.but his way with an epigram is peerless, and hecht & macarthur have given him some gems (macarthur, really -- he was the wit of the pair).the film is superbly lighted by the great lee garmes, but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence. hecht and macarthutr cared about one thing -- getting their dialogue on screen. (note: h&m themselves have blink-and-you'll-miss-'em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene).the most notable supporting player is the one and only alexander woolcott, notorious broadway columnist and close friend of both macarthur and coward, who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher coward.curious that woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary algonquin round table, of which he was a founder, and macarthur something of an auxiliary member.the scoundrel actually won an oscar for best story, though that victory is probably due more to coward's imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot. it's coward, woolcott, and the dialogue you remember...

i saw this film over 20 years ago and still remember how much i loved it. it really touched me, and i thoroughly enjoyed noel coward's work in it. highly recommended: atmospheric and touching.i think of this film from time to time, and am disappointed it hasn't enjoyed as much of a revival as many classic films. hadn't realized til i searched for it today that it won an academy award for best original story for ben hecht and charles macarthur.basically it involves a nasty character who destroys another's career and is cursed because of it. he dies, but is allowed redemption if he can convince someone to shed a tear over him. the bulk of the movies shows him in pursuit of this goal. well written and lovely. i had known him for his plays so i was surprised to see him in this role on tv late one night in new york. a must see if you ever have the opportunity.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** it's easy to see why the script for this film won an oscar. at least during the first half. my head was spinning from all of the snappy lines whizzing by. noel coward plays a new york publisher (`why don't you publish books that you like?' - `what? and corrupt the public?') who charms and manipulates his many hangers-on. then he dies in a plane crash and the story turns into a bizarre flying dutchman take-off in which coward must find someone who truly mourns him before his soul can rest in peace. very enjoyable until it gets bizarre. viewed at cinefest in syracuse in march 2003.

noel coward is perfectly cast as a suave, vain, selfish well educated, upper class publisher. the literary crowd that congregates at his office is equally lacking in depth and seems concerned only with their status and success. they constantly meet at noel coward's publishing office in the hope of gaining favor for their next book and to make sure they are not left out on the latest gossip in the artistic realm.cora is a young idealist and poet who believes her love can change noel coward and that they can establish a long lasting relationship. she ends her relationship with her fianc√© to become noel's lover. however noel returns to his playboy ways after 6 months and ends the relationship. this breaks cora's heart and she eventually returns to her fianc√© who has since lost his job and self respect after losing cora.the story picks up when noel coward leaves new york city by plane chasing after a new lover, a concert pianist who is just as shallow as he is. however a storm is encountered and the plane crashes into the sea killing noel. god takes pity on him and grants him one month on earth to find someone who will cry for him, otherwise he is condemned to wander the earth, never to find rest, for all eternity.the climax takes place on a dim, rainy night and ends with a prayer and a miracle. a strange redemption occurs. the death experience teaches noel the true values of life, although his former associate artists are incapable of understanding his message.the film has beautiful music and the scenes are classic film noir. unfortunately it is not on dvd or vhs. for those who enjoy this type of movie it is a classic masterpiece. noel coward's dialog is sharp and witty and no one could play the part better.

"the piano teacher" is all about huppert's character; a middle-aged classical piano instructor with a stoic facade behind which lurks a powerfully compelling aberrant personality. unsatisfying as a story but intriguing as a character study, the film follows the huppert character through the term of her anguished relationship with a pupil delivering superb performances in the process. not for everyone, "the piano teacher" will play best with those into foreign films and character-driven dramas dealing with dark issues. (a-)

this film is utterly amazing. from the performances of huppert, girardot, and magimel, to haneke's screenplay and direction there is not a single misstep. the film may put some people off with it's hard sexual subject matter and with it's slower pace, but it really is a masterful piece of cinema... so do not let it's challenging ways keep you away!powerful, and deserving every award it won in cannes!

be prepared for the trip to haneke's "la pianiste"...the psychological sickness of the main character, wonderfully played by huppert, goes beyond any limit you could expect. the most stunning part of it is that you start feeling compassion for the character erika. trash-sexuality (no nudes scenes though), perversion, masochism, incestuous relations...haneke gives us a crude meal, heavy to digest; sometimes, the only way you can escape the extremism of some scenes is to start laughing at it. the "mise en sc√®ne" is maybe not the most appealing part of the movie, it has obvious austro-germanic, sometimes scandinavian notes : static, long scenes, but never boring. the vienna settings, the french language used, make the whole look like a european blend. the permanent germanic music background (schubert) is beautifully chosen. above all, both of the cannes awards for best actors are well deserved: one of the greatest performance of the year by one of the greatest french actress ever.

some users are confused about the identity of the armed men walking down the steps in the "odessa staircase" sequence. these men are not cossacks but regular army troops.the cossacks arrive at the scene a little later and they are the men on horses slashing at the crowd with their sabers.to experts on russian history: correct me on this if i'm wrong.but there are a couple of lines in the movie that apparently no one has commented on. after the takeover of the potemkin, someone in the crowd on shore says, "kill the jews!" this is on screen for only a couple of seconds but it is there.how cruelly typical of history, not just in russia but in so many other countries, to immediately, unthinkingly and instinctively blame jews for any domestic trouble!perhaps other parts of the movie are not historically factual but the outcry against the jews is all too real. comments, anyone?also, why can't speakers of english learn to pronounce the name as "potyomkin" instead of as "potemkin"? there's a need in russian to distinguish the two possible pronunciations of "e": as either "ye" or as "yo." sometimes two dots are used to distinguish these two pronunciations but usually the difference simply has to be memorized.

i just finished watching this film. for me, the most outstanding work in this film was the music score. while many silent film scores work very well with their scenes, i feel that this is the best score i've come across. the mutiny scenes in particular worked extremely well.

this is one of the best films i've seen from the silent era (sad to say, i've yet to see too many with the exception of chaplin/keaton stuff). very visually brilliant, with insanely influential style in editing and composition. really unique (especially for its time) camera angles and extremely hectic editing. definitely a must see for the film nerd.the downside is that it is a bit too in your face about its politics (i have no problem with politics in film, as long as they are subtle or at least somewhat ignorable as a backseat to the story). also, it's not an "entertainment" film, which is fine, but it's not something i'm going to watch a billion times. this is art, plain and simple, like it or not.worth an a+ for influence alone, but based on personal enjoyment, i give it an a-.

i had before a feeling of mislike for all russian films. but, after seeing this film i haven¬¥t. this is a unique masterpiece made by the best director ever lived in the ussr. he knows the art of film making, and can use it very well. if you find this movie: buy or copy it!

in this film, the astronauts sent to explore a newly-discovered planet must deal with several dilemmas, and they do so intelligently. the film approaches it's main plot theme in a unique way, and unfolds it gradually, though it can be guessed beforehand.the acting is very good, though sometimes stiff, as some late-60s acting can be. it can also be somewhat wordy and even melodramatic, especially after the plot theme reveals itself. visually, it has a scene that resembles one in the previous year's "2001: a space odyssey", and that tends to date the movie. some of the actors went on to star in the 1970 tv show "ufo," which is delightfully campy and worth checking out on dvd.despite these small points, the space flight itself is realistic, and considering this was 1969, the scenes inside the cockpit of the spacecraft also had a realistic look. (look for some 1990s/2000s video technology in use, too!) one thing: i suspect a love scene has been cut, but i can't prove it! it would have been a distraction anyway.unlike most sci-fi films, this film will make you think about the plot, and that's well worth a look. i'm pleased to have this film in my video library.

this is the question that astronauts roy thinnes and ian hendry ask themselves when they discover a parallel world of earth always hidden on the far side of the sun in this 1969 cult science fiction melodrama, released here in america as journey to the far side of the sun. the plot of the film was devised by british writers gerry and sylvia anderson, the creators of such tv shows as "ufo", "the thunderbirds" and "space 1999". it is exceedingly weird at times, betraying the influence of "the twilight zone" and even stanley kubrick's classic 2001: a space odyssey. the visual effects work of derek meddings, who would also later work on superman: the movie, holds up surprisingly well under the last three decades of special effects advancements; and while they are not really on the same exalted level of the kubrick film, they are very superb. if you don't anticipate a star wars-type of a film and can overcome the occasionally trite dialogue, doppelganger is a good film; it was good enough for me to rank it a '7' and consider it an undiscovered sci-fi gem.

i had never seen this movie before it aired on a local cable sci-fi network. it reminded me of the irwin allen tv series of the late 60's (time tunnel etc). excellent effects (they beat star trek 5 done 20 years later, but then that wasn't very hard to accomplish).i found the script very intriguing and mature for this type of production. they would have needed a few touch ups to tie some loose ends on the characters' level, but for a kid movie its surprisingly interesting (especially the the glimpse at futuristic euro- politics, surprisingly similar to today's european union!)the plot is indeed reminiscent of twilight zone in general (as other users have pointed), but in this case it's a compliment.great sets, by the way!7/10

this movie is surprisingly good. the ninja fighting sequences were unbelievable. i haven't see all sho kosugi's films but this is probably the best of those i've seen. probably the most impressive fighting sequence was at the beginning when ninja killed about 20 people, that was one of the most impressive ninja fighting sequences i've ever seen. another good fighting sequence was at a cops funeral where the ninja provide more people to bury. the last fight was also very impressive. also i kinda liked the soundtrack of this movie. the story was good enough for a ninja-movie, actually it was kinda different from other ninja-movies. so if you are a fan of ninja-movies, you'll probably like this one.

this is probably the only female ninja movie ever made. it's great as a b film and the action sequences are a lot of fun to watch. this movie is just so deliciously 80's. you'll never see another film like it. check it out for some 80's retro fun.

for many and many years, gaijin have visited japan for learning martial arts, instead of acquiring any knowledge on it, gainjin have been told only nihonjin could achieve the excelent performance required to show some techniques in a "public" performance such as a movie...this one special movie, made by sho kosugi, not only shows all of those techniques and skills, but also teaches many and many lessons on how to achieve them, and one can verify that by seeing a lucinda dickey performing fantastic and unforgettable acting skills in ninjutsu...i strongly recommend watching this movie more than thrice, because three times is not enough to seek out hints and tips given so easily by sho kosugi to those who really seek knowledge itself, the gnosis...

wow. i've never seen nor heard of this film. it just came on tv (2:00 am) and i am in complete awe. setup: a bunch of rich fat cats are out golfing. one knocks a ball into the rough. it lands by a ninja!!!! a tuxedoed man walks over to pick the ball up. the ninja grabs it. crushes it in his hand. man pulls gun. ninja pulls blowgun. ninja blows dart into gun barrel. gun explodes!!!! this is just the beginning of the greatness, people. everyone must see this movie. 10 big ol fat stars from trusty.

there are few movies that have the massive amount of non stop ninja action as ninja iii: the domination. this is a story of love, redemption and revenge, however, this is mainly a story about flipping out and killing people for no reason at all. if you've been searching for a movie where a ninja goes absolutely nuts and takes all kinds of people to their graves just because he's a ninja and he can do it, this is the movie for you. i can't think of any movies to compare this to, because no movie is this awesome. wait, oh, have you ever seen the thing with two heads? there is a part in that where the titular thing is riding around on a motorcycle and about a million cop cars are chasing it/them around, but they keep crashing and what not because you can't catch the thing with two heads!!! well, that is kind of what ninja iii is like. i highly recommend this film especially if you like the following things: ninjas, swords, lucinda dickie from breakin' and breakin' 2: electric boogaloo, video games about being a bouncer in a bar, ambiguous and underdeveloped love stories or "good" ninjas.

this is an action packed film that makes me feel very peaceful and relaxed every time i see it. the film (short of its conclusion) demonstrates that in the face of extreme odds, it is still possible to prevail.this film is very refreshing, and likely to be banned at any moment. get a copy of it before the thought police burn every copy they can find. they don't want you to have hope for the future, or to think you have a chance.on the other hand, should political correctness fail to supress it, this would be an excellent movie to release on dvd. such a release could contain interviews with the writer and director, and related goodies. i'm sure it would sell some copies, and i would be one of the first to buy it.- mincka

excellent plot line makes this movie one of the classic, cult ninja flicks of all time. the plot being that this woman's soul is possessed by an evil ninja spirit. i mean to be honest if i could obtain ninja ability through possession i would. furthermore, for being in the 80's and such the fact that the ninja aspect was far greater in this particular decade is evident and despite all that, ninja 3 the domination manages to keep it original from the american ninja cookie cutter molds that plagued the 80's for so long. this chick is definitely michael dudikoff on steroids.... i mean the first american ninja was great but let's get real folks it has nothing on ninja 3

after seeing this movie, i have no choice but to write a review in the hopes that there are others like me out there who were blown away by the rocket fueled ninja action and white hot sexual titillation that is ninja iii: the domination.we all know that sho kosugi rocks. that is a given, but how about jordan bennett's ultra macho interpretation of his character police officer "billy secord"? bravo mr. bennett, bravo. you prove early on, while trying to seduce the buxom christie (played to perfection by one miss lucinda dickey of breakin' fame)that you are not afraid to take chances on your craft. i particularly enjoyed how you do not feel the need to step in and attempt to help her as 4 thugs try to rape her outside her gym. oh you could have helped sure, but by standing there and watching you let her know who was boss. secord will wear the pants in this relationship. i also enjoyed how mr. bennett was not afraid to repeatedly take off his shirt or wear the wife-beater tank top despite his gorilla like shoulders and back. back and shoulder hair are hot and secord knows it. and how about lucinda dickey? all i can say is "kaboom" - i see a sex bomb getting ready to explode. she's got all the right moves as both a temptress and a martial arts whiz. the chemistry behind dickey and bennett is what makes this movie tick. you'd think she would hate him because he's kind of a cheesy jerk, but no my friends. the animal magnetism is too strong to resist, and they bond like crazy glue. sho kasugi is not as prominent as you might think, though still a main character, which is fine by me because all i wanted was more bennett and dickey. he does seem to wear a lot of eye makeup which was nice to see. the special effects? wow. that is all i can say. i will not give away the ending but let's just say it will not disappoint. i love ninja iii: the domination, and can only hope that there is a ninja 4. i give it a 5 out of 5 throwing stars. disappoint.

this film is the greatest ninja film ever made in my opinion and if you haven't seen it then its worth watching. i would rate this film a 10/10 if you want to see more then check out http://uk.geocities.com/ninja3thedomination the opening sequence where the evil ninja is killing everyone in his way is excellent his character is the best. he then has to possesses ayoung woman who finds him dying. she then has to take revenge on the cops that killed him which means there's more killing and action. but only a ninja can destroy a ninja so she and her boyfriend who is also one of her targets enlist the help of yamad(sho kosugi) to release the evil ninjas spirit and destroy him.

i've always been fascinated by ninjistsu, who would know that it will go further than beyond. in "ninja iii", it's fun creepy and intriguing. a ninja gets shot up by the police, and uses his spirit for revenge. the victim, a lovely young woman named christie(lucinda dickey). she falls for the cop who was involved in the shooting. the love scene where she pours the v8 on her body knocked me out! the ninja's death gets the attention of another in japan named yamada(sho kosugi) he comes to america not only to save christie, but to put the ninja back to the grave. simply because he put out yamada's left eye with a shuriken(throwing star). the fight scenes were excellent. i liked the part when the plywood falls on yamada, and he splits it with his foot. and when he was caught, he tells the officer christie was involved with that everything will be fine. rule of thumb: never under estimate a ninja. he took out the other cops without killing them. and he did his thing without worry. of course, chirstie did her best trying to put the ninja in his place for using her a tool for revenge. it was a good movie, great for martial arts buffs. 3 out of 5 stars!

this is a pretty silly film, including what may well be the least erotic come-on ever to make it to the big screen (the heroine pours v-8 all over herself and invites the hero to lick it off -- yuck!). and yet it also features the resplendent lucinda dickey in what is far and away her most erotic performance. in those long ago days, women -- even action heroines -- with real muscles were a rarity, and i can still remember the way my jaw dropped when dickey took off her shirt, revealing the most powerfully built female back and biceps i'd ever seen. dickey's beauty and vitality carry the film: she could have been a female schwarzenegger if anybody had had the vision to promote her.

easily one of the best indian films ever. granted, that's not saying much(i made this conclusion after a whopping 15 minutes of watching). but i can truly say that fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant films i've seen.beautiful because of its imagery. the best example i can give is the parallelism between the 2 female leads(radha and sita) and the characters of the same name in hindu mythology. sita, for example, is the wife of the revered lord ram. as legend goes, ram subjugates his wife by making her walk through a fire to prove her `purity.' sita, in response, cries and leaves him, reuniting with her mother(the earth). this story has all sort of crazy links to the stories of the 2 indian women(nandita das and shabana azmi). the word `fire' all of a sudden has many meanings - marriage, tradition, religion, motherhood, and probably a few others i didn't catch.brilliant because of its social overtones. many who were offended by the premise for this movie should in fact be first to see fire(e.g. my mom, who actually loved it). why? because although fire is an attack on tradition, it is also an attack on tradition. in other words, that is its strength, not its weakness. traditional conservative social mores(whether indian or canadian or american or whatever) are useless if they enslave you. gender roles and self-denial can both do this.these are the things i took with me after seeing fire. hats off to deepa mehta¬Ö

this might be my favorite so bad it's awesome film of all time. like many pre-teen children of the 80's repeat viewing of revenge of ninja spawned a ninja phase of my childhood. man i thought sho k. was badass back then. jet li could wup him with both legs in a cast! this movie has insane crossovers that include flashdance,the exorcist and the lee van cleef ninja tv show. ugh. but as a friend of mine says anyone can get a good movie made it takes true genius to make a film that starts with a ninja surviving 17 shotgun blasts long enough to take over the body of arobics instructor to get revenge. wow. while previous commentors have metioned the sword flying out of the closet on the string no one has yet metioned the powerful love scene. where the sexy leading man cop takes off his shirt to reveal a mane of backhair. the fun never ends. rent this!!!!!!

sam firstenberg's "ninja 3:the domination" mixes martial arts with "the exorcist" like horror.the horror elements thrown on screen are simply laughable,but the film works as a mindless action/martial arts flick.the fight scenes are well-choreographed and exciting,and the film is never boring.so forget stupid dialogue,lame acting and annoying soundtrack-grab some beer and check this one out!highly recommended!

canadian film-maker ron switzer delivers a solid, non-stop thrill ride of relentless horror with the superb 1991 sci-fi film "science crazed". a hideous monster takes revenge on his mother, a police officer and tenants of an apartment building. brilliant practical make-up and special effects designs create a truly terrifying monster, especially when lurking through the atmospheric shadows and smoke of the gloomy apartment settings. the characters are developed beautifully with outstanding and surprisingly touching performances from an ensemble cast. produced by donna switzer, newcomer ron switzer also penned the film's face-paced script, weaving together an engaging roller-coaster ride of twists, turns, and terror that keeps you guessing until the last frame. science crazed will no doubt leave you haunted long after the shocking conclusion. highly recommended!

for those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures, let me give you a little lesson in american film-making.documentaries rely heavily on casting. you pick and choose characters you think will enhance the drama and entertainment value of your film.after you have shot a ton of footage, you splice it together to make a film with ups and downs, turning points, climaxes, etc. if you have trouble with existing footage, you either shoot some more that makes sense, find some stock footage, or be clever with your narration.the allegation that the filmmakers used footage of locales not part of the movie (favelas next to beautiful beaches) does not detract from the value of the film as a dramatic piece and the particular image is one that resonates enough to justify its not-quite-truthful inclusion. at any rate, you use the footage you can. so they didn't happen to have police violence footage for that particular neighborhood. does this mean not include it and just talk about it or maybe put in some cartoon animation so the audience isn't "duped"? um, no.as for the hopeful ending, why not? yes, americans made it. yes, americans are optimistic bastards. but why end on a down note? just because it's set in a foreign country and foreign films by and large end on a down note? let foreigners portray the dismal outlook of life.let us americans think there may be a happy ending looming in the future. there just may be one.

unlike the previous poster, i liked the celluloid treatment. it looked good, and made the movie that much more enjoyable to watch. to me, it didn't detract at all from the power of the documentary's content. in fact, i felt the slickness of the look allowed me to just lose myself that much more in the content. the previous poster was fair to liken the style to a nike commercial; it definitely has that look. but for my tastes, it worked really well (and i am far from a fan of nike commercials).in my opinion, this is how documentary film-making should be done. i can't wait to see the next installments from these promising filmmakers.

the producer, matt mochary, stumbled upon the film's subject, anderson sa (leader of the afroreggae music movement), when on a hewlett foundation trip to rio de janeiro. mochary was so moved by sa's story that he called his friend, nyc filmmaker jim zimbalist, who quit his job and joined mochary in brazil to work on a documentary on sa, rio's favelas, and the culture of violence.the first part of the film shows you the culture of violence in rio's favelas (shantytowns where the poor live) via footage of police raids and assaults on the residents. the footage is graphic and shocking.rising from the negativity of the favelas is the charismatic anderson sa, who overcame a possible career in drug dealing to start the afroreggae movement, which combines elements of afro-brazilian culture, reggae, ska, and other elements into a fast-paced, percussion heavy style of music which has since spread to other parts of the world. you can't help but be carried away by the music, especially when you see the local children get involved in sa's school, which he founded to keep kids out of drug gangs. the rest of the film follows sa's meteoric rise and his positivity changes many of the children's lives to seek a life beyond drug running. spoiler: just when the filmmakers thought they had wrapped filming, an unbelievable life changing event occurs of which the resolution has to be seen to be believed. the film then continues and you are gripped in your seat until the end.this film is a response to "city of god," and a worthy one at that. the bleak situation portrayed in that movie is countered by a real example of how favela dwellers can overcome the dire situation they are in and use their resources to constructive ends. you can't help not liking and rooting for anderson sa to succeed.this film is terrifically shot, fast-paced, and is quite absorbing. judging by the overwhelming response of the audience at last night's silverdocs screening, the film should get domestic distribution in the us and the thumping soundtrack should be released as well. keep an eye for this superlative documentary--it is excellent!

scintillating documentary about how a small group of idealistic young men have used music, art and dance to unify and heal the community of vigario geral, one of the most violent slum neighborhoods in rio ("favela" means neighborhood in portuguese), offering to its young people a positive alternative to the lethal gangster world of drug traffickers.in their feature film-making debut, zimbalist and mochary have crafted a movie that is breathtaking because it works on so many different levels. as social document, it gives the facts we need to know to have a context for understanding the significance of the particular story told here. the story itself is well developed, with a strong narrative arc, and, for added measure, it is shot through with keen suspense. there's an arresting, charismatic central protagonist, anderson sa: he's a savvy natural leader, articulate, courageous, spiritually evolved, a talented performer, a visionary who walks his talk.there's also plenty of music and dancing to entertain. there are talking heads ¬ñ mainly sa and his closest associate, jose junior - but they are presented with imaginative cinematic brilliance. the editing nicely mixes footage of differing themes, punctuated only occasionally by a few fact-filled still texts. the pace is as lively as the music. a lot gets accomplished in 78 minutes.grupo afro reggae, the neighborhood social club that anderson, junior and a few others formed in 1993, deploy music and dance as the weapons to go up against the drug lords and the duplicitous police. they teach percussion skills to any kid who wants to join a class, along with dance, martial arts, a community newspaper. the only requirement for kids to belong is no smoking, no drinking, no drugs. there is a subtle, soft sell spiritual fabric running through the movement, loosely based on the hindu god shiva, the destroyer of old habits.jeff zimbalist, who also was the lead cinematographer and the editor, is a modern culture and media student at brown university. he burnished his chops editing feature documentaries for pbs and others, and he teaches film at the new york film academy and elsewhere. matt mochary, like andrew jarecki ("capturing the friedmans") did a few years ago, recently came to film from the business world.zimbalist and mochary together won the award for best new filmmakers at the 2005 tribbeca film festival, and "favela rising" was tied for the best film of the year in awards made for 2005 by the international documentary association. i could go on for pages about afro reggae, sa, and this movie. a way better idea is simply for you to go see it! my grade: a 10/10

for once a story of hope highlighted over the tragic reality our youth face. favela rising draws one into a scary, unsafe and unfair world and shows through beautiful color and moving music how one man and his dedicated friends choose not to accept that world and change it through action and art. an entertaining, interesting, emotional, aesthetically beautiful film. i showed this film to numerous high school students as well who all live in neighborhoods with poverty and and gun violence and they were enamored with anderson, the protagonist. i recommend this film to all ages over 13 (due to subtitles and some images of death) from all backgrounds.

i'm surprised with the questions and issues this documentary has brought up in the reviews here, specially because they're indeed interesting questions. surely, the ones who could best address it would be the makers of the film themselves. nevertheless, i think i can shed some light upon something that i think has been overlooked, which is, in my opinion, the purpose of the film, what it is about and what it's trying to convey. what's its message after all? at the risk of pointing out the very obvious, i'll start saying the filmmakers have an intention. they're trying to tell a story, extract meaning out of it and get a point across. with this in mind, we can shoot down many of the criticized points, particularly the ones involving what people expected in contrast with what the filmmakers were really trying to show. causes and consequences of violence? the film is not about that. it's not "enlightening non-brazilian audiences" about the brazilian favelas' issue? well, who wanted to do that? is afroreggae this or that and supported by whom? it doesn't matter in this context. not enough women in the film for your tastes? it's not about equality or the feminist cause. every little detail about anderson's life, mother, son, family and all the aspects and the workings of the afroreggae movement? well, don't be so picky because it doesn't matter. there's just so much length a story can have before it can't become a film anymore. if the authors were to show everything everyone is expecting, they'd have to make a 6 months tv series instead. if you are expecting all that, you approach the film the wrong way.the film is actually about two individuals who started a movement. two individuals full of ideals. two individuals who thirst for change. two individuals trying to do something about all the wrongdoing going around them. individuals who went rock bottom and wanted to get up again. it's all about finding purpose in life, drawing inspiration from misery, changing the destiny and becoming something else than what they were destined to be -- criminals and drug dealers for that matter. it's about achievement and hope and not about the cruel reality of violence in rio de janeiro, though it's an integral part of the film given that's what the characters are constantly surrounded by. unexpectedly and not without a reason, the film ends up centered much more on anderson's course through difficulties in life. this is because they were faced with anderson's accident while they were shooting the film. i'm not sure about this, but they may have even seriously considered ending the filming right there, leaving behind all effort spent. but anderson wanted to keep going. and so they did, risking to lose in having a film with a bit of an identity crisis, considering the sudden change of course, but gaining in showing someone overcoming such a devastating happening. it's very evident for who watches it that the film begins about afroreggae and winds up about anderson. it's very unique in this sense (the shift of the story line). maybe their only sin is not making it evident upfront, which may initially rise expectations that will go unfulfilled.as for the importance or ordinariness of anderson, i'd say not everybody wants to change the whole world, end all violence, feed all the hungry, be like mahatma ghandi, be as known as mother teresa or whoever other known personalities there are. it's much easier to relate to and draw inspiration from someone who is, such as everybody else in fact, trying to transform his or her own harsh life, raising problematic kids, coping with permanent injuries or diseases and even managing to pay the bills by the end of the month. to understand the movie you have to see that's about leaving behind a past of involvement with drugs and crime, making up for it, and trying to persuade others not to go down the same troublesome path. though you can criticize if the way they chose to do it is effective and doubt the ideology of the method, you cannot deny their intentions.also, the perception that anderson is special or a chosen one may have partially something to do with the fact that the filmmakers became very involved in the lives of the characters they were depicting. as much as becoming friends with them. there's no way it wouldn't tint the whole movie with a more favorable light over anderson. if a dear friend becomes paralyzed in an accident, it's not just a fact, you make a big deal out of it. and this is not necessarily bad. it's not much that they treat him like "a chosen one" as much as they go to great lengths trying to show him as a seed for transformation and source of inspiration.in conclusion, don't watch this documentary for the scenes of the reality of poverty and crime it contains, watch it for what it is much more, an inspirational story.nike-ad-like? seems just damn good and professionally made to me and doesn't affect or detract from the intentions of the film. romanticized? speculate on its credential as a documentary if you will, but why not when it's supposed to cause reaction and inspire? isn't trying to better people's lives through music and dance -- the essence of what the subjects are trying to do -- romanticizing the very own reality? pardon me, but showing just the plain facts is what reporters do and you can watch it on tv every night.if i wanted to become a filmmaker, i wish my first film would also be this great.

favela rising is a documentary about the slums of rio, the favelas, specifically the most violent one, vig√°rio geral. according to this film, a lot more kids have died violently in rio's favelas over the last decade or so than in israel/palestine during the same period -- a fact astonishing if true, which shows how under-recognized this social problem is in the rest of the world. this is an important topic, especially for those who see hope in grassroots efforts to marshal the neediest and most at risk through a vibrant cultural program. this is a compelling documentary, if occasionally marred by a somewhat too personality-based version of events and by grainy digital video and film that sometimes may make you think you need to have your eyes examined.drug lords rule in the favelas and gun-toting teenage boys are the main drug dealers, like in parts of colombia. fernando meirelles' movie city of god/cidade de deus has been accused of celebrating violence (cidade de deus is another of rio's many favelas). but the early section of favela rising shows that in fact favela boys do celebrate violence and want to deal drugs where the money and the action are. it's cool to carry a gun there, cool to work as a drug trafficker: it's fifty times more profitable than the earnings available by other means.mochary first discovered the afroreggae movement and its leaders anderson s√° and jos√© junior while visiting rio for a conference and quickly persuaded his friend and mentor zimbalist to quit his job and come down to help make a film with his own promise to fund it. s√°'s eloquence and charisma and a startling twist in his life make him the center of the film and its chief narrator, but like the favelas themselves the film teems with other people. no doubt about the fact that s√° is a remarkable leader, organizer, and artist.vig√°rio geral is compared to bosnia: shooting there was very dangerous. anderson s√°'s friendship and protection and caution and diplomacy in the shooting enabled the filmmakers to gain access and shoot detailed footage of their subject matters while (mostly: there were close calls) avoiding any serious confrontations with drug lords or drug-dealing cops. they also trained boys to use cameras and left them there on trips home. that resulted in 10% of the footage, including rare shots of violent incidents including police beatings. it's hard for an outsider to keep track of police massacres in rio. there was one in the early 1990's that looms over the story and inspired s√°, who ended his own early involvement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement. the cops are all over the drug trade and if anybody doesn't like that the ill trained police paramilitaries come in (often wearing black ski masks) and shoot up a neighborhood, killing a lot of innocents.this is pretty much the picture we get in meirelles' city of god, except that this time s√°, junior, and the other guys come in, starting in vig√°rio geral but spreading out eventually to a number of other favelas to give percussion classes that attract dozens of youth -- girls as well as boys. their afroreggae (grupo cultural afroreggae or gcar) program, formed in 1993, is a new alternative way of life for young black men in the rio ghettos. it leads them to leave behind smoking, alcohol, and drugs (that's the rule) to explode into rap, song, percussion, and gymnastics in expressive, galvanic performances. eventually the best of the performers led by s√° wind up appearing before big local audiences with local producers, and their banda afroreggae has an international recording contract.other centers and groups have been created by or through the gcar over the years in vig√°rio geral and other favelas to seek the betterment of youth by providing training and staging performances of music, capoeira, theater, hiphop and dance at gcar centers.the performance arts aren't everything, just the focal point. gcar is also a movement for broader social change gathering public awareness through such performances, the centers also provide training in information (newspaper, radio, internet, e-mail links), hygiene and sex education, to seek to bridge gaps between rich and poor, black and white, and to offer workshops in audio-visual work, including production of documentaries. the program is currently active in four other favelas.there are many scenes of favela street and home life in favela rising and they look very much like the images in city of god with the important difference that the focus and outcome are very, very much more positive. not that it isn't an uphill battle. and the corruption of the police, the inequities of the social system, and the indifference of the general population of brazil are not directly addressed by any of this. but there's a scene where s√° talks to some young kids in another favela, cynical boys not enthusiastic about afroreggae and determined to work in the drug trade as s√° himself did as a boy. s√° doesn't seem to be convincing any of them despite pointing out that traffickers don't make it to the age of fifty. but we learn that the most negative boy in this group, richard morales, joined the movement five months later. there's also the account of a freak accident that disabled s√°, but with a positive outcome.it would be great if the images were sharper and clearer and if the story were edited down a little, but this is vibrant, inspiring material and represents committed, risk-taking documentary film-making and it's nice that favela rising has been included in seven film festivals and won a number of awards, including best new documentary filmmaker at the tribeca film festival. it's currently being shown at the institute of contemporary arts (ica) in london. however, a wide art house audience in the us seems somewhat unlikely.included in the sfiff 2006.

never having seen an oliver stone film before, nor any films starring eric bogosian, i didn't know what to expect from this film. having toyed with the idea of buying it for a while, i finally got it for free as a supplement with a sunday newspaper and i was hugely impressed.it tells the story of barry champlain, a talk radio host who can be incredibly rude towards his callers, often putting them in their place before they realise what's going on. though this is what has made him a popular radio show host, it has also earned him numerous enemies.the acting in this film was hugely impressive with not one dud actor in it. eric bogosian is brilliant as barry champlain, the troubled talk radio host with alec baldwin turning in a strong performance as barry's boss, dan. it also features the voice of, and cameo appearance by, michael wincott (my reason for wanting to see this).the story was really well written as, despite his arrogance, you feel for barry as more about his troubled life is revealed and you see how vulnerable he really is.i'd recommend this film to anyone as it is captivating and, more importantly real on numerous levels, two of which being that is was inspired by the life of an actual talk radio host and the fact that you do actually get radio show hosts, and callers, like the ones featured in the film in reality.high recommendation and 10/10.aye yours, cat squire

oliver stone is not one to shy away from a movie or theme for that matter. he is eager to confront people with their fears or show them their ugly faces in the mirror. look on his cv for proof! this movie is not an exception, quite on the contrary, it is another gem, that unfortunately not many have seen.as controversial movies go, this is one that you should be thankful for. a movie that should encourage you to think about you, the people next to you. the prejudices that do exist and that everyone of us has in one form or another. either we like to admit it or not, but it is easier to categorize people and be like "ah he's 'xyz', yeah he must be like ...". now i might be reading too much into it, but i don't believe that. i believe that oliver stone is a very intelligent filmmaker and that he was aiming for those things. and if that's something you want to explore (as a movie or within yourself), than watch this film and be excited!

i have never been a great fan of oliver stone, often because i have found his films to be forced, preachy and generally flawed. the two stone films i truly like are jfk and talk radio, yet talk radio takes the cake for being stone's finest achievement. stone is a director whereby you are either a fan or you are not, it is safe to say that before watching talk radio i was not fond of the guy and considered one of the most overrated directors in the film industry, though after watching talk radio some of my perceptions have changed. talk radio is an unsettling and amusing attack on what is now known as "reality tv".talk radio follows a self-indulgent, dysfunctional, determined, hysterical, outrageous and perplexing radio host, named barry champlain who hosts a controversial late-night radio show in dallas. quickly becoming well known for his bold and quirky air-presence he becomes a late night sensation, whereby depraved junkies, delinquents, racists, sociopaths, sickos, perverts and morons call in to be ridiculed on air. the film shows the rise and fall of the man's career, carefully making an accurate portrayal on freedom of speech. originally adapted from a stage-play, the film attaches itself to the theatre theme that it was originally built around, wonderfully conveying the film's fierce nature.with the ferocious energy and non-stereotypical air, talk radio brings all the hilarity behind "crass media". it remains even more poignant today than it was in the late '80s. the film goes into depth studying the likes of arrogance, self-obsession, offensive behaviour, controversy, hypocrisy and ignorance. the film shows through a controlled manner how it is good to have a personal opinion and freedom of speech, yet it is something that should be used wisely rather than shamefully blunt. stone tries to show how freedom of speech is a crucial importance in life, but is something that we should be wary and cautious about. the film asks the question of "is our main protagonist just the same as the sad people who call up the show?" stone fabulously creates the film's key set-piece (the radio station) with an ambition and cold atmosphere. he then succeeds in capturing the isolation, fear, ambiguity and the dangerous emotions that are built up at the radio station. eric bogosian is perfectly cast as the isolated, self-absorbed and complex genius, barry champlain. he fits the role perfectly letting off his lines with such enthusiasm, urgency, perplexity, brusqueness and ultimately the bold hilarity of his offensive nature. the performance brims with spark, which was evidently robbed of an oscar nomination. his voice suits the character, being that a primary element of a radio host and his power of acting along with tragedy and comedy works brilliantly.there is a strong use of editing in stone's films and talk radio boasts some of his cleanest, most rhythmic editing. he uses beautifully controlled camera techniques, which differ from being calm to suddenly becoming turbulent. there is a vibrant energy behind the film, with its raw and wonderfully delightful script working as a centre-piece for the greatness of the film. the striking and virtuous cinematography stands out in the moments inside and outside the studio, most impressively capturing the city at night. not forgetting the hauntingly heartbreaking and yet darkly funny climatic "spiral to decline" is ultimately remarkable cinema.talk radio is an essential modern masterpiece, i am certain you will be surprised by just how great it really is. i highly recommend talk radio for anyone interested in media or film. talk radio is a fine example of top-notch, intellectual and insightful entertainment, which still packs a well-earned wakeup call. finally, if it was not for eric bogosian the film would not be the fun, delightful and enduring masterpiece it is today.

i tend to be inclined towards movies about people who choose to cross the barriers of censorship, and express what they really want to express. eric bogosian's character of barry is like howard stern, but much more intelligent. the character itself is very fascinating. as an oliver stone film, i guess i was expecting more. the film sags a bit during the third act. plus, it's pretty obvious that "talk radio" is based on a play, with its long dialogue scenes. but overall, the film works. bogosian is great in the lead, and the fact that he also wrote the play from which the movie was based on probably helped him. if you want to check out one of stone's greater films, i better suggest you check out "jfk" or "salvador." this is not his best work, but a good movie nonetheless.

"talk radio" is my favorite oliver stone movie, though he has made many great ones including "salvador", "jfk", "natural born killers" and "platoon". but i like the intimacy of "talk radio", a cinematic expansion of eric bogosian's searing stage play that was based on a real life account of a dallas talk show host. working with ace cinematographer robert richardson, stone turns what could have been a very set-bound exercise into a visually arresting ideological battle that presents a radio station as an arena of war. bogosian is devastating as tortured on-air spouter of abuse barry champlain and conveys the conflicted, destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-loathing. alec baldwin, as his alpha male boss, strikes the perfect note as a man driven nuts by a guy whose monstrousness he helped nurture. ellen greene is fantastic as barry's sweet ex-wife who ends up becoming another target of his vicious personal vitriol. stone and bogosian fill every frame with interest and every line of dialog with sweet poison and cutting ambiguity. john c. mcginley, as barry's long-suffering screener/technical producer stu, turns in a hilarious, sharp performance, as does the great michael wincott. the film is a flawless, underrated masterpiece of superb writing, awesome acting and brutal, uncompromising direction. the stewart copeland score is brilliant, too.

i have seen it a few times and get completely glued to it every time. it is very suspenseful and intense. to describe it sounds boring but it is amazing. it is the kind of movie where you need can't miss a thing, but if you soak it in it sticks with you long after it ends. now thinking about it i don't even know what stone was trying to make us see. just the story of alan green? i don't think so. it was a look at ignorance, stupidity, self-absorption, and a guy just loosing his grip. maybe he had more grip than the listeners though. i didn't like barry but still seemed worried about him for some reason. i was perplexed at why i couldn't get him out of my mind when the movie ended. i wish i could see inside olive stone's mind for this one.

***spoilers*** for some strange reason oliver stone's "talk radio" based on the stephen singular book "talked to death" and the films star eric bogosian's play, about the 1984 murder of denver talk show host alan berg, has never gotten the recognition that it so rightfully deserved. the 1988 movie was prophetic enough to recognize the underground movement that was developing in the farm and hinterland of america. a movement that spawned, some seven years later, the likes of an angry and disgruntled gulf war veteran timothy mcveigh who's hatred for the us governments actions in wacco texas lead to his and friend,terry nichols, detonation of the us federal building in oklahoma city on april 19, 1995 that took the lives of 168 people, the worst act of terrorism on us soil up to that time. the movie is, as far as i know, the first time that any major branch of the entertainment media mentioned and elaborated on the rural militia novel "the turner diaries" by the late william l. pierce, that has since become a chilling underground classic. "the turner diaries" forecast a domestic and utterly disastrous terrorist attack, like the oklahoma city bombing, on a us government federal facility which was the fbi building in washington d.c. dallas radio station kgab talk show host barry champlain, eric bogosian, is the top rated show in the dallas listening area and is now about to go national. barry get's his high rating by his razor sharp wit and abusive behavior when he's on the air. taking on all comers and ducking no issues, no matter how unpopular or taboo they are, has gotten barry to be the most listened to as well as hated man on radio. barry being a showman at heart and not thinking that his talk can lead to violence keeps up his abrasiveness to his call-in listeners as his rating go up to the celling. but there are those in the listening audience, mostly ultra right wing types, that don't take too kindly to his in your face attitude. one of them decides to take matters into his on hand at barry's expense. powerhouse performance by eric bogosian as the tragic barry champlain who crossed the line from entertainment to hard reality in his actions on the radio. thinking that he's not that important to be sought out and murdered for his on the air opinions which is enemies dislike he found out only too late that there are those out there who are crazy enough to do to him on the outside. also in the movie "talk radio" is a very young alic baldwin as barry's boss dan who tries to have him soften his tone but in the end goes along with his talk show style since he's killing the competition not realizing that in the end it's him that he'll end up getting killed. both ellen green and leslie hope are the two women in barry's life his ex-wife ellen and now lover and talk show producer laura whom barry uses to his advantage and almost ends up losing both of them at the same time. the 1988 film "talk radio" is so far ahead of it's time that even if you watch it now in 2005 you still think that it's too disturbing to be shown to an over sensitive and delicate american public.

the movie is really about choices. in the oppressed state of affairs as seen in fire, where good women had to be obedient and do what was correct in the eyes of tradition, there seemed few options for radha and sita. however, granted that it was not their only option. what is life without desire, radha questions ashok. yes, it's true that life provides us with a number of options but how many we can take depends on a number of external factors. when your world is confined to a small indian household, being a dutiful daughter-in-law to a silent but observant still powerful matriarch, a dutiful wife of 13 years to a man who has taken a vow of celibacy due to your not being able to have a child, a man who only wants you lying next to him to prove his strength in eliminating his desires. i felt the ladies had little choice but to find solace in each other's company. i guess the fact that so many women applauded ms mehta's work, was because it provided them with an option to think for themselves. an option to do what was perhaps unacceptable. the lesbian scenes i felt was merely to put that point across. every scene in the movie from the first at the taj mahal to the last at the mosque, is etched in my mind. how frustrating to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires. to feel that you had to forgo the human touch to be a dutiful wife just because it is expected of you. to have to suppress any desire you might have and to crave for the human touch. what then is the meaning of our existence one wonders. in the scene where sita is crying alone in the room and radha comes in to comfort her, their lips accidentally brush against each others and it awakens a feeling in them. something they have both been deprived of.bravo to ms mehta in translating her vision so clearly. i especially like the flashbacks to the young radha trying to 'see' for the ocean. it is a metaphor for freedom. freedom to choose, freedom to transport ourselves to places we would normally be unable to reach. in those scenes, it is gently told to us that her sense of duty has also been passed down from her mother who i assume lives within the rich indian traditions of duty in marriage. the movie is beautifully filmed and enhanced by the musical score by a.r. rahman. since the film, i have become ardent fans of the two lead actresses and the director. i look forward to more of ms deepa's future productions.

for every fan of coming of age tales, this 3 hour adaptation of thesarah waters novel is pure fun. cinematic nods to baz luhrman'skinetic style, as well as to all those prim and proper period piecesever present on the bbc (where you're likely to have seen almostevery prominent member of this cast). it's rather bawdy and overthe top in spots, but that's just what the novel called for. the castis appealing and, in the cases of anna chancellor and hughbonneville, perfect. in the case of rachel sterling, as our heroinenan, you simply must overlook the fact that she's far too pretty toever be mistaken for a boy and run with it. it's a fantasy, after all. some fans of the novel may be put out by the various changes incharacter (particularly that of jodhi may's character, florence), butthe changes all work toward the greater good of this teleplay andprovide an overall high quality entertainment value.

i think andrew davies did an admirable job of taking a magnificent book which emulated the pace and styling of a victorian novel and turning it into a moving and entertaining film. i'm glad i read (twice) the book first which is usually the case for me. i know that one must view a novel and a film as different media and judge them accordingly. but, still, it's often hard to read the original material after a film gives away the best parts.i realize that davies is a very good adapter, but i wish the producers had chosen a woman to write the screenplay. davies, as he admits in the commentary that accompanies the film on dvd, wanted particularly to emphasis the more scatological bits in the book. i certainly enjoyed those, on film as in the book. but davies missed a half-dozen moments that are so excruciatingly, painfully tender which he could have incorporated if his sensibility were more feminine. i also would take issue with his use of the book's primary symbol, the rose.as the screenplay was plotted by davies, the denouement was inevitable and appropriate. but i really think that author waters' final nod to the rose symbol was much more interesting. and i preferred way the novel let nan "come of age" than the way davies chose.one quick comment about the four actors who essay the primary roles. they are all wonderfully talented -- well, except for the singing and dancing, perhaps -- and, moreover, their physical presences are so much what the mind's eye sees when reading the novel before seeing the film. i thought they were all terrific.i recommend that any lesbian and anyone who loves good fiction, add both the book and the dvd of tipping the velvet to their bookshelves.

it is surprising that a production like this gets made these days, especially for television. considering the strong sexual themes and explicit lovemaking scenes, not to mention lesbianism, this has been given superb treatment and direction.the sets and costumes are flawless, the direction is stylish and the characters are likeable. there is a fair amount of humor but it has surprisingly dark interludes. the protagonist is really a tragic figure, but not devoid of happiness. also, this production avoids the mistake most films/shows make when dealing with homosexuality/lesbianism. the characters are very human. it seems that to allow people to be comfortable with watching gays and lesbians on tv and movies most shows fill it full of cliches and make the characters obsessed with being gay. not so with this. in tipping the velvet, the protagonist is hardly aware of what being lesbian means!the bbc have made some wonderful productions in the past, and this adventurous period piece only confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts.

i have nothing but praise for this mini series. it's only about a year and a half old but i have seen it twice already; with greater enjoyment the second time than the first. i'm seriously thinking of watching it again soon since i find it spiritually uplifting.it is a very tender romantic drama with such beautiful performances, sets, costumes, music and scenes that it has a resonance which places it almost in a league of its own among mini series.some others have commented on the difficulties of living as a lesbian in britain in the 1890s. nothing especially difficult about that; it was only male homosexuality that was against the law as poor oscar wilde experienced to his great cost and as a great loss to the literary world. anyway, i digress.in my view, this is essential television. it is perhaps one of the greatest tragic romantic dramas since romeo and juliet, although not in the conventional sense.10 out of 10 from me.jmv

i'm glad i read the sarah waters novel first, since i had my own pictures of the characters in my head at the time. the ones cast for this production, however, were not at all disappointing - in fact, after i got used to rachael stirling as nan, i think nina gold did a damn fine job in the casting department. (can keeley hawes be more delicious?!)the bbc has done it again: this is a wonderful production of a very good book, and they have done it up in style. if you can get your hands on this (vhs, dvd) be sure to get the 181-minute version (the uncensored one.) it is a marvelous journey, albeit a bit rocky at times, that you won't regret taking.

this wonderful 3 part bbc production is one of the sweetest love stories that i have seen in a while. the actresses display a very high level of talent, especially rachael stirling as nan astley. she is funny, seductive and cute. the love making scenes and the close up kisses are very erotic regardless of one's sexual preference. the characters are well defined and very believable. i guess this is a by-product of a good adaptation from a well written novel.a truly remarkable well paced drama that picks up speed quickly after a couple of boring (but necessary) scenes in the beginning.my vote: 9/10

tipping the velvet has just three weeks ago been released in the uk and already i watch as countless letters flood to the national papers and tv guides, claiming that it possesses a thin plot, weak performances and an even weaker script.you find me incensed. this is heresy.i would really like to dispel all doubt by first congratulating andrew davies on enabling geoffrey sax to create this wonderful dramatization of sarah waters' novel by cushioning him with such a fantastic script. kudos. but i fear i must now change tack.i saw one of the premiere tv guides here in the uk (which shall remain nameless) relentlessly describing tipping the velvet as a "lesbian love story". if they are, and i assume they are, trying to promote interest in the film, then this is completely the wrong way to go about it (aside from the phrase being a disappointingly inaccurate description). by saying such a thing, they are either a) turning away those who would instinctively be repelled by "that" subject matter or b) attracting a class of people who will only watch to see some "serious girl-on-girl action". buy a video! through this display of serious inconsideration, this and other magazines are cheapening what is a brilliant adaptation of one of recent literature's greatest works. tipping the velvet is a story of love, of passion, of moving on, of loss, and of heartbreak. it's not a lesbian love story. no siree.the end result is a stylish affair, with excellent performances all round (particularly from stirling, hawes, chancellor and may). direction-wise, it's intoxicating and immersive - sometimes, fast-paced, sometimes not - but it never ceases to be anything less than compelling. as a whole, it's polished and well delivered, the sex is undertaken with tenderness and delicacy - and although many will not class it as a real "film", it will remain among my favourites for some time to come.

labeling this film a "lesbian love story" is about as accurate as calling pride & prejudice a "straight love story." there's just so much more to it than that.yes, the main character is a lesbian, but her story is classic bildungsroman, a journey from childhood to adulthood, from sexual innocence into maturity, from personal blindness to self- discovery. there is a stylistic element of camp to the film's direction, but it is not a hindrance; rather it serves to underscore the staged and dramatic parts of the main character's life.those who know anna chancellor from the bbc version of pride and prejudice will certainly be amazed with her here. rachael stirling is stellar as the main character nan, and keeley hawes is all wide-eyed goodness as her lover kitty butler. chancellor might have the stand out role, that is aside from sally hawkins who plays zena butler. this film is not for the faint of heart, but it's not a piece of pro-gay advertising either. it's a real story, with real comedy and drama, an engaging story with compelling characters, and well worth watching.

i started watching this expecting the worst, i was happy to find that the film turned out to be enjoyable, slightly confusing in parts, like when they all justs started singing. it gave me a chance to see daniel wu in action for the first time, he is a better actor than i thought, at times he seemed a bit out of place. i thought purple storm deserves its hong kong legends release, as it is different to most other hk films, it is about a mans emotional struggles when confronted with memory loss, it may sound corny but when he eventually pieces out what and who he actually is it really makes the film a lot more interesting. once you get into the film you will find it keeps you gripped to it, as if you miss one bit then a lot of the film wil make sense, for example i missed a bit at the start and i recommend to anyone that watches this that they do not miss any of it. so i can say that this film was worth watching and a grateful surprise for me, that i enjoyed it.

here we've got an intelligent mixture of typical hongkongmovieshootouts, worlddestructionthemes and intelligent filmmaking. not that the script has not its big holes and a few specialeffects are a bit cheaplooking. but the cinematography is a optical treat and the soundtrack is first rate. the blend of fast actionsequences and colorful slow, sometimes nearly poetic parts, has no comparison in its kind of movie, so a classification is rather hard. the closest genre is a disaster or terroristmovie with deeper human and political notes than usual. well worth to be seen worldwide in cinemas. but i am hoping this for so many other (mostly asian) movies before and nobody seems to believe me. unfortunately.

this movie gives daniel wu his chance to do a great action movie, but i really find emil chow's character really great, gutsy but determined to righting wrongs. plus the main terrorist, it gets me wondering his revolution, makes me wonder if he is doing this for good or bad.a movie that tells us about todd, an amnesiac terrorist being tricked as an undercover until he learns who he really is. the consequences that he makes from his terrorist family, gives him a the choice of redemption.purple storm was one of the best ones that i have seen this year. the movie really stands out when it is filled with tremendous action scenes set-up by stephen tung wai, which won the best action sequences in the hong kong awards. (9/10)

i found it charming! nobody else but kiarostami can do so little and, yet, get so much. you might think i'm weird, but i was so charmed that i couldn't speak during the movie. while during other movies i comment a lot. the short movie made by him for lumiere et companie, the one with the eggs, that one is unbeatable in my heart, but this is wonderful, too. i liked it better than ten. kiarostami is, maybe, the best director in my opinion, because he can see things! he doesn't need to use a lot of stuff "brought from home" to illustrate his images, he simply grabs a camera. not many can do that.. maybe i don't know to much about movies but i don't care about complicate stuff, all someone has to do is touch my soul. kiarostami does.

i learned a thing: you have to take this film like a funny period comedy, if you don't want to be disappointed. the film's enjoyable because it's a delicious comedy. i think the over-hype damaged it: the too much glorified monica bellucci appears in few scenes and isn't so good as they wanted to let you believe. she sounds unnatural, false: the best actress in this film is sabrina impacciatore, who speaks with a perfect tuscan accent and shines together with massimo ceccherini. elio germano is very, very good: the most promising young italian actor, according to me. daniel auteuil looks like napoleon, but i preferred other actors. so, the most hyped performances were also the worst.costumes and production design are okay: sure, american period movies are more accurate about these things because have bigger budgets, but the italian ability rewards the lack of money. a nice period comedy, in short, with a first-rate casting (except for bellucci and auteuil).

screened this morning for the press at roma film festival, "n - io e napoleone" is easy to love. first of all it can count on great production values, as very few italian films nowadays can, with wonderful settings and costumes. the cast is great too. director virz√¨ constantly speaks of the young lead elio germano as "a young de niro". now, of course he is going a way too far, but sure the boy can act. i loved his performance, and he did a great job with the (tuscan) accent. daniel auteuil is a great actor and did very well as bonaparte. it's really great to see him acting in italian, i hope to see him working in italy again very soon. the supporting cast worked well too - people like valerio mastrandrea or sabrina impacciatore may seem unlikely choices, but they all gave fine performances. even massimo ceccherini, best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy tv reality shows, fitted in well and was actually funny. the low point of the cast was the "diva" monica bellucci. sure, she was slightly better than usual, but she managed to look (and sound) utterly unnatural even in the part of baronessa emilia, in which, with a good dose of self irony, she used her own umbro accent. the script, by veteran furio scarpelli and virz√¨ himself is clever, with lots of laugh out loud lines, and a few very emotional moments too. sure, the ending left me puzzled. the message is kind of ambiguous: the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate, but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes pathetic, so that suddenly it's difficult to hate him; then, in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning. personally, i dislike very much this notion. "io e napoleone" is still a pleasant film, the best presented at the festival so far (the other being fur and the hoax). my rating is 8/10

martino, a young teacher in the island of elba, has been formed by maestro fontanelli, an excellent educator, to be his own man and to say whatever he thinks, something that gets him in trouble at the school where we first meet him because he is teaching revolutionary ideals. the island is in a frenzy because of the arrival of one of the most influential men in european history of the 19th century. napoleon is coming to his exile, not exactly a high point in his life.with surprise, martino is chosen to accompany napoleon who is writing his memoirs and is in need of help for his own project. the young man comes from a sea merchant family. his brother and sister want him to go on an commercial expedition, but martino has decided his place belongs in elba because he will try to assassinate napoleon. little deters him after his mentor fontanelli is tried for treason and condemned to be shot by a firing squad.martino finds his consolation with the much older baroness emilia, a beautiful woman. in his own interaction with the deposed emperor, a different kind of man emerges. napoleon is seen as a more human person who really enjoys the company of martino, not suspecting with the plans the young man's own plans for him. unfortunately, martino is not able to put his design into action because napoleon has other plans in mind.paolo virzi, the director of "caterina va in citta", shows why his early promise is still there. mr. virzi also collaborated with the screenplay, which is based on a novel by ernesto ferrero. the director shows he is as good in intimate drama as well as with this type of spectacle. alessandro pesci, the cinematographer, does an excellent job with the images he was able to get.elio germano, a young italian actor is the best thing in the movie. he is playing against more experienced players, yet he manages to convince us he is the idealist youth trying to get justice to what he perceives is a noble cause. the great daniel auteuil is a more subdued napoleon than one would expect from anyone's interpretation of this larger than life man. monica belucci is the love interest of martino, but she has little to do. omero antonutti plays fontanelli.

would you like to know why french and italians love/hate each others? would you like to have a glimpse of history that drives our lifetime? so, go to watch virzi's film (in original language, of course) and you can look at a wonderful monica bellucci who finally speaks her native language from citt√† di castello (umbria, just at the border with tuscany). and the rest of the characters speaking livornese (lovely sabrina impacciatore and all the others). daniel auteuil definitely in his shoes with napoleon. a lot of fun, a real fresco of the elba island landscape, and a picture about the political reasons to kill or leave alive a tyrant (good for all times).

debbie vickers (nell schofield) and sue knight (jad capelja) want to become one of the cool girls in their high school. uncool and ugly girls had two options, be a mole or a prude! debbie and sue imitate them by using their cheating practices in an exam. two of the cool boys, garry (goeff rhoe) and danny (tony hughes) ask them for their answers and they all get busted. after a bawling out from the headmaster (bud tingwell) the cool girls meet them outside in the playground and confronted them about whether they "dobbed" on them all. as debbie and sue hadn't the cool girls invited them to the "dunnies" for a smoke. they then start to hang with them on weekends at the beach, watching all the boys surf. sue ends up going out with danny and debbie with garry. a lot of usual teenage action takes place including sex, drugs and rock and roll. garry has an eventual overdose of heroin which makes debbie face the inequalities of life and she decides to learn to surf instead of just watching the boys. they are not happy but watch her, calling names, and eventually debbie masters the board. a cool early 80s aussie film.

i don't know if i'd go as far as to say that this movie belongs to the 'aussie trash' pile, but it's fair to say that there are no academy award nominees here. what must be considered is that most of the actors in this film weren't actually actors as such, just kids with nothing better to do at the time. there were many others that were offered roles in the film but turned them down to go surfing up the coast; all things taken into account, it really wasn't a bad movie for its time. in some respects it's really not unlike today's times, where peer pressure is still alive and kicking, just without the mobile phones, computers and other similar gadgets that kids lived without, unlike this generation. anyway, i have to rate this flick as an old fave that i watch once in a blue moon and never take too seriously...

movie about two australian girls--debbie (nell schofield) and sue (sue knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer guys.i caught this at an art cinema here in america in 1981. technically i was still a teenager (i was 19) so i was interested in seeing how australian teens acted. script wise there's nothing new here. it shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating, sex, suicide etc etc. i always knew what was going to happen before it did but i was never bored. what i found interesting was, despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair, these teenagers aren't much different than american teens. they had many of the same difficulties and hang-ups. also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventures and (i heard) it was a faithful adaptation of it. the acting was just ok but the actors were attractive and this was well-made and pretty interesting. so this is no unsung masterpiece but a pretty accurate portrayal of what it's like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids. i give it a 7.

i was actually satisfied when i played this game.the graphics were something new.the missions were great.but yet,i felt i wanted more out of this game.for a james bond game its pretty good but not as good as his other games.it would be great if they could make a 360remake for it.it would be much better then.this may just be cuz i'm into games as resident evil,dead rising and those kind of games.so it could be better but it was ok to play.one thing i absolutely hated about this game was natalya!she was irritating dying all the time and she couldn't run either.i recommend this game for those who like fps games more than i do.7/10 stars

the best bond game made of all systems. it was made of the best bond movie of all time. if you don't have the game goldeneye you should rent it and if you don't have the movie goldeneye you should rent it also to better understand the game. the best bond game of all!!!

two years after its initial release, goldeneye still sits atop the field of first-person shooters for the nintendo 64. even the quake and turok series have not had the combination of graphic detail, sound quality, enemy intelligence, challenge and overall fun that bring me back to this game over and over again. the missions each have specific objectives that force you to think as bond, not just to shoot up every baddie that pops up on your screen, but also to avoid cameras, disable security systems, rescue hostages, protect the bond girl, and so on. q gadgets abound in this game, including the famous watch. the game is loosely based on the movie storyline, including all the major characters and the best scenes of the movie, from the dam bungee-jump to the prop-plane escape to the tank chase through st. petersburg. even the layout is preserved where possible, so you'll recognize various situations if you've seen the film. other levels are added to challenge the player and string together the scenes a little more. with each difficulty level the mission objectives are more difficult, the enemies smarter and the bullets more lethal. i still have not gotten through the 00-agent levels. cheats can be opened, not by entering codes or pushing buttons, but by completing certain levels within a certain time frame, and additional characters can be opened up for the multiplayer. the multiplayer is still the best among the first-person shooters. it's not as crisp as turok but it doesn't slow down nearly as much... tons of options give your friends reason to blow each other up over and over again, and one more time just for kicks. there are better games for the n64, such as zelda and all things star wars, but rare has continued their streak of outstanding games with a first-person shooter that has not and will not be surpassed until they top themselves in 2000 with perfect dark.

this is a superb game for the n64 with superb graphics and a great one-player story-line and even better multi-player game best played with 4 people.the many levels and options for weapons mean that this is one of the best games around for years.

this is my favorite game for the nintendo 64 platform. i've played many different first-person shooters, and i've never really liked any of them much, but this game has a certain something that i can't put my finger on that makes it an amazing amount of fun. maybe it's the extraordinary detail put into the game. maybe it's the fluid movement of the characters. maybe it's the gadgets and weapons. maybe it's the suave character of james bond. whatever it is, this game never seems to get old no matter how many times i've played it.

definitely the best game for n64 ever. i most say i was farely disappointed with tomorrow never dies, but the world is not enough promises to be better then goldeneye (according to the website).i love goldeneye so much i find something to do every time i play it. i have even made up my own missions for the levels. multi player is the best of any game out there, and the graphics are astounding even now. the first day i got this i remember wishing that they would go back, and make all of the bond movies into games. can you imagine driving that speed boat in live and let die and making those incredible jumps, or fighting off ninjas or fighting jaws in the spy who loved me and moonraker. (i think fighting him in those games would be more fun then in the aztec) what about chasing sanchez in the gas trucks or scalling st. cerils in for your eyes only. oh well let me get back to the game at hand. all of the levels are unique and make for very fun killing environments. there are many places to hide so you can sneek up on people (especially statue park) well this game is not worthy of renting you really need to buy it today.

this game is not exactly the best n64 game ever. sure, it's good, but only when there's 4 players. without 4 players, the only fun thing to do is take remote mines and see how many people you can kill. but half of this game are levels where you have to save natalya, so you'll have to limit your use of remote mines in those levels, and that gets quite boring. the graphics don't exactly reach the level of super mario 64 or even mario kart 64. and if you're talking a great multiplayer in a 1st-person shooter, you'll have to go with perfect dark. at least you can play "multiplayer" by yourself.

this game requires stealth, smart, and a steady hand. the gameplay is simply the best; on top of that though are the interesting extras - bullet holes stay in the walls, enemies react to specific points where they have been hit by bullets, there are tons of motion captured animations that make the enemies seem very real (for instance when looking through a window at a guard he will stand there swatting flies away, sneezing, or scratching himself), the list goes on. this is the best licensed/movie conversion ever and it puts you in the shoes of the suavest super spy. this game is the best reason for owning an n64.

what can be said about one of the greatest n64 games ever? that the action is fast enough to keep even a seasoned fps veteran sweating bullets quite literally? that the graphics are great, down to the explosions that everyone loves to see? that nothing is quite as fun as playing multiplayer mode, and shooting your friends and siblings in the back with submachine guns?very little beats goldeneye 007. about the only thing missing was voice acting, and a bit more intelligence in the enemy soldiers. if you have an n64, and you like shooting people and things crossed with espionage, get a copy of this.

ever since i first played it in 1998, goldeneye has been one of my favourite video games. in fact, i recently bought an n64 purely so that i could own it and play it more often! the game is pretty much near-perfect: the single-player mode does a fantastic job of immersing yourself in bond's shoes, with varied mission objectives, convincing weapons, and great level design. even though the enemies' artificial intelligence is pretty basic by today's standards, that only adds to goldeneye's appeal. the method of obtaining cheats (completing levels within a strict time limit) was also innovative when the title was released, and even now i still haven't cracked some of them!the game comes with a wonderful multiplayer mode for up to four players, and while this isn't as advanced as the combat simulator in the game's sequel "perfect dark", it is still incredibly satisfying to blast your opponents to smithereens with a barrage of rc-p90 fire! ;-)

this game has cartoon graphics, not much violence and really short levels - then why do people say it is so brilliant?!? because it always holds your attention, it captivates you and refuses to let go! you will try for hours to try and find that damn flight recorder, try to work out how to get into the room without alerting the guards, etc! the levels are short only when you know what to do - until that, you will spend hours trying to figure out where to find correspondences, where to find helicopters and so on! and you'll have fun all the while you are doing it! well worth a rent!

in my personal opinion i think this is the greatest video game ever created! i first played this game at my friends house years ago, the very next day i went out and got my own. since that day close to seven years ago i have not stopped playing it. i can't help it i just can't get bored of it. i've been addicted to other games on other, much newer systems but i keep coming back for more goldeneye. every mission is amazingly fun and challenging, the multi-player mode was like none other. i hope you can be as fortunate as i was to have played four player multi-player mode because i had brothers and friends who would get together and play this game all the time.

the theme is controversial and the depiction of the hypocritical and sexually starved india is excellent.nothing more to this film.there is a lack of good dialogues(why was the movie in english??). there was lack of continuity and lack of passion/emotion in the acting.

manna from heaven is heavenly. this is a movie for the family -- teens and grandparents can enjoy it together. but it isn't syrupy sweet or silly. the characters really are "characters". the plot is somewhat complex and you have to pay attention, but it's like putting a puzzle together as it all falls into place bit by bit. the period beginning is like watching an old photo album, or remembering back when. it's extremely well done with very accurate hairstyles and costumes. the story moves along quickly with twists, turns and lots of fun.a special treat is to watch the large cast of familiar faces, many of whom we haven't seen in much too long a time. part of the fun is to recognize and name them mentally as they appear, though this can be distracting. cloris leachman by the end of the film looks as if she's had a make-over on "oprah". i had never seen faye grant in a movie -- only knew her as grace's mother in the tv series "saving grace". she was great, even minus the southern accent. and i didn't even recognize shelly duvall. the five sisters who created this very lovely film are a very talented quintet and sister theresa is a heavenly treasure.

what a great cast for this movie. the timing was excellent and there were so many clever lines-several times i was still laughing minutes after they were delivered. i found manna from heaven to have some surprising moments and while there were things i was thinking would happen, the way they came together was anything but predictable. this movie is about hope and righting wrongs. i left the theater feeling inspired to do the right thing. bravo to the five sisters.

i found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting. initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in buffalo, intrigued me. later i found myself lost in the power of the film. how do you repay a gift from god? the ability of characters to rise above their base natures and respond to the touch from god warmed my heart. the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film. i left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race. what more can any film do? hollywood, i hope your paying attention. america does like positive, upbeat films.

being from the buffalo area i was well aware of the movie having read many articles in local publications. i was most impressed with the movie, especially its clever plot, the acting and the local scenes. nice to see so many older, quality stars in the various roles. i feel that especially those of us over 50 will find the movie excellent and you can leave the theater feeling that your time was well spent.

as a native of the city where the story takes place, buffalo, ny, it's fun to see the local sites but the story line is so local and fun, too!the small scale promoting of this film requires strong word of mouth to accomplish the wide viewing it deserves. please make this film the success the big, fat greek wedding was.

`manna from heaven' is a delightfully compelling film.within the shifting paradox of values in middle-class americans from 40 years ago to the present day, the plot tweaks the concerns and hopes of an interesting range of `damon runyonesque' characters.their struggles with moral dilemmas, dotting on `what might have been,' hopes to yet fulfill youthful dreams, romantic yearnings, and `hit it big' combine to make a most entertaining film. rather than relying upon `in-your- face' sexual explicitness, the burgeoning relationship between inez and mac/bake is classically subtle but clear. his untying the knot in her shoelace at the art gallery and their heat in their poker game is outstandingthe script's crisp writing is skillfully interpreted by an outstanding star and supporting cast. one of the few films i have ever fone to see twice in its opening run, `manna from heaven' definitely warrants national distribution.conrad f. toepfer

in the wasteland that hollywood productions have become of late, this movie - in and of itself - is truly "manna from heaven"!!!in what could best be described as a "cute" movie, approximately 350 years of movie acting experience (allright - give or take 100 years!) joyously lights up the screen to tell a tale of deceit, remorse, and redemption about a catholic family in buffalo, ny.truly well-positioned to take its place in the "feel-good" movie genre, this quiet little independent film by the burton sisters' five sisters productions company will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart, all while renewing your faith in mankind.from the spectacular opening scene shots of buffalo, ny to the final credits, the film manages to tell a tale that could have been told of any family, anywhere. yet, somehow this particular gathering of family and "family by association" in a small, non-descript house in buffalo more than fits the bill. if you've never been to buffalo, you'll leave the theater with thoughts of "shuffling off" for a visit! shots of the city landmarks and surroundings help to bring a quaint, down to earth tone to the film - which suits it just fine. the quiet beauty of the "queen city of the great lakes" compliments, rather than detracts from the tale that is being told. if only more movies would take advantage of the natural beauty of this country's "second cities" instead of running off to a soundstage somewhere, the end results would be so much more believable.great performances by shirley jones, frank gorshin, wendy malick, jill eickenberry, and the rest of the ensemble cast prove again that true talent outlasts hollywood's "flavor of the week" any time!go see this movie!you've wandered in hollywood's desert for too long!

we went to see manna from heaven, my husband, two friends, and i and we all enjoyed the film. the characters are funny, the story is amusing and so much like real life. i think that is what i liked most, just seeing something believable, no murders, no sci-fi, just good, clean fun. it is something you could take your children or elderly parents to and not worry. how many of those are around anymore!!

i thoroughly enjoyed gabrielle burton's story of a mysterious gift and how it effects it recipients in the past and present. the talented burton family of five film-making sisters, an author mother, and dancing dad offer a charming plot, respectfully edited for clarity , memorably chosen songs, and a beautifully filmed piece that made me laugh and cry as the characters' vulnerablility invited me into their predicamant. there was a farce-like attitude about this work with touching undertones of innocent wonder. fanatastic

i would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for a relaxing, fun-filled, thought-provoking movie. the absence of sex, vulgarities and violence made for a most pleasant evening. i especially enjoyed the buffalo scene, but that's probably because i live a short distance from there. even so, this film could have been produced in any city; it's the theme that's so important here. i'm just grateful that manna from heaven dropped down on us. try it...you'll like it!

this film is not your typical hollywood fare, though the pickings are so bad i often tend to stay away from movies rather than be disappointed. however, this little low-budget gem is thoroughly loveable and enjoyable and definitely a keeper. the actors are as varied as the characters they portray, the buffalo setting is charming (what a pretty city), and the story sparkles. the lack of gratuitous violence, sex and the "f" word doesn't detract in the least! take the kids, take grandma, take a break from hollywood! i give it an 11 out of 10!

when i first saw the movie, i thought it was sweet - a family movie. for the rest of the night and over the next couple of days, though, clever moments and funny lines kept creeping back into my thoughts and our conversation... there's a lot going on, classic elements of farce, good character acting, and wendie malick's story line is just hysterical. labelling it a "feel-good movie" belies the wit and fun - it's smarter than it seems, just like "it's a wonderful life" is.

the squire of gothos is one of the "sillier" episodes of star trek, and therefore one of the most entertaining ones. the entertainment factor is, generally speaking, fueled by the stand-off between william shatner and the episode's hilarious guest star, william campbell.during an unspecified routine mission, sulu suddenly vanishes into thin air, and kirk follows soon after-wards. spock immediately begins looking for his missing colleagues (and, though he'd hate to admit it, friends), while the two stranded crewmen must deal with the mysterious, all-powerful, flamboyant trelane (campbell), the self-proclaimed squire of gothos, a being capable of creating or destroying anything he wants through the sheer power of his mind.at first sight, the plot may seem recycled from previous episodes (honestly, are there any sci-fi shows that didn't feature at least one god-like character), but that feeling vanishes pretty quickly thanks to the script's winning use of exaggerated humor, all conveyed through campbell's deliberately camp performance: his trelane is essentially the trek version of a spoiled child in the body of an adult, while his ignorance-fueled curiosity for the human race (his knowledge is quite limited) probably served as inspiration for gene roddenberry when he came up with the character of q for the next generation pilot, some two decades after this episode aired.in short, the key to appreciating the squire of gothos is this: "silly" doesn't necessarily equal "bad".

deepa mehta's "fire" is groundbreaking, bold, and artistic. a masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative, upper middle class indian households, this is a film no one should miss. shabana azmi and nandita das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible. a.r. rahman's music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film. mehta uses rahman's score and together, they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around radha and sita whenever they look to each other for support. this film is not about lesbianism as many have branded it. lesbianism is just a part of the film. it is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film off calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning.

general trelayne is a super-being who wants to play a little game with the crew of the enterprise. a lot of extremely unlikely and nonsensical stuff seems to be happening, and trelayne seems obsessed with the human practices of warfare and murder. he seems to need to experience what he imagines to be a thrill and has created a human environment (though a few hundred years out of date) in which to play out his fantasies. the environment is subtly inauthentic, and the crew immediately begins to spot the inconsistencies. pretty soon it becomes clear that trelayne is not just an immature god, but a very fallible one. regardless of how you feel about this one, stick around for the twilight zone-like ending. it is well worth it.as many have pointed out, trelayne's character inspired the more developed and amusing on-going character q - and you can see in john delancie's construction of that personality more than just shades of campbell's trelayne. it is fun to compare how the four captains we have seen coping with q all deal with him so radically differently.

i did enjoy watching squire trelane jerk around the crew in this episode, though after a while the whole thing just seemed a little too long. sure, the histrionics were kind of funny for a while, and the ending was a pretty good way to wrap the whole thing together. i think the problem was that i enjoyed seeing trelane when he was full of bravado and fun, the fun seemed to vanish when trelane became vindictive and nasty. talk about a mood killer--going from the obnoxious but affable host to the guy sentencing kirk to death! but, despite this, the episode was enjoyable and worth my time. for die-hard trekkies, this is a must-see, for others it's just a pretty run of the mill one.

in "the squire of gothos", kirk and his crew encounter a powerful super-being, who keeps the captain, "bones" and a few crewmembers captive for no apparent reason. i could be wrong, but i think this is the first star trek episode i ever saw and the program that made me hungry for more. it is not one of the best episodes, but the rock-solid premise of an alien being who putting the enterprise's crew in a corner, is the kind of situation that makes the show so much fun to watch. in a way, the super-humanoid anticipates one of star trek's most famous characters, next generation's enigmatic "q". this episode is also memorable for creating a unique situation: it is the first time uhura is part of the action and the story allows the viewer to see what an endearing character uhuara can be when the story allows her. too bad the show never fully explored this iconic figure.

an apt description by spock of an all-powerful fop into whose clutches fall the crew of the enterprise. this was one sector of space our starship should have avoided: first sulu & kirk simply disappear off the bridge; a landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and encounter trelane, a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in attire from an earth of many centuries past. but he demonstrates abilities of someone or something far beyond human and doesn't register on mccoy's medical tricorder. the officers manage to escape back to the ship but, like some bad cosmic penny, trelane keeps popping up. he brings them all back, including some female companionship, to continue his games. the dilemma now takes on elements of 'the most dangerous game' out in space and there's an exasperating, even infuriating aspect to the crew's utter helplessness before such unbridled power.what really makes this a great episode is the memorable performance by guest star campbell as the overpowering but not all-knowing alien. his character is obviously an early version of q, who was introduced 20 years later in the pilot for the tng series. trelane's confrontation scene with spock stands out among all the strange drama which unfolds. as usual, kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis, despite being quite outmatched. the answers to exactly what or who trelane is are right in front of us the whole time so, when we do learn the truth, it makes complete sense in view of campbell's pitch-perfect acting. he indulges himself constantly, preening before some unknown audience, remarking on things with a flair which is infectious but not quite right - we can't quite pin it down at first, but there's something missing here. every few minutes, his tone becomes sinister and the crew now appears to be in serious danger. in a way, you can't take your eyes off him, always waiting to see what he does next. actor john de lancie captured that similar tone as q on the next generation series.

this is a beautifully filmed movie that questions the future of all indigenous peoples, especially nomadic tribesmen. focusing on the saltmen of tibet, the film moves at pace that may make some western viewers uncomfortable. for some peoples, life still proceeds at the same pace which it has for thousands of years. this film follows a group of tribesmen on their annual two month quest to get salt. their tribe lives its life in a traditional manner (slowly by modern standards) and always accounting to their many gods. this is a remarkable film, one which will preserve a piece of what may, unfortunately, become history. well worth the time. don't be in a rush when you see it.

i think gerard's comments on the doc hit the nail on the head. interesting film, but very long. it's definitely the antithesis to the new school of flashy, sexy, moore-style docs. there is no narrator, no facts or side info interlaced, and no other gimmicks. what you see is what you get - a glimpse into the vanishing world of the saltmen of tibet. as a huge doc fan, i was surprised how much i lost attention with this film, namely due to the length and lack of dialogue. in the end though i would recommend it if the subject matter sounds interesting to you. it's beautifully shot, informative, and presents a valuable (and closing) window into the way of life of the tibetan saltmen (and women :) - all important attributes of a good doc. but do put on a big pot of coffee, it'll help.

a documentary about a nomadic tribe in tibet going out to a dry lake to get salt does not sound very appealing. but this is not a popcorn movie but a visual cultural feast whereby you partake of a rapidly vanishing morsel of humanity. the superstitions, the epic songs and poetry, the faith of a people who truly believe in following their own unique patterns of life are something the west had in the times of homer but that is now, unfortunately, completely foreign to most of us in the "developed" world. we have lost the spiritual serenity that comes from following well established patterns of life, often with dire mental consequences in our increasingly soulless society. the film makers have woven us intimately into the fabric of these materially poor but spiritually rich and scrappy saltmen. and made us see that there was more to life than the shopping mall and pop culture. so disconnect your land lines, turn off your cells, turn off the driveway lights and sit back and ease yourself into a timeless adventure.

_saltmen_ is a long film for its genre, and quite often the pace is much slower than that expected by western audiences. that being said, i enjoyed it thoroughly both in terms of interesting subject matter and the magnificent images this film contains. some of the scenery is truly breathtaking, and there is enough of interest that most should be able survive _saltmen_ with minimal use of the fast-forward.

yes!!!! fassbinder and ballhaus are at the top of their game, back in 1973! it's about the same subject, but in my opinion it's a much better movie than the matrix (1999), at least it was 200 times cheaper! very nice camera work by michael ballhaus and the wonderful "albatross" by fleetwood mac at the end. fassbinder is creating a very moody tone for the whole film. it's a shame this movie was never released on dvd. but now after 37 years they finally came to the conclusion, that this tv-movie, is not only one of the best fassbinder films (altough there are quiet a lot best fassbinder films), it's a brilliant example for a science-fiction movie, done without much money. buy it!! watch it!!

it is an interesting fact that metaphysics by platon and aristoteles, formal logic and abstract ontology form about those sciences that most people are not interested in. but then, around one thousand years after aristoteles, the computer began to usurp the human thinking, and the humans who were refusing to reflect questions of being other than biological, physical and chemical ones, suddenly felt paralyzed because they could not cope with the consequences that this computers would bring "over night". r.w. fassbinder's "welt am draht", together with tarkovsky's "solaris" and godard's "alphaville", is probably the first movie who took the philosophical questions of emerging computer science as a basis of a story to be told in a movie. the confusing questions about identities and realities are cleverly built into different interwoven criminal stories which the audience really tries to follow because it is interested to solve the cases. fassbinder was a master to sell highly abstracts contents to his public by embedding theoretical knowledge into practical, appetizing forms. the basis problem to understand is that an identity defines a reality, but on the other side, a reality also requires identity in order to be perceived. the idea of a person with multiple identities is known to us solely from the standpoint of psychiatry. however, logically spoken, the only reason why we have just one identity, is the fact that our logic has only two values (right and false). now take a logic with just one more value, i.e. with three: then, as you can easily see, you have already three identities. what happens now, when, let us say, dr. stiller gets killed? then, it is quite possible that only one of three identities is abolished and the other two remain and are able to rescue the individual from death. another question is, if a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at once. the idea, however, to display such sets of identities in a up-down or down-up way as shown in the scene with the elevator in the hotel, is misleading, since identities and hence realities are not structured in hierarchical, but in a heterarchical way. strictly speaking, there is no "artificial identity" either, since each identity is defined over two objects who share all of their features with one another. therefore, the idea of assuming that every individual has just one single identity is nothing but a consequence of ancient two-valued logic either (a second identity would imply that a person, at the same time, exists and not-exists). but now look around and see that one and the same object (which is by definition self-identical) is perceived by every subject in its own way. if therefore every subject sees an object differently, why should it no be possible for the single individual to open the borders of his two-valued individuality-corset, with the effect that different persons can exchange their different individualities? fassbinder would five years later pick up this topic in his masterpiece "despair. a trip into the light".

the sf premise isn't unique (although it pretty much was back then), but the focus is a completely different one than in other artificial reality films. especially during the first part it is an elaborate crime picture, that uses the sf premise to tell an unusual crime story in which the forced detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of vanishing characters and unhelpful witnesses who don't have to lie to be unhelpful. instead of an unreliable narrator we have an unreliable world.in part two we follow the main character's struggle for sanity and it turns more into a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation. he knows his very existence is nothing more than electrical impulses, how does he deal with this knowledge? he knows that there is a world that is more real than his, but he is trapped in an artificial world, a world where nobody can understand him. the problem of thinking of knowing something essential about the world that nobody else knows or wants to believe is a very real one that many of us can identify with. for me the film transports this hopelessness very well, with its dreary, artificial atmosphere which also supports the factual artificiality of the film's world.other than 'the matrix' or 'the thirteenth floor' it's little concerned with evoking a sense of awe for its artificial reality plot, instead it very much focuses on the psychological aspects. philosophy is only in so far interesting in that certain philosophical concepts are essential in how they shape and alter the character's perception of the world.arguably it is longer than it has to be (which isn't a problem if you are as captivated by it as i was) and part 2 runs pretty low on steam.

one of the best movies i ever saw - a classic "matrix" movie. for many years, i have been trying to get it on vhs or dvd - to no avail. the german movie/tv industry still prefers to let valuable cultural contributions (and this is fassbinder, after all!) rot away and collect dust in some archive rather than distribute it commercially (and make a lot of money with it if that is what stimulates them instead of the promotion of creative thinking). though, the wdr once told me if i paid dm 200.00 to check the copyright (non-reimbursable), and then dm 8 per minute of copying, plus the cost for the materials, then they will consider preparing a (single!) copy for me. some way to sell something! the same problem we have with many other tv movies or series like "so weit die f√º√üe tragen", "sonntagseltern", "kellerkinder", and others. excellent tv series - never to be heard of again. germany, wake up!update from march 2007: last year, i finally could get a dvd copy from the "mittschnittservice" of the wdr for about 50+ euro. great!

i really liked this picture, because it realistically dealt with two people in love, and one of them having a disorder. though the ending saddened me, i know that that was the best way for it to finish off. i would recommed this to everyone.

because it's late and i'm running short on vocabulary, i will describe this film as "beautiful and heartbreaking," begging the forgiveness of those who cringe at such cliches. robin tunney does an amazing job portraying a young woman in the clutches of tourette's syndrome - her character was absolutely sincere and convincing, and i will follow her career wherever it goes because of this film.

niagra niagra was certainly not the best movie i have seen. however., i cannot describe the way the movie made me feel while watching it and how i felt as it ended and also how i feel about it now. very few movies have such an effect on me. i like them or i do not. i look at niagra niagra as a work of art. we all see something in it and it may remind us of something or it may instill fear or fun etc... this movie had me in not the best mood. in fact it left me feeling empty somehow. i guess because the lives these two persons led were so empty in so many ways. they had no direction. their only direction was to have no direction. they had many problems to deal with and i guess needed to get away from what could not have been a happy life. but on the way things really only got worse. a steady decline from where it started. it was sad as it was so well acted and i guess we have all most likely seen someone in some situation that may in some way resemble the situation these folks were in. they might have had a good life if they had any idea how. but it wes clear they did not know what to do. so they kind of rambled to someplace they had heard about. no real goal. they had no idea how to have a goal. they had no idea how to overcome the life that was set before them. i felt bad but could not stop watching the movie. only good actors can make me feel so much about a movie that i would not like if just anyone played the parts. these two did a great job to the point you just did not see the acting. i am very impressed and want to buy the movie when it is available on dvd. you know. it left me feeling a little like leaving los vegas did. but again it is in a class of its own. not a great movie but well worth an hour or two on the right day. if you are a person who has problems i would not suggest you watch it. it could depress you. it depressed me and i have not the conditions these folks had. jimmyjoejetter

i tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch. i was immediately sucked in by the characters.robin tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this film. her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100% believable. really, this sort of thing is not easy to do. she pulls it off fantastically.we know early on this film is going to end tragically, but you cannot take your eyes off of it. the characters do stupid things, but unlike most hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it, these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head - and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters.this is just a great example of film making imho. great writing, great acting, great directing. a film for people who think film can be more than mindless entertainment.

i have watched this movie time and time and time again - each time it makes me laugh, it makes me think, and it makes me cry. robin tuney does an incredible job of portraying marcy (and i'm kind of glad that kate winslet and that other lady turned down her part) its just one of those rolls that you know that no one else could have even compared.its a beautiful love story of these 2 very different people in crappy situations that team up together. they stand beside each other no matter what, even if it is in an odd situation and crazy ways.i'll tell you now its not for everyone - out of everyone i've shown it to i'd say the results are 50/50 - but if you like it, you'll love it and want to share it with others! 10 stars all the way!

i like movies about quirky people. "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" is maybe my all time favorite, so one can imagine i had a blast with this one. it's definitely not one to watch if you want to walk off smiling. this movie is unpredictable and intense. some scenes are downright frightening, even after multiple viewings (because this kind of stuff really can happen). it will most definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride. and after you see the ending, if you're not deeply disturbed, you really should check yourself for a pulse.the acting was phenomenal. marcy, with her rather extreme case of tourette's, shifts from quirky-cute to utterly terrifying, sometimes appearing so out-of-control that she looks like the undead. seth was great, too. the focus of the movie definitely does not fall nearly as much on him as it does on marcy, though he happens to be the one that gains the most momentum as a blossoming character.it's a classic love story with some unconventional twists, and it's also my favorite love story next to "true romance." there are two bad reviews for it up here, but one of the people who gave such a review didn't have his facts straight and admitted to not seeing the whole film, while the other was just looking for some hollywood thrills without the deep characters (and perhaps was a little thrown off by the apparent shallowness of the plot, seeing as the end goal revolves around stealing a black bobbi head from a toy store). the point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something "normal" or "lighthearted". this one is messed up and indie as can be, and won't let you go until the heavy climax.

this movie is truly worth seeing - robin tunney excels and henry thomas proves that he's one of those rarities, the child 'actor' who grows up to become a real actor. the characters are perfectly drawn, and in the wrong hands because of their depth, they could have been unconvincing - but all the actors are simply astounding. the cast of this movie has to rank up there with that of "girl, interrupted" (both movies coincidentally star the brilliant clea duvall). the score and music selections fit perfectly, and there is plenty of action to prevent the movie becoming just a character study. if you want the story, you won't find it in this review, but i will say that the climax will haunt you for a long time.

not only is this a very interesting exploration of tourette's and how we react to people in our lives, it has some of the most well-filmed views of a bleak northern winter landscape. there's nothing pretty about this film, but it stays with the viewer.

wow! i caught this on ifc recently after i watched but im a cheerleader. id never heard of this movie but the description sounded remotely interesting. i went in with low expectations and now i must say this is one of the best love stories ever in film. robin tunney does an excellent job portraying a person with tourettes. the relationship between the two and just the slightest details in the film are so acurate and believable. i usually hate "romance" and love films but this movie truly touched me. i so recommend this movie to anyone with the ability of vision.

niagara, niagara is a stunning and heartbreaking story about the two outsiders seth and marcy. robin tunney gives a fantastic performance as marcy suffering from tourette's sydrome, getting sicker and sicker as the movie progresses. this movie is not very optimistic and it's very hard emotional, but at the same time very romantic. it's hard to explain, but see it and find out for yourself. it's definitely worth it.

henry thomas, and robin tunny, are a couple of the most underrated performers in the business. it's beyond me as to why they haven't received more recognition than they have. this movie is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities are.acting out the lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit odd seems to be their speciality, and if these characters ain't odd, i'm at a loss to find anyone who is.the story is funny, romantic, dramatic, complicated, and tragic. i hated the ending, but if i hadn't, i wouldn't have loved the story as a whole. so there ya go.

there are many things to admire about this film, but the thing that got me above all others was the part of an eccentric recluse, the sort of role that hollywood loves & romanticizes but which here is absolutely convincing & unlike any character i've encounterd in film or in life. also a very convincing & disturbing depiction of tourete's syndrome

i watched this movie in 75 and this movie was a kind of open mind to me about how important is to care the natur and the wild life. when i got a dog in 83, i called him truska ( in movie..avakun's dog ) to never forget this movie. by the way, i have a copy this movie, but is in portuguese language and the quality is not so good like a dvd or a new vhs ( i recorded almost 20 years ago and in slp speedy.. so the quality is not so good..)if somebody wish a copy.. i'll try convert to dvd and i can send for you ok?ot's a great movie and i agree that is a movie to be always watched.waldemar braz - sao paulo/brazil

another "must have" film. henry brandon is a favorite! i was so surprised when i learned years ago that he was from germany because he sounds & looks so typically american! and wasn't he great in "the searchers" as chief scar??!! another of my favorites, i have it & watch it over & again. now if i could add this one to my collection, it would make my day! this is a great wildlife story & film for all ages. the scenery is so absolutely beautiful & the plight of the endangered snow leopards is told with such great emotion it will spark the interest in endangered species in anyone, especially children. if i could i would give a copy to all of my grands & great grands!

this is one of my favourite films, dating back to my childhood. set in the remote wilderness of siberia at the turn of the century, a small community is stirred when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers to come down from the mountains in search of food, preying on outlying farms. in this atmosphere we are introduced to avakum, a hermit fur trapper, who lives out in the wilds, as he comes to the village to sell his annual catch to boris, his close, and rather only, friend in the village, who runs a store. at boris' request, avakum accompanies his friend's arrogant son, ivan, on the hunt for the menacing tigers. personalities crash and tempers flare as the older, more experienced avakum criticises ivan's amateur methods, an encounter noticed also by the other members of the hunt. on the second day, the hunters sight their prey and give chase. in a thick wood, ivan wounds one of the tigers, which then attacks the hapless man. avakum, seeing ivan tangling with the enraged beast, fires, but accidently hits ivan. he kills the tiger as it flees. the other hunters arrive on the scene, suspicious.back in the village, the doctor works to save the wounded ivan. avakum attempts to leave the village, but is confronted by ivan's friends. the trapper brushes them off however, and speeds off with his dog-drawn sled. the young villagers swear after him that they'll come for him if ivan dies, which he later does, but before dying explains to his father that it was an accident. old boris, upon learning of his close friend being run out of the village, straightens out the gathering "lynch mob" and goes out after avakum, to find him and set things right. and so the main story begins.a simple film, it raises the conflict of man and civilisation versus nature, mainly avakum's struggle to survive alone out in the wilderness. the winter landscape is very well filmed. perhaps the strongest element in the film is the soundtrack by jimmie haskell. very sentimental and evocative, the main theme reminiscent of albinoni's adagio. other movements reflect russian styles, as well as a couple of folk music type tunes.unfortunately, this film is not available to buy, to my knowledge, which is rather a shame. the copy i own, recorded off tv nearly twenty years ago is slowly deteriorating. this film is a must see for those who can appreciate it, if they can find it. 8/10

i managed to obtain an original bbc broadcast of this film on video and loved it so much i had to try and locate the original video in its original box; thanks go to ebay.deleted on any format since 1990, this exceptional wildlife film is finely constructed and well acted. directed by stewart raffil (mac & me), the scenes of leaping tigers running through the alaskan wilderness is nothing short of stunning and its timeless tale of a trapper trying to survive on his own in the frozen wastes with two young tiger cubs is moving on each viewing.why no major company has picked up this movie to distribute on dvd is a big wonder; but makes it that extra special to know its also hard to locate.if you find this film by chance or eventually track it down to add to your collection, make sure never to let it vanish out of your grasp. films of this calibre, as shown, don't come often.a true masterpiece in every sense of the word, and highly worthy of its praised comments, "when the north wind blows" will sink deep into your heart as soon as you see it.

i collect films on super-8, and managed to snag a full length print of this one last week on e-bay. it looks like at least for the moment, this is the only way to see this film in a country having ntsc video. i have seen it available on region 2 dvd many times, but never region 1. i just finished watching it a few minutes ago and i am amazed by it. it's a powerful testament to freedom and finding your own place in the world. the photography and music were wonderful, and i really felt empathy for some of the characters.i kind of like the idea that i was probably the only one in the usa watching "when the north wind blows" tonight! long live avakum!!

i remember this film,it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74/75 my dad took me my brother & sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england. i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies. if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me know.the cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away, would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it.

this film is one of the best memories i have from childhood. having always loved tigers my mum took me to see it. it is absolutely amazing. its is one of those films that leaves a lasting impression on you. the image of tigers running through the snow with it all spraying around is still in my head some 25 yrs on, not many films have managed that, as other comments have said photography is stunning. a must see. i have also been looking for the film for some time with no luck at all. :-(. checking amazon every now and then reveals nothing, not even listed. if anyone does know of a source, please contact me or post here. tim

78 years ago...the premiere of "anna christie" advertised by the slogan "garbo talks!" the film runs for 16 minutes and the viewers reach the climax of curiosity: greta enters the bar and gets through a long awaited transfer from silence into sound: a few seconds closing her silent era and, at last, greta garbo says a historic line: "gimme a whiskey, ginger ale on the side and don't be stingy, baby!" "anna christie" (1930) is the movie by clarence brown that introduced a great silent star greta garbo to talkies. nowadays, we can only imagine what serious transfer it was for actors and actresses. the careers of many were bound to end - something we hardly or not at all see at present. and it was no coincidence that it was clarence brown who directed the first talkie with the swedish beauty. garbo trusted the director after two of his great silent productions, flesh and the devil (1926) and a woman of affairs (1928): movies that achieved a smashing success at the box office, both with garbo in the lead. but we are in 2008 and that fact about the movie, now purely historical, appears to be of minor importance. the question for today's viewer is not what garbo's voice sounds like but if the movie is still watchable after these 78 years. in other words, we all strive to answer the question if the movie has stood a test of time. has it?when i recently watched it, i came into conclusion that, except for some minor technical aspects, including static camera, "anna christie" is still very entertaining. it's, on the one hand, a wonderful story of a life, of a reality that the young woman faces (being based on eugene o"neill's play), and, on the other hand, an artistic manifestation of true magnificence in the field of direction and acting. let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs.content: chris christopherson (george f marion), a heavy drinker, lives a life of a sailor, on a barge. although his days are filled with sorrows, he is consoled by a letter from his daughter anna (garbo) whom he hasn't seen for 15 years. she says that she will come back to him. he starts to change everything for better; however forgets that his daughter is no longer a child lacking experience but a 23 year-old woman who has got through various sorts of things on a farm in minnessota where she lived and worked. moreover, he forgets that she has a right to accept another kind of male love in her life... this brief presentation of the content not from the perspective of the main character but the one which is introduced to us sooner than anna (her father chris) makes you realize how universal it is. simply no letter from the whole text that life appears to be has been erased after all these years. cases discussed here in 1930 are still meaningful and valid...performances. there are not many characters in the movie, but there are two that really shine in the roles. it is of course greta garbo herself who did something extraordinary in her 15 year-long phenomenon, the presence that strongly marked the history of early cinema (something i have already discussed in many of my earlier comments on her films). but here, garbo is slightly different. i admit that there are moments in this movie when she does not feel very comfortable with her role. that seems to be caused by her new experience with sound in english; however, her performance is, as always, genuine and unique. but that is what everyone has expected from garbo. the true surprise of the movie for the 1930 viewers and also for us is marie dressler as marthy. she is excellent in her facial expressions, in her accent, in the entire portrayal of a drinking woman who looks at life from the perspective of "hitting the bottle." her best moments include the conversation with anna christie in the bar preceded by her hilarious talk with chris. the rest of the supporting cast are fine yet not great whatsoever (here the german version makes up for it). particularly dressler, except for garbo herself, constitutes an absolutely flawless choice.if you asked me what i like about "anna christie" nowadays, that's what i would tell you: it's a classic movie. however, there is one more thing that i must mention at the end. it is humor, wonderful wit that is noticeable throughout. although the content is quite serious and "anna christie" in no way carries a comedian spirit (the only garbo's comedy was ninotchka), there are such moments when you will split your sides. don't skip, for instance, anna and matt's visit in the fun park, particularly at the restaurant where he orders milk for her thinking how virtuous and innocent she is, beer for himself and where suddenly marthy joins them by chance..."anna christie" is a perfect movie for classic buffs and a must see for all at least a bit interested in the true magnificence of performance. if you are fed up with many of those modern starlets, seek such movies out and you shall be satisfied. very worth your search! skaal greta garbo! skaal marie dressler! let us drink a toast to the great jobs you did in the movie! skaal after all these years when wine tastes much better and your spirits are with us in a different sense...

garbo's first spoken words in this 1930 film electrified audiences and became part of hollywood legend. garbo had become a star in her first american film, the torrent, in 1926. and audiences waited til this film to see if garbo could make the transition to talkies. she did. and while pola negri, vilma banky, and renee adoree fell by the wayside because of their accents, garbo sailed on for another decade. despite the staginess of this film, garbo is really excellent, especially in the opening scene with the equally great marie dressler as marthy. the two great stars trade dirty looks and sharp words as they size each other up while they have a few drinks and set the tone for the remainder of the film. garbo was 25; dressler was 60. charles bickford is ok as matt, and george f. marion is good as old chris. marion originated this role on broadway in 1922 and also played it in the 1923 silent version with blanche sweet. this eugene o'neill play is a true classic yet, oddly, was never filmed again. anna christie ranks as one of garbo's greatest performances. and despite the staginess of the film and the grimness of the story, she is truly a marvel. see this one for garbo and dressler!

this is an amazingly well-filmed early talkie adaptation of the eugene o'neill play. its major drawback is a static camera, and as a result it comes off much of the time as the filmed play it is, which is a pity, for it's a good piece of primitive moviemaking, made at a time when sound was posing all kinds of technical problems, and as a result most films were experimental whether or not this was their maker's intention. garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as she was in her silent films, and her entrance is still classic. her voice is strangely deep, almost boyish, which only enhances her already seductively eccentric persona. as her boyfriend, charles bickford is appropriately virile,--he was apparently born craggy--and a perfect counterpart to the divine garbo. his irish brogue is not bad at all, and he seems always a natural man of the sea, very o'neill-like in his independent, brooding nature. as garbo's (very) confused father, george marion seems truly from another time. he has the sort of face and voice,--open, unmannered, totally without guile--that has vanished from the earth. marie dressler is also in the o'neill swing of things. her blank expression and intensity around the eyes speaks volumes, as she plays her boozy character as a woman at times bordering on psychosis. poetic license, perhaps, as this is not in the script, but we can forgive miss dressler's excesses; she is too good at it not to. the story ends with a movement to the next thing, as distinct from resolution, which isn't the author's cup of tea; and those who like their films neatly worked out in the end will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise. in anna christie we are in o'neill country, a place of sea, storms and fog, a feeling of all-pervading and damnable uncertainty, which we would now call ambivilance, or anxiety neurosis. rather than analyze this mood the author simply and wisely presents it, as weather, land, ocean and people intertwine and address one another in a unique language we feel priveleged to have heard.

i would say that this film is disturbing. the brutality is depicted in a very sick way, it's like a psychosis in 40 minutes. in the same time, it is a cruel introspection in human behavior. the scenes are ferocious, starting with the butchery of the horse and ending with the brutal sex scene in the kitchen. every emotion is exploited to extreme, the frustration of the butcher, the love for his daughter almost incestuous, the rage when he finds out she has been abused, every feeling is so natural and so wrong. this film delivers the truth about human nature in a very honest and brutal way. the message of the film is that one's life can change in a second as a consequence of one's behavior and that the most primitive emotions are the most powerful and can determine one's acting. i'd loved the unique manner of filming, the simplicity and the brutality accompanied with the silence in which only inner thoughts pierce through.

the short film which got gaspar noe on the movie map, introducing us to his horrific, but thoroughly interesting character the butcher, played brilliantly by phillipe nahon. noe's direction here has all the hallmarks of his later films, showing he was carving his own voice and style from the beginning. his sudden cutting along with harsh, loud noise, skipping flashbacks and many other techniques all are used to disconcert the viewer. and it certainly works. also, he is not afraid of showing violence, as viewers of irreversible will know. here the violence is equally powerful, and in the sequel seul contre tous, it is almost unbearable.the film opens with a horse being killed. it is shot in the head, and we watch it writhe on the floor, its pool of blood flowing out. we then see a human birth in all its bloody glory, the daughter of the butcher. he was orphaned in wwii, and has grown up hating the world, and everyone and everything in it. he serves his customers, but his interior monologue constantly reminds us of his thoughts- he wants them all dead. his daughter blandine lenoir, who would also reprise her role six years later, is the only thing he cares about, and we watch them grow older together. she is however mute, and the subject of bullying and toying. the butcher's relationship with her is almost incestuous, bathing her when she is old enough to do it herself etc,but this is explored more in the next film. when she is attacked by a man, the butcher explodes with rage, stabbing an innocent man in the mouth. he goes to prison, taken from the only things he wants- his shop and daughter. in the short 40 minutes we see all this and more, his time in prison and release back to his world. because of his daughter's state, autistic as well i think, she is bland, does little except stare, and is under the full control of her father. the film continues in the exceptionally bleak seul contre tous. if you can, watch these two films, this one first. it has some truly excellent acting, but is very difficult to watch because of the relentless tone.7 out of 10

this is the forty minute film that introduces us to the character of the butcher, who will later be examined more thoroughly in the feature seul contre tous. in this film, it follows the early period of his life from 1965-1979, but focusing on the late seventies. the first images are of a slaughter of a horse, then the birth of a baby, the butcher's daughter, who we quickly see growing up each year. the butcher (played by philippe nahon in both films) is a man bitter with the world. he hates many things. his anger comes to a head when a man assaults his autistic daughter. the butcher then maims the wrong man, and finds himself in prison.this film follows the butcher's life to just after his release from prison, then seul contre tous takes over from there. i watched the films the wrong way about, seul contre tous first. try and watch this little film first if you can.

"the falcon and the snowman" is the story of two young men, a cia employee and a drug dealer, who become disenchanted with united states foreign policy and sell state secrets to the soviet union. the events of the film are based on a true story.timothy hutton and sean penn are convincing in the lead parts and develop interesting characterizations. the supporting cast also performs well, notably with a performance from david suchet of hercule poirot fame as a seasoned soviet agent.the film is generally effective at setting out its premise and developing it and giving a sense of two boys caught in something they did not properly understand going in. however, it does seem overlong and cumbersome at points in the middle. the ending, however, is tense, stunning and effective. there are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack, but also unfortunately a repeated mellow synthesizer track that doesn't fit with a spy story. there are other spy films more worth seeking out than "the falcon and the snowman", but it is a decent film none the less.

director john schlesinger's tense and frantic film tells the true story of christopher boyce and andrew daulton lee, two young men who sold united states government secrets to the soviet union in the early 1970's.timothy hutton plays christopher boyce very competently. he is a young man very disillusioned by the cia's underhanded activities in allied australia. sean penn, as the doped-up, drug running andrew daulton lee, is outstanding.the competent and professional direction of schlesinger, along with some very good acting, make "the falcon and the snowman" an espionage thriller not to be missed.tuesday, february 4, 1992 - video

"the belief in the big other as an invisible power structure which exists in the real is the most succinct definition of paranoia." ¬ñ slavoj zizek this is a review of "marathon man" and "the falcon and the snowman", two films by director john schlesinger.though hitchcock and lang brought the "conspiracy thriller" to hollywood, the genre only blossomed in the late 60s and 70s, with films like "the parallax view", "z", "marathon man", "capricorn one", "the manchurian candidate", "three days of the condor" and "all the president's men". this was the age of vietnam and watergate, the public deeply suspicious of all political leaders.the genre remained quiet in the 80s and early 90s, until the "x files" tv series sprung to life. with taglines such as "the truth is out there" and "trust no one", the series posited a world of vast conspiracies and government plots, the common man at the mercy of all manners of ridiculously elaborate schemes. the only way out of the maze? "fight the future!" as the tagline of the series' final season proclaimed. it was apparently our duty to trawl through the labyrinth of information, discovering some elusive "truth" that ensured our own freedom.this trend ended with the boom of the internet, conspiracy thrillers now giving way to "conspiracy documentaries". the internet generation lapped up such independent documentaries as "loose change" and "zeitgeist", whilst in the mainstream michael moore titillated his audience with stuff like "fahrenheit 9/11". all these documentaries believed in a "secret order", a cabal of wealthy politicians and businessmen who conspire to reduce human rights and enslave the world. they struggle to create a mono-myth, linking various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single, all encompassing narrative that explains the purpose and point and future of everything.this need to "streamline narratives", to make them more "efficient", is reflected in the scientific community, who battle to create a "grand unification theory" and ultimately a "theory of everything", merging everything from quantum mechanics to special relativity into one giant all encompassing formula.so ultimately, the "conspiracy thriller" is rooted in man's desire to have control. the modern subject is one who displays outright cynicism towards official institutions, yet at the same time believes in the existence of conspiracies (an unseen other pulling the strings). this apparently contradictory coupling of cynicism and belief is strictly related to the demise of the big other. its disappearance causes us to construct an other of the other (conspiracy) in order to escape the unbearable freedom its loss causes. conversely, there is no need to take the big other seriously if we believe in an other of the other. we're therefore allowed to display cynicism and belief in equal measures. man thus seeks to assert control over a wayward universe, to create a kind of paternal babysitter (be it god, a mathematical formula, a conspiracy theory, an explanation for violence/conspiracies/murder/war etc) who provides meaning and symbolic order. the big other provides reassurances to the believer. it's a "lifestyle choice", akin to religion, in which his place in the world is dependent on sheer irrationality. the problem with most "conspiracy thrillers", from the innocent days of hitchcock's "topaz" all the way up to modern fare like "the da vinci code", are two fold. firstly, they are not incorrect in suggesting that something is "wrong" amongst the "elite" or "best people", but they are incorrect in individualizing and personalizing processes that are social, collective and systemic, an approach which implies that it is just a question of personal morality rather than social structures. secondly, and most importantly, these "conspiracies" ignore the fact that the big other simply doesn't exist. there is no symbolic order pulling the strings.some modern "conspiracy thrillers" ("eyes wide shut", "existenz" etc) acknowledge this, with their untangleable webs of lies, accidents, truths and half truths, nothing ever adding up, nothing ever making sense, the real and the hyperreal, the truth and the desire, all blurred, without any identifiable ground zero, but these are mostly films by intellectual directors.compared to these modern "conspiracy thrillers", "marathon man" and "the falcon and the snowman" are positively archaic. "marathon man" is a about a grad student (dustin hoffman) who gets embroiled in his big brother's business (roy scheider), which unfortunately has to do with spies, guns, double agents, diamonds and evil nazi dentists. scheider is suave, hoffman is excellent and schlesinger hits us with some neat visuals (the reveal of the eiffel tower is stunning), but what's most interesting about the film is the way that its various plot lines don't intersect until the 1 hour mark. even then, it takes a further half hour for things to start making sense. unfortunately, the film ends with a clich√©d showdown between the villain and the good guy, everything neatly resolved and explained."the falcon and the snowman" is a bit more ambitious. sean penn and timothy hutton play two friends who sell government secrets to the soviet union. hutton works at a civil defence contractor and smuggles information out of his office and into the hands of penn, a small time drug dealer who has no qualms selling to the kgb. penn does this strictly for the money, whilst hutton is disillusioned with the american government (particularly its attempt to depose the leader of australia) and so sells the secrets strictly because he hates how his country conducts crimes and games of espionage. in other words, the film is about a conspiracy undertaken as a response to conspiracies."marathon man" ¬ñ 7.9/10 "the falcon and the snowman" ¬ñ 8/10 aside from an oddly slapstick car crash and its clich√©d ending, "marathon man" is an effective thriller, with several neat scenes. "the falcon and the snowman" is even better, penn turning in a memorable performance.

this movie is one of my all-time favorites. i think that sean penn did a great job acting. it is one of the few true stories that made it to film that i really like. it is in my top 10 films of all-time. i watch it over and over and never get tired of it. great movie!

based on the true story about christopher boyce (hutton) and daulton lee (penn), and their involvement in selling american secret government documents to the soviets during the 1970s. boyce works for the government, and his job is to guard these particular documents, which ultimately disillusions him about his country's affairs and practices. he then enlists his drug-dealer friend, daulton lee, who has become a wanted man, to be the courier for these sensitive documents. lee infiltrates the russian embassy in mexico, and makes contact with alex (suchet), and they both begin to play the espionage game.lee's interest is purely about money whilst boyce is acting out of anger towards the system he is involved in. alex believes lee to be the inside man in the american government. things start to become array when lee's drug addiction and reckless behaviour in handling the courier position offsets both alex and boyce. lee becomes more paranoid, and the initial espionage game becomes more deadly and consequential for everyone involved.this is a true spy thriller without the cheesy action. the character motives and analysis of real-life subjects is sympathetic but very well written, and the film cleverly interweaves the real-life events with underlying political themes about human predatory behaviour. where a bigger nation uses their political power to control the smaller nations. well directed, and intense in parts, especially where the protagonists become immensely in over their heads in the spy game. timothy hutton and sean penn give amazingly riveting performances in a film that questions authority and yet there is no simple answer to the political message or the complexity of that system. the plight of the protagonists becomes the underlying message within 'the falcon and the snowman', and makes it a clever political thriller with a poignant element about society, human relationships, and the american system. great film!****1/2 out of *****!

"the falcon & the snowman" offers some of the best acting from its two leads. hutton, in a brilliantly understated role, calmly portrays the confusion and angst of a man who seemingly turns traitor for no other reason than as rebellion against his father. penn, as the co-conspirator basically just along for the ride and drug-money, explosively turns in one of the strongest performances of his multi-talented career.

in the movie, "the falcon and the snowman", when they were showing christopher boyce around the complex, the satellite in the background was the actual ryholite satellite that is now in space. trw allowed interior shots. trw also allowed both interior and exterior shots for one of the original star trek tv series. (the episode is the one where spock goes blind when a string of satellite lights are activated to kill the aliens). christopher escaped jail (lompock) and was featured on america's most wanted. he was drinking in a bar when the show aired. he said, "hey, that's me". needless to say, he was captured and transfered to a maximum security jail.

this movie is based on the true story of christopher boyce and his friend daunton lee. this fascinating story takes place around the time of the whitlam dismissal, in which during his time as a clerk for trw, christopher was privy to classified correspondence which admitted the cia's involvement in australian political and union circles. the movie shows several scenes involving gough whitlam (transmitted over us tv), where events take place which confirm the classified documents that christopher had read previously. the removal of gough whitlam was an organized cia coup. elsewhere in the film, it was mentioned that most people have no idea about the level of deception that goes on, ultimately to ensure that the us is used as a vehicle to promote certain policies at the behest of everyone else. in the current age, nothing has changed.christopher's life was profoundly affected, read shocked, by his knowledge of what and how the cia shapes foreign democracies, including the democracies of allied nations to the united states. christopher reacted, probably not in the best way at the time, by selling top secret information to the soviet union with daunton lee acting as his exchange. eventually christopher and daunton were captured and convicted of treason.on 23rd may 1982, whilst serving time in us prison, christopher boyce agreed to a one and only interview with ray martin of 60 minutes australia because it was the australian connection that profoundly affected him. it caused a furore in the australian media for about a week, then it went hushed.i liked the movie's symbolism of the falcon, and in it chris was called the falcon, and daunton the snowman (drug connection), but in reality the title "falcon" was not something that was used by chris.christopher boyce: criminal or man of conscience? you decide.resources: http://www.playitforwardoz.com/boyce.html

the falcon and the snowman is a superb example of an anti-80s film. while many other films of the decade in general lacked substance, this film is pure substance. there's nothing stylish or fake or superfluous about it. it boasts two superb performances: timothy hutton and sean penn as lifelong friends christopher boyce and daulton lee, respectively. hutton, penn, and tom cruise were a triumvirate of early 80s actors who all looked headed to much bigger and better things (all 3 starred in taps). while penn and cruise's popularity soared, hutton has been largely forgotten about, and that's a shame. actually, hutton is the first of the 3 to win an oscar for supporting role in ordinary people in 1980, but i think his performance in this movie is even more outstanding.hutton really captures the post-vietnam war rebelliousness in his character chris boyce. a failed seminary school student, chris has a love-hate relationship with his father, well played by the great character actor pat hingle. the scene where chris quotes the poem his father thought he'd long forgotten is a particularly powerful one.chris gets job at dept. of defense and uses his hatred of u.s. gov't and its foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the soviets. he gets his buddy daulton, a hyper drug-dealing self-server, in on it to be the courier of the project plans on microfilm. while chris is doing it based on his beliefs, daulton is doing it strictly for the money. the soviet liaison is excellently played by david suchet. penn and suchet have a real quirky chemistry and it's a kind of funny set of exchanges between them. but, make no mistake, this film is anything but that. it is a serious character study about pessimism, malaise, paranoia and mistrust.again, the leads make this film. hutton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as chris, a rather smart young man who had so much potential. penn, as usual, does a tremendous characterization as daulton, a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks, and most of the time doesn't think at all. the ending of this fact-based film is very saddening on several levels. a truly powerful character study.

if you're interested in learning about the 'real' side of spying, this movie is for you. unlike 007 movies, this shows how things really go down in the world of espionage. timothy hutton and sean penn both give outstanding performances in this not-so-well-known film. certainly worth watching.

for all that has been said about the subject matter, and the controversy that surrounded it, please do not overlook what i feel to be the most important part of the film: the salient struggles of everyone to keep their pride through their trials. whether dealing with self-imposed male braggadocio, a sexual reawakening, or even life itself, everybody is human.

okay, i know that's clich√©. taken on its surface, this is a bad film- perhaps in a league with "plan 9 from outer space". the dialog is suspect (but the singlish is quite enjoyable...), the plot is not quite believable, gavin's character overacts excessively. while watching the movie, somethings happen that truly make you wonder... handsome and kim making out on a tank, gwen eating a banana in a bath, just about everything gavin says and does ("psssssssssssssssycho!!"). these things taken separately are perhaps flaws. taken together, however, they are merely quirks. watching this movie with an open-mind (especially if you're not familiar with singaporean culture), and with an open-minded group of friends is guaranteed to deliver a lot of laughs and a memorable time. you can't go into this movie expecting a masterpiece, or even expecting to take anything serious at all. if you can take this film for what it is - an underdog film about underdogs, filled to the brim with its own quirks - then you should have a good time watching this one! i've already seen it three times and i wouldn't hesitate to watch it three more times!!

jacques audiard's directorial debut see how they fall aka regarde les hommes tomber is our old friend, the film with two different stories that gradually converge and turn out to be the same story after all, simply told from different sides. it's a shaggy dog story, with matthieu kassovitz's simpleton following unlucky-in-cards drifter jean louis trintignant with mutt-like devotion that even stretches to killing for him when he's asked to repay his gambling debts in kind. meanwhile, in a slightly different timeframe, jean yanne's over-the-hill travelling salesman becomes increasingly obsessed with finding the hit-man who put his cop friend into a brain-dead coma, his life, income and relationships gradually stripped away as he gets closer to his prey. yet while it may offer the perfect setup for a modern-day neo noir, the film is often more surprisingly playful, more interested in quirks of character and a slightly skewed sense of humor (aptly served by the occasional ironic captions and alexandre desplat's half-jaunty, half-discordant score) than the traditional thriller set pieces and plot mechanics.unfortunately the film is ill-served by one of the worst region 1 dvds released in recent years: the picture quality on synkronized's disc is so poor at times you keep on expecting to see the audience's heads in front of the picture like a pirate disc.

"dominion" is a good movie,but not original.it blends some elements of slasher movie and adventure flick.the setting is wonderful,the acting is acceptable and the film is fast-paced and exciting.highly recommended for any thriller/adventure buff.

this movie is a real thriller! it was exciting from shortly after the start till the very end! if you are a real suspense nut, this is the movie for you! the characters were very well developed and the scenery was beautiful. the story was very well written, similar to some others i have seen, but quite different in several ways. a must see!

this is a very well written movie full of suspense right up to the end! the setting is beautiful in contrast to the frightening action taking place there! it is not your typical suspense movie, but a movie well packed with interesting twists and surprises which leave you wanting and hoping for a sequel. i recommend this film to all suspense lovers!

michael kehoe has accomplished quite a feat, especially considering it is only his second start as writer, producer and director. generally "first timers" lack vision and direction when helming a major production but "dominion" proves mr. kehoe is going places in hollywood! set with beautiful scenery, dominion boasts experienced cast members (especially thomerson & james) who communicate kehoe's vast vision with exceptional clarity. few films can mix the slasher/horror genre with a genuine action/adventure feel, but dominion accomplished this completely. this film certainly qualifies as one of the top-notch films in both of these categories. if you are looking for fast-paced action with more than a modicum of suspense, look no further. i look forward to kehoe's future projects with great enthusiasm. well done!!!

by now, the game's stale, right?the jokes have been done. its all over. the creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone, after all.wrong.the game is still intact, the jokes are here, folks. sure, they're all rehash, but so was monkey island 2. and 1, for that matter.the difficulty is well placed, somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the ridiculously hard 2. the ship fighting sub-game is badly innappropriate, in the tradition of sub-games. and this game has the best joke of the whole series. when asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach, always select "you don't need to see my identification." its worth the price of the game by itself.

lucasarts have pulled yet another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of great games. if any further proof was required that they rule this genre of gaming, then this is it. before actually playing the game, there was a little concern about how the writers were going to keep up the pace of gags after the first two games. fears were rife that it was going to wear a bit thin.play the game and see how quickly those fears are allayed. from the introductory video with guybrush in the dodgem boat (!), to the closing stages in the funfair, the jokes just keep on coming. i was a great fan of the first two games and the other lucasarts works (day of the tentacle, sam & max, etc) and this one does not fail to deliver the quality. you will not be disappointed. (well, i wasn't.)

first i played the second monkey island game, and i liked it despite the low quality graphics and sound. then a few months later, i found out a new game was made. i tried it out and liked it a lot. first thing you notice is the great graphics. the areas are huge, colorful, and detailed, with lots to explore. the game requires you to use your brain, a lot, as always. the game is challenging, with all point and click games, frustrating. the jokes haven't gotten old a third time around. the animated cut scenes are a great addition to the game also. this is the best mi game out there, perhaps the best p&c game too! if you like cartoony games that play like a movie, get this game!

what can i say? curse of monkey island is fantastic. the story is good and solid, but appropriately silly, the jokes are hillarious, the puzzles are puzzling... you couldn't ask for more in an adventure game. the "you don't need to see my identification" bit is in itself well worth buying the game for, not to mention murray, who has become the hot topic among many of my friends (only some of whom have played the game). you will love this game. and if you don't, too bad!

being a huge die-hard monkey island fan, i fugured this one would be terrible since ron gilbert didn't make it. boy was i surprised! although it's still not as good as the first two, it has the comedy that i wanted. i was a little nervous about the new graphics, new scumm engine, and just the fact that it was on a cd. but it all came together, and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters. i especially enjoyed that sword fighting had returned. and the whole story about finding the big uncursed ring was just incredible. go ahead and try out this two-cd adventure. and now we can rejoice, because monkey island 4:escape from monkey island is coming out really really soon! this fall!

destined to be a classic before it was even conceptualized. this game deserves all the recognition it deserves. at a time when first-person shooters like quake iii arena and unreal tournament are garnering all the attention of computer gamers, graphic adventures are a dying breed. with great pun and humour, the curse of monkey island is a game that people of all age groups would enjoy. life can only improve after playing the curse of monkey island. *prediction* the sequel escape from monkey island is already destined to be a classic too. i guarantee it.

this was my second experience of the monkey island series, the full seven years after i had been shown the first game. what was my response? "oh, great, we're playing a cartoon." i'm glad my brother shut me up then and played on, because the jokes caught my attention once again, as well as armato's wonderful voice-acting of guybrush - not to mention everyone else done well (i still think cmi's elaine sounds better than emi's). the cutscenes do well to illustrate something happening, and the art of both the game and cutscenes are excellent. when we found the cd with the originals, secret and lechuck's revenge, we were both ecstatic and spent hours working through revenge - one such moment was where we just sat down and blew half a day on it. however, cmi has to be the monkey island game i've played the most, especially for the return of swordfighting and combat on the high seas. that moment when you encounter kenny and he tells you he's gone straight and then, "i'm running guns!" had both my brother and i in tears from laughter. and that's not the best part of the game, not by far.

the curse of monkey island is a brilliant video game and its a stroke of genius from the video game designers at lucasarts to have created this sequel. all the characters are brilliant, the voice overs for the characters were realistic and funny. a lot of effort went into this game and it deserves the 10 i gave in the vote, keep up the good work lucasarts!

on account of my unfortunately not being able to find them anywhere, i have not gotten to try any of the other entries in the series, although i certainly would not mind, and trust me, i have looked. for anyone who does not know, this is a point-and-click adventure title. that means that the mouse is what you use to interface with everything that you can do so with in this, though there is one particular case in this where that is inaccurate. i won't spoil it here, for anyone who haven't yet tried it. nevertheless, regardless of how little experience you have with computers, you can sit right down and try this. there isn't even terribly many bits of this where you need to be fast or have swift reflexes. heck, you can adjust the speed of the text(if you have it have subtitles on), and thus, of the talking in it, and it's not enormously awkward or forced when slow. accessing your inventory is easy, as well as combining or using items. clicking and holding down the button at anything you can affect gives three options for what to use with it(be it a person, a specific part of the surroundings or an object): hand(push, pick up, open, etc.), eyes(examine, look through, etc.) and mouth(eat, converse, etc.). this all adds up to a welcoming, friendly environment, where you can approach the plentiful puzzles(the amount of them is varied, based on which of the two difficulty settings you try this on) at your own pace, and explore and take in the dozens of individual, creatively done characters and areas in this to your heart's content. the length of this will be determined by how much time you take to do such(you'll hear no blame from me, they're worth it), and your skill at figuring out the solutions. there are a few points in this where you get to decide if you want the harder way of completing that or not. this can be enjoyed by anyone, from any age. there's no material that isn't acceptable for children. this is one of the products that help prove that that very fact does not have to mean that it is intolerable for older audiences. the animation is quality work, smooth, everything moves as it should, and the 3rd dimension honestly isn't that sorely missed when trying this. the story-telling is well-done, and you're never unclear as to what is going on. there are numerous well-directed cut-scenes, kept in the same colorful, mostly bright 2d world as the rest, with well-done camera motion. "cartoony" is an appropriate word to describe this, and not only the visual style. it can be applied to all of this. the entire world of this is very similar to, but not quite the same as, ours, with a mix of past and present, inhabited by people and filled with things that we can sort of recognize or understand at least portions of, but the absurdity makes them funny. that would have to be one of the greatest strengths of this, right there: it's hilarious. a lot of that comes from the lines spoken(what is said as well as how it is), and those who dig british efforts with focus on verbal, the likes of 'allo 'allo or the blackadder franchise will want to check this sucker out. however, there are several different types of jokes, including, but not limited to the following: satire, cleverness, dark, spoofs, irony, gross-out comedy(not exactly my favorite aspect of this) and more. there's self-awareness, with the lead addressing you, personally, and, for example, explaining why he isn't going to do what you just asked him to. there are references to pop culture through a couple of decades. almost all of it works, hardly any gags fall flat, and if you aren't in stitches during this, my best guess as to the reason would be that it's simply not compatible with your sense of humor... a situation that warrants no judgment, and if one suspects that could be the case, and wishes to find out, i suggest the demo version, where you, for free, can see if you care for the brand of play and/or laughter. the plot is well-written(nearly all of this is, really), develops nicely throughout and keeps your interest well. the audio is all excellent, crisp and well-done. the sound effects are spot-on. the music is well-composed with no exceptions. the voice acting is impeccable, with a celebrity or two. armato is fantastic as guybrush threepwood(gotta love that name), whom you control. boen is incredible as lechuck, the deceased(and still threatening) zombie villain. the designs are immensely well-done, highly imaginative and all fit. in spite of the relatively limited disposition of our hero when it comes to pirate deeds, you do get to engage in some. steer a ship, board that of others, and match blades in a rather unique, and marvelously thought up, way. the re-playability lies mainly in the choices, during dialog, etc. this is linear, with a tad freedom as far as the order goes, so the buccaneer sitting down with this, for at least the second time, has not got that large an amount of possibilities as far as being challenged by this goes, unless he or she has forgotten what to do in the meantime. ah, nothing is perfect. anyone who would care to delve into a thoroughly well-crafted and fascinating fictional universe, and crack up countless times should get a real kick out of this. the good kind, not the ones that hurt and potentially leave bruises. don't forget, kids, do *not* eat books... that is just begging for a paper-cut. i would wager a guess that those who like the others would appreciate this one, too. and they're not the only ones who may get into this. i recommend this to, apart from members of aforementioned group, any fan of this genre of vgs, as well as anyone to whom this review appeals. 8/10

another fantastic offering from the monkey island team and though it was a long time coming and had to survive the departure of ron gilbert it's another worthy installment. my only gripe is that it was a little short seeming in comparison to the previous two, though that might be because of a glorious lack of disk-swapping. roll on mi4.

the curse of monkey island has always been my favorite of the series. a vibrant visual look, an excellent soundtrack and brilliant voice-cast all create a memorable and humouristic adventure.graphics wise the game is definitely not a let-down. though some corners have been cut the over-all feel of the game is reminiscent of disney feature length animations. the gameplay is simple and even a novice will get the hang of it soon enough. the game also offers a little extra for the more experienced players with its mega monkey mode.the voice-cast is one of my favorites. dominic armato's sympathetic voice makes guybrush complete and alexandra boyd is simply charming as elaine. earl boen makes for a wonderfully sinister yet over-the-top villain, lechuck. also the game's charm is added by memorable characters like wally (neil ross), murray (denny delk) and one of my personal favorites haggis mcmutton (allan young, voice of scrooge mcduck). my hat also goes off to the late, great kay kuter and his memorable secondary-role as griswold goodsoup.michael land's tropical and wonderful soundtrack once more graces the monkey island adventure, comprising of some of the best tunes in the business. the game isn't perfect and some locales are not as well detailed as other, but i had no gripes with the simple ending of the game which i found very satisfying.

i had only written one review on imdb prior to this, as i consider most games as unworthy of the time and effort...curse of monkey island is different.having played and been impressed by monkey 1 and 2, i had great expectations for the third release...and was not disappointed. the first thing that hit me was the substantially improved graphics. don't get me wrong, for games made in 1990 and 1991 respectively, monkey 1 and 2 were ground-breaking and provided the goods well, but cmi steps up and delivers a superb cartoon-style game-play which is both fun and satisfying. all scenes and settings have been carefully crafted and well thought out, and suit this type of game perfectly. the animation/cgi is a mixture of realism and exaggeration; a fantastic combination in this case. for me the script has been crucial in the success of the previous two games. the cmi script is clever, appropriate and, above all, absolutely hilarious. added to this, the script is now audio unlike the previous two where speech is displayed in text format at the bottom of the screen. dominic armato's voice is perfect for guybrush: witty, clear and slightly naive. all other voice talents fit their characters perfectly, especially earl boen who is the voice behind lechuck. i loved every single character throughout the game: not just their personalities and wit, but the way each character is animated superbly and distinctively. whilst on the subject of audio effects, the soundtrack is worth a mention. the soundtracks for monkey 1 and 2 were both monotone, and despite this were very effective at giving atmosphere and representing a change in mood. cmi's soundtrack is, once again, a step up. each scene is complemented by a catchy, subtle, playful and piratey (if that's a word) tune. with a change in setting or mood, the music also adapts, adding to the entertainment and amusement that the game offers.the whole idea behind monkey island is to solve puzzles and problems in order to progress. this might sound easy, but is actually devilishly tricky in many places. some may be put off by the level of logic and amount of thinking that goes into monkey island, but in reality this makes the game even more entertaining and fun, and also adds to the replay value. the option of "the curse of monkey island" or "the curse of monkey island: mega-monkey" (which involves trickier and more abundant puzzles) suits players of all abilities and also gives good cause to play the game at least twice. whatever difficulty level you choose, you are guaranteed a different game each time you replay, with numerous speech options and other puzzles to solve that don't affect the outcome of the game, but are just there for fun. the most entertaining section of the game is ship combat, and the sword "fights" that follow. these were particularly well thought out and make the game completely worthwhile. add to this a stupendous story that is non-violent and suitable for all ages which will keep you hooked and wanting more until the very end.finally in conclusion, a uniquely special mention must go to the designers of this game. the way each complex puzzle and problem is thought out is simply astonishing. whilst gathering up items and objects during game-play, you can't see how each one is going to help you progress, but with a little thought and perseverance solutions present themselves, and for that the designers of cmi must be highly commended.10/10 for the best game i have ever played (not an exaggeration)

the curse of monkey island. released excactly 6 years after the success of monkey island 2. you would think with monkey island 2's wierd ending that it would finish monkey island once and for all. but, it all turned out to be a trick to lure guybrush into captivity. but enough about that, the whole jist of this is that monkey island has returned, and the voices are just phenominal. if lucasarts were to make a movie/cartoon of monkey island, this would probably be what it would look like, and sound like. it's plot is real good, and everything about it is just awesome. if you haven't heard about the monkey island series, buy the monkey island archives or the monkey island booty pack and play through all the games starting with the secret of monkey island, then monkey island 2, and the curse of monkey island. monkey island 4 was real good, but this one tops them all.

"curse of monkey island" is a treasure; in my opinion the series as a whole was the holy grail of adventure gaming, not to mention lucasarts.but to return to "curse," whats beautiful about cmi is that its not afraid to be itself. it does deviate from the first two but still remains faithful to the ron gilbert productions (if only the same could be said about the 4th installment of the series!). the voice work is impeccable, with dominic armato playing our favorite protagonist guybrush threepwood. the animation, while quite different than the classic pixelated characters, is done beautifully. it really is just absolutely gorgeous. and the music is fantastic! its never annoying and you never have the urge to turn it off.although i'm not too big a fan of romance, the romantic scenes and themes are not at all overpowering. they also have the rare ability to come off as sweet instead of cheesy. that says a lot from a girl who routinely falls asleep during chick flicks.then, of course, is the classic mi element of humor. cmi is quite adept at delivering deadpan lines, altogether absurdist humor, and simply good fun. gary coleman makes a cameo as a budding young entrepreneur, and world events are discreetly jabbed at without stepping out of the bounds of the game.its not entirely fair to compare cmi to mi and mi2 because it truly is in a realm of its own. personally i can never find a favorite between the 3 as they all are quite different from each other. however, if you want a swashbuckling good time with the flair of the classic series, i insist you give this game a shot. you will not be disappointed.10/10 stars, hands down.- emily n

a group of evil businessmen need to knock down a building to build a huge complex, but they can't remove the tenants. the tenants and businessmen with their hired thugs clash until the film ends with one of the funniest fights ever! the guy with the ginger hair who goes 'eeeeehhhh' every time he throws a punch and the other guy who poses with a knife in his mouth instead of fighting, only to be beaten off camera, make this essential viewing if you like to laugh at films rather than with them.

one of the classic low budget 70's movies, this film was found in a bargain video shop in london for only 50p. (interestingly, the package lists the star of the film as 'charles bone', who sounds like a porn star, but once the credits role it's obvious that the picture is aligned to far the right of the tv screen, so that all the cast members have the last letter missing from their names)from the moment the narrator lamely introduces us to the situation that the desperate tenants of a grimy new york city apartment block, you know you're in for a rollercoaster ride of fromage. the direction is from the 'ed wood one-take' school - if one or two extras were looking at the camera crew, then what the hell?the films finishes with a plot twist that puts the usual suspects to shame. buy it now.

this movie stands for entertanment. its the funniest movie i have ever seen. the lines, the acting. and the clothes, wow, talk about 70:s. if you ever see this little gem, buy it. its worth every penny. by the way, the opening song is awsome. if anyone know where i can find it. plese, send me an e-mail.

"death promise" is a lost 70's exploitation gem and deserves to be seen. technically somewhat of a mess and boasting a stock of amateur new yawk types, this film never bores. i highly recommend tracking this down. it's a hoot and a half.

first time i ever saw this was at a friends house. it ended up in his parents hands by a fluke; some videostore/bicycle repair shop!! went bankrupt and treats like this was up for grabs. we saw it two times in a row and almost wet are pants how hard we laughed. i've seen historical documents like ninja mission and plan 9 from outer space, and they still remain good runners-up in comparison to this one. almost 15 years after first contact it is now considered the best cult movie of all times (in my circles); i've showed it to all my friends... we now have a tradition of searching for movies in the same category: the un-rateable one.it can't be explained or reviewed in any normal way because every scene, every take, every move, contains at least one mistake regarding editing, dialouge, directing etc.for any cult-movie buff this is the ultimate prize, the gem of all gems.raiting: as for craft it can't be rated, because it would even be an insult to homemade videos of birthdays and weddings.as for pure amusement it is the funniest movie i have ever seen; funnier than any comedy ever made past or present. anything less than a 10/10 should be regarded as an insult to good sense of hum our.

'water' (2005), the final part of toronto-based indian film-director deepa mehta's elemental trilogy has been finally completed, almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element, 'fire' (1996), which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel '1947: earth' (1998). mehta made her directorial debut with a 24-minute canadian short film 'at 99: a portrait of louise tandy murch' (1975), but it was her canadian feature film about the life of indians living in canada that brought her fame back in east, her country by birthright, 'sam & me' (1991). recognition internationally came in the way of 'camilla' (1994), starring bridget fonda, along with the actress who in 1990 won an oscar in best actress in a leading role category at the age of 80, paving the way for middle-aged actresses to still have hope, for her portrayal of a stubborn old jewish woman in 'driving miss daisy' (1989), late jessica tandy. 'camilla' dealt with a friendship between two women from two other ends of the human lifespan, a may/december friendship. 'camilla' was tandy's last picture; she died the very same year.international fame followed deepa mehta in 1996 with the release of the controversial 'fire', which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing indian extremist. having already explored friendship between two women in 'camilla', in 'fire' mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women. set in modern day india, the suburbs of the capital city of new delhi, it shows two brothers and their wives, the elder brother (kulbhushan kharbanda) having joined a weird hindu sect leads a life of celibacy, faithful to his guru of sexless existence. the younger brother (javed jaffrey) is having an extra marital affair with a chinese woman (alice poon). thus, both the wives, shabana azmi playing the elder brothers wife and nandita das the younger wife, find themselves neglected in their own way. one forced to lead a celibate life, thanks to her husband's eccentricities, and the other whose only interaction with her husband is through sex, and nothing more. living in a world of in-laws and being the only two outsiders in the family, having nobody else to confide in, the two women fall in the arms of each other. thus comes the issue of lesbianism. if there were an outside man's shoulder to cry on, there most probably would have been chance for them to fall into the arms of a man, but having no one else to confide in, their need for each others support is quite obvious. it does not necessarily state that all neglected women would end up taking lesbianism, it just happened to exist with regard to the two women in this context. all in all, the movie is excellent, and delves far deeper than just two women rolling in bed. the key focus isn't lesbianism in the movie, but the plight of modern day neglected indian wives, even in the capital city, the two female characters just happen to have a sexual relationship. two years later, deepa mehta's second installment was the element of mother earth, released in india by the name of '1947: earth',yet another excellent movie by a great director, this time in the hindi language, unlike 'fire', which was made in the english language. now deepa mehta has managed to complete the trilogy, despite a lot of problems, having released the final installment recently, 'water'. no doubt it would be just as great as the other two.

after some further thought about this film, i find it's far too easy to dismiss this as the boy's dream. i have actually received some spiritual strength from northfork.......angels do exist....we definitely are entertained by angels....most of the time we aren't even aware of it..... at a point of spiritual and emotional turbidity in my life, i personally really needed this film. yes, as i wrote before, it speaks to so many......can't wait to get to heaven..."being so sick of all of the fx and formula stuff, i found this film to be genuine cinema. all i can say is it touched me in so many ways, that i still am sorting it all out. north fork is a wonderful film. one that brings the viewer's mind out of the gutter and into the heart. the spiritual aspect is so very intriguing to me. pay attention, as you'll need to use the brain and heart god gave you to follow the story. i think it's possibly a bit over the heads of some, but i feel those are the individuals it speaks to most importantly. i want to view it several more times, just so i can take it all in!the industry needs to study this film to realize we do exist.my thanks to all involved in the making of this film."

i recently attended sundance as i have often done in years past and was treated to the small pleasures of the edgy little indies, the glut of dark comedies and the now predictable portraits of dysfunction. but then i saw mark and michael polish's 'northfork' and i remembered why i so fell in love with the movies in the first place. 'northfork' sweeps across the screen with visionary daring and harkens back to the seminal early work of terence malick and the existential landscapes of antonioni. it's an impossible film to easily explain which is one of its many strengths. suffice it to say it's an adult fairy tale with many carefully layered levels of meaning. it reawakened my imagination and cast an imposing shadow over all the other films i saw this year. it is a work of meticulous craftsmanship and a sophistication of writing not seen in most american movies. i plan to revisit this film several times when it comes to my neighberhood theater. for it is a beguiling piece of magic and mystery, a haunting work where one can roam the plains of montana in search of angels and the very nature of heaven and earth. the cast performs this luminiscent piece with striking conviction particularly james woods and nick nolte who remind us of the nerve and daring displayed throughout the course of their careers. maybe 'northfork' will help us find a new wave of american cinema where excellence in craft and writing become more the norm than the exception. see it when it comes your way and take your friends for the questions will be many and the thoughts and feelings spurred by seeing 'northfork' will awaken memories of great movie once seen in your past and now hopefully may be returning with the advent of the polish brothers.

at first glance a film like northfork, a town set to be flooded in 1955 and a group of 6 characters who are sent out to evacuate the remaining townspeople, could be just an ordinary film. as we soon meet a remaining priest taking care of a sick child, a greedy land owner, we could be set up for a simple story we could all easily digest. however, when one is first introduced to this film, you notice the amazing wide open cinematography and a scene involving a church hall missing a wall that opens up to the pastures and scenic view of the mountains with cattle grazing. it soon becomes clear that after this scene and a few of the towns peoples introduction, that this is no ordinary film and no ordinary story, it is something very special and unique.at first glance things are not as clear, but the cinematography and landscape that the viewer is witness to is stunning, and the characters that inhabit this small soon to be extinct area are just in word amazing. it's what can either draw you in closer to this qwerky film, or either have you bored sitting there waiting for something to happen.the films deep spiritual and dream like qualities, give it a slow and methodical approach which i am sure will bore some viewers, but if you are patient with it and see the bigger picture, the film is great to witness.rating 8 out of 10

imagery controls this film. the characters, although interesting, ultimately take a back seat. the first scene i remember is a framed black and white shot of the ocean, that then opens to full screen and color. the bubbling of the water gives way to a small coffin that breaks the surface. the theme of the movie here, being that death can be accepted and brought into the realm of the living.water as an ultimate consciousness, as a tool of god, is used to here to force people to get their "houses" in order (judgment day). the dead have to be accounted for and lifted to a better place. whatever one has left unresolved or unsettled, will be washed away. there's no clinging on to the past, to a buried memory of what was.this movie has been compared to o, brother where art thou, and the threat of water and its use as a cleansing force is similar to that film. what's different in this movie is that the coming of the water is knowable and so, again, the emphasis is on what needs to be done with the here and now.i agree that the some of the scenes are reminiscent of a david lynch work. take, for example, the dinner segment with the deep-voiced and androgynous waitress. one gets the same surreal feel from the setting and odd character as one does with the backwards talker in the scene from fire starter. the difference is that lynch attacks us with the image to express the psychological processes of a troubled character, whereas this film seems to use surreal elements to create a moral message. the men in black suits can't have anything they want-they must be patient and accept what is available.

it is a rare and fine spectacle, an allegory of death and transfiguration that is neither preachy nor mawkish. a work of mature and courageous insight, northfork avoids arthouse distinction by refusing to belong to a kind. unlike the most memorable and accomplished film to impose an obvious comparison, wim wenders' 1987 wings of desire (der himmel √ºber berlin), it sustains an ambivalence in a narrative spectrum spanning from the mundane to the supernatural. this story of earthly and celestial eminent domains in the american west withholds the fairytale literalness that marked its german predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels shedding their wings with obsequious sentimentalism. its celestial transcendence, be it inspired by doleful faith or impelled by a fever dream, never parts ways with crud and rot. this firm grounding redounds to great credit for writers and directors mark and michael polish.

keys to the vip is one of the most entertaining, informative and hilarious shows that is on television right now. the idea is original, and well executed, as it manages to preserve the reality aspect, but still remain entertaining. all of the judges have a razor wit. they're not the nicest at all times, but if you're looking for comfort, go watch a chick flick. say what you like about validity of the show, but it is absolutely real. i know people who have competed on the show, and they have confirmed this. if you want to laugh, watch this show. it is on of the best comedy shows ever made.

keys to the vip is bs.rob cavaliere vs justin in season two. i went to school with rob cavaliere and adriana doria. you may remember her as the last girl he was "picking up". this was when the "angry girlfriend" came by, they made out and "left the club together". they were good friends at father bressani chs in woodbridge.whether or not rob planned it or they asked him to do it, men should know that what they are seeing is not real and the guys on here are douche bags. especially that episode.one more line to fill space.

i thought this movie was awesome and the two guys nick and aaron are hotties!!!!! i wish i could watch it over and over. i loved the plot and whole concept of the movie. it is great and i wish i had taped it last night.nick i love you!!!!!!

i am from texas, and live very close to plano where the actual deaths occurred, so i might be a bit biased in saying that "wasted" is a film that you just can't get out of your head.stahl, phoenix, and paul all play their characters very realistically. you truly believe that they are everyday high school students who just happen to be heroin addicts. the drug content is handled very graphically as well - although everything that happens in the film serves a purpose, and each moment the characters spiral further downward is heartbreaking. i definitely recommend this film to anyone. once you watch it, it sticks with you!

black tar can't be snorted there's a documentary: dark end of the street about s.f. street punks and b.t. abuse - not bad - quite heavy. in wasted there's this stuff that looks like coke but should be something else... no big deal. black tar can't be snorted there's a documentary: dark end of the street about s.f. street punks and b.t. abuse - not bad - quite heavy. in wasted there's this stuff that looks like coke but should be something else... no big deal. black tar can't be snorted there's a documentary: dark end of the street about s.f. street punks and b.t. abuse - not bad - quite heavy. in wasted there's this stuff that looks like coke but should be something else... no big deal.

i saw this a good while ago, but i just cant get over it. i have looked everywhere to try and find out where i can get a copy of it but i have not been able to get a hold of it. i really reccomend this movie and if anyone has any info about how i can get a copy then let me know. thanx

i watched this movie the night it premiered on mtv. usually to me mtv movies are kind of stupid but this one was so good. summer phoenix is an amazing actress and i thought that nick stahl was good too. if mtv started showing more movies like this i would probably enjoy the channel a lot more.

spoiler begin the movie focuses on three friends, samantha (summer phoenix), chris (nick stahl), and owen (aaron paul). the movie starts out with sam and owen as the drug addicts, and chris, the track star, as the one who takes care of them. as things get increasingly worse at home for chris, he asks sam what the drug is like. sam is out of rehab and sober by this point and tells him it makes everything better. chris then catches up with owen and they start using. it takes chris two times till he is a " full time member". after some trouble with a dealer and a confession to sam, she gets in again. so begins the downward spiral for them. chris od's when he breaks a promise to sam (i want some of the movie to be a surprise). he dies, sam gets in to college to be an architect, and owen gets arrested. so ends the storyspoiler ends. minor spoilers throughoutnick stahl is amazing. he will have an oscar one day. his portrayal of chris was heartbreaking. he was the only one that felt real in the movie as far as drug use goes. aaron paul who played owen acted as if he were on speed not heroin. summer phoenix was fine, she is talented but what can i say nick stahl stole the movie. his drugged eyes, his slow movements, everything was perfect. the writers needed to show withdrawls in the movie. that is a main reason why people don't want to quit. other then that there are hilarious scenes (the mall scene, and the backstreet boy scene,man stahl nailed the reactions right on the head.), touching, sad scenes (like the scene between sam and chris in her bedroom after he gets beat up, i bawled, and the park scene.). it was realistic too. like s am using again when chris wanted to flush the drug down the toilet, and chris using again after he goes to own's, even though he had been clean for two weeks, the pull was too strong. it is all realistic. watch the movie for a great cast, great music, and a semi- truthful account of drug addiction.

this movie was amazing. never before have i seen such a film that brought me to the harsh reality of drug use quite like this one. there is no glamorizing, sugar coating, or glorifying heroine. this movie shows the true struggles, pain, and loss people go through when dealing with this drug. good film, decent emotionally packed acting, and a great storyline. a much watch!

this was a bold movie to hit indian cinemas when it was released. the first movie to perhaps openly depict lesbian tendencies amongst indian women. the leading actress of indian cinema shabana azmi added substance to the movie with her hot passionate scenes with nandita das.the movie oozed with sexuality and the director used sex in the best way possible. the sex was not for erotic purposes but was in the context of the movie. the scene where nandita das loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in indian cinemas.good acting by all the actors especially nandita das amidst criticism from the indian public

i thought this was a beautiful film. it is not my favourite of his films - chungking express holds that spot - this one is quite different from anything else i have seen of his. it is slow (but not annoyingly so) - it takes its time and ponders the characters.. there is minimal movement in the frame - the camerawork is wonderful. the acting is great. the film feels like a long warm comforting drink.

the plot of "in the mood for love" is simple enough: a married man and a married woman (though not to eachother) slowly develop a romantic attachment to one another. the film's pace is numbingly slow and precious little actually happens between the two. yet the backdrop of hong kong in the early 1960s and director wong kar-wai's keen sense for capturing the beauty of the setting as well as the principal characters make this film a joy to watch. actors tony leung and maggie cheung are both excellent and wong kar-wai has done an extraordinary job in capturing the feel and nostalgia of the past (something so many films and directors try to do but usually fail miserably). there are so many little details that add charm to the film (a trademark of the director) and the colors and cinematography are what send this otherwise simple story over the top as a marvelous cinematic achievement. 9/10.

the chinese film title of "in the mood for love" is "fa yeung nien wah." it can be interpreted as "those blossoming years (that once were)."the whole film is a well-composed piece. a complex love story told in simple visual approach. writer-director wong kar-wai has choreographed a dancing of the hearts - it's she, it's he, it's love. i can hear galasso's theme: dum dum-dum, dum dum-dum, and the strings - almost like heartbeats. a piece with prelude, stanzas, and epilogue.director optimized the use of music (michael galasso's score, nat king cole singing in spanish, and chinese songs/tunes). the rhythm and lyrics prompt viewers to what she and he is feeling/thinking rather than verbal dialogs. i can hear nat king cole giving us the clues: "aquello¬Öojos verde" (that thing, fling, eyes green) plays when the two meet, and "quizas, quizas, quizas" (perhaps¬Ö) when she's undecided.nostalgia pervades throughout the film. design details plentiful: handbags and ties; japanese rice-cooker novelty; the ridged pattern green glass cups & saucers and plates (i remember dad treasured those at home); mahjong session; kitchen area; bedroom furnishings; the thermos for the take-out noodles that she swings when she walks. maggie cheung, slender and shapely, looks exquisite in those fashionable patterns & colors of the traditional chinese woman clothing - 'cheung sam'. every change of her dress denotes another day, another time in the story. wong kar-wai is resourceful that way.the scenes may be of the same place, but it's of a different mood, advanced to the next stanza. up and down the stairs to the won-ton noodle stand. standing by the wall around the corner to the apartments as the rain pours. along the corridor, back and forth, to his writing corner.trivia: so she helps him with his writing of his martial arts novel. maggie would be able to help as she's been in kung fu/martial arts movies. "eastern three heroes" 1992 is a fun action movie with maggie cheung (thief catcher chat), michelle yeoh and anita mui as three super heroes fighting evils.if you appreciate tony leung's performance, don't miss "chungking express" 1994 (in the second segment - romance rhythm with a difference), and "happy together" 1997 (an intense, emotionally colorful painting of friendships, faith, and fate), both written and directed by wong kar-wai.being able to understand the cantonese and shanghainese dialects, and having visited the official site, i realized the epilogue was not quite completely translated. here's sharing my version of the chinese captions:it was kind of an unbearable encounter all along she has kept her head lowered giving him a chance to get closer he didn't have the courage to be closer she turned around, walked away.that time and place had come to past. all that belonged, no longer exist. _______those vanished years, seemingly separated by a glass gathering dust, can see, yet cannot grasp.all along he has longed for all that's past if he can break through that dust-gathered glass he will walk back into the times long vanished. ________wong kar-wai's "in the mood for love" brings to mind the simple poetry and wisdom of rumi, the sufi philosopher - the 'inner and outer,' the 'spirit and body' of life, love and living.[resend. revised. ruby_fff 2/22/01]

how do you describe perfection? in-the-mood-for-love! maggie cheung and tony leong practically dance on the screen and give stellar performances that stay with you hours after you've left the theatre. every scene in the film resonates with the powerful combination of superb cinematography and shot selection, top-notch acting, and the sensual soundtrack. nat king cole singing in french absolutely sets the tone for the whole movie. maggie and tony look marvelous, with maggie slinking about in some truly glorious cheongsams and tony always looking dapper. i've seen this movie several times already, and everytime i see it i find something new to rave about. love it!

sensitive, extremely quiet paced love story between a married journalist and his young and atractive neighbor, she too also married. they lived their love for a time but the obstacles and the fear of hurting their families and children invites to a separation. a reflexive look on delicate question like love, friendship, honor and loneliness, always present in human lives, whether you are an american or a chinese. i give this a 7 (seven)

one of, if not the most visually beautiful film i have ever seen in my life...there is so much to learn here in how to play with the camera, color, costumes and set up a shot. the work that went into the official film web sites in english and french also give you a good idea of the sheer beauty contained in the film.

having seen many of wong kar-wai's other movies (happy together, fallen angels, ashes of time), i knew what to expect coming in to the theatre; the cinematography would be lush, the use of space and perspective would be varied, the acting would be superb, and at least one of the characters would be consumed by an ineffable loneliness. these are, after all, precisely the techniques that make wong kar-wai's art what it is. what i was not expecting was the degree to which i was drawn into a film that some reviewers dismissed as "unfinished" and compelled by characters who "seemed consumed by ennui."i find it interesting how people can be so utterly unmoved by a film that so vividly displays emotions and settings many of us take for granted or work ardently to forget: the overwhelming sense of grief stemming from being betrayed; the guilt aroused by the thought of becoming no better than the betrayer; the mundane yet profoundly intimate moments of relationships, where the need to express oneself verbally is utterly superfluous. this is what wong kar-wai attempts to portray in the film and what he achieves so well.too many americans are consumed by the need to have every moment of a film filled with stock dialogue; witty banter, disaffected sarcasm and overwrought confessions seem to be the pinnacle of the "best" american film has to offer. wong kar-wai sees things very differently. instead of the character needing to keep the audience apprised of her every feeling, perception or belief, wong's characters make their feelings and understandings known clearly by facial gestures, body positioning, and, yes, silence.if viewers merely contemplate this film from the standpoint of character development and action, then they may be disappointed by what it has to offer. if they are willing to let themselves try and intuit what the characters are feeling, then they may feel quite differently about what wong has to offer them.

"in the mood for love" a teasing allegory of loneliness and longing. here is a film without sex, or even kissing -- and it is no doubt one of the sexiest and definetly the most thought-provoking and psychological romance i have ever seen.telling the story of two people who coincidentally, live in the same apartment, and are a door away from each other. the film, like and unlike "random hearts," is about how two people come together via the affair of their two lovers. only once they receive this news, they take the time to think about the consequences of an affair, and each other's feelings towards having just broken-up -- and whether or not the two people are willing enough to fall back in love.what's terrific about the film is the way director wong kar-wai, presents each character's way of dealing with loneliness. with maggie cheung's character, he'll show her, in a repeated montage: leaving work, going home, watching her neighbors gamble, head to the noodle shop, leave the noodle shop, and bump into her attractive age-equal, played by tony leung. this is a clever, if not subtle and knowing technique to present loneliness. for it is when you are alone, when you find yourself falling into a loop. this movie worked for me because i can identify with that feeling.

as with many of wong's films, a lot of people find them to be boring and confusing. well i like them and i like this film too. i went out and rented it on dvd and i watched it 3 times. it is a very subtle movie that provides an intoxicating experience. for those who did not enjoy it...... you just wasted 2 hours of your life.... too bad...muhahahahaha.

what an awesome film!!!!!!!! i came out of the theatre feeling stunned. the film that i had just seen was one of the best films i have seen in my life. i had my eyes glued to the screen. it's very symbolic, visually lush, beautifully shot, and gorgeously told. it's basically about two people who move into a flat and live next door to each other with there partners, who are assumed to be having an affair with each others partners. assuming this, our two heroes act out what they think their partners are getting upto. there is an obvious repression of feelings for each other, with the use of vouryistic camera work, body language, and symbollic stairways. it's a visual feast, and hard not to like. some of the story gets slightly confusing but that's nothing. the ending is one of the most beautiful (and anti-hollywood) endings i have ever seen in my life, and visually amazing. the films haunting score adds to the mood. i highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind, and respect. what a superb film.

for a long time i did not know weather i liked this film or not. this is surprising, because i usually do know, but because the film did not go anywhere, i was a bit confused.two people move into a somewhat communal household setting. finding their spouses constantly working or away on business trips, their attention, out of sheer loneliness, wanders to each other. after a platonic love affair, the male lead played by tony leung chiu discloses that he has a mistress on the side. su li-zehn, played by maggie cheung is hurt, even though their love affair has not been physically consummated. chiu leaves the country, only to come back years later, when everything has changed.for the cynic's part, the film is correct. by never actively or actually touching the part of love, but only approaching it, the film, admittedly says more than so many others have on the subject. it is also true, i think, that nothing good could have come if they did go on to have the affair. at least that's the feeling i get.if we are to believe it, however, when garica marquez writes that "...love is a state of grace; not the means to anything but the alpha and the omega, an end in itself," then this film falls miserably short of this, as do all others. or, if you are inclined to entirely incomplete minimalism, hits it right on the mark. what films in history have achieved, approached, or sustained this phrase, if for only a short while? my honest feeling in memory is that about two. when harry met sally suggests effectively this romantic perfection; and the getting is all in just getting there. it is interesting that in when harry met sally, this is done in the course of wooing, rather than in its attainment. can't anyone say anything good about love after it has been achieved by two individuals? nicholas spark's recent film the notebook comes closer to this perhaps than any other film; are we to believe that once love is achieved it flies of the radar only to exist in perfection in some other dimension, or, more true perhaps, becomes latent vehicle for other ends? in the mood for love is an honest film,with gorgeous and generous cinematography worthy in all respects of the best that almodovar has to offer, yet all it manages to say in the end is that "life is sometimes like this." now this is by no means a diffident thing to say, especially if said well, but the problem really comes at the end of the last act when kar wai wong tries to round out the film by relating, only for the second time, a broader historical theme that plays in the background of the relationship which has just taken place. this is a worthy effort, and the variation on the musical motif played throughout the film is rather brilliant, but the theme's relatively spare indictment plays too little to have much more than a superficial effect on the holistically inclined audience, leaving the viewer to split the difference, a mistake in any film. a director should know where he is going, and how to get there. but in all honesty, it is only one wrong turn. however, as anyone knows, all it takes is one notable imperfection to spoil the perfect barrel of honey.the effort, though, is definitely worth while; trying to let a historical theme broaden and round out the film and raise it beyond the micro-meaning of the couple, but without any real foreshadowing, it is the crucial mistake. in a word, and unfortunately, it is too little too late. it is also, i think, too much of a challenge for the non-asian viewer not familiar enough with china's history to appreciate completely this sweeping stroke.

i admire deepa mehta and this movie is a masterpiece. i'd recommend to buy this movie on dvd because it's a movie you might want to watch more often than just once. and trust me, you'd still find little meaningful details after watching it several times.the characters - except for the grandmother perhaps - are all very balanced, no black and white. even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists, there is also empathy for the other characters.i think the imdb rating for the movie is far too low - probably due to its politically controversial content.

joline (heather graham) sets out after her husband carl (luke wilson) who disappeared to clear his head about himself and their marriage. joline, who is committed to their marriage starts her journey to find carl, yet on the way discovers a lot about herself. on her trip she encounters a bountiful of interesting characters who unknowingly help her find her way.in my eyes this is a classical road movie, which moves just at the right pace (some viewers may find it too slow). throughout the movie it keeps its humorous note while joline responds to the craziness of the world around her with a warm, knowing, sometimes sad smile. all actresses and actors give wonderful performances and the musical score is immaculate. 9/10

some people drift through life, moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye; others latch on to a cause, another person or a principle and remain adamant, committed to whatever it is-- and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it. but we're all different, `made of different clay,' as one of the characters in this film puts it, which is what makes life so interesting. some people are just plain crazy, though-- and maybe that's the way you have to be to live among the masses. who knows? who knows what it takes to make things-- life-- work? writer/director lisa krueger takes a shot at it, using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed-- and how one `gets' committed-- and obsession, in `committed,' starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy, too. her name is joline, and this is her story.	admittedly, joline has always been a committed person; in work, relationships, in life in general. she's a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what. and when she marries carl (luke wilson), it's forever. the only problem is, someone forgot to tell carl-- and 597 days into the marriage, he's gone; off to `find' himself and figure it all out. when joline realizes he's not coming back, she refuses to give up on him, or their marriage. maybe it's because of that `clay' she's made of. regardless, she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him, which she does-- in el paso, texas, of all places. but once she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, giving him his `space' and not even letting him know she's there. she considers carl as being in a `spiritual coma,' and it's her job to keep a `spiritual vigil' over him until he comes to his senses. and while she watches and waits, her life is anything but dull, as she encounters a young woman named carmen (patricia velazquez), a waitress at one of the local eateries; carmen's `grampy,' (alfonso arau), who is something of a mystic; t-bo (mark ruffalo), a truck driver who has issues concerning carl; and neil (goran visnjic) an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her. for joline, it's a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about carl, but even more about herself.	there's a touch of humor, a touch of romance, and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot. and krueger presents it all extremely well, delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining. her characters are very real people, with all the wants, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story. we see it from joline's point-of-view, as krueger makes us privy to joline's thoughts and therefore her motivations, which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold. that, along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates, makes for a very effective piece of storytelling. there's an underlying seriousness to this subject matter, but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy-handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters. and the result is a well textured, affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life.	heather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation. she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable, adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person, and one that is real. and for this film to work, it was imperative that joline be viable and believable-- and graham succeeds on all fronts. her screen presence has never been more alluring, and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes, is enough to draw you in entirely. it's all a part of the character she creates; there's an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance, who she is inside and out. she's a likable, agreeable person, and because you've shared her innermost thoughts, you know who she is. it's a good job all the way around, beginning with the way the character was written, to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life.	as carmen, patricia velazquez is totally engaging, as well. her performance is very natural and straightforward, and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character. she has a charismatic presence, but is less than flamboyant, and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down-to-earth. she is refreshingly open and up-front; you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back, but is totally honest on all fronts, and that, too, is part of her appeal. and, as with joline, this character is well written, and velazquez brings her convincingly to life.	overall, there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including those of luke wilson, casey affleck (as joline's brother, jay), goran visnjic, alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as t-bo, who, with very little actual screen time, manages to create a memorable character.	the supporting cast includes kim dickens (jenny), clea du vall (mimi), summer phoenix (meg), art alexakis (new york car thief), dylan baker (carl's editor), and mary kay place (psychiatrist). a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture-- reflecting upon who we are, where we're going and what we really need-- `committed' is an enjoyable experience; a ride definitely worth taking. 8/10.

its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires. what does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms? one husband finds outlet with the immigrant - since immigrants don't belong or aren't accepted, they don't need to conform and dam their desires. the other husband looks for solace in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness. it fails - of course - and he breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons. sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires. the mother in her still couldn't find the strength to destroy his myth. she sees him as a child who is glorifying himself in his lust-control but should she give him the opportunity to finally grow up? both the wives find courage and togetherness through their shared rejection by their husband. but the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept sita's desire. a decade and more of receiving care was not enough to break the shackles of her culture.seems like it was easiest for the househelp to let his desires flow - since he's anyway damned by his culture - being at the bottom of the hierarchy. since there is anyway no respect and expectations, might as well taste sin.

englar alheimsins are very good movie. she happen on a mental home in iceland. ingvar e. sigurdsson is in a leading role and is good. other good actors in this movie are baltasar korm√°kur and bjorn jorundur. i like this movie she is very good. i voice with this movie.

this film is based on a true story. the author of the novel bearing the same title, einar m√°r gu√∞mundsson, had a brother, who turned mentally ill. i found this film very moving, following the main character's path down into illness, to see how he tries to cope with life after diagnosis, and how he makes friends at the mental institution, it all is very convincing. there are quite a few splendidly funny incidents also in the manuscript. the title of it gives nothing away concerning the story. you must watch it to understand ... and listen to the music, which is twisting and turning your heart and soul upside down and back as the film moves on. a must-see for everyone.

this movie is great. best acting i have ever seen in my life. ingvar e sigur√∞sson is the best icelandic actor, and of course hilmir sn√¶r and bjorn j√∂rundur. great music and sound. cold hard reality about a struggle of a man that has a lot of problems and the people in his life. black humor mixed with great acting and this european art movies style, it works, it comes together in a the best icelandic movie ever made. i say to you." see this film, you will not regret it". i gave it 9 stars. if you see one icelandic film in your life...see this one

this movie is stunningly free from storytelling. it's a pure experience where the music overshadow the visual impression. - words cannot of course enough express what should be expressed, but it is the requirement of the chattering classes that chatter is put forward, entered into production lines of mediocrity and therefore a necessity in order to express any sensible thought or opinion about something which should not need to be degraded by chatter. therefore these elaborate opinions are put forward to satisfy those empty minds which need to be filled by noise that you will not find however hard you try in this movie.

if this film doesn't at least be selected for an oscar nominee for best foreign film i'm going to stop waking at nights watching the event. fridrik thor fridriksson has proven that money isn't the key to making a good movie but originality. out of a cold country comes a warm but thought-provoking film of a mentally ill man and his struggle against an insane world. after an insight like this, you question whether or not the man is crazy or the world he lives in.

the movie angels of the universe is a pure masterpiece and it proves once again that you can make a brilliant movie on a low budget, e.g american beauty and blair witch project. the director fridrik th√≥r fridriksson gives the novel englar alheimsins a new life on the white screen. the movie is a breakthrough in icelandic film making because it's the biggest and the greatest movie that has been done in iceland.the music in the film, played by sigurr√≥s, is very symbolic for the film, it is absolutely brilliant. i recommend everybody who are able to think to go and see this film as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed. i would bet on this film to win the best foreign film award next year ¬ñ all over the globe!

this film very succeed in the film festival in karlovy vary, czech rep. logically. it' s based on a very good book, excellent actors, good camera, the best director and icelandic. it was probably the most black comedy i've seen.i really do recommend it to you.

this film by fri√∞rik √æ√≥r, director of children of nature, is powerful. it has great music by sigurr√≥s and good acting. it shows how sad insanity as a disease can be. there are many good jokes but the humor is dark. if that is not a problem then you should see this film. note though this is not a comedy but a drama.

having a close experience with one such patient is probably the best reason why i had my heart rushing throughout the entire film. intense, sensible, moral and revealing, and don't forget to check out the marvellous sound track. really good.

the movie is about paul(p√°ll) a young man who sinks into the harsh world of insanity and his stay at the mental hospital "kleppur" and his friends. victor(viktor) who during his education in england started to think he was adolf hitler. peter(p√©tur) who took to much lsd and tried to fly of a roof top the fall left no broken bones or physical damage only insanity, he is obbsesed with china. oli beatle (√≥li b√≠till) oli has spent most time at the hospital although viktor is slightly older then him, he claims he wrote every single beatles song and send it to them by telepathythe novel is better then the movie and covers all of pauls life from birth to his death, there is a long time since i saw the movie but if i remember it right the movie doesn't cover pauls childhood."englar alheimsins" is funny,sad and powerful if you haven't seen it watch it now! and read the novel first it makes the movie better

this movie i've seen many times. i read the book , englar alheimsins which was written by einar m√°r gu√∞mundsson who received the scandinavian book awards for the work. the movie does not start on the same place as the book starts. it happens in reykjav√≠k and the main character, p√°ll is young and having a good life with his girlfriend. but as she breaks up the relationship with him, he starts to get some headaches which make him annoyed and angry. and soon he starts to have big mental problems and then the movie begins. soon he is puted in the icelandic mental hospital called "kleppur" and there you get to see some great characters like viktor who thinks he is hitler and √≥li who thinks that he writes all the " the beatles" songs and sends them to them with mind transporting. ingvar e sigur√∞usson who has the role of the main character p√°ll does is so work so well that it leaves you breathless. also the music in this movie is mad by sigurr√≥s and just for the music's cost you should see the movie. overall a great movie meant to be seen.

first at all: if you like watching movies i recommend you not to watch this one. why? afterwards you won't appreciate any other movie so easily anymore...actually i don't wanna give rise to any excessive expectations but it is almost frightening how perfect, intense and beautiful this work of einar gudmundsson is. when in most movies there is at least one aspect spoiling the whole thing, like good actors but horrible dialogs or a nice scenery but low budget cinematography ¬ñ in ¬Ñangels of the universe" there is nothing of this ambivalence. really everything is just great, even (and not least) the soundtrack with the magnificent sigur r√≥s.in this story about pall, a student that goes schizophrenic after being dumped by his girlfriend, especially the dialogs (and monologues) deserve some attention: together with (and sometimes in sharp contrast to) the plot they range from depressing and fatalistic to the whole opposite of comical and totally absurd. what is more, they are often (with quotes from hegel and shakespeare) of such a poetic beauty that the movie almost drifts into a surreal sphere and is only saved to the real world by its incredibly authentic actors.one of the other comments was already referring to another point: this movie is no trivial entertainment for relaxing in the evening. despite of several comical reliefs in between it is largely disturbing, partly cynical and bitter, and most of all sad. it is a modern poetry about a life of insanity with all its emptiness, rage and solitude.finally: when you've seen the movie ¬ñ watch it again. there are some great visual metaphors and allusions in it that you realize only when you look twice and connect them with the ¬Ñmoral of the story". and of course: read the book, it contains a lot more of the small funny stories in between and also makes you understand some things in the movie a bit better.

reading the other comments here at the imdb, i had very high expectations before seeing 'angels of the universe'. i wasn't disappointed, and giving the movie an 8, i would say that i can justify that grade.the movie has some incredible acting, especially by the main-person, pall. the supporting actors are also doing a very good job like the patients in the mental institution, the parents and the siblings of pall. the music is also worth mentioning, supporting the movie throughout, giving depth and feeling.although the movie is very scandinavian, it doesn't leave out some humour and has a sort of objective authorship about pall's life. still, if you want to see a cheesy comedy or something light-weight, this is not for you. it is a story about people with mental problems, about the way they are being dealt with in society - but most of all, a story about pall.i recommend this movie to all movie connoisseurs. it is one of the best movies that has ever come out of iceland, if not out of scandinavia.

it is the best film i have seen in the last 5 years. surely, it will be in the same row with such masterpieces as the platoon, apocalypse now, the doors, the dog's heart (russian film). really, the play of the boy and his parents is so good that you can't even say that they "play". no, they live as if it was happening to them. notice the smile on there faces when the main hero agrees to go for a walk with them. the hate and love in one piece. and the final scene!really, i'm still under impression of that film. it's very hard, even impossible to combine the humor and the tragedy, but if you succeed (and frederikson did) the impact would be twice strong.i compared it with "one flew over the cuckoo's nest". i like this film either (and the novel itself is good, too), but after frederikson's movie it seems simple. (the same difference i noticed after i watched the film "american history x" and "romper stomper" - the latter is deeper). i mean milos forman only showed the material point of view of the problem. you watch it, then you say yes, it's a good film, i like him, i don't like her, and that's it. but "angels" leave you a wide base to think. there are no bad and good boys in the film. cause each of them have the right to behave in the way they do. like the girlfriend of one of the patient. of course she's young and is pregnant and that is a problem for her that his husband is in the clinic, but the feelings and emotional experience of her exfriend are even stronger (the result is his suicide). why ask him what have he done? aren't you insane yourself to ask? why do not support him, help him, understand him? finally, it is even funny when those people talk to each other. they say genius things! there are a lot of things i would like to say about this film, but i'm not so good in english. but i'm sure, those of you, who have watched the movie, understand me.good luck!

it is 1969. phoebe(camilla belle) is an 11 year old girl growing up with an idealized vision of her 19 year old sister faith(cameron diaz). faith is the doer, the truth-seeker, the fixer of all the wrongs in the world. then one day, phoebe and her mother gail(blythe danner) receive word that faith is dead. faith has killed herself. both phoebe and gail are overwhelmed by this news and, although saddened, gail mourns. phoebe can't let it go. phoebe decides to go to europe and find out what happened.it is now 1977. phoebe(jordana brewster) is 18 and decides to go to europe over the objections of her mother to discover the truth. when alive, faith was inseparable from a man she called "wolf"(christopher eccleston). though wolf claimed not to know anything about faith's last days, phoebe convinces him to tell her everything. within days, wolf realizes that he hadn't let go of the past either and he joins phoebe on her pilgrimage to portugal.in the end, wolf is able to tell of faith's decent into drug abuse and his own guilt at not preventing the suicide. although angry, phoebe realizes in the end how human and fragile faith really was.i liked this movie. i'm old enough to remember the bank robberies of the red army and i was 10 in 1969. this story was familiar ground for me. i can still remember young men trying to decide if they should go to canada or not to avoid the draft.the story is simple, but probably occurred several times in real life during that period. camilla belle was enjoyable and fun to watch as she portrayed the young adoring sister excited by what was happening around her. jordana brewster slid easily into the role of the older phoebe. blythe danner was the ever supportive mother, a role she is all too familiar with on american tv, unfortunately. i would have liked to see her with stronger material to work with. cameron diaz played the immature anarchist perfectly. though at times, her performance of a 1960s activist seemed to come off a news reel. of all the characters, it was christopher eccleston's wolf, that made the most growth. when we are introduced to the character at the beginning of the movie, we can see he is a worldly man. he is a patient and kind man filled with anger at the world's injustices. in the end, he realizes the direction he and faith are headed is wrong and begins to "grow up" deciding he should fight against injustice in his own way. faith refuses to join him in this and it eventually leads to her death. eccleston's wolf is the most real of all the characters.i recommend this movie. it was enjoyable and thought provoking. "the invisible circus" is rated tv-ma, but there is very little cursing, sex or violence in it. the subject of the movie is the reason for the rating.

i caught this on late, late mexican cable and i have to rant about it. the title was translated as "secretos" (secrets). well there's a secret that has an important part in the movie but come on, ! we are not stupid. we know there's a novel behind this.anyways, the movie is pretty interesting and it's carried by it's solid ramatic performances. the always beautiful and stunning jordana brewster and christopher eccleston deliver great performances and have such great chemistry between them. cameron d√¨az is also good although she has minimal on-screen time. blythe danner is perfect and his last appearance in the movie is touching, sad. great performances. jordana's character and her sister's ex-boyfriend travel to europe in order for her to deal with his demons and understand why her sister died. through flashbacks, we learn the sad truth and we can't help but feel sorry for the whole family. the ending is truly moving. so there's nudity but it's minimal. in fact, the sex scenes are artsy and do not intend to be steamy or sexy.to be honest, i kept watching it for joranda brewster's on screen charming and beauty. and i ended up liking the story and the dramatic presentations. give this movie a try if you like solid dramatic features. great movie. the last, last scene was very sad.. the two little sisters through flashbacks.

i've seen this film three times and each time i appreciate it more. i think jordana brewster should have received an emmy nomination for her real and natural performance. many of us who were phoebe's age at this time the story takes place will understand how real it is. life for most of us is neither softly glowing romantic or harshly cynical pessimism. it is a blurred balance, and this film captures this balance. it is well constructed, too, with so many fine details in its composition. like the film or not, judging from the extraordinarily high ratings it gets from the demographic of females under 18, we can know that this movie reveals some important truth about how young women see themselves in the world.

the plot of this film is not complicated. a very attractive young girl goes to europe in search of the reasons for her older sister's suicide ten years earlier. there she meets up with her sister's former boyfriend and together they travel to all the places her sister went, and gradually the reasons become clear.but what makes this film so special, and soar above the limited plot, are the beautiful portrayals of the characters. although the older sister's boyfriend is a drop-out hippie, he has noble ideals, moral standards and incredible strengths. and although the older sister, who we see in flashbacks, shares these ideals, she doesn't have a sense of limitation or balance, of how much is too much. and although the younger girl is fiercely loyal to her sister's memory, she gradually finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was only a normal girl, after all.the most special moment in the film is when the young girl and the sister's boyfriend finally stop fighting their attraction to each other. i can't recall ever seeing more beautiful, touching, romantic tenderness in lovemaking in a film!in all these ways this is a truly beautiful film, a film to be treasured, and to be seen again and again. 9 out of 10.

so it isn't an epic, but for people experiencing anything similar(sibling suicide) it might be an interesting way of therapy. animaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time wellspent. for some reason, it hasn't really caught on in the audience,something i do believe is a result of the main theme. why did shecommit suicide? clearly, this is hardly something that usmoviegoers will flock to, had it been an european production itprobably would have reached its audience in a much greaterextent. it is however, a movie that although the realism tainted by ashimmering romanticized glow, gives the viewer a whole heartedimpression.

i cannot for the life of me understand why the rating here for this movie is so low. this was one of the most beautiful films i have seen this year. it really struck a chord with me. i had been anticipating this film for several months and i thought to myself, there's no way it can possibly live up to the expectations i had for it...seeing as how i built it up in my head as much as i did. well needless to say, not only did it meet my expectations but it far surpassed them. jordana brewster and cameron diaz were excellent in every way. their acting superb by far. they were both in their element and completely natural for the roles. the locales were absolutely gorgeous. every shot filmed was perfectly captured and fit the mood and atmosphere beautifully. i found this film very touching and took it very close to heart. i would even contemplate saying this could be one of my all time favorites. at the very least, certainly i could see it again and again.i swear i couldn't find one fault in this film. it's hard to say that about any film. i would highly recommend this one. it's touching, it's meaningful, and it says a lot about human nature and family.10 out of 10. well done by all.

when i watch this movie i too get excited when seen bed scenes of miss world. she has beautiful and charming body. when cute lady do bed scenes and show her fully nude body... i think male have hard to resist....i think its time for cute girls like hrishita bhatt also do nude scenes. at least no one wants to c nude body of ugly women like seema biswas to c in bandit queen.i concur with what mallicka.b has said. the movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. emotions aren't conveyed properly. i guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. in my view, tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of aishwarya rai. in some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. i also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes. i'm a bitter critic of aishwarya rai :) can't help it; sorry for that. 'raincoat' was a good movie by rituparno ghosh. and i saw choker bali after seeing raincoat; i was not at all impressed

i saw this movie at the locarno film festival in italian-speaking part of switzerland.aishwarya rai is good-looking.i rate this movie 7/10 because of its nice moments.* spoilers ahead *it has some really nice cinematic moments in it, specially at the end.though my general feeling is this is too long (over 2 hours and 40 minutes) and containing too much dialogs. and nearly no dancing at all.clearly a bollywood movie like lagaan or devdas is quite a different kind of movie compared with chokher bali.

it is more a subtle story of the fact that in indian household how most decisions are taken by the man, how no attention is paid to the desires of the lady, for example how even when the husband and wife sleep together it would be a test for the husband whether he can control his desires, not to give the woman pleasure. and in such a type of scenario, women invariably have two choices, either to accept all this and take it into their own life, which is usually the case or not accept this and try to mould things to satisfy themselves, which makes a movie!fire is a brilliantly directed story of the second option, which women choose for themselves, no sacrifice, not to serve anybody else, rather a decision for their own good. somehow the whole idea of justifying lesbianism didn't find an acceptance in the indian audience but if one looks the whole movie from an angle of self-expression, then the whole debate doesn't even arise.

it seems a lot of europeans and americans see indian movies for the wrong reason; i see some people are complaining that this movie did not have any dance sequence! a class apart from their hindi counterparts, bengali movies tend to be more realistic. rituparno ghosh is one of the best young directors in india, being widely known for his choice of subjects for the movies and the strength of his scripts. 'chokher bali' is a perfect example. a faithful adaptation of the nobel laureate tagore's novel dealing with the pursuit of sexual pleasure of a bengali widow, the director gives a new dimension to the much acclaimed and controversial work.

its very tough to portray a tagore novel along cinematographic lines.and if you forget an obscure production of 1967 then its the first time that chokher bali has been done on a grand scale. overall the sets looked fantastic with the right touches for making a successful period drama.prasenjit,so used to doing crass commercial stuff made a good effort.i saw the bengali version and found that aishwariya's voice was dubbed,which made her dialog delivery a bit poor. while the director did a good job portraying each of the characters with finesse,yet there was very little in the way of meaningful plot,probably a lack of the story itself.however the development of the characters including those with minor roles seem to be the strongest point.its tough to make some tagore stories into films,as only the visual parts seem to get realized.

the hindi version of the film is 121 minutes. set in bengal in the early 1900's, the film (based on tagore's novel) draws an analogy between the british colonization of india and the subjugation of women. an educated and beautiful woman, binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage, but she does not accept the constraints imposed on her as a widow by her society. the film has a beautiful look to it but perhaps aishwarya rai is out of her depth in portraying binodini's strong character with its subtle combination of idealism and deviousness. binodini's idealism does not come across, and as a result, the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried.

i like the wind and the lion very much. it was a good movie. i thought that since i'm young and it was made so long ago i wouldn't like it all that good, but after i saw it, i was amazed of how good it was. my family liked it, my friends liked it, everyone i showed it to liked it. i liked it because it showed how arabs and people in morroco was treated during the early 1900's, by the germans, french, and even the americans. if i was a high school history teacher, i would definitely show it to my student's, from a high schooler's point of view. i give this movie a good 10 out of 10. my grandparents liked it so much they bought it for themselves. my little 3 year old cousins even sit down and watched it.systemoffell

"subconscious cruelty" has to be one of the most disturbing films i've ever seen. "salo" and "cannibal holocaust" didn't bother me that much, but there's a strange psychological element to "subconscious cruelty". this film invades your subconscious mind with shocking taboos, surrealist visuals and one of the most unsettling film scores and sound designs. repulsive at times; yes, but its visual flair can be compared to avant gard directors such as alejandro jodorowsky, dario argento, dusan makavejev and david lynch. take the most extreme elements of those 4 directors and throw in the graphic violence of a film by luico fulci, and you might be able to guess what you're in for. the film is divided into 4 parts. the first part "the ovarian eye" is real short. a narrator tells us about the the parts of the brain and its functions. then a nude woman gets her stomach cut open and an eyeball is pulled out. the second part "human larvae" is kind of like the film "eraserhead" but with incest. it deals with a man's sexual obsession with his pregnant sister. where's frued when you need him? the third part is my absolute favorite. it reminds me of "begotten" and jame's broughton's 1972 short film "dreamwood". in this segment people have sex with the earth. men hump bloody holes in the ground, girls masturbate with tree branches. the branches bleed when broken. watch in horror as a man gives fellatio to a knife sticking out of a woman's vagina. these people really know how to get in touch with nature.the last part of the film is the most disturbing and at times it borders on hardcore pornography. this part of the film made me think of jodorowsky's "the holy mountain", "sweet movie" and "cannibal holocaust". i've never been more disturbed in my life by what i witnessed. a business man gets his privates pulled apart by fishhooks. yuck and ouch! two women urinate on a christ figure and proceed to cannibalistically eat him like communion bread and sodomize him with a tree branch. poor guy. the last part was so extreme that if i ever watch the film again, i'll have close my eyes or slightly fast forward. karim hussien and mitch davis are obviously very talented, to think they did this project in there early 20's. hussein went on to direct the tarkovsky influenced "ascension" (2002) which is a much better film and he co-write the screenplay for nacho cerda's after dark horror masterpiece "the abandoned". "subconscious cruelty" is a fascinating and unsettling journey; with images that come from the unthinkable realm of everyday human minds. well, sort of.

finally watched this shocking movie last night, and what a disturbing mindf**ker it is, and unbelievably bloody and some unforgettable scenes, and a total assault on the senses. looks like a movie from the minds of lynch (specifically eraserhead), buttgereit, and even a little of "begotten". what this guy does to his pregnant sister is beyond belief, but then again, did it really happen or is it his brain's left and right sides doing battle. that's the main theme of this piece of art, to draw a fine line between fantasy and reality, and what would happen if the right side of the brain that dreams and fantasizes overtakes the reasoning and logical left side. and the music in this movie is unbelievable, a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect. even though this movie is totally shocking and pretty disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes (including hard core sex) you will ever see in any movie, i viewed it as a work of art, and loved it. and that music still amazes me, i have to try and find the soundtrack if is available. watching "subconscious cruelty" is a real event, and not something the viewer will easily forget. and a note to gorehounds, this is a must-have.warning... be careful buying this movie, because some prints have fogging on the graphic sex scenes and extreme gore, especially the copies from the japanese release.

first off - this film will not be for everybody. there are scenes of extreme graphic violence and "disturbing" images that by their nature alone will turn off many possible potential viewers. obviously from the reviews on this board - subconscious cruelty has divided those that have seen it. i'm among the ones who liked it very much for several different reasons. i feel this was a very ambitious (and quite competently pulled off...) undertaking for a bunch of 18/19 year olds with no budget and little experience. i think that each aspect of the film - the direction, the acting (though the character's performances are more likened to stage or free-form performance because of the nature of the film...) the production, the fx, the score/sound design - all are far superior to many films i've seen that exceed these kids budget and experience ten-fold. i honestly haven't been this impressed with an "art-house" style horror film since nacho cerda's genesis...first off - i'm not going to pretend to understand and/or grasp all of the graphical content in this film - but knowing that this wasn't a straight-narrative type of film when i went into it, i wasn't disappointed with how it played out. subconscious cruelty is 4 relatively short vignettes that all sort of revolve around the theory of right brain/left brain lust/anger/psychosis vs. restraint/compassion/"normalcy". to very briefly give a synopsis of each "chapter":ovarian eyeball basically just has a naked girl who has an eyeball cut out of her abdomen. i'm sure it's symbolic of something - i don't think i was paying that much attention at that point and this one blows by pretty quick. the next "episode" - human larvae - is a nihilistic, horrific, genuinely creepy story of a guy who's both in love with and repulsed by his pregnant sister, who gives into his growing psychosis which leads up to the shocking conclusion of that particular chapter. human larvae is the best of the bunch in my book, and will probably get under your skin. the dead-pan narrative dialog accentuates the growing tension as you know something horrible is going to happen - but you're not quite sure what it is. do yourself a favor and if you are interested in seeing this film - don't do too much research on it. come into it with an open mind and an iron stomach and i think you be pleasantly surprised, especially with this particular episode.rebirth has a bunch of people in a field screwing the ground and blowing trees and stuff. apparently an "arty" interpretation of the rape of the earth or something to that effect. not bad, but this one is pretty short too and i sorta missed the point on it...and right brain/martyrdom seems to be about religion and religious hypocrisy and also along with human larvae, has some of the "hardest" images/messages of the whole feature...ovarian eyeball isn't anything to write home about, mainly because of it's very short running time but does make a decent segue into the insanity to come...and rebirth is also kind of short and not quite as thought provoking, but human larvae (especially) and right brain/martyrdom are so off-the-wall and well done that they more than make up for the other parts. i think the main reason that i liked this one so much is that as "shocking", "repulsive", "violent" and "excessive" as it is, it is also done very beautifully and you can tell this was a real labor-of-love from those involved. nothing about the film feels cheap or rushed, and even if the content isn't completely decipherable, it's undeniably original - and that alone up's the points some in my book. not that every "weird art-house" film that has an unintelligible plot should be praised for it's "originality", but subconscious cruelty is the type of film that i do think i'll watch a few more times in the near future to see what other interpretations i may gain from it. again, this film is absolutely not for everyone - with some very extreme scenes of gore, murder, rape, incest, sacrilegious imagery, etc...that is definitely there to shock the viewer into taking a harder look at this film. i have to say it worked for me, and i'm anxiously awaiting the hussain/cerda collaboration that is rumored to come next. check this one out if you have the stomach for it - 9.5/10

this is one of my all time favourites. all the actors do a great job. comparing this movie to "lawrence of arabia" does no justice to both movies. "the wind and the lion" levels a much lower budget with fantastic actors portraying heartwarming characters in a heartwarming atmosphere. action and beautiful pictures are provided as well, which all together guarantees a favourite movie to me.

"subconscious cruelty" has to be one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen.still it's extremely grim and gory at times,so fans of politically correct mainstream horror garbage shouldn't bother.the film mixes many wonderful visuals with plenty of sleaze and gore.it is extremely odd,vicious and disturbing,so fans of bizarre cinema won't be disappointed. my favourite segment from "subconscious cruelty" is "human larvae" which shows us a twisted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister.the birthing scene is particularly nasty and not easily forgotten.the last segment "right brain/martyrdom" has to be seen to be believed.it's incredibly harsh and blasphemous with scenes of genital mutilation and grisly torture.we see jesus christ captured by three naked females who mutilate him,ripping flesh from his chest,licking a wound on his knee and pissing on him.there is also a jesus statue with a projection of a swastika on it."subconscious cruelty" is a truly memorable film that should be seen by fans of extreme cinema.check it out.

the movie ". . . and the earth did not swallow him," based on the book by tomas rivera, is an eye-opening movie for most people. it talks about the exploitation that migrant farmworkers go through in order to survive.sergio perez uses impressionistic techniques to depict rivera's story. he uses sienna and gray-scale effects to depict some of the scenes, and he uses specific photographic techniques to make the scenes look like they took place in the 1950s.perez also gives life to the film by using time-appropriate music, including balladeering and guitar playing.i feel that it is a good film to view because it shows in detail how migrant farmworkers live, what they do for entertainment, and their beliefs.

i was very moved by the young life experiences of a man who rose so high in the academic world. a hard life surrounded by the love of a close family and extended family of companion workers created a person able to succeed in the world. for the most part the hispanic culture is shown as i have always observed and admired - hardworking, optimistic, and truly family oriented. the points of religious superstition were quite authentic to the catholic church. without a doubt,the actress who played the mother deserves an academy award. her prayers for her missing son moved me to tears. i will recommend this stunningly thoughtful film to my friends and family.

recently finally available in dvd (11/11/08), severo p√©rez' film...and the earth did not swallow him (1994) is based on one of the most highly regarded and discussed novels in chicano literature. tom√°s rivera's ...y no se lo trag√≥ la tierra/ ...and the earth did not devour him (1972) is still generally acknowledged by many critics and serious readers as the classic chicano novel. originally written in the spanish characteristic of south texas and also translated into english, rivera's novel continues as an indispensable presence within the chicano literary landscape. perez' film, originally made as a highly-rated american playhouse pbs production has taken some time to be released in dvd. one can only wonder about this matter because its high quality is not an issue. the film, and now dvd, however, remains, so far as i know, the only cinematic adaptation of any chicano novel and clearly is a tribute to earth's incredible staying power. this cinematic version also strikes an exceptionally deep-rooted nerve that is, i maintain, both specifically ethnic, yet also generally universal. doubts about earth perhaps might have arisen because it is too "ethnic," too alien from a basic american mainstream, too much a "foreign" art indie, too limited in economic resources. yet, perez in his version of art, in my opinion connects very effectively, artistically, and creates a sharply-etched portrayal of a chicano migrant collectivity that focuses on daily family life. as far as a production done with relatively limited economic resources, its lovely cinematographic work and haunting music go much beyond its available funding. simply viewing the film makes manifest this film's (or dvd) artistic value.briefly, ¬Ö.and the earth did not swallow him portrays in a neo-naturalistic way the plight, the suffering, and the despair of chicano migrant laborers as they follow the crops northward from south texas to minnesota in 1952. the local priests bless the beat-up, overstuffed vehicles of these chicano laborers who can no longer find work in the area and must follow the agricultural trail of the migrant worker northward. this chicano collectivity, like the depression-era joads in steinbeck's the grapes of wrath, forms an epic tide, driven by economic need, a survival instinct, and anguished despair, and ultimately a barely flickering faith. a tribute to these people of the earth, a collective hero, the dvd is centered on a focal family, and most especially emblematic is a young protagonist within the family, a boy, perhaps twelve or so. this work then, also, functions as a bildungsroman. ultimately, the viewer's sense of identification is generated through the experiences, subjectivity, and the struggles of the protagonist. poverty, alienation, child labor, illness (sunstroke and a pregnancy death), discrimination, school absenteeism (the boy's escapism from the bullies of discrimination is spent lying down in a lovely, peaceful cemetery) are laid bare as matter of fact¬óyet, also symbolically. worse still, the problematic conflict between the youngster and his mother goes beyond socio-economics and political conflict, into deeper realms of psychology and metaphysics. in a desperate but artistically rendered struggle, the youth battles his mother, an archetypical mexican-american traditionalist, a representative of god's will, content with prayer, resignation, consolation, and acceptance. the rebellious youth cannot believe in a god that would permit such evil and suffering to be visited upon them. how can god be so cruel, he asks, since his little sister is certainly purely innocent, as to come down with serious illness in the fields? at this point, the boy must overcome obstacles even more daunting than poverty and discrimination. the issues now include death, doubt, and despair, and lack of meaning. and he has few resources available to him¬óstrength of character, his own will power, his intelligence, and a powerful survival instinct. in this desperate, but artistically rendered struggle, the unnamed youngster, the central figure, feels the necessity of his enduring, of his achieving a heightened sense of meaning, and, the viewer hopes, a renewed and strengthened life force that can serve as an inspiration to chicanos and others.this stark battle makes use of a plot device just touched on by the original work to tie the episodic work together: missing immigrant laborers from mexico who leave no trace upon their death, although this dvd deals not with mexican but mexican-american migrant laborers a highly existential work: anguish and despair; a quest; a focus on a project; and redemption¬óall under the auspices of free will in spite of the deterministic socio-economic and religious circumstances.perez has a long list of credits basically as a documentary filmmaker. his many awards are confirmatory. the producer paul espinosa is also well-known and has been likewise honored for his work. the 1994 film, in fact, won and deserved a number of awards: first place, audience favorite at the santa barbara film festival in 1995; first place at the cairo film festival; and a number of other well-deserved awards.in my opinion this film and dvd, earth, by perez is the best chicano film that has been made.

i first saw all the rivers run on tv when i was a kid and loved it. it was great seeing a mini-series that was set and filmed in a place so close to home. living fairly close to echuca, i loved going to the historic port to see the paddle steamers. the first one i ever had a ride on was the pevensy(philadelphia in the movie). i love how it takes its time to let the events unfold. nothing feels rushed as most movies are today. the acting was fantastic. all the rivers run was perfectly cast and i just love the crew of the philadelphia. mac is always amusing to watch with his trademark raw onion sandwich after a big night out. easily deserves a 10 out of 10 and is one of my favorites mini-series of all time along with the dirtwater dynasty.

as an adventure mini-series, this is about as good as it gets. i viewed it when it was originally shown on hbo. sigrid is totally believable in her role as philadelphia, and the whole production was first rate! see all 400 minutes of it if you can. i highly recommend this mini-series. amazing that i can't rate it officially, but for you readers/users i will let you know it's a solid 10!

sigrid thornton (seachange) was seemingly born to fill the role of cato's philadelphia gordon, in this story that is often compared with margaret mitchell's american civil war classic gone with the wind. waters (heaven tonight) is in arguably his best role also as her larrakin love interest, and the two leads head a wonderful australian cast in this, arguably the most well-known and best-loved of australian miniseries. it's an outstanding production all round, though don't try watching all of it in one hit, and it deserves to be remembered as a magnificent portrayal of life in pre-federation australia. rating: 8/10

i have to hold barney drilling my head every day; well.. i guess there must be reasons. first, i'm convinced that our kids are not stupids, they are just kids, but they know (my 1 and a half years old son "selects" what to see) what's nice or disgusting. did you see the news? do you think your kids have to know the reality as it is? maybe..or maybe not; we (the adults) have the responsibility about what we want for our kids, and what to teach them. a film of drug dealers? news about massacres in middle east? of course, the kids must know there is a real life, but... they are kids; let's give them some mercy. what do you want for them? if you wanna have kids trained on weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor, go ahead, impose them lethal weapon, kill bill, any manga's anime, tell them santa's a depraved who enters through the chimney directly to violate them. i want illusions for my son (don't get me wrong, i'm not saying barney and friends is the best; in fact, the show have a lot of defects, i read other comments and i agree with most); maybe the happiness is made of dreams, or illusions. at least, i want to teach him to grow without fear but cautious, that learns to think and believe that everything is not serial killers or hijackers, whom they're reasons to worth to grow. that, at least, he can be a little happy with his own dreams. so, parents, don't underestimate your kids; they know what they want.

i have seen this show when i was younger. it is a really good show to watch. it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old. barney is definitely super de duper. b.j. is pretty funny. babie bop is very cute. the kids are very cool too. this show is about learning about numbers kinda like sesame street but different type of show and characters like barney the purple dinosaur, b.j. the yellow dinosaur with a baseball hat on his head, and baby bop the cute green dinosaur with a pink bow. the first one that started was very old barney and friends show. but then the second one was different to be new episodes. also the last one in the 2000 was new scene of barney's park. they also have a show of barney at universal studios in florida where you see barney, b.j., and baby bop and then when the show is done you get to go play, shop and meet barney. it's a very good show watch this show when you learn about many things you will like it the movie, and the live show at universal studios florida.

i can understand how barney can be annoying to some, but the hatred he gets is very ridiculous. barney was made simply right from the beginning and simplicity isn't bad, especially for the young ones he entertains. i personally find this show to be very underrated period. barney & friends is a very educational show in my opinion and even 17 years after its debut (and nearly 21 years after the character's debut on home video), he proves time and time again that he still appeals to young children. maybe less so than in the early 90's where barney was the hannah montana of the time, but he's still a classic. as a fan of barney myself, i feel that i should defend him in a way that doesn't seem like spam. the way the purple guy teaches things may be very simplistic and unrealistic, but would you rather have them hearing about war? be thankful some one (a costumed dinosaur, but still) is there to comfort kids and let them be kids simply. in this day and age, i feel that we rush our kids to grow up and barney is there to say you can still be a child at heart. in addition, many of barney's lessons on current episodes about plagiarism, being honest, and yes... even death, could appeal to everyone, not just his target audience. besides, our children need to learn to be kind and respect others for who they are, and he helps them do that. in short, barney may be annoying to some people and i completely understand why, but cut him some slack. all he and his friends (along with hit entertainment, his production company) are trying to do is help kids not only learn necessary skills, but to have fun and to also look at the positive parts of life. if more people listened to their children's favorite character and viewed him through their eyes, maybe we wouldn't be so negative about him and possibly life itself.

when i reviewed the video for a local magazine, i called it "the greatest achievement in the history of the american cinema." that was not wholly tongue in cheek. tw&tl remains milius' best work, and it's sad that he has so little opportunity to work anymore. however, tw&tl remains a striking exposition of what once was known as the american character, largely on the strength of brian keith's superb portrayal of teddy r. (obviously milius--and keith--admired tr tremendously to make two films about him, including "the rough riders.") it's hard to fault this film at any level: a splendid balance of action, levity, relationships, and the serious topic of america coming of age in the world. furthermore, tw&tl has exceptional appeal across the board: note the stats showing it rates best with under-18 males, females 18-29, and over 45! clearly candy bergen struck a responsive chord with women as well as men.

ok. is barney the best children's show of all time? of course not. but in some of the comments left by other members of imdb you would think it was a multi million dollar production with high class actors and a ridiculous budget for special effects. well guess what? it's barney for god's sake. he shows children good behavior, good manors and that it's ok to be who you are. for those of you who find him annoying that is because you are not five years old and the show was not meant for you. to the imdb member who wrote the review on the first page i think you may have gone a little too far. did you actually describe a sesame street character as "down to earth"? grow up everyone, this is a great show for preschoolers and actually does help children learn in a fun and creative way.

i was a bit surprised to see all of the hate comments on here. sure it's not the best kid's show, but don't people stop despising barney this much after the fifth grade?okay, everyone hates barney. okay, i think his voice and songs are annoying. okay, he's kinda creepy and strange. i'm fourteen years old, so i know well enough. but here's the thing. kids? they love this show.when i was a little kiddie of two or three, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anything else. nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. face it, that's how toddlers are. even the most patient ones can't sit still long enough to give their parents a break. there's too much to do and see and explore, too much trouble to get into.and then came barney. i don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that's so amusing to children, but they sure do love it. i know i did. i was hooked on the show, and wanted to watch it over and over. yes, the songs kind of drove my parents nuts, but to be able to watch their kids learning, and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span, it's worth it. i learned my abcs and 123's, the magic words and brushing your teeth. i'd grown out of it by five or six, of course, but by that point at least i was a little more patient, and gave my parents a break.my nieces and nephew all went through the barney stage growing up, much to their mother's delight. i know what keeps barney on the air. he entertains. of course there's big bird, ernie, and oscar, and they're great, too. but at the toddler stage, it seems that more kids prefer the big singing dinosaur. and that's enough for me.

barney is about "imagination" what you guys do not have if my preschooler never wanted to play pretend like they do in that show then i would be worried. what 2 or 3 year old actually gets all that anyways its all about the colors and the singing. for those of you saying that all they do on barney is eat junk food and recommend sesame street better well what about "cookie monster" thats all he eats but i haven't seen anyone comment that one. i do agree that sesame is a better educational show but barney is just like a show for fun don't be too serious if you didn't like your child watching tv and worried about them understanding things you don't believe then you shouldn't be propping them down in front of the tv in the first place because all of that is fake everything is fake actors are fake so why don't you take your fake brains and put it to use and think if you have a problem with a fake television show for kids then turn it off and play with them yourselves and teach them what you want them to learn not big bird or bert & ernie or barney someone who used to watch all those shows and turned out fine.

i don't understand why everyone is hating on barney. if you hate the show so much, then don't watch it! its stupid how everyone is changing the "i love you" son to "i hate you." if you don't like it, fine. whatever, thats your opinion. but there is no point to degrading the show, when it isn't even that bad. ok, so its corny, and yes, it has its flaws, but its a kids show. kids don't want to be sad and miserable, they want to be happy. and barney helps that. and even in the show, there are moments of sadness and anger and etc. and yes, barney uses magic. but the kids see barney as a figment of imagination. kids need a place to escape to express themselves. the world is a miserable and hard place. we all need a place to express ourselves, and be happier. barney does this to us. this show is great. i watched barney when i was younger. yes, some people find it stupid. but i watched it, and i'm top of my class. it might not necessarily make you smarter, but that's not the point. i believe that the point of barney is to provide a place where kids can be kids and the spirit of childhood can be expressed. where imagination lives on. so many teenagers now are unimaginative and are scared to express themselves. barney helps encourage that. barney helped me to not be afraid and to just show myself for who i am. i'm a sophomore at high school now, an ap student with a 4.0, a drama student with a love for theater and art, and with a new baby cousin who loves barney. i watch it with him and enjoy it and sing along with it. yes, its corny and silly, and whatever, but its great for kids. who wants to be an adult who doesn't have time to have fun? im a kid at heart and i love barney. its great for kids and those who are a kid at heart.its a great show for babies and toddlers. so stop hating. say that you don't like it, but stop it with the "dumbest show ever" or "barneys a load of bull" or whatever. keep it to yourself. take a chill pill or whatever. here's something: i never liked sesame street. but you don't see me going: "grover is a load of bull" or "cookie monster should die" or whatever. i hate all of the bullss**t that people say about books or movies, like barney or twilight. if you hate it, ok, whatever. no one cares. don't go saying hate things about it, cuz you might just offend someone.

yes barney is nonsense now but when i was a kid it made perfect sense.i haven't gotten any smarter but i enjoyed it. as a child i was mocked because no one could say my name so i changed it. ever since i was 4 i've gone by the name tina from barney because i could relate to her being from a different culture. i'm 17 now and barney is a huge part of my life . ...my name came from it.... i cant dis the show i grew up with no matter how stupid it seems now.i don't care if i get blocked i have nothing more to say. they shouldn't make the minimum 10 lines because some people just don't have much to say. ok done

mighty like a moose is one of many short films director leo mccarey did starring charley chase. what a dandy it is! charlie and his wife both undergo plastic surgery to improve their hideous appearances unbeknown-est to each other. they then meet at a party and become smitten with each other. now they can't allow each other to find out they're cheating. that's the preposterous premise of this frantic farce. vivien oakland, one of the few comic short leads to have a flourishing career long after the silents, is perfect as charley's long of nose wife. charley has an awful case of buck teeth, which are quickly dispatched at the dentist's. after a party is raided by police for no other reason then to practice raids, charley and his wife frantically try avoiding each other at home for fear the alterations in appearances become known. both have been photographed with their new features at the party. the hilarity back home culminates in charley trying to teach the no-good-nick cheating with his wife a lesson. the no-good-nick of course is the new charley, which his wife comes to realize long before charley teaches a lesson in faithfulness. this is one of charley chase's better efforts. *** of 4 stars.

okay. to enjoy this silent comedy short you must suspend disbelief concerning the major starting point for the film. if you can't then you'll probably be more likely to score this film a lot lower. charlie chase has a huge overbite and his wife has a nose large enough to have its own area code. unknown to each other, they have both been saving to have surgery to correct these defects. apparently, plastic and dental surgery was better back in the 1920s because neither seemed to have any need to recuperate from these major surgeries and they looked just dandy right away!! okay, remember i said to ignore this, right?! okay, well you also have to then ignore the difficult to believe idea that both could then meet and have no idea the other is their spouse. okay,...now that you allowed yourself to accept these two silly premises, the film gets really, really good.charlie makes a pass at her and she makes a pass at him. both are shocked and thrilled because no one has ever really considered them attractive. so, because of this new vanity they agree to go on a date. but, they both sneak back home--not wanting their spouses to know! anyway, they meet later and are quite attracted to each other. but what about the poor spouses supposedly at home? well, they both learn that the other is married and both anticipate their marriages will result in divorce because they really want to be with each other! late in the film, charlie figures out that the woman really is his wife and he goes through a very funny sequence where he plays both the boyfriend and the old husband--by changing his clothes and putting in false teeth when he plays the hubby! it really is a laugh riot to see him bouncing in and out of the room as he appears to be fighting with another person! you really have to see it to believe it. however, the wife sees an ad with charlie's before and after photos and knows what's happening. in the end, they both feel pretty foolish!

(***minor spoilers***)if there's something in the world of silent clowns that puzzles me, it is that charley chase never got his well deserved "break through" in the movies. oh well, maybe it isn't that strange, really, inasmuch as he never starred in any full-length features. but when i think of it, such an explanation makes it all only more mysterious -- because why the heck didn't chase get any offers to play the leading lead in features? one explanation is that his character, no matter how amusing, was simply too realistic to suit a longer story; without the burlesque elements that chaplin, keaton, lloyd, langdon and other comedians possessed, it can be assumed that the comedy he made and which worked so well for twenty minutes would get repetitive after a few more reels. i don't quite buy this, though, as chase's gag construction is magnificent and could, i believe, at its best maintain the interest of viewers alone for a longer period; at least i am tempted to think so when mighty like a moose runs the show.mr. moose isn't extraordinary handsome, and mrs. moose is hardly a "classic beauty;" he possesses the truly biggest front teeth of any human being on the planet, and she has a remarkably large nose. both of them takes plastic surgery without the other's knowledge, and when they meet by accident just a little later, he doesn't recognize his wife and she doesn't recognize her husband. a number of hilarious misunderstandings begin, with many clever gags all the way through. i don't think i'll reveal anything further, to make the viewing more enjoyable for you. because if you're a fan of silent comedies, or even if you aren't, mighty like a moose offers so many memorable moments within such a short time that i would look upon it as a downright shame not to see it; silly indeed, but no less extremely funny.

from start to finish, this 1926 classic two reeler from the hal roach studios seems to sum up what was fun about the 20's. it stars the now forgotten comic genius, charley chase and was directed by the legendary leo mccarey, who was unknown then but would earn his keep with roach and graduate to greener pastures in the 30's and 40's. recently released onto video and disc, this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by audiences of all ages. although today his star has virtually diminished, charley chase was considered the leader in the short subject comedy field in the waning years of the silents. he helped the careers of stan laurel and oliver hardy before they were brought together as a team, leo mccarey and a host of other talents. it is a shame that he is all but remembered today. check out this little gem of a film. once you do, you will be seeking out other films from this classic comic. he had his hand in over 300 films and many of them survive. rediscover this lost giant of a film from a bygone era and its giant star.

while it may not be his most laugh-packed film, mighty like a moose stands as one of charley chase's most satisfying farce comedies, twenty minutes of clever sight gags, nicely choreographed physical comedy, and amusing quips (rendered via title card, of course) all based on a wacky and wildly implausible premise. we're told up top that this is "a story of homely people-- a wife with a face that would stop a clock --and her husband with a face that would start it again." soon we meet buck-toothed charley moose and his wife vivien, who has an enormous nose. but there's no point in discussing plausibility when our plot hinges on such a patently unbelievable series of interconnected coincidences: i.e., first, that charley would have his overbite corrected the very day his wife would have her nose fixed, second, that each spouse would keep their respective cosmetic surgeries secret from the other, and third, that when bumping into each other in public afterward, charley and vivien wouldn't recognize each other. sounds like a bit of a stretch, doesn't it? multiple stretches is more like it. clearly, we're in the world of farce here and just have to roll with the silly plot twists, so as long as you can relax and forget about plausibility you're likely to enjoy this short.mighty like a moose gets off to a leisurely start as the various complications of the story are established, but things pick up once charley and vivien have "met" and made a date to attend a party together at the home of charley's dentist. they each rush home excitedly, enter separately and are at first unaware of each other's presence. (mr. & mrs. moose appear to be quite wealthy, incidentally, as they live in a mansion the size of a luxury hotel.) there follows a beautifully timed sequence somewhat reminiscent of buster keaton's the navigator in which husband and wife dash about the house without ever quite meeting up face-to-face. and once they arrive at the party the comedy really kicks into high gear as charley is forced to dance with gawky wallflower gale henry. henry, an estimable player in her own right who starred in many short comedies dating back to 1914, is hilarious as the dance partner who brings great vigor but little grace to her dancing. there's also an elegant cinematic touch during this sequence, when the camera pans down to show us only the shoes of charley, gale, vivien and vivien's dance partner, yet we're able to follow precisely what's happening between the principles by watching their feet.unfortunately for charley and vivien the party they're attending is raided, and from there on the complications multiply when they manage to escape the police dragnet and return home. when charley realizes that his newly-prettified wife was attempting to step out with another man he resolves to each her a lesson . . . while conveniently forgetting, of course, that he was attempting to do the very same thing. the last few minutes of this film offer some of chase's funniest physical comedy, capped with a good sight gag for the punchline. mighty like a moose leaves the viewer with a warm glow, and surely ranks with the most amusing comedies produced by the prolific, sadly underrated charley chase.

this was my late wife's favorite film. i'm sorry she did not live long enough to have the video as i'm sure she would have worn it out. what can we say? a great romantic story and the push off of two great men, the raisuli and teddy rex. sean connery and brian keith are great in these roles. but while connery is his usual sexy sex, it's the late brian keith who gives us a solid performance as the mercurial teddy roosevelt. back up is provided with candy bergen, gorgeous in her early 30s, as the kidnapped american widow. great back-up also comes from the great john huston as teddy's beleaguered secstate, john hay; geoffrey lewis, from the clint eastwood films is great as the hesitant us ambassador, gummere; the late vladek sheybal with his demonically evil stare is great as the beshaw and more is given by steve kanaly and roy jensen whose faces we have seen in several backgrounds. all in all, this is a film filled with wonderful romance, mindful of an era long gone. mindless story? not at all. the issue of big nations pushing around smaller ones for their own hegemonical interests is as true today as it was then. overly romantic? not really-- certainly not maudlin in any sense. fun to watch? you bet. i own the video and will watch it again and again. i suggest you do the same.

1st watched 8/31/1996 - (dir-tim robbins): very thought provoking and very well done movie on the subject of the death penalty. deserved more recognition and publicity than it received.

lovely candace bergen as the widow perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by the sheik raisuli played by one dashing sean connery. the incident comes during 1904 as theodore roosevelt runs for election to the presidency in his own right. needing a good example to show off the muscular foreign policy of the united states, brian keith as roosevelt issues a stunning declaration to the sultan of morocco, "perdicaris alive or raisuli dead."but in this adaptation of that incident the famous declaration is the only true thing about this story. the perdicaris in question was in reality one ion perdicaris who was a greek immigrant and dilettante playboy. in fact perdicaris gave up his american citizenship years ago and was back as a greek national. never mind that though, his predicament was serviceable enough at the time.the damsel in distress makes better screen material though so it's a widow woman and her two kids that are in harm's way here. of course as presented here the incident is also used by some of our european powers to get their foothold into morocco. the intrigues get far beyond one brigand's demand for ransom.the wind and the lion is hardly history. but it is an enjoyable film and sean connery is always fun to watch. brian keith also fits my conception of theodore roosevelt and the scenes in the roosevelt white house do ring true to all the stories told. john huston plays the ever patient secretary of state john hay who roosevelt had inherited from his predecessor william mckinley.but kids don't use this film to skip reading a history assignment on the theodore roosevelt era.

crackerjack is a hit and miss film set in the australian suburban lawn bowls club of cityside. mick molloy plays a scammer who has been scoring free parking spaces at cityside. when the club is put under pressure to install poker machines in it's premises they need to raise $8000 to keep this from happening. the club needs new members to help and this is where mick molloys character comes in and has to bowl to save the club. with many up and coming and aging australian actors crackerjack is a hidden gem. be warned though most of the jokes are for those with a knowledge of lawn bowls but there are many amusing sight gags that provide comical relief. sam johnson and judith lucy co-star. overall the movie should be recommended for people who play lawn bowls or have played but there is enough other material in there for an amusing play if you have a slight understanding. if you enjoy australian humour i suggest you get you're bowling whites on and head on out to the theatre because this is the premiere lawn bowls comedy of the year(also the only one).

while the romance in this film is an important aspect, it is largely about the role of responsibility and duty in modern indian. all of the major characters were well fleshed out, and had their own "inner life". i recommend this strongly

anyone who gives this movie less than 8 needs to step outside & puff a couple. great story.reality is for people who can't handle drugs.

not your ordinary movie, but a good one. billy bob is very funny in this movie, the way he talks, what he says etc. i was kind of surprised when i saw it, cause i just thought it was a normal comedy, but it was more than that. it had a very good story, great characters and a good balance.favorite part: probably when billy bob is running around in his robe shooting at the rippers

a fun romp...a lot of good twists and turns! (and we were not even baked!)didn't know this movie even existed until watching the extra trailers on a monty python dvd...(oddly it was there along with the city of lost children, and the adventures of baron munchauhsen)the plot keeps you wondering throughout.the acting was awesome...hank azaria shows his talent again, bill bob is billy bob...(wecis?)definitely worth watching.

what a great little film, lots of good roles from some random stars. basically there are these pot growers that get caught up in a comical adventure. at points the film makes you believe everyone is going to end up dead! which adds to the comedy. when the character of john lithgow (3rd rock) re-appears - its impossible not to imagine the trip, this may have caused, like a total paradox. the film is full of twists and turns that keep you guessing all the way to the end. billy bob thornton astronaut farmer) is brilliant, in fact looking back, the character is fairly similar in the fact he holds the family of pot growers together. everyone involved in this film should get a big thumbs up.as i say' the final scene is a dream; however a nightmare at the same time. i love it when hank azaria (carter) says at the end do you think we should do this every year? i felt my self wishing they would. i'm not going to say this film is good for everyone, but as a lover of stoner movies i give it 10/10. - my advice have a joint ready; kick back and enjoy!

this is an awesome movie, and if you haven't seen it, you should go to the video store right now and rent it. first off, the cast is superb. not only does it have current stars, like ryan philippe and billy bob thornton, but it also has your stars of yesteryear like judge reinhold. it also has numerous cameos by actors like jon bon jovi, ted danson, and jamie lee curtis. second off, the story was quite good also. it was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie, and almost made it dramatic. it takes the drug situation in the united states, and instead of giving it a comedic face like in "half baked" it has a true, life lesson image like "traffic". so watch this movie, if you're a stoner it will give you insight into something you love, if you don't do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see.

the first half hour of "homegrown" was rather boring and not absorbing, but as the film progressed, so did my interest in the characters and the plot. several scenes are really scary and you fear for the main characters who you actually grow attached to. the story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in southern california. they witness the murder of the farm's owner, malcolm (john lithgow), and they take over the weed for their own. the three rather simple-minded farm hands soon get swept up into a scary world of mafia and local interest, while all of the time trying to convince everyone that malcolm is still alive. while the movie had several faults and a slow beginning, it turned out to be worthwhile. 7/10 stars.

one of best movies ever...fire...it is not much about sociological description of india today...it is the mind blowing use of light that never stops, never becomes...normal...even when...in this sense the movie is almost unique...both leads are of very good quality...the origin of das as a street performer are pretty obvious...her performance is a superb "cammeo"...but the use of the light...i have look at it and looked at it, again and again...still mind blowing after ages...nothing torrid in the story...rather "pure" way of facing the subject...in a way it is sad that in the bizarre world we live today, a major art work is usually known as a gender film...fire can stand face to face with dryer's jeanne d' arc or ichikawa's biruma no tategoto or some of the major kurosawa movies, just to name "some". wish my input could help a little this movie to its deserved way to fame.

the cure is one of the few movies i rated 10 out of 10. i mean, everything is flawless for me in this motion picture. i saw it almost a year ago, and yet i remember many of the scenes, especially the final touching scene that comes with the credits.the two boy actors clearly gave everything they could and this greatly contributes the excellent storyline, making the film perfect.the message is clear - friendship, and it's displayed throughout the whole thing.i have nothing more to say here. simplicity is one of the things i love so much about this film. and of course, it's fun and moving at the same time, suiting people of any age.10/10, nicely done!

"the cure" is a very touching and poignant drama. the film focuses on two neighborhood boys who become good friends. one of the boys has aids. the boys become good friends despite erik's apprehensiveness at first. the film shows the boys journey to discover "the cure", which is in ohio according to "the national examiner", and how it affects their relationship. the acting is wonderful (i have never seen annabella sciorra do better), and the movie is just plain touching. i couldn't stop crying with the shoe scene. this is a good tearjerker. keep the kleenex nearby. 8/10

this was truly a heart warming movie. it is filled with so many messages. loyalty, friendship, sickness, death, and the paranoia society has concerning anything they don't understand. i have shed a few tears during certain movies, but this movie kept the tears flowing.

the best romantic comedy i've seen in years. not the kind of slick over the top hollywood stuff by ben stiller or adam sandler and a lot less syrupy than a hugh grant epic. julianne nicholson and jay mohr are perfectly cast and both deliver smoothly professional performances as the engaged couple who decide to spend a little time sowing their sexual oats before marriage. instead of playing it strictly for laughs the writers and director concocted a nice blend of human feelings and comedic action. nicholson is just great as the awkward seductress and mohr does a great job as the man who reluctantly enters into the game but soon finds himself enjoying his flings a little too much. we see just enough of the supporting characters to nicely round out the plot without distracting from the main story. andy richter (earnest friend) and helen slater (distraught single-mom) are particularly good. there is enough meaning and emotional complexity to make this a lot more than a standard boy-girl farce. indeed, with just a little better pacing and a tiny bit more cutting this film would be a top ten comedy.

this indie film is worth a look because of the enormous talent of its creators, wallace wolodarsky and marsha forbes. mr. wolodarsky has directed the young cast, and he is to be praised for this effort.the premise of the film is a cautionary tale of the danger for wanting something one can't have. which is the story of alice and ed. after living together for a while, alice suddenly gets restless because she imagines she's lacking experience in the sex area. alice and ed's relationship, while not an example of ideal happiness, is a comfortable way to share their lives with one another. that is, until the moment alice and claire, her sister, happened to bump into a sexual encounter by another couple that has no clue of being observed.this incident makes alice reevaluate her own sexual life with ed; she finds it lacks substance. when she proposes 'seeing other people', ed is shocked, to put it mildly, but not wanting to contradict alice, he decides to go along. what happens next is that both alice and ed enter into a world that's been unknown to them. the people they meet, in the end, are not worth the trouble. they sadly realize at the end, they were made for each other.the film is worth watching in order to see the amazing julianne nicholson, who we happen to have liked in another indie film, "tully". ms. nicholson reminds us of a young shirley mclaine; she projects such a luminous quality about her, that is hard to take one's eyes from her whenever she is in a scene. this young actress proves she is an accomplished performer who gets better with each new appearance. basically, she carries the movie. her alice is a study in contrasts. alice is a decent woman who thinks she is inadequate in pleasing ed because of her inexperience.jay mohr, is an excellent match for ms. nicholson. both do wonders together. his ed is perfectly credible. we have known people like him. deep down inside, he is a good person, who suddenly gets himself in a situation he didn't call for, yet, he goes along only to discover he is too decent and not cut out for a life of gratuitous sex with the willing women that have no problem with a tumble in the hay, just for fun.the rest of the cast is wonderful. lauren graham does some amazing work as claire, alice's yuppie sister. andy ritcher is also wonderful as the grounded carl, the nerdy friend who finally finds out fulfillment when he meets penelope, a single mother. as penelope, helen slater, makes a felicitous, albeit of a short, appearance in the film.the director is enormously gifted, who will no doubt go places because he shows he is well suited for the job.

intense, funny, witty, and more than anything, social comedy on the ways of adult dating and it's results-be it good or bad. mohr and nicholson are engaged couple two months away from a wedding date, when a bizarre event at their engagement party forces nicholson to re-think the relationship and start to date other people so she won't feel so pristine when it comes to sexual experience. this leads to a disaster of events following mohr, nicholson, and their cohorts. very intelligent and needed in this time of clumsy, condescending comedy, while containing your usual variety of comedic, sexual, and frustrated characters(especially charles as a sexually frustrated sex fiend...very annoying) who even they seem to get the right feel to this heart felt commentary.the film goes the way films should go these days, showing that guys are sensitive at heart and have morals. most of the male characters are the moralistic, straight forward eyes, while the woman are the fresh faced street prowlers who will stop at nothing to get pleasure. guys will be appreciative of the message made for guys with self respect, however it is easy to assume that most males who do see this film will use it's message of male sensitivity cover up any flaw or trait that a female might find offending. still, the writing formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for it's male leads, particularly those of mohr, richter, and finding the director in a cameo as a sales man!the females are by far the most promiscuous as they speak of nothing but pleasure and what it would be like to... with someone else. they have amicable traits though, even though they are covered by the image of sex driven kittens. very funny stuff.on another level, the film follows some of it's ensemble into different relationship work. richter meets up with a stressed divorc√©e(a very remarkable and noteworthy performance by the always reliable helen slater) named penelope who is divorced with a son who hates her for splitting with his father. as the two go deeper into a relationship, human interest is revealed and both the comedy and tragedy of divorce and starting anew are studied. by the end of the film, mohr and nicholson have become way to deep over the heads to see what's coming next, and it is up to what they have learned about each other and themselves to decide what will come next. it becomes appropriate and dramatic at just the right time.wallodorski's direction is emulated very well when the characters learn to face each other after all that has happened...with the right ending.all in all, this film should have been released nationwide, and i should hope that it is up for some academy awards...maybe helen slater can finally get the recognition she deserves. anywho, this film is a no hits miss, give it all you got romantic sex farce, displayed very maturely and aesthetically.great film!

i finally watched the third film in mehta's trilogy: "fire". to begin, i'd say that "water" was the unquestionable masterpiece, on all levels. fire comes next with earth close behind in order of quality. fire: there is so much going on in this film that i'll need a few more viewings to drink it all in. the writing is superb, the script creating friction that starts the entire process of "heat" from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire, the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships. mehta is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced, false and repressive about the great society from which she came from. india is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change. that she met with such ferocious opposition to the making of "water" after having had the script cleared, shows that there are still many taboo subjects which indian people more than less cannot look squarely in the face, cannot examine or discuss them. worse, if someone like mehta has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues, she faces death threats. so, as much as india thinks of itself as a pluralistic, tolerant society, the facts are not always so. whereas "earth" was merely a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after indian independence, fire and water are pointing at personal, social and religious issues, which as i say are considered so strongly (in a negative sense) that an open artistic dialog is still many years away. as i write this "water" is scheduled to actually be shown in india later this year. i'll believe it when i see it. fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional conundrum that i saw in "a price above rubies". whether it's arranged marriages (which it used to be like among jews about 150 years ago, or like it is among many modern indians), they have the risk of having a bad match forced upon both men and women; or, just plain loveless marriages..... however, this is not the real issue. mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (fire). i am no expert regarding either the secular or hindu laws concerning divorce. the film seems to imply that the stigma (of divorce)is almost as bad as the sad marriage. in any case mehta's film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern indian relationships up to probing scrutiny. that all three of these films have made themselves felt in india as an unwarranted attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable clamor of a repressive mindset. mehta is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack. i admire her work and cannot highly recommend her films enough. superb, disturbing, provocative, taboo shattering.

i'm sure the film contains certain gaps in logic, but i was so enthralled by it that i really didn't care. the movie plays out like a fun, lighthearted teen romp combined with a schwarzenegger-type action flick. it's packed with action, packed with excitement and has some humorous moments as well. sean astin is fun to watch, and i haven't seen louis gossett, jr. since i saw "diggstown" in theaters. he is a fine, underrated actor and i love watching him on screen. i just wonder what he's doing now. unfortunately, he might be starring in a lot of those direct-to-video flicks. hopefully, my assumption is wrong. anyway, this is a fun, edge-of-your-seat thriller and i definitely suggest you check it out. my score: 7 (out of 10)

'toy soldiers' is the story of five misfits boys (most noteably being sean astin, wil wheaton, and kieth coogan) attempt to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the american government imprisons the leader's father. lou gosset jr. plays the headmaster of the school, a headstrong guy who tries to instill in his students a sense of discipline.'toy soldiers' is a funny and pretty cool action, and certainly the better of hostage-crisis-at-school movies. i think most of the appeal comes from the teen cast, but also, the terrorists don't come off as completely useless whereas in some movies, they never seem to be quite the intimidating group that they should. trapped inside the boarding school, and threatened to be killed if the military or police interferes, this is a very formidable challenge for these group of guys who plan to save the school. they're actually pretty clever about it, too.i was surprised that it was a pretty good movie. it keeps a steady pace and doesn't get ridiculously sentimental or anything like that. astin and gosset jr. give good performances. i, too, agree that this is an underrated action movie.

there are questions that sometimes hover over us and have no answer. two women progressively find themselves ensnared in each other's arms (as corny as the expression sounds, that is exactly what happens) and fins that they cannot answer their own question as to what defines their relationship when their very own society has no name to what they are. deepa mehta's somewhat mis-titled fire is the first of a loosely connected trilogy, here linked by the theme of the elements, and more symbolic than consuming. fire as uncontrolled erotic passion does not make an appearance here, since the women -- the older and more feminine radha (shabana azmi) and the younger, more masculine tempered sita (nandita das) come to realize they share a lot more than common ideas and affection for each other and stand for what they believe is their passion for each other despite the opposition faced by their very traditional husbands and families. as in water, fire is deeply spiritual, even if it technically falls into the mode of sentimental melodrama (where water, much like the weight of the word, carries a stronger meaning that ultimately transcends its definition). even so, it's a very beautiful picture, and a strong voice from a strong director.

now i do understand that this film was not meant as an indictment against all indians but it is an amazing film because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy that some indians have concerning their women and sexuality. i have known for some time that sexism is very common in this society (with women being murdered because the husband's family doesn't want them any more after his death or because she had a small dowry as well as the frequent killing of female fetuses because they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing). i also realize that some from this culture will be greatly offended by the film, but the bottom line is that there is some truth to the subject matter--even if the film was so strongly attacked when it debuted in india a decade ago. as a result of the extreme misogyny in the movie, most western audience members will be shocked or at least be emotionally pulled into the plight of the ladies in this film.although i am a male, am not rabidly feminist and i am straight, the film had a strong positive impact on me and it is not an agenda film that can only be enjoyed by lesbians and "man haters". in fact, i don't think the film is promoting hatred of men or homosexuality but instead gives a credibly argument how in the case of these two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative due to their wicked husbands. yes, i use the word "wicked" and mean it, as both husbands living in this large household are intensely selfish and have no regard for their spouses' sexuality. in many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existence.one husband married a vivacious young woman, sita, out of family obligation. this arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning sita makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband. however, he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about sita--and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded chinese lady. to make matters worse, he did nothing to hide the affair and made no apologies. in their dead marriage, sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way sita could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met. and unfortunately, he could have cared less.another husband was married to a lady who was infertile (radha). oddly, after initially trying to have children, they have gone the next 13 years without any sexual contact whatsoever! it's because this man has decided to become an ascetic (i.e., in hinduism, a person who gives up the pleasures of the world to gain inner enlightenment). now his wanting to do this was all well and good if he was not already married and had obligations for his wife. however, being married, this was an incredibly selfish act and like his brother, he assumed his wife had no sexual feelings nor did he seem to care. the closest he would allow her to him sexually was to sleep next to him--as having her next to him helped teach himself to "overcome the desires of the flesh". this must have brought nothing but frustration to her.so, you've got two neglected and normal women living in the same household who long for emotional connection as well as an outlet for their sexual needs. eventually, these needs bring these sister-in-laws together--at first, just emotionally but later sexually as well. the movie was brilliant how it got me to look at and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional desolation.late in the film, when the intensity of their sexual relationship is discovered, it leads to a not totally unexpected reaction from radha's "enlightened" husband--a man who seeks religious insight and peace yet is so wrapped up in himself that true insight and growth is impossible.this is a very challenging and adult film. while there is very little nudity, the subject matter is very adult and this is not a film to show your kids. very disturbing indeed is one minor character who masturbates in front of an old paralyzed lady--as i said, this is not a film to let your kids watch. however, for a mature audience, this is an excellent and highly erotic film that will get you to think.the film features good acting, complex characters, excellent writing, lovely mood music and a slow pace that might annoy some, but which i found rewarding. the only serious negative i cannot blame on the movie itself but on the idiots who released this on videotape. this is because although the movie is in english, the accents are quite strong at times and it's not always easy to understand what's being said. but, and this is the worst part, there are no closed or open captions--including them is a must for western audiences. if you do watch this film, see if you can find it on dvd or hopefully a newer release on video will have captioning--mine sure didn't.by the way, director deepa mehta (a popular female director) has made several other wonderful films such as earth and bollywood/hollywood. a consistent theme in her films is the conflict between traditional indian culture and expectations and westernism--with a strong emphasis on female characters. not surprisingly, this west-thinking lady makes her home in canada and is divorced--a truly unusual woman to say the least. for a similar film that explores traditional culture meets western culture, try another canadian gem, eat drink man woman.

lloyd hamilton was one of the most imaginative (and among the funniest) of all the silent-film comedians. why is he utterly forgotten? unfortunately, the original negatives for a large percentage of his films were lost when the fox warehouse burnt in the early 1930s. hamilton was not handsome or graceful like chaplin, keaton and lloyd; nor was he dapper, like raymond griffith. and unlike harry langdon and (again) chaplin, hamilton did not try for audience sympathy.however, his films were hugely popular at the time of their original release, and they remain hilarious today. oscar levant once claimed that he asked chaplin if there was any other comedian whom he'd ever envied, and chaplin instantly named lloyd hamilton. the character most frequently portrayed by hamilton on screen -- a flat-capped naff, with fastidious hand gestures and a duck-like walk -- was later adapted by vaudeville comedian eddie garr (teri garr's father), and further adapted by jackie gleason as his 1950s tv character 'the poor soul'.'the movies', directed pseudonymously by roscoe arbuckle, is one of hamilton's most innovative shorts, and it's hilarious. we first see him as a country boy, bidding farewell to his family outside their homespun cottage, on his way to the big city. then he steps away from the cottage, and we see that it's in the big city, with traffic booming all round him!eventually, our hero ends up at a restaurant (uncredited, but it's the montmartre cafe in downtown l.a.) where all the movie actors eat between takes. there's an amusing gag when hamilton's bumpkin character meets three actors in costume and makeup as presidents washington, lincoln and roosevelt: this gag would have been funnier if the impostors looked more like the originals. finally, our lad seats himself at a table, hoping to meet a celebrity. sure enough, entering the restaurant and sitting at the very next table is a big movie star ... none other than lloyd hamilton! there's a very well-made double-exposure shot -- the join is nearly invisible -- when lloyd hamilton as himself greets lloyd hamilton as the country boy.sadly, hamilton's peak period of creativity was very brief. he began his film career in crude slapstick films as one half of a double act (ham and bud, opposite bud duncan), and had a brief and blazing period of stardom in shorts during the late silent period. sound movies were not kind to hamilton, and he was quickly shoved down the cast list in some crude early talkies. then he died young. fortunately, 'the movies' is quite funny, and a splendid introduction to this unique comedians' style. i'll rate it 7 out of 10.

yes, i know, roscoe arbuckle didn't like to be called 'fatty', but i couldn't resist the joke.this is a fine lloyd hamilton short from his peak period, directed by roscoe. the two work together with lots of good gags and roscoe's usual attention to the details of shooting the picture in an interesting manner. most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting. roscoe uses a couple of long tracking shots and some nice camera trickery to tell his story and to show ham as a fine actor, as well as a talented comedian.this story plays with some interesting themes, like lloyd's classic move along: here it's about perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make of them. or you might choose to ignore such issues and laugh your head off.

if you get the slight enjoyment out of pink floyd's music you will love this movie. the score is completely pink floyd and of course the drug element plays a major part in this movie giving you the doubts about life within the weakest moments. this movie also touches the heart with the story about love and the people around you ... there is also a huge connection with the world around you with the environment of a personal island.this thing tell me i need ten lines to sum up a movie but i am done that is all you get that is why this movie is a 6.1 which is a major upset to any movie with a score like this. take a look at requiem for a dream and the fountain .... equally good scores for our generation but overestimated

i have become a big fan of the work of barbet schroeder, so maybe i am already a little biased by now, but i think this movie is great, although there may be a few lengths. it is a romantic unromantic view of the great liberation in the later sixties, stylistically amazingly polished (great set design!) and in my opinion still very watchable.basically this is an ironic re-telling of the story of adam and eve who are driven from paradise after having tasted the ¬Ñforbidden fruit" which has turned from an apple into a hypodermic filled with heroine. the woman seduces a man into using it thus accelerating his doom. i say accelerating as the guy seems to be doomed and bound for an intensive life and an early grave right from the great title sequence onwards. there is no place for any hope.although the story is rather sad, i was captured by the beauty both of the beautiful location ibiza and mimsy farmer. i found her character was at once shallow, enigmatic, endearing, annoying, interesting and boring. somehow she represents what men see in women in a basic, unoffensive way. architecture and built artifacts in general are put to very good use ¬ñ which seems to be a schroeder trademark of sorts.there is even some humor, mainly delivered by stefan, the german main character and his accent. his main nemesis is not a snake but an older german of dubious reputation ¬ñ and provider of the heroine - called wolf. although it is a german name and stefan is german, he pronounces it verrry english and in fits of jealousy spits the name out at his girlfriend in regular intervals ¬ñ becoming a boy who cries ... at times stefan has to work in order to earn a ¬Ñcellery". at one time the guy goes snorkeling and afterward awkwardly clambers up a rock with his rubber flippers ¬ñ never has male frontal nudity been funnier in movie history.

17/02/09 "more" (1969) dir: barbet schroeder for a film that most viewers have agreed is pretty average, i'm impressed by quite how many differing interpretations have been offered of it. i've only scoured the web quite briefly and i've already been informed that "more" is: a 19th century-style romance, an allusion to the story of icarus, a plain film full of dull people, and of interest only to pink floyd completists. it's fair to say, then, that critical reception is mixed. i would argue that these wildly disparate readings of barbet schroeder's 1969 directorial debut are proof enough that "more" is anything but a pretty average film.neither is it a masterpiece, of course. i approached "more" as i did "easy rider" and antonioni's "blowup" - as a 'time-capsule' film, a snapshot of an era - despite the differences in pace, style and content between these movies. they all have similar flaws - either vague or downright unlikeable characters, acting that seems slightly adrift from reality, relaxed editing, and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant. these movies never try to be persuasive or meet the audience half way - they are what they are, man. this in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a souvenir of the experience. thankfully, "more" offers several truly memorable images, sounds and suggestions to the viewer, and this is what saves it.stefan is a young man who arrives in paris fresh from his studies in germany. the first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of french hipsters, accompanies them to devastatingly cool and self-conscious parties and bars before meeting estelle. the two characters become sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to ibiza, against the advice of his friend charlie. this is where the icarus thing comes into play - she is the sun, he is pursuing her. you may now be able to guess how this all ends.ibiza is an idyll so far away from the bustling urgency of the over-populated paris that the naive stefan knows he must be on to a good thing. estelle remains elusive and erratic, and the island has a less desirable underbelly. up until now i had cared little for either of these characters and their unfocused pursuit of somewhere to be really free, but once the action is pared down to just these two the film becomes poignant quite suddenly. during just one single wistful exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they inhabit, the place where their volatile love crystallises, i went from watching with a fading optimism to being utterly enraptured. i can't think of many other films that have done this.the relationship between stefan and estelle is real and human in that we can see it go from life-defining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel coldness. they take a lot of drugs and cavort naked on the terraces, the rocks and beaches. their lives revolve around nothing but each other and the beautiful mediterranean surroundings. for a while, their situation is the very essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience for its own sake. but stefan is not in control, and this is the downfall of more than just his future on ibiza.pink floyd's score is a perfect fit for the exoticism, the intimacy, and the foreboding of "more". it is one of the most memorable inclusions, along with the mosquito netting around estelle's bed, and their hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill (which appears on the soundtrack album's front cover). a scene in which they take acid to escape from heroin withdrawal is illustrative of the fundamental flaws of the couple - they cannot 'land' without a crash. maybe they've come too close to what they wanted.stefan never makes contact with any family or friends from before his arrival in paris. we are left to presume they have no idea where he is. while other 1960s counterculture movies dwell on debauchery, excess, the media and voyeurism, schroeder has instead presented us with a story focused upon one man, who backs himself into a little corner somewhere in the world and quietly disappears.

overall, a well done movie. there were the parts that made me wince, and there were the parts that i threw my hands up at, but i came away with something more than i gone in with.i think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition. without spoiling it, let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in ramayana, is way beyond what this movie stands for. the ramayana is an epic. not a 200 page book that puts down women in india. the movie is about two girls married into a very distinctive indian family. while the basic tenets of the "unwritten laws of the family tradition" seem to be that of conservative india, let me assure my reader that i (having lived in delhi for 12 years) found entire parts that just did not ring those bells. i mean some things and some actions are very true, but some other stuff is just way off the mark. especially today.delhi is complicated. india is complicated. the director tries to simplify both. and fails pretty miserably at that.why in english? can you imagine a movie about american indians in english. or the french speaking in english. seriously jarring. even the servant spoke in fluent accented english (albeit with a hint of colloquialisms in the language for "believability").but the chemistry between the leads is palpable. if you like it hot, this is a movie for you. i think that is the biggest saving grace - the development of a true real life love story.if this film was about radha and sita, then it would have got full marks from me. and in being about them, it could have made a subtle statement. but this movie goes out there to say this is what india is, and this is what indian society is like. and in that respect it succeeds as much as it fails. just take everything you see with a pinch of salt. the dark secrets of india are not being revealed. just two girls are falling in love. just like it happens everywhere else.

this movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. the dialog is crisp, the pace is fast. not only is this a clever comedy, this is an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes in the television news business.there are so many funny lines...a couple of my favorites:ernie merriman: (sarcastically) it must be nice to always believe you know better, to always think you're the smartest person in the room. jane: (seriously) no, it's not, it's awful!!aaron: he must be good looking jane: how do you know that? aaron: no one invites a bad looking idiot to their room!the performances of holly hunter, albert brooks, and william hurt were absolutely brilliant! even years later, i remember this movie well. often forgotten is the wonderfully funny joan cusack! i love the scene where the newsroom personnel are racing to beat a deadline. there are so many funny scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite. i highly recommend this film.

for me this wonderful rollercoaster of a film bears repeated pleasurable viewings. its about the tangled lives of three very different people. holly hunter is the obsessive workaholic producer. albert brookes plays the unprepossessing but brilliant journalist. william hurt is the affable but dumb new kid on the block, news anchor.the classical love triangle emerges with the stunningly witty and self deprecating brookes in love with hunter but she of course is attracted to hurt.this film works on many levels. at the very least it is a brilliant comedy with the one liners flying so thick and fast that each viewing bears a new harvest of ones that you may have missed last time. its also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romance.but perhaps most importantly the film examines the modern obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over intellect as a valued human attribute. this is personified by the meteoric career success of the hurt character in contrast to brookes relative decline.despite being fifteen years old the film has some startingly relevant messages about modern news values and the continuing decline in journalistic standards.this film is a classic in every sense and it is difficult to understand why it has been so neglected

this was a really nice surprise. i was up late last night and couldn't fall asleep. not really thinking twice, i turned on my tv and hbo was on, and this film was just beginning. luckily i saw the whole thing, and i am very happy i did. because this film was very good. the actors were well-cast, and they did a surprisingly good job. kris kristofferson delivered a solid performance, there was a lot of substance behind his lines. this film made me realize he's a good actor. brian keith was great as his father, as was trey wilson playing the colonel (this was trey wilson's final role before his untimely death. too bad, he was a quality actor and seemed like a nice guy). jobeth williams also did a nice job as kristofferson's american wife. as far as the direction, i had no idea franklin j. schaffner was the director until i read the review in leonard maltin's movie guide(this was the last film he ever made). now i understand why this movie was so good. schaffner also directed patton, a truly great movie(i haven't seen his other great film, papillon). while i was watching "welcome home", i said to myself, "this director really knows what he's doing," not knowing that schaffner had directed it. there's one really beautiful scene in a thai orphan refuge, enough to bring tears to my eyes. not only was this sensitively directed, but it was also directed in a very economical and taut way. there is nothing wasted in schaffner's effort. the script was one reason this film is so good. the writer doesn't weigh the actors down with too many lines. it was written very simply but very effectively. it just shows you that a lot can be said with few words. this film also made me proud to be an american, at the same time that it showed you how beautiful all people are.

hi i have been looking 4 the soundtrack or a song from the film, does anyone know who sung the title song? i think it was called welcome home or coming home.it is played throughout the film and for the end credits please can anyone help either the artist and/or title of song thanks mike this is for all you movie buffs lets see if you know your stuffhi i have been looking 4 the soundtrack or a song from the film, does anyone know who sung the title song? i think it was called welcome home or coming home.it is played throughout the film and for the end credits please can anyone help either the artist and/or title of song thanks mike this is for all you movie buffs lets see if you know your stuff

this film is good,but not schaffner`s best. my favourite is papillon and patton,but this is a sad and very nice film. kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference. i am going to miss schaffner and this is his last film.a good film by a great director! 7,5/10

a stunningly well-made film, with exceptional acting, directing, writing, and photography.a newlywed finds married life not what she expected, and starts to question her duty to herself versus her duty to society. together with her sister -in-law, she makes some radical departures from conventional roles and mores.

this was a great film in every sense of the word. it tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm. it criticises a great many indian customs that many find oppressive -- such as the arranging of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, the valuation of women in terms of their baby-making capacity, the binding concepts of duty and so on. at the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagonists find themselves. the film is well-acted and genuine, completely believable from beginning to end, unlike most bollywood flicks. the main faults of the film as i saw it was first, that the two lovers seem drawn to one another not necessarily by a natural affinity for each other as much as the fact that they are stuck in dead-end marriages with no passion and no rewards. this may play a part in the sexual awakening of the characters, but most people stuck in the same situation will not "turn homosexual". it seems clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are quite heterosexual -- when radha does her scene at the end of the movie with aashok, she makes it quite clear that "without desire she was dead", and the implication was that if he had desired so, he could have fulfilled her quite completely, and also when sita seemed very disappointed when her husband seemed to not like her. such situations do not turn people into homosexuals -- they may seek comfort in others in the same position, but inthe film it is not at all made clear that they are lesbians from the beginning -- quite the opposite. some people are bisexual, it is true, but most tend to be either hetero- or homosexual. in the case of the ladies in the film, both had insensitive jerks for husbands . . . if this had not been the case, would they have naturally found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they may have otherwise not have considered? the film ignores this. the other fault is the naming of the characters . . . the names sita and radha seem contrived deliberately to shock and outrage (imagine a film in america depicting a gay relationship between a man named "jesus" and another named "paul"!) by using names associated with various hindoo scriptures. the film is strong enough to stand on its own and needs no such devices in my opinion. at any rate, the faults do not take much away from the power of the movie. it is indeed a very touching and powerful story -- the images and characters will stay with you a long time after you leave the theatre.

this is a surprisingly great low budget horror/comedy, it's funny and pretty well made, with good performances and a really cool twist ending!. all the characters are pretty cool, and the story while unoriginal is very good, plus eric jungmann(adam) and justin urich(harley) had fantastic chemistry together. one of the funniest moments in the film for me is when adam is trapped in the bathroom, and harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there, and decides to take a p*ss in the truck, and aimee brooks is just plain sexy!, plus this is one of the best low budget horror films i have seen in a long time. it's very gory, but in a comical way, and i thought it was very well written as well, plus michael bailey smith is fantastic as the monster man and had some wicked makeup!. it's similar to films like joy ride, duel, jeepers creepers, etc, etc and it has some suspenseful moments here and there, plus the gore effects are really well done for the most part. this is a surprisingly great low budget horror/comedy, it's funny and pretty well made, with good performances and a really cool twist ending, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. michael davis does a very good! job here, with great camera work, good angles,good use of colors, and using a great setting, plus he kept the film funny and at a very fast pace.there is a lot of gore!. we get extremely bloody nose bleeds,gory impaling's, bloody stabbings,guy is cut in half by a monster truck, human remains in a cooked stew, guts all over the place,guys guts fall out,pencil in the eyes,bloody slit throat,bunch of people walking around without limbs,gory dead squirrel,heads are squished,severed limbs,bloody and mangled corpses,decent amount of bloodshed,one very gory scene at the very end and more!.the acting is very good for a low budget film. eric jungmann is fantastic here as adam, he was a nerd but a very likable one, he had fantastic chemistry with justin urich, had some cool lines,and i just loved his character, he also seemed to be enjoying himself,and he was especially good at the end!. justin urich is excellent as the ass of a best friend, however i just couldn't help but love him as he was very funny, and often stole a lot of the scenes, i really dug him!. aimee brooks is gorgeous, and did great with what she had to do, she had good chemistry with jungmann and like jungmann was especially good at the end, as i loved her mysterious character. michael bailey smith is wonderful as the monster man he was very creepy looking, had some awesome makeup, and is now one of my favorite slashers!. rest of the cast do fine.overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5

two city guys are driving through hicksville usa when a rusty monster truck suddenly appears and repeatedly attempts to run them off the road.having picked up a mysterious blonde hitchhiker,they pull up at a truck-stop full of redneck amputees,one of whom warns them of 'the demon out there'. but they don't listen.big mistake!"monster man" by michael davis mixes comedy with horror surprisingly well.the film borrows heavily from "duel","the blair witch project","jeepers creepers" and "the texas chainsaw massacre".the story is pretty silly,but there is enough gore and violence to keep splatter freaks happy.i enjoyed especially the performance of justin urich,which offers the film its comedy relief.still the complete lack of suspense is hard to forgive.give this one a chance,if you have some time to waste.7 out of 10.did i mention that aimee brooks is sexy?

great horror comedy from michael davis.iwas laughing so hard i almost peed! great acting from eric jungman as the good guy who saves the day & great performance by the jack black-esquire like performance from justin urich. he was just divine in this film. this guy deserves to be a big star. also,aimee brooks was good in the film as well as the girl in danger along with the guys from a killer reminiscent of jeepers creepers. the gore to was given in copious amounts & i loved it.i just hope they release a not rated version. great low-budget horror comedy. the dead cat in the hotel sex scene is just gruesomely funny! ***** out of *****

in the veins of jeepers creepers and the texas chainsaw massacre, monster man surprisingly well-made--though mindless--little horror. throw in a little buddy-comedy, nice gore and intense scare. it's hard no to say that monster man is really entertaining. the low budget seem pretty obvious, but it doesn't effected the presentation of the movie in general and put more big budget horror movies in shame.yes, the plot somewhat generic as possible. pair of friend, adam (eric jungman)and harley (justin urich) are driving cross country to interrupt the wedding of a woman adam has always loved. while adam is more nerdy type, harley is a self-proclaimed ladies man and very offensive loudmouth. adding a bonus to the plot, then they picked up a sexy hitchhiker, sarah (aimee brooks). things turn into nightmare when a monster truck with scary face drive stalking them. when dead body starts counting, they must do the race against the time before their own life on risk.the plot is obviously reminiscent of many prior famous horror movies, but michael davis as the writer and director succeed in keeping the tension. the scare is build well enough, where characterization is never be the best, but fairly okay. the script also littered with comedies that works for the funny moments and they quite enjoyable rather than annoying and also wait for the twist in the finale. it's hilarious and shocking in the same time, which is pretty amusing.as conclusion, monster man surprisingly entertaining. it deserves more attention in the big screen. it proves that big budget doesn't make an effective horror movie, but skill does! something that the director has shown and delivers.

i first saw this on demand. or on tv. i'm not really sure. but this has got to be my all time favorite movie ever! i mean, this movie has blood, gore, laughs and chills through out the movie. i recently ordered "monster man" from amazon and i've been watching "monster man" ever since i got it. trust me, you will love this movie. p.s. the commentary on the dvd is way funny. they also said something about "monster man 2" during the commentary. let's hope they make "monster man 2"! if you have the chance, rent the movie or buy it. you will absolutely love it! this is the best movie that has come out in 2003.10/10

adam (eric jungmann) and obnoxious best friend harley (justin urich) are driving cross country to a wedding. along the way they pick up sexy hitchhiker sarah (aimee brooks). then, for no reason, a monster truck keeps trying to run them off the road...and maybe kill them. who is doing this and why?pretty good horror film. its energetic and full of flashy direction which gets you right into the action. it's also a horror comedy. most of the humor is infantile and really gross but actually somewhat funny. also this movie really piles on the gore at times--but that's a good thing! the acting is ok--jungmann overplays his nerd role a bit much; urich is stuck with the hopeless role of the foul-mouthed, sex-obsessed best friend--but pulls it off; brooks is good too in a limited role.but i could see the "twist" ending coming long before it happened and logic totally disappears at the end (especially the rescue). still, this is a gory, sometimes funny and sometimes scary horror movie. i give it a 7.

i saw this on zone horror and fully expected it to be compete crap like most of the films they play , however i was pleasantly surprised. the film revolves around 2 friends and a maniac in a monster truck who is chasing them (i know it sounds crap but its actually quite good) , the film is creepy when it intends to be and is laugh out loud funny in parts (and not in an unintentional way either, it is well paced and is a lot of fun as well as being very gory , there's some very funny black humour thrown in as well. its not the most original movie but so what. if your after shakespeare then this is not it , if your after a fun movie then this should be fine

while driving in a highway to the wedding of his beloved betty-ann, adam (eric jungmann) is surprised by his former schoolmate harley (justin urich) on the backseat of his car. adam has broken off with the inconvenient and moron harley because of betty-ann. along their road trip, harley makes fun of some rednecks in a bar and later their car is chased by a giant monster truck on the road. after some incidents, they give a lift to the hitchhiker sarah (aimee brooks) and sooner the trio is terrorized by a scary monster driving the monster truck.in spite of having one of the most annoying characters i have ever seen in a horror movie, the irritating harley, "monster man" is a surprisingly good trash horror-comedy. the story is a collection of clich√©s, beginning like "joy ride" or "duel"; then it turns to one of the countless rip-offs of "the texas chainsaw massacre"; there is a surprising twist, ending with a hook for a sequel. there are hilarious scenes, aimee brooks is extremely sexy and this film really entertains. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "monster man"

if you took a really good jack black movie, added a little jeepers creepers, and then a dash of joyride with a hint of texas chainsaw massacre and house of a 1000 corpses...you would have monster man! i went into this movie, not really expecting much at all, but i wound up really enjoying the movie. the whole premise is really cheesy, a monster man in a monster truck chases down people, but it is so funny that the writer/director doesn't expect you to take it seriously. justin urich is a comic gem and should have a very promising career. he is identical to jack black. the only problem with the film is the unbelievable hero role played by eric jungmann. but overall, if you are looking for a really really fun movie that will crack you up until you are rolling in the aisles, and at the same time, scare the crap out of you...check out this film.

this was on showtime the other night, and i figured it was going to be another made-for-video crap fest, like "earth vs. the spider" or any of those other hbo horror shorts. instead, i found a comedy/gore classic. it was legitimately funny, and surprisingly, the acting was quite good. even my wife, an overall horror-hater, agreed and was laughing at parts. in addition, the fx were high-quality.overall, the film felt like a parody of joy ride/jeepers creepers, and the 2 main characters reminded me of the pair from shaun of the dead. definitely worth watching, but don't take it seriously.the end.

a beautiful woman, a backwoods, inbred monster man, a super sweet monster truck, a road kill zombie brother and 2 friends...one anal retentive, overly sensitive nerd and the other a foul mouthed, adolescent slob. throw them all together with a dash of jeepers creepers, texas chainsaw massacre and road trip and you've got monster man. a hilarious horror/comedy outing that never sets out to "say something". it's a simple, straight forward laugh fest. unpretentious and well made, this horror/comedy is at its heart, a buddy flick. this film offered some hilarious and sickening set pieces. i highly recommend this to fright fans looking to be entertained.

imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid. now think what would happen if you had the chance to speak with your younger self, or even change him/you. would you try to influence or try to change your younger self's beliefs in light of your future experience? or perhaps the encounter would change your older self's perception of life and reality? walt disney's the kid tries to engage this complex thought by putting "older self" bruce willis in a collision course with "younger self" spenser breslin (from the santa clause 2 and the cat in the hat "fame"). the result is a sometimes funny sometimes touching encounter, which makes you ponder about your own past, present and future ¬ñ and truly believe it is never too late to change your course.

this is my first deepa mehta film. i saw the film on tv in its hindi version with its "sita" character presented as nita. i also note that it is radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not nita/sita. yet what i loved about the film was its screenplay by ms mehta, not her direction. the characters, big and small, were well-developed and seemed quixotic towards the end--somewhat like the end of mazursky's "an unmarried woman." they are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. and one cardboard man (ashok) seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him---carrying his invalid mother biji. he seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion. ms mehta seems to fumble as a director (however, compared to most indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant) as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the chinese micro-minority in the social milieu of india. she even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter (not her father!) yet her radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field. compare her to mrinal sen, adoor gopalakrishnan, muzaffar ali and she is dwarfed by these giants--given her competent canadian production team and financial resources! mehta's film of two bisexual ladies in an indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some, but merely captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space. kannada, malayalam, and bengali films have touched parallel themes in india but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoers.ms das, ms azmi, mr jafri and mr kharbanda are credible but not outstanding. ms azmi is a talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors (mrinal sen's "khandar", gautam ghose's "paar", benegal's "ankur") a brilliance notably absent in this film. ms das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability. all in all, the film's strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema. i am sure ms mehta can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays.

contains "spoiler" information. watch this director's other film, "earth", at some point. it's a better film, but this one isn't bad just different.a rare feminist point of view from an indian filmmaker. tradition, rituals, duty, secrets, and the portrayal of strict sex roles make this an engaging and culturally dynamic film viewing experience. all of the married characters lack the "fire" of the marriage bed with their respective spouses. one husband is celibate and commits a form of spiritual "adultery" by giving all of his love, honor, time and respect to his religious swami (guru). his wife is lonely and yearns for intimacy and tenderness which she eventually finds with her closeted lesbian sister-in-law who comes to live in their house with her unfaithful husband. this unfaithful husband is openly in love with his chinese mistress but was forced into marriage with a (unbeknownest to him) lesbian. they only have sex once when his closet lesbian wife loses her virginity.a servant lives in the house and he eventually reveals the secret that the two women are lovers. another significant character is the elderly matriarch who is unable to speak or care for herself due to a stroke. however, she uses a ringing bell to communicate her needs as well as her displeasure with the family members. she lets them know through her bell or by pounding her fist that she knows exacly what's going on in the house and how much she disapproves.in the end, the truth about everybody comes out and the two female lovers end up running away together. but, not before there is an emotional scene between the swami-addicted husband and his formerly straight wife. her sari catches on fire and at first we think she is going to die. however, we see the two women united in the very last scene of the movie.the writer/director of this film challenges her culture's traditions, but she shows us individual human beings who are trapped by their culture and gender. we come to really care about the characters and we don't see them as stereotypes. each on surprises us with their humanity, vulgarity, tenderness, anger, and spirit.

previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than i could. what i recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful, in every sense - emotionally, visually, editorially - just gorgeous.if you like movies that are wonderful to look at, and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant, i think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art.on a scale of 1 to 10, i'd give it about an 8.75. the only reason i shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece. if you are in the mood for a really artistic, very romantic film, then it's a 10. i definitely think it's a must-see, but none of us can be in that mood all the time, so, overall, 8.75.

it's worth boning up on the hindu pantheon before watching this film. three main female deities -- wise sita, nurturing lakshmi and kali the transformer -- as well as three main male deities -- grave rama, playful krishna and shiva the ender -- are all alluded to. knowing the folklore as surely every indian member of an audience does lends a richness to the telling of the present-day story. in fact, one folktale is enacted first on stage, as part of a lesson in spirituality, and then in the movie's "real life." "fire" speaks out against the misogyny and homophobia in the society to which its producers are native, and it does so with a beauty that weaves the message into multiple levels of the viewer's awareness, making it a deeply satisfying presentation. this is the finest film i've seen in the past ten years; very highly recommended!

bill, jeremy theobald, is an inspiring writer who hasn't gotten anything published as of yet. bill also has an odd and strange habit, he likes to follow people.bill picks out some stranger in the streets diner or on the subway, metro, and follows them as if he were their shadow. maybe bill does this to help him in inspiring himself to write the great novel that he's been dreaming about or get an article of his get printed in a major magazine? maybe it's because it fills bill's lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance by his paying attention to him or her? or maybe it gives bill someone to look after and care about and be responsible for besides himself? bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone : after you follow him or her to their home or place of work you stop. one day bill follows cobb, alex haw, home and instead of following his rule of stopping he still keeps following cobb. bill will soon realize how right he was with that rule he set for himself in following people and at the same time how wrong he was by breaking it. amazingly good low-budget movie made by christopher noland in 1998 before he hit it big in hollywood with his ground-breaking and original motion picture classic "momento" some two years later that has already become a major cult movie. "following" is actually a much better movie then "momento" because it's a conventional and easy to follow story. compared to "momento's" which was at first confusing and then when you realize what the movie is telling you in it's backward storyline very complicated. whats makes "following" so much better is just by it being simple but at the same time brainy in it's affect on those who watch it. the movie is far more direct as well as devastating and you don't have to see it over and over to get just what it was trying to tell them like "momento" did. "following" is a story within a story within a story with one of the most surprising as well as simply manipulated ending, if you watch the movie again and notice the clues, that you'll ever see.made with an unbelievably small budget of $6,000.00, thats less then what most hollywood movies budgets out for coffee-breaks, with a no-name cast in black and white and just over one hour, 71 minutes, long. hollywood as well as the motion picture industry outside of hollywood can learn a lot from chris noland in how someone with nothing more then talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases can't; make an intelligent and at the same time penetrating film with next to nothing in money and no big name stars.

just watched this on dvd three times - once the 'normal' way, once with the scenes in consecutive order (in this doozy of a film noir, the beginning, middle and end of the story intertwine), and once with the director's commentary running. quite amazing. a bare-bones tale, told with more flair, energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today. i think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent memento, which turned me on to nolan in the first place. can't wait to see what he does with a bigger budget (and bigger box-office stars) in his next film, insomnia.

great film. no gratuitous gimmicks like in most hollywood films. everything supported the suspense of the plot. b&w gave it a basic, no-frills feel also. in short, it was visceral in its simplicity of cinematography and cast.following serves as an interesting contrast to memento. characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively. in that sense, both reminded me somewhat of "in the company of men," also highly recommendable. one difference between nolan's two films is that memento was a little easier for me to follow, given that the b&w scenes progress in a constant chronological direction, and so do those in color. i don't think that was true of following, where scenes seemed to be shown at random. if you have the choice between vcr and dvd, i'd highly recommend dvd, since that gives you the option of watching the movie a second time in chronological order, not just in the scrambled (albeit ingenuous) order presented by nolan. it also makes it easier, upon a second viewing, to piece the order together for yourself, if you want to.as another viewer noted, one of the best things about both this movie and memento is that none of the cast were famous. they were characters, not big-name actors who brought in personas developed in other movies.given certain similarities in the plots, i wonder if memento is sort of a remake of following, but intended to reach a bigger audience, like edward burns made she's the one in the mold of -- and with largely the same cast as -- the brothers mcmullan.

this intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition (reminds me of william faulkner's novels).the characters all feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are expected to assume, and seek for a way to live within those roles rather than throw them off altogether. but as the story develops the two wives, trapped in loveless marriages, draw together. drawing on the strength of their friendship and love, they give each other the courage to abandon their roles.they have found that living within their traditions is no life at all, it is a sort of living death: without passion, without true connection to others, without fulfillment. although they know there will be a price to be paid for their rebellion and freedom, it is a price much less dear than the sacrifice called for by a comfortable, predictable existence.the screenplay is wonderful, the acting marvelous. near perfect!

the thing which makes "fire" even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry, is its touch of femininism and rebellion. to my mind, the very character played by shabana azmi is a symbol of the indian feminine protest against the indian society. the name of the movie and the scene when radha walks through flames in her kitchen are symbloic of hindu mythology's lord rama's wife sita's walking through fire for the proof of her immaculacy, as per the same narrative which appears in the film too. the film could be a great inspiration for women, particularly those in the subcontinent, to search for their liberties and to attain control of their lives.

i just found the entire 3 dvd set at wal-mart in the bargain bin for $5.50, so i thought i would take another look. total of 13 hours to watch it all (26 episodes). i was born in 1948 and saw most of them on tv in the sixties. many independent stations repeated them for many years.better than i expected actually, time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of it's creators, and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all the allied fighting men and women. more abstract and arty than a straight forward documentary, but very truthful in it's depiction of the causes and final results of wwii. that war was greatly dependent on sea transportation, and the final victory was dependent on who achieved the final mastery of the world's oceans. the allies were the ones who were able to do it.interesting too, to see how they try to strike a balance between big events, and the individual soldiers and sailors that made them happen. the score is impressive, if a bit too much by today's standards. i read somewhere that robert russell bennett contributed just as much as richard rodgers to final score. i imagine that rodgers provided all the major themes, and it was up to bennett to fit them to the images. great job!should be seen by every ruler, or potential ruler. a warning to tyrants that wars are eventually won by ideals, determination, and the supplies to back them up. logistics: their quality and delivery will determine the eventual victors. the allies outproduced and surpassed the material quality of the axis, attacked their very source in the process, and insured their eventual defeat.sorry to see that the producer, henry salomon, lived a very short life. imdb's facts were rather skimpy, i have to find out more about him. he did a few more outstanding documentaries before his early death. might have more to say at a later timetrivia: i had all 3 lp records made of the background music, pretty good overall. unfortunately, the producers decided to add sound effects to the last one, relegating immediately to just novelty status, rather than for serious music listening. too bad too, because it contained some interesting but more minor themes in the series. silly stuff like 16 inch guns firing, torpedoes being fired, bulldozers, planes...just for kids mainly.rsgre

i spotted this film in a branch of the duane reed pharmacy in new york on holiday, and it seemed like a bit of silly fun. and sure enough, the whole premise is ridiculous beyond words - but it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable action film for kids, and their parents too.10-year-old ricky bernard (jordan garrett) has his head in the clouds most of the time, much to his father's (larry miller) dismay. as a member of his school orchestra, ricky and schoolmates fly to a concert performance ... and once again ricky's mind 'takes off' and suspects some criminal plot is happening.reluctantly aided by best friend sashi, who is a fan of hot sauce (what a strange plot device that was) and others they try to get to solve the mystery. oh yes, and ricky's skills 1,000 hours of flight simulator experience prove to be handy when he is called on to save the day in the film's thrilling climax! it was good to see eric roberts and mark dacoscos play parts in a family film. and watching the dvd interviews everyone seems to have had great fun taking part.i totally liked junior pilot; charming and good-natured performances, funny plot line and a real; sense of enjoyment and sheer silliness.if you are looking for an entertaining family film, you could do far worse than buy this one.

definitely worth renting! good clean family entertainment. my 4 and 5 year-olds (and i) loved it. kept them on the edge of their seats. i recommend parents sit with their younger children to watch this, as it can be quite suspenseful for them. it's not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your children, and so this is a rare find. some of the acting / realism isn't quite there at times, or maybe is a little corny, but children don't seem to notice or care, they love it. parts are predictable, but other parts are not - like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. the movie doesn't have any really scary/creepy stuff, and so i doubt it will give children nightmares. it does inspire children to dream, which is something we need to encourage and foster more in our children. rent and be blessed!

this was a great movie. it had one "sot-so-nice" outburst. plus there were some very intense (drama) scenes which might make it inappropriate for younger viewers, under 6.for a under the radar film, the acting was quite enjoyable, and touched down in our family room for a near perfect landing. it held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it end.this movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day, but was given a somewhat more believable scenario. the dream scenes were a distraction at first, but did a great deal to establish the plot. the pranks and hi-jinx were also quite amusing.we hope you like as much as we did.

this film is titled "junior pilot" here on imdb but "final approach" at netflix. go figure! the movie is a delight for both the target youth audience and for adults who can suspend their maturity long enough to watch this film through the eyes of their own youth. for the adult, the story is quite predictable, and perhaps trite and melodramatic; whereas the tale may seem new and creative to youngsters who have not yet seen or read many films or books with such a story line.in any case, credit must be given to the film's creators, particularly the director james becket and the cinematographer denis maloney, for making this most entertaining and visually interesting film. the cut-aways to the young protagonist ricky's fantasy thoughts are hilarious as well as delightfully filmed.the young actors give uniformly believable performances, seemingly quite invested in their roles--silly as many scenes are. jordan garrett plays the protagonist "ricky" with quite well, having excellent camera presence. jeffrey tedmori creates a delightfully soft and sensitive "shashi" who of all ridiculous things thrives on hot sauce. skyler samuels and adam cagley give solid performances as well.as is typical of his always fine acting, larry miller creates a solid parental figure around which the children's part-real, part-fantasy world revolves. compared to his father-figure, the other major adult roles appear to be shallow and one-dimensional, intentionally and quite humorously so, to be sure.this movie is a simplistic youth-targeted story, of course, yet it is quite entertaining, perhaps repeatedly so to the targeted youth crowd, but also for at least one viewing by adults who retain the ability to view such a film from their once-youthful perspective.

i've just watched this with my three children - 12yrs (boy), 10yrs (boy) and 8yrs (girl) and this film was good old fashioned family action adventure. although definitely aimed at the kid market (i'd say 5 to 13)it was certainly watchable and as a parent it is a pleasure to find a movie that appeals to a broad range of ages whilst still being suitable for the whole family to watch - particularly younger children.the story revolves around ricky, a bit of a nerd with a vivid imagination (this can definitely be seen in his daydream sequences) who foils a kidnapping and major art theft while on on-board a flight to washington for a school trip. ricky's dad is an airplane mechanic, so ricky not only knows the structure of the aircraft inside out but is also a top-gun on his computer flight simulator. this comes in handy when the pilot and co-pilot are out cold through a series of misadventures and there is no-one left to fly the plane. i don't want to give away any more of the plot.

a fairly interesting look at some characters from india's burgeoning middle class. although india is rapidly modernizing, her culture is not keeping up. this film involves the patriarchal society, where women are not yet truly free citizens. a land of arranged marriages, men who dally with mistresses with total impunity, and women who are expected to tolerate all this, will eventually come up short. i was impressed with nandita das, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total earnestness. but i was even more impressed with shabana azmi, who i understand is a long-time fixture of bollywood. her quiet beauty and low-key psychic suffering was excellent. the lesbian subtext of this film was never particularly erotic, and never titillating. (darn!) worth a look for those interested in vastly different cultures.

i never heard of mishima before i watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious, i still find myself drawn to watch it when it is repeated on the box. at the beginning of the film, we are told about a celebrated japanese writer behaves like a lunatic and commits seppuku in public. as the film progresses you are gently inducted into twisted logic of mishima's mind. the stages of his life are are presented in four chapters. each chapter itself is a blend of two contrasting narratives, the first continues the story with scenes from mishima's life and appear in black and white. the second narrative is an adaptation of scenes from a novel and these are staged like a play and filmed in vivid colours. there is a different novel staged in each chapter. between each chapter, the narrative returns to the present, as mishima proceeds towards his eventual ritual suicide. this means that the drama and tension is maintained until the end.i suspect that many people will find this film to be boring pretentious and art-house. i respect that, this is not a film for people who want action and a strong story line. if on the other hand you are the kind of person who relishes the opportunity to penetrate the mind a bizarre man while watching his life story told in collage of beautiful pictures set to music by philip glass, you will love it. i loved it.

i saw this originally on channel 4 (uk) and it was a fantastic film that left a great impression on me. however i saw it on irish tv recently and there was an added narration by roy scheider ("we're going to need a bigger boat!"). this ruined the film for me. his droning monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film, and if anything takes from the films brilliance. i wonder at the new dvd version that has no roy (due to legal reasons?) would stop people from buying it. well believe me, the film is much better for it!cheersdamian

this movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet, mishima. it jumps around through his past, through his last day, and through some of his stories but is expertly constructed as it moves from section to section. it captures the flavor of the man, his work and of his times...the difficult 1960s.i think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of "wonder") are the excerpts from his works. the sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective. they could be used as exemplars for any set designer. i woke up at night dreaming of the golden pagoda. the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art. after watching this film, i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or japanese history.

mishima: a life in four chapters is an art-house biography about yukio mishima, celebrated japanese writer, who bears resemblance to paul schrader's earlier character travis bickle (taxi driver): both of them are lonely people searching for their place in their society and when they realize that world doesn't need them, they try to destroy their surrounding universe.if you want to learn about life of mishima, then you won't find a lot of information here, because it shows that he didn't live a very interesting life (except for his final day), but if you want to understand his personality, then it is the best movie of its kind, as most of the movie is adaptation of his novels and also provides a guide to his thoughts. this movie shows that mishima was a person, who witnessed the fall of japanese culture, which he was very fond of and with his final act he tried to save traditions and prove to himself that he is a real warrior, but he realized that as a person he was just a man with no power to change the events.

paul schrader and his brother leonard wrote mishima, and in so doing, clearly drew parallels between the life of yukio mishima and his work. the film is divided into four sections: beauty, art, action, and the fateful day when mishima held an army general hostage and spoke to the garrison, only to have it ridicule him and his bushido ideals of the samurai code. mishima committed ritual seppuku on november 25, 1970, and he planned it as a meshing of beauty, art, and action. schrader edits scenes recreating that day with three different scenarios from mishima's novels: temple of the golden pavilion, kyoko's house, and runaway horses. the moment of seppuku is perfectly realized in relation to its shocking climax via pulling back the camera while simultaneously zooming in. black and white sequences are intermingled with the colorful moments depicted in mishima's novels. the black and white scenes represent memories from mishima's childhood and youth. schrader correlates some of these autobiographical moments with scenes from the novels that often parallel mishima's real life, such as his stammer, development of his bodybuilding obsession, and his fostering of the samurai code. each of the three themes of beauty, art, and action is exemplified in the chosen depictions from the respective novels. the color sequences are reminiscent of early, stagy technicolor films, giving the film, perhaps, an intended surreal quality considering the subject matter.ken ogata plays the real mishima with unfailing determination, headed to the general's office on that fateful day and resembles the real mishima. schrader took tremendous risks with this film in focusing on the novels he did and with tying them thematically to both mishima's personal life and his literary ambitions. the editing of the film between the three main sections of november 25, 1970, the black and white growing up segments, and the colorful novel scenes clearly point to the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty, art, and action in mishima's life. at times, it is difficult to follow, and there may be little to recommend for the uninitiated viewer. *** of 4 stars.

this is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art. this is an oblivious labour of love by the schrader brothers about the life of yukio mishima that is full truly artistic elements. the movie jumps from color to black and white, past to present, fictional works by mishima to him. all without being confusing in the least bit. the only thing that gets me is that the entire movie, with the exception of the narrator's spoken parts is in japanese. still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but hasn't found won. criterion, if you are reading this, this is a film that should be released under your imprint with as much extras as possible. this film truley deserves more. 10/10

"mishima: a life in four chapters" is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative ease. it is based on the life of controversial japanese author yukio mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. it is not really a biopic - at least not one in the traditional sense - but an exploration of mishima's iconoclastic oeuvre. the film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an unembroidered, totally engaging manner. paul schrader makes you sympathize with mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work. it doesn't quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it. an added bonus: as we see mishima's fury over the lack of tradition in a morally vacant modern society, schrader gives us an excellent demonstration of the dichotomy between thought and execution in cinema. john bailey's cinematography is spectacularly good. the grandiosity of composer philip glass' work is perfectly suited for the project. "mishima" is the best film i've seen this year, so far.

this film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition. all this against a backdrop of an india which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values. this film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front. it is easy to see why "fire" has caused riots in india, but tragic nonetheless. a true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world, not just privileged westerners.

spoiler alert! don't read on unless you're prepared for some spoilers.i think this film had a lot beneath its shell. besides the apparent connections with "oldboy" (and park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action.the main actor, kang-ho song, is terrific in the r√¥le of the priest sang-hyeon - coincidentally, "sang" means "blood" in some languages - who truly loved tae-ju, played by ok-bin kim. their relationship reminds me a lot of that between martin sheen and sissy spacek in "badlands", where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger.their relationship is one thing, but the girl's mother is entirely different. while moving, she is stiff, one-dimensional and taut, but paralysed, she says all through not moving, or through the wink of an eye.park-wook has really, really mastered his cinematography in this film, and owes a lot to stanley kubrick; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film, some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch.the music is quite stock, using mostly strings to accompany the main thespian's monoreaction; it's a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is. while he does very little and loses at that, he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot. while his love-interest says and does a lot, her actions display very little thought behind it. in my humble opinion.all in all, a very disturbing film that is not made for action, which isn't even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days; it's magnificent, and repellant at the same time.

(this has been edited for space)chan-wook park's new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify. nominally a horror movie, the central character is a vampire, the film actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analog of viral invasion of a body), romance and few other things as well. it's a film that has almost too much on its mind. the film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic european literature, in this case emile zola's "th√©r√®se raquin". it's an odd mix that doesn't always gel, but none the less has an incredible power. here it is almost 24 hours since i saw the film at lincoln center (with a post film discussion by the director) and i find my cage is increasingly rattled. its not so much what happens is bothersome, its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring a lot of bells in retrospect.the plot of the film has a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease. infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dies, but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood (its not explained) he actually survives. hailed as a miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick. unfortunately all is not well. the priest finds that he needs blood to survive. he also finds that he has all of the typical problems of a vampire, and its no not possible for him to go out during the day. things become even more complicated when he becomes reacquainted with a childhood friend and his family. the priest, some of his animal passions awakened becomes taken with the wife of his friend. from there it all goes sideways.an ever changing film, this is a story that spins through a variety of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who finds that his life has been radically altered by a chance event and finds that he is no longer who he thought he was. it's a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever evolving into something else. its also a film that has a great deal on its mind and the themes its playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of waysthe film has enough going on that one could, and people probably will, write books discussing the film.the two of the strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance the vampire part of the tale is brilliant. there is something about how it lays out the ground rules and the nature of the "affliction" that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside. sitting in the theater last night i found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked. i think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is so earth shaking. here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life. it's contrasted with what happens later, it makes clear that living an existence of hunting humans really isn't going to work. its not the dark world of twilight or lost boys, rather its something else. i personally think that the film changes the playing field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible. (the sequence where the powers kick in is just way cool) the romance is also wonderfully handled. sure the sex scenes are steamy and well done, but it's the other stuff, the looks, the talk, the gestures outside of the sex that makes this special. i love the looks, the quiet stares as the forbidden couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act, the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspected, and the mad passion of possible consummation. this is one of the great screen romances of all time. it perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love (and lust). if you've ever loved deeply i'm guessing you'll find some part of your hear on screen, i know i did. the statement "i just wanted to spend eternity with you" has a sad poignancy to it. it's both a statement of what was the intention as well as the depth of emotion. the tragic romance will break your heart. i won't lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great. its not, as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are great (especially the actors who i have unjustly failed to hail as amazing) the whole doesn't always come together. the various genres, thematic elements and tones occasionally grate against each other. frequently i was wondering where the film was going. i hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlessly.i liked the film a great deal. i loved the pieces more than the film as a whole. its been pinging around in my head since i saw it, and i'm guessing that it will do so for several days more. like or love is irrelevant since this is a film that really should be seen since it has so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for days afterward. one of the meatiest and most filling films of the year.

anything park chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant, and very twisted at a minimum. well, anything that isn't i'm a cyborg at least. park's newest film titled thirst is a vampire romance-erotic-thriller-dark comedy-drama ¬ñ yes, that is a lot of adjectives ¬ó inspired by the 19th century french novel by emile zola titled therese raquin. park creates a uniquely korean, and uniquely park, vision of the vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a catholic priest discovering himself having a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop. park delivers on the elements you would hope but definitely falls short of masterpiece quality like oldboy or even that of lady vengeance. heavily bloated with a narrative that often loses itself much less the audience, thirst desperately needed another trip through the cutting room. it crawls when it should be running but luckily brings it back home before losing the audience completely. as negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted zeitgeist of park chan-wook film.check out the rest of our review at www.thefilmstage.com

although at times i was the only one in the cinema who was laughing, this is the main pleasure i took from the beautifully shot "thirst" - laughter. although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and didn't know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy, the blackest of black humour shone through at regular intervals. it helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful, and that i was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady, who was gorgeously elegant no matter how blood soaked and malevolent she became.i read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong. i didn't think so. in fact the last scenes, moving and hilarious (i mean, the brown shoes....) by turns, were among the best in the film.

of the korean movies i've seen, only three had really stuck with me. the first is the excellent horror a tale of two sisters. the second and third - and now fourth too - have all been park chan wook's movies, namely oldboy, sympathy for lady vengeance), and now thirst. park kinda reminds me of quentin tarantino with his irreverence towards convention. all his movies are shocking, but not in a gratuitous sense. it's more like he shows us what we don't expect to see - typically situations that go radically against society's morals, like incest or a libidinous, blood-sucking, yet devout priest. he's also quite artistically-inclined with regards to cinematography, and his movies are among the more gorgeous that i've seen.thirst is all that - being about said priest and the repressed, conscience-less woman he falls for - and more. it's horror, drama, and even comedy, as park disarms his audience with many inappropriate yet humorous situations. as such, this might be his best work for me yet, since his other two movies that i've seen were lacking the humor element that would've made them more palatable for repeat viewings.

as far as i am concerned, this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs i am used to viewing: 1 - the setting is paris, france; 2 - there is 28-minute scene with no dialog.both make this movie a bit unique, at least to english-speaking film noir fans. actually, an american, jules dussain, shot the film, so it's not entirely a european film. initially, i was disappointed in this after i had watched the first 40 minutes. it's an expensive dvd and i was bored. however, once that silent segment started - the actual heist (you already know what's it about), the film picked up considerably and just got better and better.in fact, i thought the best part of the story was what happened after the heist. the best aspect of the entire film was the cinematography. this is what makes the disc worth owning. it's excellent film noir photography and a real travelogue for those of us who have never seen paris...and this is paris in the mid 1950s. there are lots of bleak-but-interesting rain-soaked paris streets and buildings i found fascinating to view. in fact, there were many more of those great shots than of london in the much better known film, the third man.the lead actor in here, jean servais, i think his name is, also is interesting to view. someone described his face as a cross between humphrey bogart and harry dean stanton, and that sums it up perfectly. a warning for those not expecting profanity or nudity in a classic film. this is france, not the united states, so there is a little bit of both in here. i appreciate the dvd offering the choice of subtitles or a dubbed version, too.

if the caper genre owes a lot to walter huston, it also has a debt of gratitude to jules dassin, a man that was ahead of his times and who suffered a lot because of his blacklisting when edward dmytryk accused him of being a communist. the end of his american career would have meant the end of mr. dassin, but moving to europe proved he was bigger than the same people that had contributed to his hollywood demise."rififi" is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to mr. dassin's vision. he decided to adapt auguste le breton's novel because he saw the possibilities for turning it into a caper film that became an instant classic. jules dassin was penniless in paris when he discovered the city that were going to serve as the background to his film. the bad weather paid off for mr. dassin as the streets were always wet and not much had to be done to show them that way.when we first meet tony, he is playing cards. tony appears to be in bad health; he coughs all the time and sweats profusely. after losing all his money, he goes to see jo, the swede, who tells him about a possibility for a robbery at maupin & webb, the fancy jewelry store at a tony section of paris. they pass the idea through mario, who suggests cesar, the milanese, an expert safe cracker.tony, who has come out of prison recently, learns that mado, his former lover is now with grutter, a creep that owns a night club. upon confronting mado, instead of love, all he feels is contempt, and the meeting ends badly and he throws her out of his place. grutter has no love for tony, who is his natural enemy because of his connection with mado.when the day arrives, the gang is able to get to the apartment building where on the second floor, right above the jewelry store, the owner lives, but he is away. everything goes well and the gang gets away with the jewels. cesar, the milanese, a typical ladies' man, takes a ring as a souvenir, which in turn he gives the chanteuse at the grutter's night club. this tactical mistake is the spark which unravels the well thought plan.jean servais made an excellent tony. he showed a tired man who was possibly doing his last robbery. carl mohner, robert manuel and the director, jules dassin, are seen as jo, mario and cesar, the quartet jewelry thieves. marie sabouret plays mado. marcel lupovici plays grutter with a subdued intensity. robert hussein, who would go to direct movies later on, makes an impression with his remi, one of grutter's men.the film best asset is the great camera work by philippe agostini, who captured the atmosphere of paris and the locales where all these criminals operate from. georges auric's music plays well with the action in the film. jules dassin was peculiar in his choice of films that he directed, and unfortunately, that is our loss because this man was a genius as proved mainly with "the naked city", "night and the city" and "rififi".

this film is a work of pure class from start to finish, for a moment forget the famous 28 minute no dialog heist, forget that it's set in paris and forget it's noir. the film itself, the premise and the execution make this a pure gold experience.. it's sharp intelligent and thought through in great detail, just like the heist itself. it portrays real characters that are not only believable but whom you empathize with. it's a film that doesn't glamorize the notion of a robbery but shows it for what it is.. theft. it shows that a heist is hard work and ultimately not worth doing. now all things considered put on top of that a daring 28 minute sequence with not a word spoken and set in gorgeous paris with truly great attention to detail and fantastic cinematography and that last scene ...when you look up and see those trees... wonderful use of raw and basic filming techniques... it is a master piece in my view and i'm glad to have seen it.

the minutiae of what's involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all heist movies. then there's the robbery itself, a wordless, thirty minute nail-biter that has never been surpassed, followed by what is probably the cinema's most pronounced example of dishonor among thieves as things begin to spectacularly unravel, and we have what is unquestionably the greatest of all heist movies.this was a tough and unsentimental film when it first appeared in 1955 and it is just as tough and unsentimental today. (it displays some of the edgy brutality of dassin's earlier "brute force"). there isn't a flabby moment or duff performance in the entire film and dassin captures the milieu of seedy clubs and parisian back streets like no-one else and the final drive through paris by a dying man is one of the most iconic closing sequences of any movie. a classic.

or vice-versa.this is a french film noir directed by an american film maker (jules dassin) who had to leave the country because of being blacklisted by hollywood thanks to huac. the premise of the story is rather familiar--one last jewel heist for tony le stephanois and his buds--and so is the ending with everybody getting... well, no spoilers here, for sure, since this is the sort of film in which tension toward the ending is important.dassin filmed in realistic lighting in black and white on the streets of paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous. the engaging--sometimes intruding--score by georges auric nicely enhances the movie and will remind viewers of many a similar score from american film noirs from the forties and early fifties. jean servais plays the hardcore, consumptive lead in a fedora much as humphrey bogart might have played him. tony's recently out of prison, past his prime, but still tough and decisive when he has to be, his mind still sharp when focused, the kind of anti-hero whose eyes water even though the tears will never fall.dassin plays the italian safecracker and would-be ladies man who knows the rules but gets careless.in film noir we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify with the bad guys. often there are levels of bad guys, the "good" bad guys we are identifying with and the "bad" bad guys who are out to do in our good bad guys, and then maybe there's a really bad, bad bad guy or two. (here we have remi grutter, played by robert hossein, a slightly sadistic druggie.) then there are the cops who are irrelevant or nearly so. in more modern film noir the bad guys are not even "good" bad guys, and they get away with it or something close to that. in the old film noir, which evolved from the gangster films of the thirties, the usual motto, following the old hollywood "code," was "crime doesn't pay," with every criminal having to pay for his or her crime before the end of the movie.probably the most impressive feature of rififi is how nicely the film moves along. the plot unfolds quickly and seamlessly much the way the great film directors always did it, directors like stanley kubrick, louis malle, and the best of hitchcock. some have actually compared this to kubrick's the killing (1956) and suggest that kubrick stole a little. well, directors always steal if need be, and there are some perhaps telling similarities, such as it being "one last heist" for the protagonist, and having the girl gum up the works. the similarities may go deeper because as this film was nearing its end i suddenly thought, oh, no! the suitcase in the back seat is going to fly out of the convertible, hit the ground, burst open, and all the money is going to fly into the air! those of you who have seen the killing may recall what happened to the money near the end of the film! which reminds me of another film with something bad happening to the money: oliver stone's u turn (1997) starring sean penn. there the money in his backpack gets blown to smithereens by a shotgun blast. ha, ha, ha! getting the dubbed version of this film would be an act of sacrilege since the dialogue (when there is some: the heist itself is done entirely without dialogue, about 30 minutes worth) is terse and easy to follow requiring only an occasional glance at the subtitles, which, by the way, are quite utilitarian and guiding as opposed to having every word spelled out.one other thing: all the brutality is done as sex used to be done in film, that is off camera. a guy gets his throat slit. we don't see it. i kind of like this approach. we don't have to see the gore. you could almost let your kids see rififi--almost.catch this one now and be on the lookout for a hollywood reprise starring al pacino and directed by harold becker coming out next year in which you can be sure that the violent scenes will be played out in full.

after five years in prison, tony le st√©phanois (jean servais) meets his dearest friends jo (carl m√∂hner) and the italian mario ferrati (robert manuel) and they invite tony to steal a couple of jewels from the show-window of the famous jewelry mappin & webb ltd, but he declines. tony finds his former girlfriend mado (marie sabouret), who became the lover of the gangster owner of the night-club l' √¢ge d' or louis grutter (pierre grasset), and he humiliates her, beating on her back and taking her jewels. then he calls jo and mario and proposes a burglary of the safe of the jewelry. they invite the italian specialist in safes and elegant wolf cesar (perlo vita) to join their team and they plot a perfect heist. they are successful in their plan, but the d. juan cesar makes things go wrong when he gives a valuable ring to his mistress."du rififi chez les hommes" is a magnificent film-noir, certainly among the best i have seen. the screenplay has credibility, supported by an awesome direction of jules dassin, stunning performances of the cast and great cinematography. jean servais has outstanding performance in the role of a criminal with principles guided by the underworld rules. the famous long silent sequence of the heist is amazing and extremely tense and certainly among the best ones of the cinema history. i am listing this great movie in my list of favorite movies ever. my vote is ten.title (brazil): "rififi"

i see alot of movies at the cinema (103 so far this year) and i have to say that this is by far and away the best film i have seen this year, even though it was released back in 1954!i sat in awe and watched this work of genius and felt quite ashamed that i had never even heard of it before my local art house cinema decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new print. the best part of the whole movie has to be the 28 minute break in where there is no speech and no music, merely the sound of the men carrying out the heist. pure quality. although really dark in places it is lightened with the dry humour.not many films score 10 out of 10 but this does and also gets a gold star for effort!! if you ever get a chance to see this movie, please do not hesitate, it's a classic. 

rififi (jules dassin - france 1955)to me, it seems a very risky idea to attempt a hollywood-remake of jules dassin's 1955 classic rififi. planned for release in 2007, al pacino apparently is gonna play the lead, taking on the role of tony le stephanois. risky business... how they're gonna pull this off?ironically, dassin was blacklisted in hollywood and went on to try his luck in france and made this little masterpiece, aptly called by some "the grandddady of all caper- and heist movies". in my opinion, it remains a one-of-a-kind classic, beautifully filmed with one of the most memorable endings ever to be put on film. whatever one's opinion of the film.in the last couple of years rififi has become dangerously overpraised. nevertheless, this french noir-classic shouldn't be forgotten. go see it, before the remake is out there, in order to have some ammunition for comparing the two.camera obscura --- 9/10

rififi deservedly gets a lot of mention for the famous heist scene, and, indeed, that scene deserves all the credit it gets. it's a masterful piece of suspense, character interaction and photography. but rififi isn't just this one scene - every scene in the film is as masterfully put together, and as a whole, the film is not only taught with suspense, plot and character, but an adroitly told moral tale that set the scene for film noire for years to come.cinematically and technically, the heist sequence may be the most impressive scene of the film, but for me, it's the final scene that holds the most power - tony le st√©phanois's hallucinogenic drive towards redemption.

du rififi chez les hommes/rififi(1955) can on the surface be described as a french variation on john huston's seminal heist film, asphalt jungle(1950). the difference between the two films is rififi(1955) pays a little more attention in detail to the robbery sequence. also, the police aren't involved in the aftermath of the robbery in rififi as much as in asphalt jungle. in the end rififi(1955) is in my opinion a slightly better film than asphalt jungle(1950). remarkable noir picture that defines 1950s french cinema.spartacus(1960) may have been the one which broke down the infamous blacklist, but in my opinion rififi(1955) was the film that began to break apart the unbreakable hollywood blacklist. first film in five years for jules dassin who was victimized by the mccarthy communist hunt of the late 40s to early 50s. he got some sort of retribution when rififi(1955) became a success around france and europe. thus defying the poisonious hollywood blacklist in a major way that probably inspired others to do the same. rififi(1955) is the most important film of dassin's career because it not only restored his name, but also gave him a second chance at making films.jules dassin gave the filmworld and its ever growing audiences a masterpiece of influential proportions. his handling of the material is exceptional and direction of the actors is flawless. builds up tense situations with precise craftsmanship. dassin came full circle in the film noir genre by directing his best and last noir, rififi(1955). marked the end of dassin's period in filmmaking when he was involved in doing noir pictures.rififi(1955) is the number one film in an arsenal of thirty plus films for director, jules dassin. a masterpiece in acting, cinematography, directing, editing, and writing. not a film to leave your seat for one minute because there is always something memorable going on. as brilliant as anything by jean pierre melville who was a master of this type of film. masterpieces such as rififi(1955) are relatively small compared to the probably billions of films made in motion picture history.the one fascinating aspect of rififi is the precise planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes up a bulk of the 118 minute duration. the main characters plan and execute the jewel heist in the same way a film director prepares for the pre-productions, production, and post-production of a film. shows how difficult a jewel heist like in rififi(1955) is in committing and why very few would do something like it. the fact that the scene hardly contains a mess up like in other heist films turns this scene into something even greater. close as one can get to having a perfect sequence in a motion picture.lack of unnatural sound in the landmark thrity minute heist sequence puts it in a realm of absolute realism. any dialogue or/and music would ruin any suspense and tension the director is trying to create. the use of natural sound makes the heist sequence a rewarding film viewing experience. now filmmakers and producers would use dialogue and music in a scene like this because of a lack of confidence of a mainstream filmgoer's patience. sustains a level of consistency that never once lets down.maintaining a high level of suspense is what makes the heist sequence tick to perfection. the director achieves suspense in the heist sequence that's rarely equaled in most robbery scenes from heist films. jean servais and the rest of the main actors contribute to the suspense with some low key acting. getting suspense put in a scene is a task few are capable of doing. the robbery sequence of rififi(1955) reaches a hitchcockian level of suspense and tension.many filmmakers from the years following du rififi chez les hommes(1955) have been influenced if not inspired by it. one filmmaker influenced was jean pierre melville(original choice for director of rififi)who used variations of the heist sequence in le doulos(1961), and le cercle rouge(1970). another filmmaker influenced was stanley kubrick who made a similarly themed film in the killing(1956). also, quentin tarantino whose debut feature reservoir dogs(1992) was inspired by this film. other film directors influenced are john woo, michael mann, paul schrader, ringo lam, etc...du rififi chez les hommes(1955) is comparable to bob le flambeur(1955) in many ways. one, jules dassin and jean pierre melville directed groundbreaking films in rififi(1955) and bob le flambeur(1955). two, each film involves an aging criminal who plans and carries out a daring heist. three, bob le flambeur and rififi finishes in fatalistic fashion. four, each film shares many motifs and situations that classify the two as film greats.part of rififi's charm are the colorful characters that surround the story such as tony le stephanois, jo le suedois, mario farrati, and cesar le milanais. most of the violence is implicit yet effectively brutal. the main characters led by tony le stephanois abide by a strong outdated code of honor that is remindful of sam peckinpah and john woo. jean servais becomes the role of tony le stephanois with his cynical outlook and tired looks. du rififi chez les hommes/rififi(1955) became a favorite of mine the moment i saw it on the big screen from beginning to end.

in this election year, where so much idealism is attached to one of the candidates, it is poignant to watch a film that warns us not to make an idol out of anyone running for public office.luke eberl is the writer and director of "choose connor". there are significant parts of the film that reveal that he is a 'genius' when it comes to telling stories via the cinema.go see this movie before the election and then ponder why and for whom you will cast your vote.let you eyes be opened like those of the young protagonist.a mix of "citizen kane", "advise and consent" and "paths of glory" by a young director as talented as those who made the films listed above.

the plot line is an expose of the under belly of american politics. while the theme seems common, what "makes" the movie is the unconventional way the story is told.the characters are played with conviction. you feel the innocence of the lead, and his innocence lost. the politician is the prince of double-talk, a real snake.the camera work is impressive. it affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue. ditto for the music.the story uses a parable-style with vingettes where the message is filled with double-entendres. a very canny strategy by the writer/director. the tension in the storyline is carried through to the last scenes.the movie was like a good mystery book. something was "afoot"; you knew it was bad; you didn't know exactly what it could be - you had your suspicions; and when the evil was revealed you let out your breath you hadn't noticed you were holding in. saddened, shaking your head.a story well written and well told. 3 cheers to a young writer/director.

this movie doesn't have any pretense at being great art, which is good. but it is a well written script with well developed characters and solid acting. i think if i wrote it i could do without the drama surrounding the wife, but it wasn't distracting enough to detract from the main story concerning minnie driver's character. i think that all too often hollywood abandons an attempt at real quality writing to try and inject more visual drama when, with an adult themed movie such as this, the emotional type of drama is all that's really needed - and probably more believable too. overall, it's a very well done offering and well worth seeing.

gracie (minnie driver), a woman in her late twenties, is on a waiting list for a heart transplant. bob (david duchovny) has just had the tragedy of losing his wife in an automobile accident. one can guess the outcome. gracie receives bob's wife's heart, although they have no knowledge of each other....yet! a year later, gracie is feeling like a new person while bob is just beginning to think about his social life. when a friend sets him up on a blind date, bob finds himself interested in the waitress, gracie, at the restaurant where the date occurs. they begin to see each other. how long will it be before the truth materializes and what will be the consequences? this lovely, funny, and touching movie is one of the best romantic comedies ever constructed. the two stars dazzle as the couple only heaven could bring together and the supporting cast, of bonnie hunt, jim belushi, and carroll o'connor, are just marvelous as well. taking place near chicago, the neighborhood setting is likewise charming and beautiful. let's make that dittos for the costumes and script. if you know someone who goes ga-ga over mirthful love stories, you will be in their good graces forever if you introduce him or her to this fine movie.

i saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it. so charming and so very romantic. david duchovny and ms. driver have chemistry that is so hot, you will need to take off a layer of clothing. the supporting cast is 100% top notch. just watching caroll o'connor and robert loggia play off one another is pure poetry. bonnie hunt and jim bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the films most charming moments are when they are on the screen. like jim belushi screaming at his children to go to sleep "forever!" or him dancing in the kitchen. this film made we wish i knew people like that in my own life. not to mention, what woman does not want david duchovny for a boyfriend?

i'm not sure whether i like this film or not. i think it is creepy and completely weird.crispin glover as always gave a great performance as layne. i think his performance was really good and one of his best, but i don't like the character at all. keanu reeves performance was really good, and i truly felt for his character. over all i think the whole cast gave great performances as felt like the characters were real. i disliked some, but genuinely felt sorry for others (keanu reeves). i would like to know if that was the original ending that the film was supposed to have as it didn't end how i expected it to. i was disappointed in the ending and i don't feel that it did the rest of the film justice. if you are into creepy, weird and really well different movies, go for this one. if you like things that are normal, please stay away.

imdb forces reviewers to type a certain amount of lines, but all i really want to say is -- "this is an incredible film, and you can't consider yourself a film fan without having seen it." you ought to just trust me on this one and stop reading this review and get the movie and push play. but i have to type something. so, let me point out the following: (1) river's edge contains what still may well rank as crispin glover's all-time funniest and best performance in a film, and if you have been following crispin glover at all, you know that that alone justifies giving it a 10. funny lines galore.(2) river's edge contains the second-most memorable performance of dennis hopper's career (other than the one in blue velvet), and it is really excellent. dennis hopper is really funny.(3) river's edge contains the best performance of keanu reeves' career, and it is excellent. it was the role he was born to play. he has plenty of good lines, but one in particular is really really funny. listen close when his character and the step-dad are talking to one another.still the best stoner film, it is much more than just that. it tends to show up in the drama sections of film-rental stores, but if this is a drama, it's the funniest drama of all time.

i really don't have any complaints about this movie, except for the disturbing scenes with the body. i fell upon it while switching around the tv one night. the acting was actually amazing, i didn't expect it to be better than it appeared! i thought keanu's(who looks the same since 1986, which is a very good thing hehe) acting was really *great*, and crispin played his character perfectly! this movie is a hidden gem! its a fresh awaking of reality to the '80s, compared to the other teen movies done by the brat pack(even though i do like those moives alot too). all in all, i give it thumbs up!

after reading some of these reviews, it is apparent that some have missed the point. what is great about this film (here comes the point), what is incredible about this film, what is astonishing about this film is that there is no proselytizing. there is no preaching. there is no preaching. there is no preaching. life goes on. it is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for its collective self. these are just kids doing what kids do - without consciousness. we all went to school with kids like these. we are being numbed by fiction-/movie-/tv-/news-based reality/invention.feck's (dennis hopper the great) girlfriend alone and his relationship with her is worth the price of renting this movie.there have been few movies before or since that measure up to the intelligence of this film. amen.

i hope the writer, director, editor, and composer (and let's not forget producer) read this... because their work was truly incredible on this movie. let me start by saying that i am in no way affiliated with this movie. i am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times.every second of this movie is touching. every scene is classic. the acting is real. the movie is honest. you can relate to these characters as people, not actors.this tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives. the story is carefully thought out and every sub-plot is intertwined and woven together, culminating in a message that leaves us pondering the values of right and wrong that each of us carries inside.crispen glover, daniel roebuck, dennis hopper, and joshua john miller (as a 12 year old boy) give absolutely amazing, real performances. i've seen this movie about 8 or more times and i still get so absorbed in their performances that i forget i am watching a movie. it's that good. great job everyone who worked on this. great job.the music is also wonderfully matched and haunting. with the chosen cast, the carefully timed editing and pacing, the mood and tone, and even the subject matter, the director made some of the best decisions for a movie i've ever seen.this movie is real. it's honest. it's a true movie experience which i will never forget. you may not be into the subject matter but it is something you cannot ignore. ultimately, it's about people being people... and everyone can relate to that. i recommend this movie to fans of drama, suspense, and horror above almost every other film.

i can remember a college professor commenting as to how disturbing this film was, reflecting the apathy of adolescents (this was before generation "x").in a way, most of us are products of the same consumer culture; these high school kids spend their time drinking, getting high and wondering what to do about the body left on a riverbank.what would they do today? would things be different?. some very important questions. there are some excellent scenes with keanu reeves, and the dysfunctional family he lives with; his 11 year old brother going out to get wasted; the mother has no idea what to do- spends her time drinking with her boyfriend.this film was a bit before its time in that it addresses the problems in lower class american society; these kids had no outlet; what is available for them in this dirt-water town? . all in all a few interesting social commentaries are presented, and there are no solutions. 9/10.

i have seen this movie a number of times and find it very compelling and sad. the lack of real emotion from most of the characters is very disturbing. they seem empty, hopeless. the story is based on a real event.a teenage girl is murdered by her boyfriend for no obvious reason - apparently he just felt like it. then he boasts about it to his friends and as they don't believe him he takes them to view the body - a number of times. no one reports the murder. there are two strong leads - keanu reeves and crispen glover - crispen glovers character is seriously annoying.keanu's character matt appears to be the only one who has a sense of right and wrong. this is keanu at his best - a flawless performance and very believable - anyone who thinks this man can't act should watch this movie. matt's little brother is almost the most disturbing character in the movie. only twelve and no compassion or love factor in his life. it is very sad to think there are kids out there like this. it really makes you grateful for what you have. 9/10.

river's edge is an excellent film and it's a shame that it hasn't made more of a mark for itself in cinematic history. there were a number of gritty films based around school kids made in the eighties, but of all the ones i've seen; this is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing. the film takes a storyline that is disturbing in its own right and adds the theme of teenage slackers and their uncaring attitude about things, which takes the story onto another level. the film works because the central story is interesting and it's played out by complex characters. the film begins with a murder. we then follow the murderer, nicknamed john, as he goes back to school and tells all his friends about what he has done. rather than give the expected reaction, most of them hardly react at all and the strongest reaction that the murderer gets comes from layne; who makes it his number one priority to help john clear up the mess he's in and get him out of it. the other friends mull over the crime, and before long one of them goes to the police...river's edge features a host of great performances from its young cast. keanu reeves has a reputation for wooden acting, and for good reason; but he fits in very well to this early role and this performance is easily one of his best. crispin glover is the biggest standout as the slightly insane layne. glover always stands out in every film he's in, and while he does go over the top a little bit; he convinces well as the lead in this movie. reeves and glover receive good support from a talented young cast that includes daniel roebuck and joshua john miller, as well as the great dennis hopper in another wild role. the film features a very gritty picture which bodes well with its nihilistic tone. the central characters are all of the 'slacker/stoner' generation and the way that they genuinely don't seem to care about the murder of their friend is more shocking than the murder itself; and the point that the film tries to make about modern society is both strong and well defined. the film is also rather funny, owing to some of the characters' lines; but the humour is pitch black and clearly this film was never meant to be a comedy. overall, this is an excellent and memorable film that is definitely worth seeing!

less than zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they actually stuck to the damn book. but, where they hadn't, this movie presents does the job, and leaves you with the creepiest feeling when its all over in ways not done until the late nineties with larry clark's movies 'kids' and 'bully.' societal outcast teens are faced with a rather curious dilemma (they don't treat it much like one) when their estranged friend (daniel roebuck) boasts to them that he killed a teenage girl near the river's edge in their suburban town. keanu reeves may be the only civilized character among the bunch, the only one willing to exhibit any sort of conscience, anyway, while the others either don't do anything about the girl's death or want to help their friend hide the body. i don't know who is more sick in this film--crispin glover--who becomes nearly obsessed and quite paternal in trying to protect the friend and hide the crime by smuggling him out of the state. dennis hopper, an on-edge drug dealer (who clings to a female blowup doll) that befriends the teens (as a dealer, of course) and suddenly becomes involved in the events. or, josh miller, who plays reeve's little brother, tim. he appears to be the most apathetic of them all, at least until his emotional breakdown at the end. it is definitely not peppy 80s teen fare, obviously. and certainly makes the point strikingly clear about the serious detachment these kids deal with (despite a bizarre series of events) thanks to many great performances all around (even reeves proved some acting capability).help yourself to a comedy to recover if it rocks you too hard.

i just saw this movie for the second time. i first saw it back in the mid-90's as a vanguard video selection. it has retained it power.it is interesting from several aspects. one is that it is based on a true story. two is it is a launching pad for two interesting actors: keanu reeves and crispin glover. and three, it has dennis hopper in one of his better social misfit/psychotic character roles.the movie is also a study in the way people act in different settings. you have characters in one-on-one, family, peer group, school, general society settings, etc. the story does well in demonstrating how a person will act in each setting.i wish i could find the details of the actual murder to compare to the movie. i saw a short bit that indicated it occurred in california and that several schoolmates were taken to view the corpse. this is a good choice for a rainy night video rental. be prepared to feel unsettled at the end.

this film is one of the best of 1986 with creepy, yet intriguing performances from crispin glover and dennis hopper! the reagan years were pretty bleak for a lot of people, not just teenagers, but this flick really captured the desperation and despair. well-directed with great script (apparently based on a true story), i don't really see any weaknesses in this. the opening shot was brilliant.keanu reeves was decent for a change and miss skye was right on the money. hopper had three other great performances that same year (blue velvet, texas chainsaw ii, and hoosiers). i imagine this has a cult following and i wonder how this picture would fare if it was re-released. super stuff!

one of the better movies to come out of the 1980's, this based-on-fact movie tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend, leaves her naked body on a river bank, and brags about it later to his friends. what is just as bad is their inability to feel anything about it.disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic kids who have no respect for their parents or any sort of authority, who seem almost doomed to live lives of rebellion and recklessness. this drama hits hard and is impossible to forget. the young cast does a creditable job - even keanu reeves, in one of his earliest roles, is better than usual. of course, there's no reason for the character of layne (crispin glover) to be as crazed and off-the-wall as he is, but that's just glover being himself. veteran dennis hopper has an especially good role as a loner who despite his own sordid past is saddened by the attitudes of this group of kids. i would like to point out the chilling performance by daniel roebuck as the young murderer; he's an under-rated actor and aside from hopper, his is probably the best performance in the film.i saw "river's edge" for the first time a long time ago when it first started being shown on cable tv movie channels; however, i didn't catch all of it; i saw it in its entirety for the first time a number of years later, and now i've seen it again for what is probably the definitive time.some potently affecting moments include madeleine's (constance forslund) breakdown where she wails that maybe she should leave her children just like their worthless father did. i also liked the scenes where matt (reeves) faces off with his disturbed younger brother (joshua miller) and when the teacher, mr. burkewaite (jim metzler) deplores the fact that the girl has died and that none of his students seem to care.i will never forget this film, not as long as i live. it's too saddening for that.10/10

river's edge is not a pleasant film to watch but it is an incredible one. having viewed it many years ago i truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be re released or remade or something. perhaps no movie ever made has captured the essense of young suburban inertia like this distrubing frightening movie. given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing. very well acted and just unpleasant at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a truely important film. should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all highschools. fantastic.

this is actually the first movie i ever saw in a theatre , where the people didn't leave immediately when the end credits started. in stead they remained seated for a few minutes , gaping with their mouths open staring in the infinite , trying to understand what they 've just seen.the only thing i can say: try to go watch this movie with as little knowledge about it as possible (so did i)!. i gave it a 10

fair and nifty little science fiction/horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer, allegra geller (jennifer jason leigh) whose latest game - "existenz" not only draws the attention of people who volunteer to try the game, but one who nearly kills her (and her game, too). since she forced to stay out of sight, allegra is stuck with ted pikul (jude law), a marketing trainee ("p.r. nerd") to be her bodyguard even though he only has a gun that's made out of flesh and bone and the bullets are teeth. director david cronenberg has, well, used some bits from his earlier films ("videodrome", "scanners", "the fly", etc.) and placed it into certain parts of the story with some good timing. law and leigh are fine here and so are some of the supporting cast (ian holm, willem dafoe, sarah polley, christopher eccelston, and so on) that has an international twist to it. dafoe is anything but devilish as gas, a deceiving garage mechanic. one of the movie's best scenes is witnessing ted eat (fish and frogs) and construct a gun and admit to allegra - " i can't help myself." "existenz" manages to show that he (cronenberg) is up to his old tricks and it still works like a charm.

this was a movie i came across by accident. i was flipping through and saw it was on showtime so i watched it. now i watch it at least once a month. this is a movie that is filled with symbols that might cause some people to trash it. don't listen to people that hate this movie, if they want an action movie with expensive f/x they should have rented a movie that promises them. if you are in the mood for a good sci-fi, i highly recommend. if purchasing on dvd i recommend the alliance atlantic edition of the film, it contains many more extras than the dimension films edition.

i have seen this movie twice and it's theme is an invigorating one. i have been into computers for many years now and this movie inspired me in a technologically sense as does a fresh love which stoked the furnace of my poetic passion in the heat of infatuation. very original idea,great allurement in the way it holds you as it tells it's story to minds that need a release from the every day realities of this life.

david cronenberg movies are easily identifiable, or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks. fetishism, the blurring between the organic and inorganic, squishy throbbing things that shouldn't be squishy and throbbing. "existenz" is classic cronenberg. briefly, it's about a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, visuals are supplied by your mind. the game plugs directly into a 'bio port' in the base of your spine and while the game is running, the player can't tell reality from game. jennifer jason leigh plays the game's developer, guiding a novitiate marketeer, jude law, through the game's paces. while in the game they uncover strange goings-on and possible crimes. but are they real, or is it the game? not even the game's author knows. the movie is quite a treat, keeping the viewer engaged, but in the dark until the final minutes. another thing i like about "existenz" is that it doesn't use a heavy reliance on special effects, it's the story itself that propels the movie. recommended for the saturday night when science fiction is called for.

the movie existenz is about a futuristic video game on a "pod" system that is almost like virtual reality. the only copy of the video game is damaged when an assassination attempt is made on the designer (jennifer jason leigh). unless it can be repaired, the many years and 38 million dollars spent on the development will all go to waste. the only way to repair the game however, is to actually go in the game with the only person she feels she can trust(jude law). this movie was pretty good, but doesn't really pick up until very late in the film. the best thing about this film were the twists toward the end. definitely worth seeing. 7/10

i loved this movie but then again i am a big cronenberg fan. if you have not seen a david cronenberg film then this is not a good place to start. scanners, the fly, rabid would be a place to start and then work up to videodrome before checking this one out. this is certainly one of his best and takes the interactive game phenomena one step beyond.in this game the players plug a bio-engineered game pad through a jack inserted into their spinal cord and get into the game directly through their nervous system. it is very hard to tell you more without giving away the story and the plot but it is enough to say that this is a game you will not forget. it is full of cronenberg's slimy body works, dark foreboding scenery all populated by a great cast including jennifer jason leigh, jude law and willem dafoe who take the situation they find themselves in very seriously. these people will do what they can to figure out the game and then to win at it. like other movies of his there is no shortage of imagination or parts where you sink to the seat but like an auto-accident you don't look away. if you liked any of the movies mentioned above then by all means go out and get this one.

yes, i have noticed that there are 347 other comments, i think that is a good sign for a movie, even if some are negative. i have seen this movie 2 and a half times. i adore it and would watch it again. it is very smart, but i can understand why some people would hate it. they don't get it's appeal. yes, i have a weird taste in movies, but this is a great movie. some of the lines are just so quick, like the whole scene in the chinese restaurant. i started dying laughing. that and when he was in the assembly line talking to the contact. jude law was wonderful, though it was humorous, him trying to cover up his wonderful accent. anyways, i do not consider myself the movie goddess as some critics of this movie and if you have nothing better to do than write pseudo-intellectual movie commentaries about films you hate online, i feel sorry for you. why don't you write about movies you like, like me. i just love how everything ties together, it keeps you guessing, even though you guess wrong. the ending was interesting, and not overdone. it was purely clever. i would not compare it to the matrix, because i think people then get the wrong idea. i went into this movie expecting nothing except jude law and a sci-fi. i was blown away. i have no clue about any other of cronenburg's films, but love this on its own merit. another clever thing was the foreshadowing with the dog. definitely watch this movie.

this was a great movie, i would compare it to the movie the game. you get to the end of the flick and cant move... your brain has been removed and shaken (not stirred) and put back in your head. dont plan anything after this movie, you will need time to think about what just happened.dont come to this movie expecting the matrix style multi millions spent on special effects, this movies special effects come from the actors, they keep you involved, no, they suck you in and dont let go for the entire duration of the movie. great acting, great plot... very enjoyable film, i cant say enough. also very original plot, plenty of twists and ideas that i would have never thought of. the ending is abrupt and leaves you hanging wondering, was that real? is this really the end? good ending, not saying that it is bad... just leaves you wondering, and a little frazzled.great movie for those who like action, like a good plot (dont get up for a bathroom break on this movie, you will come back lost) and like mind games, because thats exactly in a nutshell what this is.

you got to see it to believe it. shot in hollywood on the strip in the middle of the sleazy, anything goes 70s, this cheaply made flick must of really packed the inner city theatres back in the day. then again, i bet it had a one week run. actually, its pretty hilarious. the acting is dreadful, the direction non existent, but the hair, clothes, rotten pre disco music and the general out and out sleaziness of the story are mind boggling. sleazy, its very sleazy. highly recomended (if you can find it)

(possible ?? spoilers included, but nothing critical given away.)i just watched this classic low budget movie on video, and was knocked out by the level of energy present on screen. all the actors do themselves proud, especially john daniels, must see another of his films. not only does this movie boast great performances, but manages stylish sequences, like when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see shards of glass falling into a swimming pool which erupts from the impact of the fallen man, i love the way slow-motion photography was used in 70's cinema, dreamy and hypnotic. cool and witty black dudes spout great one liners while slimy seedy lumps of white trash come to unpleasant ends. i love it, my rating 10 / 10. if this ever comes out on dvd, count me in for a purchase.

i started to watch this show by accident, but i love it. the fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television, especially for kids shows. my five-year-old nephew (as most children do) would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of handicap but after he watched pelswick it just seemed to be a normal occurrence to him. every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say "like pelswick" and go on with what ever he was originally doing. and yes the animation is a little crude, but if you can stand to watch through the first season of the simpsons then this isn't that bad. the "genie" is actually an angel who is there to help pelswick learn lessons in life. he can not walk some else said he could walk some of the time, i've seen every episode and he never to my recollection walked, he is a paraplegic he has no feeling below his armpits (he mentions it in an episode). as for the humor if you can get a copy of the "ntalented" episode, which lampoons boy-bands, you will instantly love this show.

eve is an eye opener, because of the great sceneries and the tech-no music in the backgrounds, we hear. this movie shows a good aspect on the human body being god's creation and to considerate about it, viewers can earn better respect on the legendary story of adam and eve (either if it's true or just a fairy tale, depending on what we believe) from watching this movie. actress/model inger ebeltoft's impersonation of eve is so good, there's no good word to describe her performance, and i can't imagine having another actress being eve. this movie to me, comes in really handy for the type of therapy of stress relief. we'd never fell so relax then before from watching this movie. this movie is a masterpiece, god supposedly wanted this movie to be made in the first place!mr. razbin!

the story of a little girl who was driven once by fear and now by pain, she becomes woman and a vengeful crime fighter. her power is to manifest strong anime characters onto herself. this movie fuses animation with live action as she wields her animated sword through all that stands before her. she struggles to deal with life, her demons, and her fears.young emily watched her parents fight and argue. she watched her dad leave her motherless. emily soon discovered she had the power to do something about it. emily grew through life traveling as a loner and at night she had the power to make a difference in the world.this movie is a great blend of animation and real action. there are many themes and metaphors that run deep through the movie. this movie is broke up as a 12 part series.

drawn by pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema i have ever seen. here are my reviews of the episodes released so far: episode one was even better than i expected and from everything i had heard about it, i expected quite a lot. i am very impressed with the actors already. the father was creepy and played perfectly. the little girl is so expressive, she uses her eyes to convey such emotion. the animation was superb. the cinematography was amazing, each camera angle capturing the feeling of the scene perfectly. the editing was done so well, each scene blending seamlessly into the next. the music captured the emotions quite well and drew you into the story. i just can't say enough about how wonderful this episode was. it definitely whets my appetite for more! episode 2 was even better than the first one! everything i said about the first episode carries through, only you get to see even more of the character development. i can not wait to finally see episode 3, or the rest of the series for that matter. what is developing is an intriguing, character driven storyline with all the trappings of a big hollywood production, but without the pretension. so much is said, with so few words. this series is something like you've never seen and perched to become a real success.this episode was freaking awesome! no other words describe it! wow! everything that i've said about the previous episodes holds true for this one, and yet it was even better! i don't know how you manage to take something amazing and make it even better! the further character development proves that this is a completely character driven piece. the cinematography excels as it always has and draws you into emily's pain, fear, hate and emotional roller-coaster. i can't wait to see episode 4... or the rest of the series for that matter. you have truly outdone yourself!as much as i have loved the other episodes, episode 4 is the best yet. i love the character progression. i feel like we are really coming to know emily, her pain, and her internal struggle. the other themes i've stated in past reviews are continued. great cinematography, the writing is superb, the actors are right on with their portrayals and have made the characters their own, and the animation is simply amazing! another great job from the dbp crew!

this young filmmaker has a talent for capturing his audience quickly with unusual camera work and sparse but intense scripts. the concept here of combining animation with live footage is remarkably well-executed and the soundtrack is very good.the decision to release the movie in twelve parts online puts the onus on the director to make each episode fascinating enough for the viewer to invest in buying each upcoming episode. i only wish all motion pictures had this kind of commitment to keeping their audiences entertained throughout their stories.highly recommended.

rock star is a well-told hollywood-style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how ripper became rob halford's replacement for judas priest. mark wahlberg poured on his likable boy-ish charm and performed with believable admirably, something he has been known to do since the release of boogie nights.stephen herek, no stranger to musically-themed movies, takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species, the hair-metal rock god. wahlberg's "izzy" acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true. his likable character quickly wins over the heart of the viewer, who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the metal "goat horn" hand-sign several times over.the only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast, namely the other members of the band, were not fleshed out, or even introduced, properly. more interaction with these life-long rock musicians would have amplified and solidified izzy's new surroundings. naturally, rock star is filled with great music. rabin's score, the steel dragon's original work and plenty of 80's-style metal hits makes this soundtrack a must-have! let's all hope that films like rock star not only give a credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation but also spark a very-needed revival.

rock star / (2001) *** (out of four)by blake french:	"rock star" is the story of a nobody who becomes propelled into fame, only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it. we have seen all this before (in better movies), but this human story does capture the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge. it garners a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere. the script, by "crazy/beautiful" director john stockwell, portrays the hard-core universe with memorable images-it doesn't explain what it is about, it shows us.	"rock star," originally titled "metal god," stars mark wahlberg as chris "izzy" cole, a pittsburgh office supplies salesperson who dreams of becoming bobby beers, the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group, steel dragon. although chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called blood pollution, instead of writing his own songs, he insists on performing only those by steel dragon, and only in the exact way they perform them. his group becomes irritated with chris' obsessions and gives him the boot.	this devastates chris, as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend, emily (jennifer aniston from tv's "friends"). he then receives a phone call. it's the steel dragon band. they have seen chris' tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer. in an instant, chris rockets into the dizzying world of sudden stardom-from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. unfortunately, it's not as rewarding as he expected.	a true story inspired the "rock star" concept. an ohio supply salesman, tim "ripper" owens, really did replace rob halford, the lead singer in judas priest, after initially singing for a tribute band. the rest of the film is probably fiction, although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands. the film details the various ordeals of being a rock star. it explores the aspects of touring, personality differences, the danger of drug abuse and violence, struggling relationships, sexual freedom, dishonesty, and the extreme measures of the producers all to please the fans and keep popularity high. i have seen all of mark wahlberg's movies, and this is the first that has earned my affection. wahlberg, a former singer/model, has made movies like "fear," "boogie nights" "three kings," and most recently tim burton's lacking remake "planet of the apes." i am starting to admire the young actor more and more. although he has not performed in many successful films, he has taken many chances, and done a variety of roles. "rock star" is his best film to date. i can't think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed chris cole's struggles and aspirations. wahlberg truly makes "rock star" rock. jennifer aniston lights up the screen as well. she creates a chemistry-rich relationship with chris that induces audience participation. it's tragic of what happens to their relationship. we care about these characters a great deal. during the film concert scenes, director stephen herek (who also directed "holy man" and the live action version of "101 dalmatians") creates a gripping atmosphere. he captures the scenes with an intense urgency, and a raw, unmistakable energy. the musical numbers provide the film with the best, most involving scenes. unfortunately herek cannot sustain the energy and zest throughout. at the three-quarters mark, he looses the spark as the movie becomes dull and unpleasant. i understand where the story needs to go in order to portray the negative side of fame, but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it. in "almost famous," a much better film about rock and roll, there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most sorrowful scenes. here, it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion.the message comes a bit too late and suddenly in the story. the film turns into a morality tale that wants to provide us with a sappy destination. the filmmakers might as well stop everything, appear on screen and say: "now audience, the moral of the story is¬Ö" we understand the theme, but it's too instantaneous. the personal discovery for chris' must be gradual.fortunately, all of this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the film, hardly enough to completely destroy an entire eighty-five minutes of a reasonably good feature. "rock star" is not a great movie-see "almost famous" if you want a remarkable film about rock and roll-but for marky mark, it's a turning point in his career. 

surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. but the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clich√©s in the final act. i enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball "almost famous". it has a nice, bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish might've made it more memorable. **1/2 from ****

i'm an action movie fan but until today i've never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in italy, so i went to see "the long kiss goodnight" on pay-tv hoping for nothing special.but, what a surprise! this movie is great! the only problem i found is the presence of some holes in the plot, but the rest is the most entertaining, intriguing and funny action movie ever made.the transformation of samantha/charly from ordinary wife-teacher to cool-blooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea. the action scenes and the stunts are the best i've ever seen. samuel l. jackson adds some of the best lines i have ever heard and his chemistry with geena davis is good.and what about geena? she is wonderful, she plays the best action heroine ever seen and does strong, convincing acting and fantastic stunts.so i think this movie had weak performances at box office and bad critics because most reviewers and some kind of public have a hard time with strong female lead roles.9/10.

this is one of the best action films i have seen. geena's portrayal of the tough as nails, 'charly'/gentle mother 'sam', was superb and samuel l jackson just keeps you laughing all the way through, with his classic one liners. sure, there were a few holes in the actual story, but this fast-paced flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end.i felt geena was a perfect choice for the role of sam/charly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as the mother in the recent movie 'stuart little'. both samuel and geena were well supported by david morse, brian cox, sweet little yvonne zima and newcomers, sexy craig bierko, and melina kanakaredes. this film accentuates the growing trend of strong female character and the diversion away from traditional male/female stereotypes as we see sam/charly (davis) and mitch (jackson) hurtling from one disaster to the next.while i and many others loved this movie, it is fair to say that there will always be people that don't and that's fine - each, to their own. i highly recommend this film to action fans, for its hilarious scenes and fast-paced action.

terrific movie: if you did not watch yet, you must watch. geena davis and samuel l. jackson are amazing in this movie.great actors + good story + incredible action scenes > "the long kiss goodnight" i give it a 10, a+, 4 stars.

spoilers in this reviewthe long kiss goodnight is yet another prime example of a common affliction of many modern films; it starts off on a very interesting concept - a trained assassin whose memory was erased regains consciousness of herself - and the initial setup is engaging but then it seems the writers don't know very well where to go next and the whole thing trails off down increasingly confusing and/or inane paths, leaving the disappointing taste of something that was ok but promised to be a lot better. the baddies are remarkably unremarkable, and even jackson's comic sidekick turn seems more like something from his pre-pulp fiction days; it looks like harlin, as in cutthroat island, made every effort so that no-one would upstage his then wife. her character is by far the best of the film and this fact only makes you feel even more frustrated that they weren't able to do something better with it.however, there is still something about this film which for me sets it apart from the run-of-the-mill hollywood actioner and places it above average, if only just. it is something very subtle i can't quite put my finger on; it's a disturbing, cold, dark, even sickly edge, a nightmarish and unreal feel, a decadent air, a mean streak, which keeps cropping up in various ways. it's in the dark reddish photography and almost permanent night the characters dwell in, it's in samantha's dreams in front of the mirror, it's in her vicious eyes and smile whenever she's about to kill a man or when she announces how she will enjoy watching her nemesis die with her daughter listening, it's in mitch's comeback at the wheel of a car while he is spurting so much blood from his mouth he can hardly speak... i don't know, it's an atmosphere, something i can't define but which gives me the creeps (a bit) and which makes this film still oddly intriguing for me.

almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. geena davis is a schoolteacher housewife who suffers from amnesia. she'e even on the pta! but then an auto accident awakens the woman she used to be, and it's hot! samuel l. jackson is hilarious as the low rent private eye who tries to help davis find her past, only to find out he's in way over his head. davis has some hilarious lines too, and the interaction between her and jackson works surprisingly well.look for brian cox, the original hannibal lechter, and david moorse finally managing to shed his st. elsewhere tv image. the film is directed by davis' husband, who almost seems to have built the whole film around her, but it works.i pull out this dvd and rewatch it often. i still love the makeup scene. is geena hot or what?

i was happy to find out that at least now this movie is beginning to get the appreciation it deserves (just view those votes). not top-class action like "die hard" or "lethal weapon", but still something like a solid 7 out of 10: fine script, good actors with working chemistry, and a director who knows what he wants (sadly, this was director harlin's last good film. "deep blue sea" managed to reach 'an ok rollercoaster-ride'- status, but "cutthroat island, and especially, "driven" are well-deserved flops!) personally i think the turn-off at the box-office might have been the "woman as an action star"-theme. well, give her a chance, because davis does deliver a performance above par. and, after all, this film doesn't concentrate so much on the "feminine"-side, but instead on good ol' action, buddyism (jackson as a sidekick is given a lot of room in here, plus his share of action- and about a thousand killer wisecracks!) and on the plot (from shane black, the writer of "lethal weapon" and "the last boy scout". the latter of which as a movie is on very many levels much like this one...the theme, the clever plot, also as good and as underrated!) overall: if one hasn't seen this one yet, don't forget to rent it for the next quiet saturday night!

i love this film...! i've seen it 1000 x on dvd and i cant say enough about it. it has it all, comedy, awesome action and incredible stunts/fx. samuel jackson steals the show here big time. i dont think there isnt a moment that he's in that he isnt funny! "everyone knows that when you make an assumption, you make an ass out of you and umption"!! the f/x are great! the bridge/truck explosion is incredible, although the sound isnt all that great!when samuel drives out of the truck, the sound is off a little i think and what he says is priceless!!! for those of you who own it on dvd, put the audio in french!!! it's halarious!!! even emotional moments are great when the bad guy discovers that sam's/charlie's daughter is his, is great... this is a great film that no action fan can do without... i also reccomend cutthroat island... aside from all the negative publicity, it kicks!!!!

amazing, amazing, amazing. what more can be said? jacobi is the best hamlet ever to grace the stage and captures every inch of the character. every nuance and element of hamlet is depicted and depicted well. some people have complained about his age, but you honestly cannot tell when watching the film. if anything, he looks drastically younger than 40. i only wish a more worthy ophelia could have been found. her acting is passable but she just doesn't look the part. the only real exceptional performances come from jacobi and stewart, who is a great claudius. the rest of the cast is good, but jacobi is what truly elevates this teleplay.

i have watched every version of this play that i can think of, including several on the stage, and sir derek jacobi is absolutely the best hamlet i have ever seen! he has the most wonderful voice for stage acting, and his expressive face will take you on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this play. the way in which he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness. he (as hamlet)can in an instant be loving, soft and gentle and in another instant be raging against the hell that is his life. you believe that he is in pain, you believe that he is angry, you believe that he is not a little mad. you believe he is hamlet.of course, some of the thanks obviously goes to shakespeare, :) but without an excellent actor to get the words from the page to the stage, it doesn't really matter how well written a play is.if you like shakespeare, you absolutely must see this version. if you don't like shakespeare, you absolutely must see this version. you will come away with a new appreciation for shakespeare if you do. the nuanced performance that sir derek gives will leave you breathless.

1. i've seen branaghs hamlet: branagh is too old, speaks frequently with a high pitched voice (unwillingly funny!) - not a convincing hamlet, and his directors qualities - poor ! (see also much ado about nothing from branagh - the funny parts of the dialogues have mostly been cut out not speaking of the directors mistakes in the dialogue cuts!) 2. i've seen hamlet 2000: i think the scenario is an interesting idea - but such lousy actors - all of them 3. orson welles hamlet is ok - but this bbc hamlet is the best! derec jacobi is convincing - seems a bit of a lunatic - very suitable! and patric stewart - wonderful, and claire bloom is a very attractive queen. you believe those actors what they are saying - i think this is the best compliment.

i have seen this play many times, from olivier to branagh, and this remains the one version that always stands out in my memory. many actors have captured aspects of this character, but for me, it is always derek jacobi's performance they are compared to and all others just come up a bit short.

part of the bbc filming of all of shakespeare's classic plays, this version of hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of shakespeare's most over-rated plays and hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character. i feel no sympathy for him, and i didn't after watching this.even when you have great actors like the great derek jacobi in the role of the dane, and patrick stewart as claudius and jonathan hyde as rosencrantz, it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline. and when a good actor like jacobi injects passion into it, he renders the entire role incomprehensible. i just could not connect his physicalisation of the character to what he was saying, and this killed it for me. that said, he does get the "to be, or not to be" speech right, as his actions with a dagger make clear the character's suicidal intentions at that point in the play.the supporting roles, to me better written and consequently better played, are enjoyable, notably lalla ward's loopy ophelia and stewart's well-detailed interpretation of claudius.at four and a half hours, it is very long and best watched in bite-sized chunks. check it out if you're interested but be prepared for a long watch.

i was never in the past interested in this play although love shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studied some at school. something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off. i never bothered to try to see hamlet until fairly recently deciding i should at least try to watch it and i borrowed the olivier version from the library. well, i struggled with it. olivier seemed far too old, not only in his looks but in his acting of the part. the play had been enormously cut to fit a more conventional movie length and i think must have missed out too much as i found it difficult to concentrate on it, soon became bored and annoyed by it. i still think olivier's henry v is the best version i've seen of that rousing play - tho' admit i haven't rewatched the beeb version yet and can't recall how it was when first shown.i heard of the branagh full length version of hamlet. although i enjoyed his much ado, i think the beeb version is far better and i wasn't entirely impressed by his henry v. but i was off branagh a bit after seeing his disappointing effort at a musical of love's labour's lost which is a play i like and was so well made by the beeb. finally acquiring the complete beeb shakespeare on dvd recently, i soon rewatched one of my most favourite shakespeare plays, richard ii, and was simply enthralled by jacobi in the part so was immediately persuaded to watch his hamlet next. what a revelation this play now is for me! yes, it is splendid, but i feel it needs an actor you can emphathise with to play hamlet and this for me is jacobi. amazing. intriguing to note that although he is older than i understand the character hamlet was, it doesn't show whilst in olivier it did. now i note he's also in the branagh version and had much to do with training branagh, so i shall have to watch that to see what jocobi does with claudius! i'm interested to discover jacobi has trained branagh as yes, you can certainly see the influence.and now i'm going to watch it all over again....

for those of you who've wondered what an art-house monster movie might be like, wonder no more. the daimajin trilogy, circa 1966, was just such a series. more period samurai epics than anything else, these three movies just also happen to feature one of the most (literally) monstrous deux et machinas ever. there's not a single facet of these gems that is unpolished, from the scenario(s) to the performances to the filmmaker's craftsmanship. even the special effects are handled with well-above-average skill, and are integrated (in most instances) almost seamlessly into the movie(s). if you're a gojira fan or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who just likes a good movie regardless of genre, i highly recommend the daimajin trilogy.

ruthless evil warlord samanosuke (superbly played to the hateful hilt by yutaro gomi) cruelly mistreats the peaceful residents of a small village. the giant stone statue majin eventually comes to life to destroy samanosuke and his wicked minions. director kimiyoshi yasudo and screenwriter tetsuro yoshida give the compelling story all the power and simplicity of an ancient age-old legendary folktale: there's a very strong sense of an ancient time and faraway remote place (it's specifically set in feudal japan), the good guys are noble and appealing while the villains are truly nasty and detestable, the occasional stirring swordfights are staged with considerable skill and gusto, the special effects are fine and impressive, the serious tone and steady pace never falter for a minute, and majin's last reel rampage of savage destruction is extremely lively, exciting, and more than a little scary. moreover, the fantastic elements of the narrative are given substantial credibility by being firmly grounded in a throughly believable dark, harsh and gritty world. this film earns bonus points for depicting majin as more of a brutal and frightening force of angry vengeance instead of a pure spirit of absolute good. veteran composer akira ifukube supplies a typically rich, robust and rousing score. fujio morita's sharp, moody cinematography likewise hits the bull's eye. the capable cast all give admirably sound and sincere performances, with especially praiseworthy work by jun fujimaki as the valiant, protective kogenta and tatsuo endo as mean henchman gunjuro. highly recommended.

with its rerelease by adv films, i've had a chance to watch "the giant majin" for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of a late night horror chiller theaters. guess what? it's a pretty damn good movie!the sets are authentic, the acting in subdued and believable, and the giant majin is stately, powerful, and unstopable. i loved the subtle fantasy touches (the enchanted wood, luck charm, etc), and the potrayal of the god as a little less than 'good'.this movie is begging for a remake in the new century!

this film is absolute cinematic genius. it has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance. the effects are nothing but stunning and the story will keep you hanging off your chair right the way through the movie. jack long plays the part of abbot white exceptionally well, he provides an immensely thrilling portrayal of absolute evil. if your a kung fu fan or just an action movie enthusiast this film is an excellent choice for anyone who is lucky enough to find a copy. for any big kung fu fans this movie provides a compelling insight into the world of shaolin. this film is definitely 10/10 quality and should be considered as one of the greatest eastern movies of all time.

i saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in pablo co. i had just quit my biomedical engineering job at a hospital. i consider the script to be a exaggeration of the real type of stuff that goes on in hospitals. the idiots that put it down on production value don't get the point and probably have never been hospitalized. and never worked in one for sure. billy jack (same era) was very poorly produced but had a significant social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message.i have ever since been looking for this movie this is the first site i have found where it get mentioned.

it has been since 1972 that i saw this movie and i still remember it as one of my favorite all time movies. i would buy a copy if it were on dvd and it is too bad it isn't. you would think that anything starring peter sellers would be brought back. much better than "being there" and as good as the pink panther series. uschi digard had a small part for such a well endowed performer. she is bonus in this movie. i think the medical field may not appreciate this film as it really makes fun of the profession and it also makes one appreciate that sellers was never available to treat them as his bed side manner sucked as well did his analysis of urine samples.

i remember seeing this film in my late teens or early twenties on tv - probably hbo. i watched it with my parents, a brother and a few friends. since that was about 30 years ago, i don't remember a lot of the story. i do remember that the entire group of us watching agreed that this was the funniest movie we had ever seen. when it was over, our bellies hurt from so much laughing. my dad worked at a hospital, so that made it all the better.every time i see the party in the tv listings, i look to see if this one is there, too. to my dismay, it never is. although i loved the party, i feel this one is funnier. peter sellers was great as a crooked hospital administrator. why it's never been released on video is a mystery to me. it's a classic, but it appears that nobody under 35 or 40 has been allowed to see it. i'd buy it in a second if they ever release it to dvd.

though often considered peter sellers' worst film, it is in fact an excellent send-up of medical corporate corruption and abuses of power. often misunderstood, the film is actually a departure from the type of film sellers was best known for; satirical farce. this film had excellent performances by jo ann pflug and pat morita (of happy days and the karate kid movies), but was marked by its ribaldary, irreverence, and total madcap demolition of the medical industry of the day. it was ahead of its time (1972) in taking the outrageous path that the monty python crew would take into the cinema some time later. as such, it was unacceptable to the traditional peter sellers fan, who found the more pointed barbs in this humor to be something to which they were unaccustomed. presently, peter sellers movies are in demand by fans, but this effort, where does it hurt?, has by its nature become almost impossible to find.

this is probably the best movie from director hector babenco. it shows a brazilian reality unknown by foreigners, which is the same reality that haunts all of the latin american countries, poverty and a survival instinct. the most affected in this reality is the children usually left orphans, or abandoned by their poor parents have to make it in a "dog eat dog" society many times falling into the gap of delinquency, prostitution and crime. very well acted and with a "no frills" approach, this movie will get to you, great story plot, a must have movie on anybody's collection. the starring role went to fernando ramos da silva, a young boy who fell into the crime wave, killed some years later during a robbery. i would suggest people to watch the movie "who killed pixote?" so you can have a more in depth idea of the lives of these characters. some other characters from the movie had a similar fate, some died and others are in jail. none the less this movie will last for a long time in your memory

i'm originally from brazil... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that boy. they told his life story and he never got one "centavo" (brazilian cent) of that movie. fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through that life style in brazil. sad... but that is the world we live in. it's about making money not saving lives. question is: where is fernando today? most probably... dead. we tend to want to live in this "disney filled fantasy bubbled life". when someone comes up to the plate to help... along comes the higher power and says: "what do i get from this? where's my cut?" - i wish people's conscience would speak up!

film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults. overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the means the children go to to try to achieve living. only living. staying alive in a cruel world. a nightmare world, we are afraid to watch it because we are seeing truth and are afraid to see it. to see a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we have not got when it is so trivial compared to someone else. they, the children of the movie, are desensitized. they are more than desensitized by what is around them. they see sex as an act, like they are watching a tv program. when the one boy is with the hooker, pixote is sitting on the bed watching with a blank stare, no feeling. he wants to be a little boy and have a family but the hooker has no compassion either and pushes him away. a "human" film, with "human" relations and moral judgement in a ugly, scared, cruel world. reminds us that life is not fair, but you can still have a human connection.

for me, this is another one of those films that i got to see off of the los angeles based "z" channel when it was in service. and it was another one of those movies that i saw when i was young...and learned that there was a world out there...one i did not want to accept.moving to los angeles and getting to watch international cinema became quite the guilty pleasure hobby of mine and to date, no premiere channel programming has matched the "z" channel in its showing of international films. the three international films that stuck in my young head were "spetters", "beau pere" and of course this one, "pixote".this was the most shocking and saddest movie i ever witnessed in my life. this was also one of the first movies that made me understand that there is a difference in cinema: to entertain, and to inform. let me be honest..growing up in a small town on the east coast, i had no idea anything like this -- to this extent -- existed. all i knew from south america was brochures of fabulous brazillian vacations and that columbia had a lot of drug trafficking.then comes a film like pixote. sad. disturbing. unflinching. scary. you're watching: children. those that need shelter, love, understanding and all these get are a way to survive day after day through drugs, sex, robbing, stealing, sleeping on the streets and in sadistic group homes etc. their survival is hard to watch with other street children, prostitutes, etc., and you begin to wonder how can things like this be allowed to happen in this world.pixote is not a film for entertainment, it is a film of information. it shows shocking and disturbing images - but it shows life for these daily street children.

this was really a "nightmare" of a film; i saw it about nine years ago on cable tv and haven't forgotten it since. pixote is a 10-year old boy who lives in the streets of sao paulo (brazil) and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends lilica, dito and chico; they steal, pimp, sell drugs and murder in order to survive each day...in the first half of the film pixote is caught by the police and sent to a sadistic foster home where he witnesses every kind of abuse from the older inmates and guards to the rest of the kids; one night, lilica's boyfriend is killed after a beating, so pixote and his friends decide to escape during a riot. the rest of the film shows pixote's descent into a criminal life; he doesn't show any feelings or remorse after killing someone, maybe because he knows that good feelings are of no use in the world in which he lives...but there is, however, a gentle scene in the middle of the film; pixote and his friends are at the beach, missing (and wishing) one of his friends from the reformatory was there. i thought it was a poetic and melancholy scene in the middle of all these horrible events...the boys are obviously longing not only for their friend, but for a better life. director hector babenco's "pixote" is a brave and depressing film that doesn't shy away from showing the harshest reality many people -including myself- tend to ignore or misunderstand. this film will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person.

i've been studying brazilian cinema since 2004, when i stumbled onto "cidade de deus / city of god". let me tell you something, this movie is probably as good or better than "city of god".the acting, cinematography and music supervision make this movie a unique experience. i have not been to brazil yet, but this movie presents the harsh reality that is beset before the citizens of s√£o paulo.i recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema. this movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit despondent after watching it.something you want to watch, but nothing you want to go to sleep on.

when it was released, in the beginning of the 80's, pixote brings to brazilian society the problems of young delinquents, and the impact of this in brazilian society. i can't watch the movie at that time, cause i was too young, but now i got a chance and watched it a few days ago. it's a very brutal movie, but everything is absolutely true, and sad. pixote is the name of a 12 year-old boy who lives in the streets, and survive with misdemeanors; he stays for a while in a house of detention, and when he left it he continues to plan robs with other buns and a prostitute, played by marilia pera. the boy is still a marijuana addicted and smell glue with another teenagers, to forget his sad reality. the quality of the images it's not the best, but the movie is totally realistic about brazilian problems, and must be viewed and admired.

"pixote" is the one of most powerful, shocking, and moving motion picture to come from brazil. it's about the lives of street kids on the streets of sao paulo and rio de janeiro, and it centers around a ten-year-old boy. the camera follows them around in an almost documentary style;from the juvenile detention center (where most of the staff is as corrupt as the police) and back to the streets, and it never turns away from the horrors of the city. prostitution, drug use/dealing, corruption, and murder are all witnessed by these youths; yet it's something they're painfully used to. director hector babenco used real street kids as the actors, adding to the films brutal reality. although not for everyone, a film i highly recommend. an emotionally devastating movie.

the film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about brazilain street kids whose families live in poverty and must steal and kill to survive. in fact the main character (pixote) was played by an actual street kid only 11 years old. what follows was one of the most brutal, depressing and horrifying film i've even seen. i saw it about 17 years ago (on a double bill with "black orpheus") and have never forgotten it. i don't think i ever want to see it again--it was just too much. spoiler ahead!!!! the scene which will not leave me is when pixote meets a prostitute who has to abort her own fetus. you don't see her do it...but you get a quick glance at what she got out. it's almost 20 years later and just recalling that scene upsets me. spoiler end!!!!!the movie gets more brutal as it goes along and ends the only way it can. what's all the more harrowing is stories like this really did happen in brazil in 1981...and are still happening today.a harrowing brutal film...but it should be seen if you can handle it. i'm surprised this got an r rating--i've seen x rated film that are less graphic. a 10.

this is a difficult movie to watch, and would have been even more difficult had i known then that the actor playing the protagonist was in fact killed in his home by police at age 19. pixote (peewee) is a street kid in sao paulo who is caught in a roundup triggered by a murder in which he had no involvement. he is committed to a juvenile prison where he witnesses brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens try very hard to believe doesn't exist. when finally he escapes, he and three comrades survive by the only means they know, which is crime. what makes the film so heart-rending is that both pixote and the actor portraying him clearly do not wish to be the characters life circumstances have made them. pixote tries to trust and to love and to bond, but there simply is no room in his world for the gentle side of human nature. one is left at the end wanting desperately to do something for the pixotes of the world, but what? building more children's's prisons with higher walls surely is not the answer...

this is no walk in the park. i saw this when it came out, and haven't had the guts to watch it again. you will never see a more horrifyingly devastating or depressing movie. i felt like i'd been severely beaten. what kind of world are we living in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage? this is our world, what we have created, what we have allowed to happen. and i would hesitate to say that i-me-we are not responsible for this. babenco made this film to wake us up, to shake us to our very core, and he succeeded. how can we be cruel, or self-indulgent, or neglectful of our children, when we see the graphic results of such behavior? he is pointing a finger of accusation at us all for doing this to the lowliest and least powerful of our society. and if you aren't doing something each day to prevent it, then you are part of the problem. i am not a religious fanatic, but this movie made me think about the state of my soul.

"pixote: a lei do mais fraco" deals with what is perhaps the greatest of all brazilian themes: poverty. and along with poverty the other unnatural feelings and actions it brings; prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder.brazil is the country of paradoxes, and its social problems are present everywhere. the difference between the rich and the poor; the beautiful and the ugly; happiness and the most profound human decay."pixote" is one of the films that dare to touch and open these so painful wounds, and does it without the slightest glimmer of hope, in an honest portrayal of a country that, like pixote himself, is already lost.

the violent death of fernando ramos da silva only eight years after the completion of this film, only adds to the poignancy of dierector babenco's powerful message. the film is split into two halves - the first in a reformatory where a group of youngsters are abused and violated by the violent law enforcers and guardians. the second backdrop is the city where they are confined instead by their own actions and morality, which includes mugging, pimping and killing different characters who enter their lives.the differing gender and sexual roles in the film allow for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people. particularly interesting is teh character of lalica, a transvestite who is mother and lover to some of the children. her reaction to the arrival of sueli, a prostitute is both poignant and tragic. there is no happy ending to this story and i reccomend to watch it with caution as there are some very uncomfortable scenes to watch especially in teh opening twenty minutes. but whilst watching it, it is important to remember that this is not just a fictional tale. the actors are not trained professionals but instead boys selected from the streetsof sao paulo. they actually lived this life that is portrayed so vividly on screen and in da silva's case, died at the hands of the police who are depicted so brutally. a documentary? a piece of fiction. it borders on both but it certainly makes for heart wrenching material and is a film that actually leaves you breathless and thinking long after having watched it.10/10

in his descriptions of caa, platinum card lunches in hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in provincetown he never took, and free trips to nicaragua, financed by columbia pictures.it sounds narcissistic, but spalding gray (possibly because of his unusual personality) ropes the audience in, laughs at himself (perhaps because he did not take the hollywood thing oh-so-seriously) and gets us to care.this monologue is not just about "the killing fields", or "swimming to cambodia"; it is more a pastiche of events, as he sees them. some of the lines are classic, as when gray meets with the esteemed talent agents at caa. the conference table is ..."full of them, tanned, healthy, fresh from drinking blue-green algae from an oregon lake...there are no drugs now in hollywood".this was before the tragedy occurred. many of us will miss his off-balance humor. 9/10.

three of the things you can say about spalding gray are: he certainly marched to the beat of his own "drummer;" he was never at a loss for words; and he obviously felt that those watching and listening to him would be interested in every aspect of his life, experiences and thoughts - no matter how trivial at times.most of us are not quite as far "off the wall" as he was. most of us aren't as interested in sharing the most minute parts of ourselves with others - even one-on-one or in small groups, let alone on stage.but that doesn't make it any less-interesting to watch and listen to this erudite, unusual man. and after seeing one of his performances, on reflection, we can find many of his articulate musings were perhaps more relevant to our own lives and thoughts than we may have first thought.granted, he was a "new york/avant-garde" type of personality, and undeniably a bit "strange." (there are those who would maintain describing someone as "new york" and strange" was being unnecessarily redundant.)i give him a "10" for the talent he presents in this genre which is his specialty.

gray can make the english language jump through hoops like none other. he recounts a number of events, tied together by his writing of a manuscript (the "monster" of the title), some sad, some uproariously funny, all in his characteristic, sarcastic manner. if you liked "swimming to cambodia" you will love this one. i actually thought this was a bit more interesting and better told than "swimming to cambodia". a real masterpiece.

this is marvelous movie, about a soul of ale. this is a journey to ale's heart. i found it fascinating. the director did a great job. he makes the scenes talk. especially on the silent scenes. the window of ale is a great one. an the scenes when he lies in bed are one of the best directed scenes i have seen. apart from directing. it has been a quite time i did not watch a movie about a soul. as a philosopher i can say that, this film proves that the age does not matter about your soul. so as ale's soul. as living in turkey i do not care about the other side of ny. this is a universal scene you can see everywhere in the world. as to my opinion more universal than every other thing. do not miss this film. otherwise you will miss a great thing about a soul. if you have one. baris.sentuna

i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels; from production to plot and character development.this definitely fall under the "realism" genre, since there is nothing going on here that makes use of creative imagination, twists, or manipulating audience in how a viewer shall feel, think and asses.the actors are great, especially the "little" ones. the chemistry between the brother and the sister is mind blowing, maybe not even as common as should be in real life. it is a movie excellent to literally watch while visualizing it. one knows when a movie is good when one just does not want it to end, but eventually everything does...

the majesty of ramin bahrani's second feature is that, like the work of a poet, he portrays the very soul of humanity and lets it flourish on the screen. beyond the scope of most other indie films out there, chop shop is wise, exuding the very best of the great cinema of the ages; we can look back at the works of bresson and pasolini and compare bahrani's work to theirs, and yet chop shop is fresh and urgent to modern society. we can see the workings of a master here ¬ñ a certain sense of beauty, style, and content all merge together in a film that reminds us what it means to be alive. instead of focusing on the side of nyc we so often see, we live and breathe with our young hero, alejandro, in the destitute willits point ¬ñ a fascinating quasi-sub-world of our culture ¬ñ and yet it's a very, very real place. trying to stay afloat, alejandro has to support himself and his older sister. watch this film and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that bahrani leads us toward ¬ñ all with profound and concise realism.

this is one of those movies when you are watching it you wonder whether it is documentary or fiction. after the movie, ramin bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the movie has a script.bahrani's camera is silent, he is not judgmental, he almost erases director from the movie by purpose, background is not organized to make the picture pretty, however don't get me wrong; there is a lot of preparation for this movie. starting on personal level, being the part of environment, being to be ignored when you film.main character is a 'real' actor in every sense.i would like to thank all crew for this movie, showing us another country within nyc. i strongly suggest it if you like stories of others.bora kizilirmak

some critics have compared chop shop with the theatrical releases of city of god and pixote. i've seen both of those as well as chop shop and like in many instances, i don't feel the comparison is warranted. city of god and pixote surely had a much higher budget. chop shop is a low budget independent film about survival and hope, disappointment, and continuing with life. one of the scenes is allegedly filmed during the us open and either the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time and the us open footage was added. i say that because i live in the area where this movie was filmed and security is insane while the tennis matches are in progress. it's also noteworthy that the actors actual names were their character's names in the movie. back to the movie. it's an enjoyable story about survival. however, it ended up getting a 7 because... at times the actors acted extremely well. at other times, they appeared to be just reciting their lines. if the actors were less competent (as they were in the low budget "the big dis" for example) i would have been more forgiving. but in several scenes each and every one of these actors gave exemplary performances. at other times, they appeared bored. the director might be at fault here. i also had problems with the ending. this is one of those movies that "just ends". maybe there will be a part 2? definitely worth getting on dvd. i wont bother summing up the story because that info is already available on imdb.

can't say this wasn't made well. at a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes. and there isn't the slightest indication he didn't get exactly what he wanted. but this is an oddly non-hispanic film in the same way west side story was many years ago. both the leads, a brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts. the setting, a sort of underground car repair district in queens, is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself. but there's something unsatisfying about the key issue in the film, namely, what the sister feels she has to do to get by. i can understand the brother's reaction, but it just seems a little too easily come by to me. the movie seems to suggest that people like these don't need our help, that they'll find a way to survive without the usual support systems. i wouldn't encourage anyone to believe that. there would be far more resistance to the choices made here than depicted. other than that as an entertainment it works well. as an accurate depiction of a culture, not so well, i think.

if ever a potential movie must've sounded like it wouldn't work based on reading the script on paper, it would be this one. here we have what seemingly looks like a lurid and seedy soft-porn s&m flick, complete with the huge in-theatre poster, depicting a near-naked christina ricci chained to none other than mr. bad ass mf himself, samuel jackson. but let me tell you, if ever a film springs to life on celluloid major big time with soulful power to spare, it's craig brewer's redemptive follow-up to hustle & flow, black snake moan.unashamedly over the top from the get go, this film sucks you in with the opening scenes and proceeds to dig deeper and deeper in with every subsequent frame. it's yer basic story of two deeply damaged characters who find in each other the strength and courage to move on, in more positive ways, with their lives. been done before, of course, this tale, but as i've always said, it's the manner in which a story is told that gives it heart, depth, meaning and power.ricci's damaged-by-childhood-abuse wild-child character rae and jackson's equally soulsick musician character lazarus find each other under desperate circumstances, and laz takes it upon himself to try to help rae. this in itself is relatively unique: the idea of a man trying to genuinely help a woman who is in serious pain, rather than trying to take further advantage of her, and we know from the onset that laz's heart, and the film's heart, is in the right place. the movie at its core is about the redemptive, healing power of love (with music as a very close second), and the film resonates profoundly with this truth - soulfully, artfully and brilliantly.a major reason the film succeeds so profoundly is because of the fierce, committed performances from ricci and jackson. scenes that would have come off as laughable and pathetic in lesser artists' hands are, instead, powerful as all get-out. in particular, the film's arc scene, in which jackson sings and plays the song of the title alone in his house, with ricci, amidst a serious thunderstorm and the abusive demons from rae's past running amok inside her head, leading her to crawl to lazarus and cling to his leg, comes off not ridiculous as technically it should, but rather as gut-wrenchingly cathartic. all the supporting performances are fantastic here too. justin timberlake is completely believable as rae's anxiety-ridden boyfriend ronnie, and the always-wonderful s. epatha merkerson is also perfectly cast as a character who obviously has feelings for lazarus. john cothran jr. is outstanding as well, as laz's reverend friend r.l. (a nod to blues musician r. l. burnside, no doubt). everything works about this movie, let's face it, including the music/soundtrack, which features burnside, scott bomar, bobby rush, son house, and most importantly, jackson himself, whose fantastic version of stackolee i am listening to as i compose this review. there's also a really beautiful and moving version of "this little light of mine" featured in the film, sung heart-breakingly tentative and soft by ricci.samuel jackson has said in recent interviews that he believes his performance in this movie is the best of his career thus far; i could not agree with him more. this is work that he can be monumentally proud of, along with everyone else involved in this audacious, supremely wise and deeply heartfelt mother*ucker of a project.

craig brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom i will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. his debut, hustle and flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. i wasn't quite sure what i would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. the cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. fortunately, black snake moan hits all its marks dead-on. the acting is astonishing, the writing superb, and the editing style, as well as juxtaposed music, riveting the whole way. brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption.the first moment i knew i was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning. like he did with hustle and flow, brewer lays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically. the 70's aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinema's best. from here we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both lazarus and rae, each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally cross. the editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose. rae's boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and laz's wife leaves him for his brother. each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that situation¬órae to sex and laz to the bottle. only when rae is left for dead at the side of the road and her savior comes from his farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clear.samuel l. jackson is fantastic as the older bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with god and that of the flesh and the pain it has brought him. there are the moments of stoic sternness as well as those of kindheartedness with his captive/patient. you never really look at the setup as comical or unrealistic because he sells what he is doing so well. also, the character of rae is not chained up for very long, despite what the trailers would have you believe. the situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only a day or two. as for that chained girl, christina ricci really shines. i never really saw her as anything special, but this role is a true breakthrough for her. this girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deep down. any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and itches to be touched by any man available to let the image go away. her nymphomania is not for pleasure, but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her eyelids. ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism. mention must also be made of justin timberlake, again showing some real acting talent. where this guy came from i have no clue, but hopefully he will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music he churns out.while not as solid and consistent as hustle and flow, moan still ranks equally to it, in my mind, because when it is on, it is spectacular. towards the end we have a truly enthralling sequence with "this little light of mine" singing out, and earlier, the interaction between captive and captor, when the chain is first introduced, shows some top-notch work. the truly magical moment, though, is when jackson sings (yes that is him throughout, like it was terrence howard in hustle) the titular song while a thunderstorm roars and the lights flicker. if i don't see a more beautifully shot sequence all year, i won't be surprised. what these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of. one thing i think i really enjoy with brewer's work is the fact that he doesn't show sinners becoming redeemed heroes. instead he shows us that no matter how bad you have been, or how bad life has been, everyone can strive for redemption and to be better people. we don't have saints here, but fallible people looking to right their ship. if the course stays true or if it falls back into darkness, no one really knows, but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could.

i knew as soon as i saw the first trailer for black snake moan that i would have to see it. i was not disappointed in the slightest in the film, which was written and directed by hustle and flow's creator craig brewer. it tells the story of a broken blues man and the nymphomaniac he aims to cure not just for her sake, but also his own...yet it's so much more than that. it's complex and rich and it manages to steep you in a gritty, sticky, sultry blue memphis without making you feel like you need a bath afterward.the characters are (for the most part) multifaceted and very well-written and performed. the accents and the dialogue were carried off flawlessly. however, there was one weak link in the chain: justin timberlake. the best i can say for him is that he can pull off crying...it's a rare male actor who can cry convincingly. however, justin's ronnie was flat, but as an actor he was trying very hard. i would definitely give him another chance.lazarus and rae (samuel l. jackson and christina ricci respectively) have a great chemistry and a great respect for each other. this is one of those films where it doesn't matter how good one actor is if the other one isn't up to the task and, luckily, both of the actors were up to the task.the music was very bit as good as you would expect, especially when mr. samuel l. jackson sings the blues. phenomenal.on the technical side, all was brilliance as far as i could see. it was well-edited, well shot, and well-mixed...everything was great. the character and set designs were just right, the casting of the supporting characters (even justin timberlake and especially kim richards) was spot on... loved it.

if you've been looking for a film where a out of control nympho gets chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man then look no further than paramount vantage's latest release 'black snake moan'. not exactly looking for what i just described you say? well then, you best get ya wits 'bout yaself and mosey on down to your local theater and still see it as samuel l. jackson's character lazarus would say. as long as you're open minded and don't take everything seriously, there's no reason you won't leave the theater glad you saw it.in the third offering from director craig brewer, we are taken into the deep south where as the tagline to the film claims, everything is hotter. while there we're introduced to the godfearing bluesman, lazarus as previously said played by jackson, and the almost always half naked rae; a role bravely taken on by christina ricci. in the film this unlikely pair cross paths long enough for their characters to each learn a lesson from one another. both lessons ultimately convey the message to us the audience that no matter what, we are all human. no one is perfect and if everyone would realize that, then we'd be a lot better off. the question of if this will be understood, or be accepted by all who see the film is another story.one thing not up for debate is how great jackson and ricci both are here. you'd think with the role of a sex-crazed woman, overacting would be a given, but no, not here. ricci breaks through and demonstrates true talent with a raw performance that also doubles as her best to date. then we have jackson who completely disappears and for the first time in a long time makes us forget who he even is. sadly, the third star of the film, justin timberlake who plays rae's military-bound boyfriend isn't all that great. at the start, he fails miserably as he appears to be trying too hard. later on he steps it up some, still he's far from the level he reached in january's 'alpha dog'.the other thing 'black snake moan' boasts is a splendid soundtrack. containing tracks from the black keys, john doe, pieces from the score done by scott bomar, & of course four, count 'em, four tracks from jackson himself. it's actually one of his songs, the main performance of the film, 'stackolee' that is the fuel to the fire of this great collection. it alone is worth the ticket price. other notable musical delights from the soundtrack are bomar's 'the chain', 'when the lights go out' from the black keys, & the title track which is also among the most memorable scenes in the film where lazarus sings to rae on a stormy night.the efforts of craig brewer can't go without mention though. his last film 'hustle & flow' which ended up surpassing low expectations and gaining critical acclaim put him on the map. what he has done with 'black snake moan' will be what sets him apart from other newbies to the industry. he not only directed 'moan', but also wrote its screenplay. the end result is a story that is surprising and clever. as you watch you feel like you know exactly where it's headed despite its valiant composure. just as you think you've predicted the next move brewer shifts gears and takes an entirely different route. there are however some blotches within the screenplay. the background characters are drab and flat while the ending is somewhat disappointing. it left me craving for something more exciting. after so many highs i guess the final scenes were a tad weak compared to the rest of the film.i imagine the majority of people who see 'black snake moan' won't enjoy it due to the fact they won't be able to stop themselves from thinking how unlikely the situations are. the depressing part about that is there are many other films with just as unlikely, even more outrageous scenarios that are widely well received. it's the issues of race, religious motives, & sexuality the film exhibits that will have more effect on opinion than anything. the idea of a black man chaining a white woman up in his house is enough to make most people not even consider seeing it. simply put, it's not for everyone. like i said, to fully enjoy it you have to go in with an open mind, or else you're just wasting your money. for those of you who can do that, i highly recommend it.

i'm surprised that mine, so far, is the only comment on this t.v. movie...as far as i'm aware, the series itself, has had a huge following, reviewer pundits and real people alike, have praised it to a person. anyway, let me tell you right away that, if like me, you're a sucker for gritty police dramas, you'll like "the lost child" tennison, the heroine, throughout the "prime suspect"series, has been battling the male police establishment, throughout the series, getting to her present, comparatively powerful rank in the police hierarchy through hard work,obstinacy, and sheer talent for police work. she is,essentially, an ambitious career woman, but she has a romantic side and is certainly no man-hater. unfortunately her relationships are affected by the wicked hours, which her career demands, and she has never married, so when she finds herself pregnant from her latest affair, she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother, and jeopardising her entire police job, let alone future advancement, or having an abortion - which she opts for. this abortion never looms large in the ensuing drama - it's very skilfully dealt with, in less than a couple of minutes screentime, a marvel of economy in scripting, and editing - but it's always there, as a counterpoint to tennison's desperate efforts to find another "lost child" - a kidnap victim - before it's too late. the story takes many twists and turns,before the surprise ending, and one is fascinated, alike, by the plot, and characters (although i found the many villains a little overdrawn), the police, and especially tennison, herself, are not always competent, nor that likeable, which figures, given the unpleasant job that they have to do, in the sleazy underworld which this series, habitually inhabits.mirren, herself, has said that she'll make no more movies in the series, but, excellent as she's always been in the role of tennison, the series, itself, is as "actor proof" as is another addiction of mine -dick wolf's american"law & order" - whoever appears therein, each could go on forever. as is my fervent hope.

"prime suspect 4" continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice, detective superintendent jane tennison; the first of three miniseries (ps4, ps5, & ps6) with the notable absence of founding writer lynda la plante from the credits. imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series, the second three series pit tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age, loneliness, indiscretions, a host of personal and professional problems, and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal. ps4 conjures two stories while ps5 & ps6 are single episodes each which find tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good. in other words, to prevail, tennison must overcome both evil and good forces, something which makes the always gray scenarios of the ps series yet grayer and the tennison wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers. very good stuff which only gets better from series to series. (b+)

this is one of the funniest shows on tv today. it hits the mark 99% of the time. usually after watching a sitcom after a few years, the actors become to cartoonish, as if they are trying to become the beloved characters they play. these actors have in my opinion stayed true to their roles. the chemistry is still there, the writing has not gone down and i still look forward to watching it. the family dynamic still seems real and the situations after all this time are not so far fetched to make it seem the writers are reaching into an empty bag trying to keep the show on for one more season it is one of the few shows i watch without the remote in my hand for quick switching.

king of queens is comic genius. kevin james, whom plays ips deliveryman doug heffernan is extremely funny, leah remini who plays doug's wife carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. the true magic of the show however is the scenes with jerry stiller, they are the funniest in the show. jerry, a comic genius, plays carrie's father, arthur spooner, whom lives in doug and carrie's always cold basement. i must admit that i never watched this show until this year, 2006. whenever i had flipped by it previously it never seemed funny, but with the cancellation of friends, still standing, and yes dear, i needed some new comedy. actually giving the king of queens a chance i discovered that it was absolutely fantastic. so funny in fact that i downloaded the first 7 seasons and watched each season in 8 hour blocks. i strongly urge anyone whom has not seen this treasure to check it out. you will not be disappointed.

"the king of queens" could be divided into two eras.the first era, constituted of the first few seasons portrayed the issues of everyday life of a man and his wife making it through life in the city paycheck by paycheck.the second era, increased the scope of the show, addressing current popular culture and marital issues with a humorous spin.but besides all of that...this show was freaking hilarious.kevin james, when not doing crap comedy films with adam sandler, is a genius of laughter, and his chemistry with leah remini was unparalleled on tv.jerry stiller as the psychotic live-in father in law added his own unique style of quirky humor, and patton oswalt as the "man-child" spence ulchin was amazing, (he's a great comedian too) "the king of queens" was the final sitcom of the 1990s to go off the air, and it's a damn shame. now, all we have to watch are the idiotic sitcoms full of untalented actors and actresses whose only appeal is their physical appearance. i like many fans of actually funny tv shows am now in a state of mourning

in a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, king of queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! it is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. nothing has been this good since married with children. kevin james and jerry stiller are comic geniuses! and believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. these guys truly understand what is funny. i could watch ten episodes of seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing koq just once. other funny people in this show are carrie, janet heffernan, spence and doug pruzan (carrie's boss). i'm so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem. the show has been a hilarious winner in a time of mostly comic losers. check it out if you haven't!!

i have not seen a better comedy than the king of queens for many years. i rate it one of the best ever. i've just returned to ireland from arizona on american airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. i laughed my head off and later i asked the stewards to play again and they did. thank you aa. the acting from all the team is first rate and especially from kevin james, leah remini and gerry stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. i love all the cast, they are so funny. there is a hard edge in the king of queens that i love and is seldom seen in today's tv comedy. both leah and kevin play off each other so well that every situation is believable and hilariously funny. i have just purchased the 2nd season while i was in az this week and i intend buying the full set the next time i am in the us. my son who is 20yrs old also loves this show and its brilliance is that it has the magic to reach out to different generations. i would like to thank all those involved with this amazing show - it's so appreciated to see this kind of tv show in what is in my opinion an era of poor tv fair in general these days with the exception of re-runs of seinfeld and such like... thanks for a great show..

here in germany "king of queens" has a big big cult status! nearly every teenager (and adults) watch this sitcom. it's really awesome!! better than the other horrible american sitcoms like "full house" or "set by step" (the only series, who is still ok, is "al bundy"). there haven't been an amercian sitcom in europe who was as effective as this really funny show!! kevin james and leah remini as doug & carrie haffernan are the craziest couple i know, jerry stiller as arthur is the funniest "grandpa" i know, and victor williams and (especially) patton oswalt as deacon & spence are the most different, but funny guys i know. i watch it as often as i could, and i still haven't enough, good humor!

when this show first came on the air, i saw it once or twice and thought it was another "fat guy, skinny wife" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. it was just "okay" upon initial viewings and i didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, i caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and i'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud. every new episode i watch is more creative than the one before--people who only watch this a couple of times will not notice this. the writing and story lines are much more sophisticated than they appear at first (this is far from "according to jim"). first of all, kevin james is hysterical, incredibly charming, and a talented comedic actor, as is the supporting cast. leah remini has excellent timing, and patton oswalt's spence is one of the funnier characters on the show. and of course, jerry stiller is brilliant as arthur. i was shocked to read comments that he was the worst part of the show--he's a gigantic part of why this show is so great--his delivery of these ridiculous schemes (rounding out the crazy dad character) are beyond hilarious. and the yelling--the best episode is when they show him as a kid yelling "lemon icee!!". that episode, during which carrie takes him to a therapist in hopes to get him medicated (to make doug less stressed out), guest star william hurt decides that arthur yells because he's never been validated. the latter part of the episode where doug beats up his childhood self in a therapy session is beyond funny, it's one of the most creative scenes i've seen on a sitcom. i feel the strange need to defend this show, because it is severely underrated--while "friends" was sometimes amusing, and "raymond" has some great episodes and characters, they both lacked the creative touch that "king of queens" has. in an era where most sitcoms have canned jokes and are on the whole mediocre, "king of queens" continues to push the sitcom envelope and show real comic genius. critics of this show obviously don't get it--or haven't watched the show enough to give it a chance, because anyone with real comic and creative sensibility has to laugh out loud while watching. it's certainly on par with my other two favorites, "seinfeld" and "the office" in its ridiculous tone. it's the arthurs, kramers, and michael scotts of tv that keep us watching, and laughing out loud.

albert finney and tom courtenay are brilliant as sir and his dresser. of course the play is brilliant to begin with and nothing can compare with the immediacy and collegiality of theatre, and i think you listen better in theatre; but on the screen we become more intimate, we're 'up-close' more than we are in the theatre, we witness subtle changes in expression, we "see" better as well as listen. both the play and the movie are wondrous: moving, intelligent, illuminating--of the backstage story of the company, of historical context, of the two main characters, and of the parallel characters in "lear" itself. if you cannot get to see it in a theatre (i don't imagine it's produced much these days) then, please, do yourself a favor, and get the video.

as the superb `prime suspect' series reaches part four there is no loss of momentum at all, this in itself a considerable achievement.' prime suspect iv: the lost child' has the solid supporting cast that we take for granted in these british dramas but of course the beautiful helen mirren easily dominates; our eyes never leave her while she's on-screen.the search for the lost child of the title leads superintendent jane tennison's cid team to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile now living with a single mother and her two young daughters. the insight we are given into the workings of his mind is one of the emotional highlights of this mini-series but it may be too strong for many stomachs.the action sequences are brilliantly handled with the hand-held camera thrusting us right into the middle of the excitement and there's gripping tension during the climactic siege.altogether this is another magnificent police procedural drama.

i have been watching king of queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. this show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because i work at a company a lot like ips, (dhl) and we just love the teamster plugs!! carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. arthur well what can you say? he just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things. doug, well he is just so lovable, and funny, the three characters, plus all the friends just make the show complete. this is the best comedy on tv!! i would say up there with seinfeld, and hey, there's nothing wrong with that .... excellente!! as doug would say.

a must for any die hard carpenters fans!cynthia gibb does the role of kc a huuuuuge amount of justice, and although the 'story' isn't 100% factual, is still a good insight into the lives of both richard and karen and worth a watch just for the soundtrack.makes me cry everytime!!!

every time i hear karen carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. what an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. cynthia gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, i thought karen allen would have been a better choice. this is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of karen and richard but also the personal struggles that karen dealt with and her disease. the recording sessions in herp albert's studio are very nicely done. however karen carpenter turned out, there was a time when she was very special and brought a great deal joy to her fans and music lovers. even if you weren't a carpenter's fan this is a nice story that depicts how a great talent can fall victim to the pressures of society.

yes, this is one of the better done television movies and i wouldn't expect less from joe sargent. one thing for this reviewer is that i was also a great fan of the carpenters, i got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and i got to do much of the solo material of which karen sang lead. i thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing i was looking forward to was meeting this woman. i never got to, she died three weeks before that was to happen. and yes, that did effect me for i knew nothing of anorexia - and could not understand completely what happened.when this tv movie got produced, i got quite an understanding. maybe not everything in karen and richard's life is open to the television audience, but in opening the parts that were shown, i got to understand much from the music industry of that time. what upsets me is that i am writing "of that time" and seeing "now". no one has learned a darned thing, even though this was a very informative and heartfelt look into a family's problems in the music industry.these films aren't done for fun, they're done to open a door and show us something. here was a wonderful woman who got caught up in the whole idea that her talent was based on weight. she was fine. didn't know it. she got mixed messages about her weight from the brother she loved, the parents she loved and the music industry that cared more about her looks/weight than the talent within. with the onset of mtv, it got worse. with 'american idol' it's like a puss festering in an english accent.a wonderful tv film, i am sure later someone may give it an hbo treatment but either way, many lessons to be learned and the absence of another wonderful talent.

on watching this film, i was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. karen carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. as with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. this had a huge effect on karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. this heart felt film was not initially something which i would have thought of watching. but on starting to view it, then i was hooked. in the same way that the tina turner story does, then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life. the acting was superb and even after nearly 20 years after it was made, then the directional and the dialogue are still entertaining.i would recommend this to anyone who hasn't yet watched it. it is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged.

this film was made soon enough after karen's passing that perhaps richard carpenter and the people closest to karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. as the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. richard has spent the years after karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. he married his cousin, mary, and from what i have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation carpenters with his children. he seems to have regretted making this film,and that may very well be why it is unavailable in any form. it seemed to me to be a fairly honest assessment of the tragically short life and incredible talent that was karen carpenter.

being an avid carpenter fan, i really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off i went to discover more. i must recommend a book by ray coleman - carpenters - the untold story. the book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. i hope you enjoy it. i remember cynthia gibb from her days in fame and gypsy. she is a singer (aswell as dancer) in her own right and i think this was the edge needed to create the character. some other actresses may have struggled with this. it is ashame the film did not delve deeper into her story. after all this is the film title, but i felt we learnt more about richard, but i suppose like any performer worth their salt, you should always leave them wanting more!

the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenter's complex life. though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.cynthia gibb (portrays karen) was not a fine election. she is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb karen carpenter. i think that the role needed a stronger character. someone with a stronger personality.louise fletcher role as agnes carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as karen's mother.it has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album. unfortunately they weren't, though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries

the third entry in the "stepford" franchise, but apparently the three made-for-tv obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down, whereas the 70's original as well as the blockbuster remake with nicole kidman are commonly known and very popular. i haven't seen either the early 80's "revenge of the stepford wives" or the mid 90's "the stepford husbands", but this "the stepford children" is a quite charming and highly entertaining little film. it's basically the exact same film as the original; obviously less mysterious yet much cheesier and incredibly 80's to the nth degree. the main difference here, like the title implies, is that not just the liberated wives but also the rebellious and punk teenage offspring in town undergoes the typical and highly effective "stepford treatment", licensed by the local men's association. for some reason the scenario attempts to uphold the stepford mystery until late in the film, even though nobody is likely to watch this sequel before having checked out the original and presumably everybody also knows about the denouement. the harding family is all packed and ready to move from the grisly city of new york to the small and peaceful community of stepford. particularly father steven is excited about their new life because he already lived in stepford and always wanted to go back ever since his first wife, whom his new wife laura and adolescent children mary and david know very little about, died under mysterious circumstances. the town is almost too perfect, with picturesque neighbors and model students, and especially the modern teenagers face huge difficulties to adjust. their efforts to modernize the place and take the local youth of stanford in tow cause confrontations with the eminent townsfolk, particularly the members of the men's association, and put the familial relationships under a lot of stress. david meets and falls in love with the last "normal" girl in school lois, but when even she transforms into a domestic dummy overnight, david can convince his skeptical mother to investigate the sinister stanford secret. the first hour of "the stanford children" is slow-paced and rather tame, but the finale is trashy and cheesy like the vhs cover promises and like a late 80's thriller ought to be, in fact. the modus operandi behind the stanford secrets is illustrated in greater detail, and i think horror fans and lovers of the original film will appreciate that. at least, i did. the overall plot still doesn't make a lot of sense and the script is chock-full of irrational aspects, but it's nonetheless an engaging formula and undoubtedly one that evokes an atmosphere of suspense and fear. the acting performances are far above average. especially the arrogant and obnoxious members of the men's association depict plausible characters and even teenage players tammy lauren and randall batinkoff give away impressive performances. recommended without hesitation!

the stepford children, besides being a very good made for tv movie, shows the very disturbing result of indoctrination. it is quite a statement about how being made to act within the confines of what is considered "good" behavior can destroy whatever it is that makes a person unique and an individual. i think that this is a movie that parents who want to maintain some semblance of the thought that loams within the hearts and minds of youngsters should watch with their children and discuss what the movie is saying. i don't know if that was in any way the intent of this movie but i have always been of the opinion that it is one of the best movie devices against the wish to have children conform to an unrealistic and domineering pretense of what is in the best interest of anyone other than that of the children themselves. i hope to one day see this movie on dvd. i am at the starting gate... waiting.

you may have serious doubts about watching the third sequel to the stepford wifes, but this is an absolute classic. much scarier in premise than the first, and very entertaining. it only got a video release here in the uk, but should be released worldwide for everyone to enjoy.

the stepford children is the second best stepford movie in the stepford series.i saw the original the stepford wives in the theater when it came out in 1975.i was absolutely blown away,it was terrific.i have seen all of the stepford movies, and i like all of them.i think that the stepford children is such a campy and fun movie.i just watched it again recently on tape, and i enjoyed it immensely.the cast in this movie was real good to watch. barbara eden did a bang up job as usual.every role that she has ever played has been very good.barbara eden is very good at playing roles where she is a kind and nurturing type of person.don murray as the husband and father was just perfect in this movie.he was particularly effective at being the irritated father to his two teenage children.i made sure that i have all of the stepford movie on tape to enjoy.if you get a chance to see this movie you should.

i like many others saw this as a child and i loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood, i have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on tv someday, since it originally played on usa networks. does anyone know where to buy this movie, or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me? also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on tv again? maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again. i don't think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows about, people only know of the stepford wives and stepford husband movies. no one is familiar with the fact that there was a children version. maybe they should also do a re-make of it since they seem to be doing that a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thriller/horror flicks. well if anyone has any input please i beg of you write me with information. thanks taira tcampo23@aol.com

a fantastic cinema experience. i really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out. there is nothing to add, except that is a terrible shame that sir albert finney still isn't accepted by the ampas (american academy). after roles in such films as tom jones, murder on the orient express, under the volcano (to name only few - for these he was nominated for the oscar), the dresser is arguably his highlight, yet...i know, oscars are just popularity contest, but if americans like british actors and actresses ("and the oscar goes to" jeremy irons, daniel day-lewis, anthony hopkins, emma thompson, glenda jackson etc. - and they all deserved the award!), why they always left sir finney with empty hands?on the other hand, they gave it to john wayne and marisa tomei (in cousin vinny). i don't know, should i laugh or cry.if you have seen the two leads in the dresser, you won't forget what is the art of acting. watch this film and enjoy! i recommend it to everyone who loves art.i give 9/10 for this excellent film (1 point missing for non-cinematic material, after all it is "just" a theater)note: my criteria is much stronger than this on imdb (10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that should/could last forever).

this film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. this small band must hold on to a fort located close to the indian village until reinforcements arrive. the indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes. one major difference for this film, "only the valiant", is that it attempts to play out the usual storyline, but at the same time, deliver the message that duty is a paramount concern to be shared by all, even if they don't accept that charge.gregory peck embodies the tight-lipped captain of the troop that has to prevent the indians from breaking out into the territory. the troopers that he takes with him to the small outpost are the dregs of the troop at the fort; they, in turn, have gripes or weaknesses that cause them to wonder if the captain hasn't taken them out because of their general lack of devotion to a cause. eventually, the captain and the small band confront the hostiles, and at the same time, each confronts his own flaw. the cast includes western stalwarts such as ward bond, gig young, neville brand, lon chaney, jr., and warner anderson. a sleeper of a film, and a good solid western for fans of this genre.

"nurse betty" is the kind of movie you can't describe on a poster or in a trailer or commericial. it's the kind of movie that you walk in to expecting a more mature "dumb and dumber" what with temporarily insane waitress goes on a cross country adventure while avoiding crooks trying to kill her.the fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams. the best part about "nurse betty" is it's unpredictability. director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.

what more can you ask for? a great screenplay based on one of the finest plays of the latter half of the 20th century, two fine emotional performances by courtney and finney, a realistic vision of war time london, a great supporting cast. this film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster through humour, sadness, loss and fulfillment. if you are in the theatre it is even more effective. this is a true 10 on the rating scale !

'the dresser' is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them. written by ronald harwood (himself a former dresser to the legendary donald wolfit), it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlights.as 'sir', the overbearing actor and main focus of the play, albert finney is a joy to watch - whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the 'blow, winds ...' bit of 'king lear' or chatting to his faithful stage manager, madge (eileen atkins, good as ever) about the old times. as norman, his camp dresser, tom courtenay gives a fabulous performance, wiggling around at the beck and call of 'lear', collecting a bottle to go at the pub, or bitchily disparaging the former fool, mr davenport-scott (often mentioned, but never seen!).in an engaging support cast, there's edward fox as oxenby (a typical arrogant second lead), zena walker as her ladyship, lockwood west as the replacement fool, and many others.this film has great energy, bringing with it some of the greasepaint of its stage origins, it is true, but being so well-acted you don't notice. very well done indeed.

the cell is weak on plot, filled with holes and has pretty lousy acting as well. but none of this matters, for, director tarsem singh has given us one of the most visually stunning movies ever. the whole plot is just an excuse to let tarsem fool around and take you into the minds of a serial killer, bringing the audience some shocking, pleasing, breath-taking and mind blowing images.the images from this beautiful movie will stick with you for a long time to come. this movie is a perfect case for the "suspension of disbelief" theory. forget the silly plot, just let your senses be overwhelmed with the images. and j.lo looks stunning enough to add to the rest of tarsem's work. the cinematography is harrowing, the music haunting & the costumes just stunning. the movie is less of a movie and more of a work of art. its just that the medium is not canvas anymore, it is the big-screen and celluloid. one of the most refreshing movies of this decade. the cell is a must watch. a bold new step in movie making.an enthralling 8!!

a crackling and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist, catherine deane (jennifer lopez) who is desperately urged by two fbi agents, peter novak (vince vaughn) and gordon ramsey (jake weber) to use her therapy on carl stargher (vincent d'ofornio), a serial killer who (uses strange and horrifying torture tactics) is found in a coma by the feds. what novak wants in return from deane is whereabouts of stargher's latest victim is and if she's alive. once deane gets into stargher's mind, which has the appearence and atmosphere that resembles a colorful combination of david lynch's "dune" or "blue velvet" and wes craven's "a nightmare on elm street", the adventure begins. deane sees a variety of odd people ranging from carl as a youngster (an adorable jake thomas) to a freddy krueger-like man minus the razor claws. i don't want to give away the ending, but the movie is great altogether besides the dynamite performances, howard shore's creepy musical score and directing (by tarsem, who shows here that he can direct).

after you have seen enough movies, there is very little that doesn't remind you of other movies. nevertheless this was a watchable if somewhat disturbing film. i had to shut it off from time to time and come back to it later. like "silence of the lambs" it features the search for a serial killer who has abducted someone and has confined her to his chamber of horrors, like "flatliners" the main character explores a dream world through an experimental procedure. the surrealism of the dream sequences is what makes this film, as one finds the characters in a situation and landscape in which literally anything can happen. and beyond this continuity and "making sense" are not necessary, which makes it a film-maker's dream too.the only thing that seems a bit off is the fact that in the end one hopes for the redemption of the serial killer or the exorcism of his demons. you actually feel sympathy for the little boy inside the man, but clearly the innocence of the boy cannot be separated from horrible deeds of the man. the focus swings as it must from saving the man to saving his victim.

a serial killer , carl stargher , has been kidnapping and murdering young women by letting them drown in a water filled cell . he is apprehended by the fbi , but is in a coma and his latest kidnap victim awaits in a cell timed to fill with water take a look at the above premise and you'll see that there's a very much seen it all before look to it . the magic of mark protosevich's script is that he changes a hoary old chestnut plot in to something quite different from what you're expecting . if i mentioned the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter the mind of stargher then sets up a different film entirely this wouldn;'t be enough to make the cell a different class of thriller but director tarsem singh creates a visually striking surreal thriller . the cinematography by paul laufer where opaque primary colours are to the fore is stunning but singh doesn't let it end there , things like costume design where stargher wanders around his idiosyncratic universe wearing opulent costumes does have a visual impact making this so much more than a run of a mill thriller what stops the cell becoming a classic movie however is that you start becoming more and more aware that the whole movie revolves around the visuals rather than having a natural narrative . we see a third character , a fbi man enter stargher's domain but this seems more like a contrived plot turn just to introduce the audience to more stunning but very disturbing momentsit should also be pointed out that this is a rather disturbing thriller with a atmosphere that is very depressing and that stops the film from being if not enjoyable , then involving . one scene where a fbi agent recounts a case where a paedophile beats a rap only to later cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair you might reach for the off button . you'll probably have to watch a massive amount of thrillers till you see another one as disconcerting as this one

i remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. i never got the chance to see it though. when i went to blockbuster to rent some videos, i figured i should watch it. after all i did love "silence of the lambs" and "se7en", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of "the cell". the whole story concept is very interesting. going physically into the mind of a killer, i can't imagine the world they live in. the acting is actually pretty decent. jennifer lopez is the only one i have to say that wasn't that great, but she does a believable job. i would recommend for a scary thriller.7/10

"the cell" is a rather difficult film to classify. if you read the plot outline, "a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. but that doesn't really do this movie justice. there is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. there is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing. and there is most definitely a horror facet due to the sickening actions of the serial killer's evil persona. the movie attempts to function on many different levels and crosses genre boundaries at will. while i feel it ends up being a reasonably bizarre experience, i find it to be completely fascinating.right from the opening credits, with lopez riding a horse through the desert stunningly clothed in a white dress, you will know that you are in for a visual treat. every time the audience leaves reality and follows her into the sub conscious depths of her "patients", they are guaranteed a feast of visual and aural delight. the costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colour. the camera leaves regularities at the door and traverses a world where up and down are the same. the characters become rulers of their own domains and transform into creatures worthy of such stature. if you don't enjoy anything else about "the cell", you will surely be impressed with the work put into these scenes.the casting is top notch also. jennifer lopez is in her element here, utilizing her natural, compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities, while combining her own striking looks with the lush surroundings, makeup and costumes. she is incredibly sexy and i personally wish someone would find another role for her outside of the rom-com world she has been typecast into that would allow her to experiment further. vince vaughn is fairly convincing as an fbi agent that will do anything to save the life of a young woman. but it is without a doubt vincent d'onofrio that has the biggest impression here. it's an extremely difficult role as he is required to bring out multiple emotions within the viewer. we are disgusted at his actions, yet sympathetic towards him due to the trauma he has experienced during his life. he looks magnificently powerful within his realm, yet insecure and vulnerable within the real world. it's a great performance from an underrated actor.while "the cell" doesn't work as well on every level it ambitiously attempts (some of the actions of the characters are not believable) and while it is all based on some fairly flimsy scientific logic, it is an occasionally shocking, visually astounding head trip that rewards multiple viewings.

"the cell" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. this is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. this is the best movie of the year to date.i've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. this movie may be a landmark, a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. "the cell" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director tarsem singh that we don't want any more? personally, i would more than welcome another movie by tarsem, and would love to see someone try to challenge him.we've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer, and yes, i do agree that the "genre" is a bit overworked. the 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. but "the cell" does not blaze down the same trail, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.i like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another. instead, she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. "the cell" wants to let you "see" what it's all about and not "how" it's all about, and i guess that's what some people don't like. true, i do like explanations with my movies, but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.i noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality, maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. nonetheless, the set design was simply astonishing. i wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like. if it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture.i've noticed that i've kind of been repeating myself. not because there's nothing else to say, but because i can't stress enough how fantastic i thought "the cell" was. if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time. i guess this film was just a little too much for some people, writing it off as "weird" or "crazy". i am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was right down my alley. leaving the theater, i heard one audience member say "whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs." if so, i want what he was smoking.**** (out of 4)

what makes watching and reviewing films a pleasure is when every once in a while when you least expect it a film like the cell comes along and knocks your socks off!. this movie is a superb horror that has everything a you could want when you want to be scared out of your witts. without going into the story all i will say is that it has a great beginning ,middle and end that keeps you on the edge of your seat while being transfixed with the amazing special affects. the acting is good without being outstanding but that does not matter because the subject matter and the way it is put on the big screen makes this one of the best horror movies i have seen for a long while. it is one of those films that you imagine started as a novel but saying the credits it does not look like an adaptation , so a lot of credit must go to mark protosovich the writer. 9 out of 10.

style over substance. but what a style it is. "the cell" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.psychotherapist catherine deane (j-lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. a new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the fbi. he's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim. director tarsem singh has incredible visions and set pieces for this production. each dream sequence is like a nightmare-ish painting in motion, from the landscapes to the costumes. but the plot suffers from lack of history of its characters. stargher is the only person with a thorough background and he's the last person you want to care about. without him, you basically have a movie that moves in the present tense only, which is a shame since the movie is so visually stunning and genuinely scary. lopez is wasted but she's not that amazing an actress anyway, though she's as gorgeous as ever. and vince vaughn? i don't even know why he was chosen. this is not his forte and he overacts to boot. he tried too hard to become his character and it showed. stick to comedy, vince! even so, this movie is so visually frightening, i still watch this movie with the lights on and can never fall asleep right away afterward.

this movie is definitely a case of style over substance but the style is good and certainly more than unique on its own to make "the cell" a memorable and above average movie."the cell" is beautifully looking with impressive sets, costumes and make-up. yes, it's real eye candy to watch all. the movie has some perfectly 'dreamy' sequences that are certainly odd but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at. this movie is a perfect mix of an art-house type of movie and a typical hollywood-thriller, that is accessible to both fans of the genre.the story itself is pretty far fetched and doesn't always make sense. because of that the movie isn't always pleasant and likable to watch but like i mentioned before, the style compensates for this. the style makes you keep watching till the end and provides the best moments of the movie.vincent d'onofrio is unforgettable as the serial-killer with a twisted mind. vincent d'onofrio is really underused as an actor and this movie shows his talent once more. i'm not particularly happy about the casting of jennifer lopez. i know that she can act in some of her movies but she really wasn't suitable to play the main character in this movie. her character wasn't strong enough and she was overshadowed by vincent d'onofrio and vince vaughn. still i felt that vince vaughn was also miscast in this movie. he didn't fit the role well enough and no, i'm not saying that because i'm used of seeing him only in comedies now days. the rest of the supporting cast is good and still give the movie a certain degree of credibility.the musical score by howard shore was also surprising good and was sort of "se7en" like at times. it suited the movie well and gave some of the scene's some extra mood and atmosphere.it's a far from perfect movie and the concept is far fetched and not always handled in the right way. still "the cell" is a perfectly watchable movie and perhaps even a bit of a must see, due to its style, originality and creativity.7/10

the last film that provided a vivid and disturbing look at what insanity is probably like was in dreams. in that movie, you didn't see insanity, you were there. now the cell comes along with an updated and much more disturbing portrayal of the inside of the mind of a psychotic killer. the opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a comatose little boy, and the things that catherine deane (jennifer lopez) sees are first fascinating and then terrifying. the things that she later sees in the mind of vincent stargher (vincent d'onofrio) are amazingly imaginative and fascinating, most of this stuff has never been seen in film before.the story of the cell is not exactly something that is really groundbreaking. in fact, it is basically the same as the story in the silence of the lambs. you have a killer in custody and these people have to enter his mind to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life. the only real difference between the foundation of the plots is that in the silence of the lambs, you have to enter the mind of a killer to find a different killer as well as his current victim, while in the cell, you have to enter the mind of a killer to find his own victim. however, despite the unfortunately weak story, the cell completely revolutionizes the genre of the psychological thriller. none that have ever been made even come close to it. also, the film had good direction and was extremely well acted. vince vaughn delivers another of his characteristically excellent performances (he was even good as norman bates in the pathetic 1998 re-make of psycho), and even jennifer lopez puts forth the second good effort of her career (the other being the great out of sight). nothing can be said of the cinematography in the cell to give it sufficient credit, it was imaginative and fascinatingly done and is unparalleled by anything ever seen in cinematic history. the cell is an incredibly well-made film, and it deserves to be recognized.

'the cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and i mean this literally. the film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. in my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. in fact, the story is pretty good.we start with catherine deane (jennifer lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. how this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality. she and other scientist including henry west (dylan baker) and miriam kent (marianne jean-baptiste) believe that this method might work. catherine enters the mind of the boy and speaks with him there, in a world that is completely created by the boy. she hopes she can let him do things that in the end will give results.the real story then. a serial killer named carl (vincent d'onofrio) just dumped the body of one of his victims. fbi agents ramsey (jake weber) and novak (vince vaughn) are on this case. another girl (tara subkoff) disappears and at that time, after forensic research on the dumped body, carl can be traced and captured. two problems occur. 1. carl just went into a coma; he has been sick for a long time. 2. his house and the house with his last kidnapped victim are not at the same place. in a way this part of the story is pretty standard.things are about to get interesting again. to find out where the girl is, catherine has to go into carl's mind. this is dangerous for a lot of reasons. in short: carl is unknown territory, schizophrenic and a serial killer. if catherine starts believing carl's mind is the real world then her mind can convince her body; she could die in the mind of carl. a tape of how the last victim was killed, a fate this girl will have in about twenty hours, makes sure catherine will try to get the location out of carl's mind.it is the journey through this sick mind that makes this film more than worth watching. director tarsem singh, who did music videos before this, in a way goes back to these music videos. every room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists out of beautiful and sometimes haunting images. for me the visual style felt completely new, the way 'three kings' had a new visual style one year earlier. if something like that can make you like a film, 'the cell' will not disappoint. but fans of the thriller and horror genre can like this film anyway. the story itself, without the great fantasy world, is good enough for that. i think you have to be a little open minded, of course events are not (yet) possible in our real world. still, a very entertaining film with nice ideas that looks terrific.

forget about the plot of this movie. forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by vince vaughn and vincend d'onofrio. forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring jennifer lopez that i can stomach. although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. it is as if salvador dali decided to make a crime drama. a must see for anyone seriously interested in cinematography and the use of the film cell as a canvas on which to display true works of visual art. i would have to give this movie a 9/10 for it's amazing visual display.

superb story of a dedicated young teacher who sets out teaching minority children in an area off south carolina.jon voight is just tremendous as the headstrong, dedicated, idealistic teacher who faces this challenge despite a principal, who believes in stern discipline and has little regard for modern educational techniques as well as a crusty old school superintendent, played with relish by the late hume cronyn. madge sinclair is the principal who loves her babies.as i'm a retired teacher, i could in some ways relate to this excellent film. the ignorance shown here as well as the lack of cooperation with officials is also quite apparent in urban areas.voight realizes that these children need far more than the traditional teachings of a classroom. he has them go out and experience life by themselves by learning outdoors.the end is a definite downer but so true to life.amazing that such backward students had a zest for learning and were well disciplined. i guess that answers my question. the behavior was there and they were motivated to succeed despite their environment.the ending will just tug at your heart. it was memorable and so well poignant.

coming on the heels of that 1970's "blackploitation" era, conrack (20th century-fox, 1974) offered audiences a low-key, sincere and everyday people sort of a drama. offering a far different fair to its audience (which was far more general than those "gansta" flicks); being a down to earth dose of realism that offered a lonely counterbalance to those shoot-'em-ups'.replacing lead characters that were bad-ass detectives, super-flies and megs/macks/pimps (take your pick in terminology), was a lone, humble and meek teacher. the academian we speak of is the main character, pat conroy; who is the one and only lone teacher hired to take on the responsibility of a sort of old time one room school house on an island off the coast of south carolina."conrack" (jon voight), the name that the youngsters dub him finds conditions in the school terribly backward. in addition to the physical properties of this "little red schoolhouse", any systematic and progressively graduated educational system was totally absent.oh yeah, by the way, did we mention that further complications to any successful educational venture were manifested in two incontrovertible facts. those were that pat conroy was both an outsider and he was white; with almost the entire population of this off-shore cay was black and very poor.perpetuating these unacceptable and deplorable conditions were the agents of the local board of education; being the school's principal, mrs. scott (madge sinclair) and the superintendent, mr. skeffington (mr. hume cronyn). between the two, we are made to understand that the teacher, being the low man on the totem pole, is powerless in most respects to affect any sort of meaningful, long-lasting improvements.but don't you tell a 'young turk', such as pat conroy, that he can't. (can't anything, that is). "conrack" spends a year of unorthodox classroom performances and is making real progress; but alas, the strong-headed teacher won't give in and recognize the authority of his superiors. while he is, by law and unbeknownst to him, serving at thee super's pleasure; he disobeys mr. skeffington's specific order and prohibition to take his class kids to the mainland of south carolina on halloween for some trick-or-treating; even going to the brazen act of stopping with them at the skeffington residence.next we see a western union telegram messenger happily singing as he crosses from the carolina mainland to the island; where he delivers the telegram to conroy that bore the news of his dismissal from his position with that school and district.not being one to take his being fired lying down, pat files suit against mr. skeffington, principal mrs. scott and the board of education protesting his dismissal as being unlawful. impartially reviewing both the "offense" and the law, the judge asks skeffington if there are any lesser punishments that could be substituted for conroy's being separated from the school system; to which he receives a negative response. fittingly, the judge dismisses the suit with his gavel pounding down while saying, "it's very simple!" the story is brought to a bittersweet conclusion as the 'conrack'students see him off to the mainland bound launch, while a phonograph record provides us with beethoven's 5th symphony; which had played an important part in the conroy educational agenda, as well as our story.in the humble opinion of this writer, the story (which we believe was at least semi-autobiographical, even giving the main character the name of its author), was much more than a tale of a localized happening. to both me pal schultz and meself; this is a sort of depiction of a microcosm that represents the overall deplorable conditions that permeate the government schools throughout the entire nation. (just an opinion) as for this film, it was just one of many movies portraying the stores of common folk; leading their lives of "quiet desperation" in the great hinterlands of the country, which lie outside the d.c. beltway and the urban centers of enterprise and communications situated on either the atlantic or pacific coasts.in its own small way, this is a fine film, which would soon be joined in the film vaults of 20th century-fox by such great works as norma rae and breaking away. (both being from tcf in 1979).see it if you ain't yet. recommended by both schulz and his buddy.*note: * why, that's me, of course! poodle schnitz!!

i just watched the dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago.it's not a "big" movie, and doesn't try to make a big splash, but my god, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.the dresser is the story of sir, an aging shakespearean actor (finney), and his dresser norman (courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii. these are two men, each dependent upon the other: sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of lear. and norman lives his life vicariously through sir; without sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway.this is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. finney, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they're taking their bows! and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. employer is really the wrong term to use, though. for although, technically their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple.yes, there are others in the cast of this movie, but there is no question that the true stars are finney, courtenay, and the marvelous script by ronald harwood. that is not to say that there aren't other fine performances, most notably eileen atkins as the long-suffering stage manager madge. there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been.although it doesn't get talked about these days, it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards: best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay, best picture, best director (peter yates), and best adapted screenplay.i had remembered this as being a good movie, but i wasn't prepared to be as completely mesmerized as i was from beginning to end. if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about, and be hugely entertained all the while, then i encourage you to see the dresser.

the ma & pa kettle characters were highly popular and controversial. the films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. one obvious reference is 'the beverly hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. you could even say the 1980s sitcom 'newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. still, i wonder if betty macdonald, the washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good. her portrayal of hillbilly characters makes them the butt of many jokes in terms of their alleged sloppiness and laziness. (the real life family that macdonald based the kettles upon, successfully sued...claiming they had been ridiculed and humiliated with these less-than-flattering references). sure, it's comedy and the situations bring us a great many laughs and fun moments...and political correctness as we know it today did not exist in the 1940s and 1950s. but i think macdonald could've still written these characters more sensibly and universal international could've had its scriptwriters show them on screen with more dignity (there's such a thing as good taste). the more realistic moments are when the oldest son tom is ashamed of his rural heritage but learns to accept his parents and siblings for who they are. for their part, the kettles have to realize that they don't exactly fit into a modern world. that's not a joke...that's a sober truth.

the further adventures of ma and pa kettle almost seamlessly picks up where the egg and i left off. for the first solo adventure of the kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. leonard goldstein, associate producer of the egg and i, was producer of the further adventures of ma and pa kettle. with many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the macdonalds to the kettles works very well. there is a reference to ma beating birdie hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in the egg and i. the prize money from the quilt contest was to be used to send tom kettle to college. in this movie tom is returning home as a college graduate.there are two plots intertwined in this movie. one is the comedy of the simple mountain family moving into a state of the art modern house. the other is a light morality play on how environment affects children as they grow up.pa kettle (percy kilbride) wanted a free tobacco pouch for entering a contest, and ended up winning a house. his disappointment at not getting the free tobacco pouch is played for laughs quite a bit. when pa plays with dynamite he is totally oblivious to the explosion. kilbride never flinched in the scene as the debris from the explosion fell around him. he played the part to perfection. in his autobiography, jack benny mentioned how impressed he was with percy kilbride's deadpan delivery. kilbride took that comedic device to a high level of perfection.ma (marjorie main) and pa move into the new house with modern conveniences that confuse ma and pa almost as much as they help them. ma adapts far more quickly than pa. included with the modern conveniences is a television, a very new household item in 1949. moving walls, hidden beds, and plumbing fixtures are used as comic props, but the attention is on ma and pa, never the props themselves.tom kettle (richard long) meets kim parker (meg randall), a magazine writer who feels that hygiene and environment are essential for children to realize success as adults. tom is a bright, self-made man who contradicts the theory that success can only come from a pristine environment. this subject is briefly discussed in a couple of scenes, but left to subside. it was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise whimsical movie.seeing the kettles moving out of their run-down old house to move to a new house would almost be a disaster if it were not for the characters staying true to themselves. ma was the practical one, just as she had been in the the egg and i. pa was the fish out of water that provided the best comedy. he never felt at home in the new house, but the actual location of a comfortable bed would never be of concern to him.

there is a need for this kind of entertainment in our modern world. you can watch "ma and pa" with adults, with your family (kids any age or just by yourself like me. they are gentle, but gentle is so refreshing in a society of kids killing kids, a horrible war, inappropriate prime time television and poverty. we don't even get a hint of where all of those children came from! give me modern plumbing and i'll gladly become a kettle. humor does not require offensive language. it is hard to follow conversations in shows where every other word is bleeped. relax, take your shoes off, and climb in your recliner with a good old-fashioned glass of lemonade, and just breathe easy watching ma sweeping the chickens off the table at lunch time! pj

the film begins with a cranky old broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor richard carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. however, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised). however, while this seems like bad and contrived writing, it is not....as this is all part of an elaborate ruse by the writer to have a group of actors in the home act out his plot. however, part-way through the ruse, the producer and his browbeaten assistant figure out that the murder mystery taking place in the home is fake and think the whole affair is pretty funny. what no one realizes, though, is that an escaped maniac is loose and he is about to enter this contrived little plot--making for some wonderful twists and turns. so when it seems that there is a real murder, the actors are truly terrified while carle and his sidekick are convinced it's all a hoax. while i have explained some of the plot, there are many more aspects of the film you'll just have to figure out yourself--and it's surely to keep you entertained and guessing.considering that this is a b-movie in the public domain, i certainly did not have very high hopes for this little film. however, i was thrilled when the film turned out to be a much better than average flick--with a very interesting and novel twist on the old clich√©d plot about a dark and stormy night spent in a mansion. plus, while the plotting of the film was very good, the dialog was even better--with lots of sparkling wit and a nice light-hearted pace. full of pleasant surprises and well worth your time.

i have this movie on a collection of inexpensive b-movies. it's not restored, in fact, the audio was difficult to discern for the first few minutes.at first, it seemed like a typical haunted house film, and feels very much like the forerunner of clue, murder by death, house on haunted hill, etc.about a half hour into the film, the storyline takes a really interesting twist--and it goes from being a clich√© melodrama to something entirely different, and far more entertaining than i had initially thought.check it out, it's a great deal of fun, even if the long clips and wider shots (and near lack of music score) make it feel a bit creaky by today's standards.

one of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as "the murder mystery", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. and since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced). aspiring playwright charles belden saw in this renewed interest in murder mysteries a chance to make a name for himself, after warner bros. picked his three-act play, "the wax works", to create the 1933 horror film, "mystery of the wax museum". belden joined independent filmmaker frank r. strayer to keep making films, and "the ghost walks" was one of his best.in "the ghost walks", john miljan plays prescott ames, a young playwright who wants to impress a famous broadway producer named herman wood (richard carle) with his new play. ames takes wood and his assistant homer (johnny arthur) to his country house for a reading of his play, but his car ends up stuck in the mud during a terrible storm. the three men ask for refugee in an old mansion which happens to be property of one of ames' old acquaintances. inside the house, wood and homer witnesses the strange relationship between ames and the house owners, however, this is all a plan conceived to impress wood: everyone in the house is an actor playing a role in his murder mystery. unfortunately, the murder committed is done for real, and while wood and homer think it's all fake (after discovering ames' original plan), the cast knows that someone inside the house is a real murderer.as expected, charles belden's screenplay for "the ghost walks" features the classic elements of the murder mystery stories of its time, as we have the stormy night at an old dark house as setting, the obligatory group of suspects, and the touch of comedy. however, what's interesting here is how belden makes the film a real spoof on the genre with the many twists he puts in his story to play with the clich√©s of murder mystery plays. the dialogs are excellent, full of wit and lighthearted charm, and while the plot certainly loses a lot of steam by the end (it follows the murder mystery routine anyways), it never fails to be interesting and entertaining thanks to its smart twists and specially its quirky characters. interestingly, there's an obvious gay subtext that while stereotypical, it's never denigrating and it's genuinely funny at times.by 1934 director frank r. strayer was already an experienced craftsman in the poverty row side of the film industry, but his partnership with writer charles belden would give him a couple of his most interesting movies, and "the ghost walks" was one of them. while obviously done on a shoestring budget and the typical production values of independent films of its time, strayer manages to take advantage of his set and makes an atmospheric movie that fits nicely the mood and tone of the story. the pacing is a little too slow at times, but strayer knew that the power of his film was on belden's script and makes the most of it, letting his cast to make the most of their characters with excellent results. certainly the execution is a bit typical and unoriginal, but strayer makes an effective albeit restrained work in this film.as written above, the screenplay is filled with great lines that make the quirky characters shine, and fortunately, most of the cast play with this to their advantage. veteran character actor richard carle is remarkably funny as cranky producer herman wood, adding a lot of charm to his character, specially in his scenes with johnny arthur, who plays the flamboyant secretary homer. arthur is the one who gets the most best scenes, and he gives and hilarious performance as the cowardly yet witty assistant. john miljan is just effective as presocott ames, nothing amazing, but nothing really bad, and the same could be said about june collyer as gloria shaw (the obligatory love interest), whom is just fine. however, donald kirke is really enjoyable as the malicious terry shaw, and it's a shame he didn't get more screen time.as usual with frank r. strayer films, the low budget hurts the film badly, as while strayer makes the best he can, the film still feels kind of plain at times. however, the main problem is problem the very slow pace it has, as even when the film is filled with sparkly moments of witty dialogs, it moves at a pace so slow that can become boring and tedious for moments. it also must be said that while effective in their roles, miljan and collyer are pretty dull and average when compared to arthur and carle, and one wishes the movie had been more focused on the comedic pair they make than on the main couple. finally, as written above the ending is kind of weak and not up to the high standard of the first and middle parts, although credit must go to belden for keeping creative plot twists appearing until the very end.one could say that charles belden is an unsung hero of the murder mystery genre, as among the many horror and mystery films that came out the b movie studios nicknamed as "the poverty row", "the ghost walks" is easily among the best (alongisde strayer's previous film, "the vmapire bat") despite its shortcomings. and even when it's definitely not a masterpiece of the genre, it's a nice way to spend a night enjoying the way it pokes fun at its own origin as a murder mystery play. a very recommended film if you like the genre. 7/10

on their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. they make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. if you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.this is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it. the cast is across the board excellent and they're more than willing to have a good time with what is good material.i would love to say that this is one of the best of the genre, it should have been, but for me something happened on the way that made me down grade the rating to only seven out of ten. i can't tell you what it is, not for certain anyway. perhaps its the sense that i knew where it was going almost from the outset, or perhaps its something else, i'm not sure what, but there was something that i couldn't shake that made me like this film despite wanting to love it. it just missed being great and somehow fell short.that said i do suggest you see it. it is after all a very witty film, that entertains fully, despite just missing being great.

the ghost walks is a nifty little mystery with a great twist, snappy dialog, and best of all a pansy played to the twittery hilt by character actor johnny arthur which never demeans or denigrates his character. mr. arthur is great in his role of homer erskine bringing great comic relief as the secretary of the broadway producer herman wood, played by another great character actor richard carle.they play off of each other superbly.although the acceptable words of the time sissy and cream puff are used to describe the character of homer, it is never mean spirited or meant as denigration, and are not spoken by the manly males of the film but by his employer, who fires and rehires him every other scene and who displays an almost exasperated affection for his devoted employee.there is a great scene where homer tells his boss that he has devoted the best years of his life to him and has been everything but a mother to him.the mystery angle of the film is very entertaining, and the twist at the end might just leave you in stitches.for a low budget poverty row picture, this film has superb set decoration and great costuming.director frank strayer ably handles his cast and this film holds together much better than some of his other low budget mystery attempts, but he had a great script to work with and some wonderful actors to carry it through.this film is a must see for devotees of poverty row films, old dark house mysteries (they actually managed to work in the lines "it was a dark and stormy night)and it has the added bonus of being an early representation of a gay character in film where nothing bad happens to them in the end.this movie is available for download in the public domain film section of the internet archive at archive.org.

both jackie and candice are terrific in this movie. they are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. in particular, the way candice pronounces the words "puerto rican" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. i had seen the original of this movie, called "old acquaintance", starring bette davis and miriam hopkins. they allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other. hart bochner and meg ryan have supporting parts and are both excellent, in particular bochner, who never got many decent parts in movies, as far as i am concerned. george cukor did not make another movie after this, so this was a good one to go out on.

gosh, i am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. for example, i had no idea who george cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. all i can say is..i really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. can that ever exist? well, in certain doses, yes...and this film let out in a bit on ... "how".being a youngster with not a lot of life experience at the first time i saw this so i focused more on the "rich" and "famous" part between the two. at the time, i had no idea there was a difference and what would happen to two women who discovered there was...and how that would effect their friendship. through their men, their career, the decades that defined them. and coming to realize one thing remained stronger than anything else...their friendship and knowing each other more than anyone else could have.then i got older, studied film a bit... and watched this film again with my best friend from high school. we do understand the 'rich' and 'famous' angle ... and we are still the best of friends...but this film is not a cinematic masterpiece...it can be seen as a bit campy at times...a little over the top at points (kinda on a 'dynasty' and 'dallas' level to me..) and honestly i can identify with the "teddy bear" scene for we do share a bear that means a lot more than a stuffed fun toy through our trials and tribulations with men/careers, et al..so its not as over the top as it seems....! as many already said, seeing meg ryan and matt latanzzi and dack rambo and david selby are great in this 1981 piece. this is a nice "chick" flick!

recently i saw this movie again (after 25 years). in the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between jacqueline bisset's character and michael brandon's character. the rented version did not have this scene in it. did i imagine this?or, is this part of the "clean up" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not "appropriate"?i love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and i and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together. her husband thought it was us as well.thank you, joan

i loved this film because of the dialog and superb acting by candace and jacqueline. however, i never knew until now, watching a bette david marathon on tnt that this film is a remake of a 1943 bette davis classic called old acquaintance. bette co-stars with miriam hopkins who she was in a terrible feud with during the making of the movie because bette had had an affair with miriam's husband who directed her in a film before they made old acquaintance.anyway, both are worth every minute spent watching. i highly recommend this film if you like a lot of dialog and drama. it's a study in the psychology of women and their relationships with each other, in my opinion.

i finally received my dvd today, viewed it and i'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. as you may have read in previous reviews of "rich and famous" that the edited for tv version of the film that somehow made it onto vhs sometime in the late 90's but, now wb has corrected the error and released it on dvd complete with the airplane restroom scene, matt lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the hotel room where liz (jacqueline bisset) calls merry (candice bergen) a c**t! it's all there and looks better than ever! a crisp clear digital transfer, widescreen, and special features that include original theatrical trailer and a vintage 1981 featurette called "on location with rich and famous" with cast and director interviews. if you love this film as i do you won't be disappointed with purchasing this dvd. glad to finally have this on dvd¬Ö well worth the wait! thank you warner bros!

george cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. itself a remake of bette davis' campy "old acquaintance" written by john van druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.bergen and bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. liz hamilton (bisset) is a "serious" writer, intellectual, and elegant. she meets her lifelong best friend merry noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition. later in their lives, when liz is a "promising" but blocked writer of serious fiction, merry decides to try her hand at writing, which infuriates her pal because of merry's casual approach to the craft she herself takes perhaps a little too seriously. much to liz's chagrin, merry's trashy novels hit pay dirt, and ultimately, her old friend liz is judging her novel for the national book award. bergen steals the show as the haughty writer of steamy bestsellers who schemes to bring together the broken pieces of her life in conjunction with her final literary triumph, but alas, things are never that simple.the supporting cast includes david selby, whom you might remember as the tragic quentin collins from dark shadows, hart bochner and, of course, a deliciously young and mercurial meg ryan in her first film role since leaving the soaps. rich and famous is catty, campy, witty and wise. it culminates in a new years fiasco that stresses the enduring nature of true friendship, and i never let a year go by without watching it on new years eve. watch it and you'll see why.

george cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. the unsung hero of his generation. nobody mentions cukor in the same breath as john ford, howard hawks, william wyler or billy wilder and yet, look at his filmography. from sparkling comedies "the philadelphia story" "adam's rib" "holiday" psycho melodramas "gaslight" "a double life" a great semi western "heller in pink tights" not to mention "my fair lady" or "travels with my aunt" he was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera. i feel a certain tenderness watching "rich and famous" flashes of the old master still very much in evidence. candice bergen gives us for the first time in her career glimpses of the wonderful comedian she was about to become. jacqueline bisset is a throwback to the days of greer garson and loretta young and hart bochner steps in, teasing us, promising something spectacular that will eventually materialize in 1989 with "apartment zero", meg ryan, as bergen's daughter is already meg ryan. as tired as the formula is, it remains a cukor film and for what i gather one of almodovar's favorite movies.

the year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'the gunfighter' by henry king, and 'wagon master' by john ford. 'the gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced zimmerman's 'high noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.however, i personally find 'wagon master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring. frontier scenery is well used as it supports the poetic narrative perfectly. add naturalistic camera work and we are transported among the mormon travellers to witness western folklore told in cinematic means.

the performances by the male leads make this long-hard-journey west interesting throughout. the soundtrack by the sons of the pioneers is one of the most beautiful i have every heard. the journey itself is somewhat episodic, and joanne dru is badly miscast. overall, this is a very heartwarming and heartfelt western.

what can you say about a short little film filled with secondary actors and no "stars", with absolutely no bad performances, not one poorly delivered line of dialog, and with the cold violence on one hand being balanced by the warm "heart" of the protagonists in the story? it's a jewel, a diamond, a little valuable gem of a western that evokes the spirit and legend of the american west. a west not settled by grand heroes like hickock or cody or masterson or earp, but by the spread of the everyday man and woman, farmers and ranch hands, merchants and miners and lumbermen, whores and barkeeps, and entertainers of the day, some looking for riches, some for peace and quiet, some for religious freedom. it is, perhaps, a very spiritual story, though not promoting any particular religion, for even the non-mormon cowboys portrayed by ben johnson and harry carey jr. act in kind and noble ways toward everybody in the story, regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs, and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train comes upon the stranded medicine show people. and in true biblical fashion, like david and goliath or samson and the philistines, they are the guardian angels sent to the wagon train who eventually have to go head to head with the evil incarnate clegg clan, likening them to the serpent in the garden of eden, and regretting what it is they have to do afterward. it's a sweet folkloric tale of the west that hits every target john ford takes aim at.nowadays i have a western santa claus whose red outfit is covered with a denim drover coat, whose red stocking cap is replaced by a brown stetson, who carries a burlap bag of presents and a coil of rope. to my santa i added a winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a colt revolver to tuck into his waistband. when people at the office ask why my santa has to carry guns, i simply reply, "snakes!" after all, isn't the spirit of the christmas season one where everybody should get what they deserve? fifty five years later, especially post-911, the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and story of this movie are still as relevant today as they were back then.

i first saw this movie on tv back in 1959 when i was eight years old. i knew nothing of westerns then but recognized ben johnson from the movie "mighty joe young." what attracted me to "wagon master" were the great songs sung by the "sons of the pioneers." merian c. cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. cooper hired max steiner to create the mood for his classic creation king kong. steiner would later win an oscar for the theme for "gone with the wind.' cooper was also the producer of "mighty joe young." if you remember, music was important to the big ape which would only respond to the sound of stephan foster's "beautiful dreamer." in 1947, cooper would partner with john ford, who directed "wagon master." of all of ford's famous westerns, this one is my favorite which features his brother francis and a sullen janes arness.

most of us kids growing up in the 40's or 50's were western buffs but this was one that had escaped me until seeing on the movies for men channel today. i loved the film's story, cinematography as well as the superb casting of ben johnson and harry carey jr. in the lead roles along with the ever dependable ward bond. apparently this movie was the inspiration for the later television series 'wagon train' which featured bond once again as the boss of the wagon trains heading west. johnson steals the film with his horse riding skills and it's nice to see an actor doing his own stunts like ben does in this movie. other notables include the lovely joanne dru as denver and an early non speaking role for james arness who later became famous for his marshal matt dillon role in 'gunsmoke.' if you like films of this genre you can't fail to like this one.

for my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director ford ever made. the dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l the story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any american black-and-white film. owes an awful lot to sergei eisenstein's editing technique, but never as coolly detached or 'scientific' as eisenstein could frequently get. and a great musical score. a magnificent panorama of an important and poorly understood episode in american history.one little quibble: it's not clear why the film involves the mormons, who, as far as i know, were never the pacifists the quakers and amish were. this confusion leaves a slightly bitter after-taste.however, the rest of the film is such a feast, this is easy to ignore. in all other ways, a true masterpiece of american cinema that needs to be revived and looked at again (and again and again).

this small john ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. it has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey west of a party of mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all ford's films, (it's on par with "the sun shines bright" which he made a couple of years later).there is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental. the splendid performances of ford's stock company, (ben johnson, harry carey jr, ward bond, jane darwell etc), adds considerably to the film's authenticity while the nearest the film gets to a full-bodied star performance is joanne dru's denver. dru was a much finer actress than she was ever given credit for as were bond and johnson, who at least was finally awarded with the recognition of an oscar for his work in "the last picture show". as he said himself, 'it couldn't have happened to a nicer fella'. add bert glennon's superb location photography and you have a genuine piece of americana that couldn't have some from anyone other than ford. this is a film that truly honors america's pioneers and is full of sentiment and feeling.

by 1950, john ford had already fully-developed the ideas and motifs that would form the core of his most successful westerns. always present, for example, is a strong sense of community, most poignantly captured in the joad family of steinbeck's 'the grapes of wrath (1940).' within these communities, even amid ford's loftier themes of racism and the pioneer spirit, there's always room for the smaller human interactions, the minor friendships and romances that make life worth living. 'wagon master (1950)' came after ford had released the first two films in his "cavalry" trilogy ¬ñ 'fort apache (1948)' and 'she wore a yellow ribbon (1949)' ¬ñ and it covers similar territory, only without the military perspective and, more damningly, the strong lead of john wayne. ben johnson and harry cary, jr. are fine actors, but they feel as though they should be playing second-fiddle to somebody, and ward bond's cursing mormon elder, while potentially a candidate for such a role, isn't given quite enough focus to satisfactorily fit the bill.in 'wagon master,' ford seems so comfortable with his tried-and-tested western formula that any character development is largely glossed over. ben johnson's romance with joanne dru is treated as an obligation more than anything else, and harry cary jr's charming of a mormon girl is so perfunctory as to be almost nonexistent in the final film, leaving one to ponder the survival of deleted scenes. only in charles kemper's charismatic and shamelessly-villainous uncle shiloh does ford try some different, and it works, even with his being surrounded by a troop of insufferably hammy slack-jawed yokels. where ford does succeed is in orchestrating the conglomeration of three distinct races of americans ¬ñ the values-orientated mormoms, the easygoing horse-traders, the eccentric travelling showmen ¬ñ into a cohesive community of pioneers looking towards a bright future. this apparent harmony is thrown into disarray by the arrival of uncle shiloh's gun-toting outlaws, who exploit the lawlessness of the western frontier but ultimately lose out to the noble cowboys who "only ever drew on snakes."ford reportedly considered wagon master among the favourite of his films, and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like john wayne or henry fonda. armed only with his stock selection of usual players, ford is able to generate a sense of community by avoiding placing focus on any one character, though most of the mormom travellers still remain completely anonymous. despite being undoubtedly well-made, i can't help feeling that this film only does well what other ford pictures did even better: the terrific majesty of the the western frontier was presented more beautifully in 'she wore a yellow ribbon'; the romances and friendly squabbles among community members took greater prominence in 'fort apache'; the early relations with native americans, only hinted at here, were more thoroughly examined in 'the searchers (1956)'; the bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored more movingly (albeit by henry hathaway and george marshall) in 'how the west was won (1962).' 'wagon master' is pure john ford, but it isn't a landmark.

i don't think i really have any spoilers in here but since i do describe a couple of funny scenes, i'll check the box saying 'might contain spoilers' just to be on the safe side. now...i hardly know where to start. by now you know the basic outline of the story - horse traders travis (ben johnson) and sandy (harry carey jr.) take the job of guiding a mormon wagon train west to their 'promised land' and along the way encounter a variety of trials and interesting characters, most notably the outlaw clegg family.anyone can enjoy this movie. you don't have to be a fan of westerns to like this one. for one thing, johnson and carey are two of the most quickly likable characters you'll see in any movie. carey in particular is animated and outgoing, almost like a big kid - while johnson is a little calmer and wiser, kind of like an older-brother figure. i get a kick out of the scene where they sell the sheriff one of their 'gentle horses' for ten dollars; then inform him that the horse has "some peculiarities - you might say failings"... travis elbows sandy who lets loose with a shrill whistle, sending the sheriff's new horse off on a wild bucking fit with him in the saddle. the look on his face as the horse finally dumps him and gallops away is priceless.pay attention to the music... even if you never thought you'd be a fan of the sons of the pioneers, listen to "shadows in the dust" as the wagon train is shown in motion with some of the people walking along between the wagons. it's a truly beautiful song- too bad only half a minute or so of it is in the movie. i want to hear the whole thing sometime.one thing that impressed me greatly about this movie is that much of it must have been almost as hard to make as the real situation it portrays. teams of six horses pulling wagons up steep mountain trails, straining to make the top - this was no simple and easy film. it must have been risky for the actors, the stunt people and the animals as well. fording rivers too, this movie has plenty of authentic-looking action involving the movement of the wagon train. it should be mentioned that both harry carey jr. and ben johnson were extremely competent riders, both with many years' experience riding, roping, and doing all manner of cowboy-type things. carey grew up on a ranch where his family employed many navaho indians and in fact he learned to speak navaho before he learned to speak english. no rhinestone cowboys in this movie - "travis" and "sandy" were the real thing through and through.watch for the scene when miss denver throws out the pan of water from her wagon, hitting travis's horse in the face... the horse starts bucking, eventually throwing him off it. watch the look on sandy's face when denver tells travis 'i'm sorry you fell off your horse.' another favorite scene of mine is when harry carey jr. (sandy) gets into a bit of a tiff with one of the mormons. they're working back to back getting their gear ready, and after sandy gets disgusted with the other fellow, the two of them get into a rear-end bumping match that quickly turns into a rolling-around-on-the-ground fist fight. even after the elder (ward bond) stands them up and separates them, the two combatants continue trying to get at each other. the mormon (named 'jackson' in the film) gets one final kick in at sandy so high it hits his shoulder. it's a really funny scene from start to finish. i don't know what else i can say about this movie other than that it has a good story, very engaging characters, beautiful scenery and plenty of action balanced with humor and a bit of drama. oh, it has been colorized, at least in the version i saw; not the most beautiful color film you'll ever see but i think i prefer it to black and white. i give this one a ten and i don't give out many 10's. one of my favorite movies, without a doubt. and, judging by the other comments, i have plenty of company in that assessment.

this film has to be as near to perfect a film as john ford made. the film is magic, a masterpiece, the reason ford was, well ford. if you want to know why ford was great this one explains it.the photography of course is superb, black and white as black and white should be, wonderful shots, not an over the shoulder conversation in it, pure ford, great moments, big and little. the famous ripped pants of ward bond. apparently two dogs kept invading the set and fighting so ford wanted to use them in the fighting scene, but instead of fighting one dog ran away and the other attacked ward bond and ripped his pants, which caused ford no end of mirth. a whole scene around plaiting a rope. the way ben johnson burn then snuffs his rope, wonderful foreshadowing and anticipation of the final. harry carey's naive courting of prudence. the usual ford line about being scared and not showing it. bond's horse accidentally falling in him and its left in the film. johnson and bond are fantastic in that scene. lord help any ford actor who does not stay in character while the camera is rolling even when a horse falls on top of you.a couple of very sweet romances, not intruding on the whole focus, two very likable leads, not to mention for the girls, the number of times the cameras focus on ben johnson's rather delightful backside.lots of old time stuntmen getting lines and roles, cliff lyons, frank mcgrath. some wonderful character studies mostly of faces staring, all the villains and main stars. a set of villains to rival any group in any western.many many fordian shots of faces, groups, children, women, small things happening, foals in the background (ford seems to love images of foals), women in aprons, allowing the moment as wagons cross rivers and the camera lingers.this is probably not a western as much as an artist's picture that happens to be set in the west.lucky the film was made in 1950 because it is impossible to imagine such a film could be ever made again, but then it is such a work of art that it would be a sacrilege to attempt it

this film is about two horse traders who agree to escort a small group of mormons across the desert. along the way, they encounter a murderous family of thugs who menace the peaceful folks and put their pilgrimage in jeopardy.wagon master is what i would term a "little" john ford film, as it obviously did not have the budget or scope of some of his other westerns. in particular, this film lacks the big-name stars like john wayne but allows some of the usual supporting characters to take center stage. long-time ford stock character actors ben johnson, harry carey, jr. and ward bond have been elevated to starring roles and perhaps the one who came of as "the" lead was probably johnson--though the other two got nearly as much screen time and focus. this is not a bad thing, as the film worked just fine without the big star--and is well worth seeing.now this isn't to say i loved the movie. it was very good but certainly not perfect. in particular, as far as the music goes, you'll probably either love it or hate it. i found the sons of the pioneers' music a bit schmaltzy at times. it did evoke a nice mood, but seemed to occasionally dominate the scenes. i think a little would have worked much better. plus, with their incessant singing in the background, i kept expecting roy rogers to pop out at any moment. another minor problem is that the plot was amazingly simple and the ending was pretty much a foregone conclusion.however, and i am glad to say there is a 'however', despite this being rather formulaic and sentimental, the film still worked well. this was primarily due to john ford's nice, as usual, direction as well as ben johnson's exceptional performance. he was able to provide an excellent anchor for the film. another plus for me is that i saw this in the same week as brigham young, another film about the mormon migration. while brigham young was a bit silly and overly "saintly" in its portrayals, here the mormons were less "perfect" and more like real people--with foibles and personalities. oh, and speaking of brigham young, it seems as if jane darwell was the 'go to' girl for mormon-themed films during this era, as she was a major supporting character in both films. considering that she died in brigham young and it was set about 20 years before wagon master, this is some stunt!also, if you'd like to catch a glimpse of the famous jim thorpe, he's in a tiny role where he plays the impassive indian dancing next to jane darwell around the camp fire.

wagon master (1950) dir: john ford production: argosy pictures / rko radio pictures john ford brings the stock company out into the utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. no john wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.this ensemble piece nominally stars ben johnson (as travis) and harry carey jr. (sandy). they're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of mormons, led by ward bond, are being shown the exit. the group is about to embark on a trek to their own settlement, but they know the odds and the harsh terrain are against them. so they hire travis and sandy as wagon masters for their trip. along the way they run into and take along a traveling medicine salesman and his two female cohorts (alan mowbray as the doctor, recalling his appearance in my darling clementine and joanne dru as his "daughter"). tension is added when the murderous clegg gang comes upon the wagon train. and there is also an atypical (for hollywood) meeting with the navajo.most of the story and humor is driven by the clash of ideals/cultures; first between travis and sandy and the mormons, between ward bond himself (he's constantly trying to suppress his urge to curse and be a reformed man), between the doctor and his ladies and the mormons, between the wagon train and the outlaws, and finally, everyone and the navajo. there is also a classic ford scene of a rowdy dance which expresses one of his signature themes of civilization coming to the frontier.again, no duke here, but i've found ben johnson, especially the young, cocksure ben johnson, to have an engaging screen presence of his own. he comes with his own backstory, with that drawl and also when you see him doing all the stunt riding himself. he's great here in one of his early credited appearances. harry carey jr., although having been around for a few years by this time, is still pretty raw at times, but he's likable. ward bond is his usual marvelous, blustery self. i've found joanne dru to be a drag in whatever i see her in, but here she's mercifully unobtrusive. other familiar faces include jane darwell, francis ford and hank worden, playing 'dumb', like he will in the searchers a few years later. it's not any more amusing here.there is some absolutely spectacular b&w photography by frequent ford collaborator bert glennon. not only is there the typical masterclass on the landscapes and horizons, there is also some flourish in a handful of scenes with shadow and (sun)light. the soundtrack features the legendary country music group, the sons of the pioneers. can't get more cowboy than that.***¬Ω out of 4

lackawanna blues is a fine stage play by ruben santiago-hudson and an even finer film as the author adapted his own life story for the screen. this brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors, fine music, brilliant editing, superb direction by george c. wolfe, and a cast so stunning that they make an encore viewing compulsory! yes, it is just that good.the story is based on the author's life as the child 'junior' (marcus carl franklin) raised in the inimitable home of soulfully empathetic rachel "nanny" crosby (s. epatha merkerson), a lady who devoted her life to aiding the disenfranchised by transporting them from the south, from mental hospitals, and from the streets to lackawanna, new york. the boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house - odd characters with painful pasts - and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by nanny. the myriad characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business: terrence howard, rosie perez, mos def, the beautiful carmen ejogo, louis gossett jr., jeffrey wright, ernie hudson, charlayne woodward, jimmy smits, patricia wettig, macy gray, liev schreiber, kathleen chalfant, lou myers, hill harper - the list goes on and on.in the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the infectious joy of african american music contributions to our musical culture, and the courage of one fine woman who battled all the hardships the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact. s. epatha merkerson is wholly submerged in this role, a role she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos. she offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years, and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an hbo movie, she without a doubt would add the oscar to place along side her golden globe award.the entire cast is exceptional and wolfe handles the acting and the story like a master: like riffs in a jazz piece, he pastes tiny moments of conversation with each character and junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues, jazz, dancing, and joy. the production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention lag from the momentum of the story. highly recommended, almost compulsory viewing! grady harp

lackawanna blues is a drama through and through. it details the life of a strong woman by the name of rachel crosby (s. epatha merkerson). rachel is referred to as nanny by all who know her, but she could have just as easily been called wonder woman. she epitomized strength, will power, confidence and resolve. she owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject. her tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputee, and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary. each successive event rachel took in stride and handled flawlessly. she wasn't a dictator devoid of compassion, but in fact she was quite the opposite. she displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to over-extend herself.merkerson did a good job, but i believe this role was right up her alley anyway. the movie had an even keel never straying from rachel. there were of course dramatic moments but they were to be expected. nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than rachel herself.

lackawanna blues is a touching story about nanny, a woman who gives all of herself to help those in need. it's told from the viewpoint of a boy, taken in by nanny when his own mother isn't quite up to the task.i have respect for this movie for three main reasons: 1) it is touching, but not sappy. it's told in a very real fashion, without a lot of the aggravating hollywood storytelling baggage. and the ending is quite good (teary but not over-the-top).2) although it's clearly an african-american film, being set in the post-segregation black community of lackawanna, new york, it doesn't wear its ethnicity on its sleeve. the story stands on the strength of the characters and the dramas (and comedies) surrounding their lives. it's not preachy, it's simply good.3) it has a great soundtrack (can't beat old-school r&b and chicago blues).generally the acting is strong, but not universally so. some of the performances simply don't hold up to the characters the actors are supposed to portray. but considering it was a made-for-tv movie, that's to be expected.8 out of 10. imperfect but likable, good film for a rainy day.

kannathil muthamittal was simply one of the most touching and sincere movies ive seen in a long time. the story of an adopted girl who on her 9th birthday learns the truth about her parentage. she sets out in an endeavour to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is now a terrorist.the greatness of the movie lies in its simplicity. mani ratnam generally has a tendency to create unreal and pompous overblown characters in this movie, every person seems real and their interactions are touching and sincere. this is the reason why this ranks as one of his best movies.the movie is emotionally draining and tugs at the heart of the viewer, keerthana as the 9 year old amudha and simran as her adopted mother are simply brilliant. their relationship is the cornerstone of this movie. there are some notable flaws here, particularly the scene where amudha learns that she is an adopted child is jarring and seems totally unreal. it is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would break such a news in the manner that they did. another flaw is, surprisingly enough, the brilliant songs. they again seem forced and stand out, not gelling with the rest of the script.having said these, this still is one of the most poignant and beautiful movies to come out of india in a long long time. this beauty is not just in the script or characters but in teh technical brilliance as well, ravi chandran's camera work is sheer poetry. all characters perform creditably and the realistic humour, especially in teh flashback scenes are entertaining.a sincere 9!!

in sri lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-sinhalese government and the liberation tigers of tamil eelam (ltte), a separatist organization, has claimed an estimated 68,000 lives since 1983. human rights groups have said that, as a result of the war, more than one million people have been displaced, homeless or living in camps. the impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed tamil director mani ratnam in his 2002 film a peck on the cheek, winner of several awards at the national film awards in india. while the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girl's voyage of discovery, the human cost of war is made quite clear and ratnam gives the fighting a universal context, pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoing.beautifully photographed in southern india by cinematographer ravi k chandran in a setting mirroring the terrain of sri lanka, the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9-year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in sri lanka. played with deep feeling and expressiveness by p.s. keerthana in a memorable performance, amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents shyama (nandita das) and dileepan (j.d. chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out, leaving her in a red cross camp. in a loving flashback, we see amudha's adoptive parents, father thiru (madhavan) a prominent tamil writer, and mother indra (simran) a tv personality, marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker-skinned little girl.young amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday, according to the parents' prior agreement. while she is playing, thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that "you are not our daughter" and the response is predictable. distraught, she questions who her father was, what her mother's name was, why she gave her up, and so forth but few answers are forthcoming. amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to sri lanka to help her find her true mother, now a fighter for the tamil separatists. the family's immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions, handled mostly with skill by ratnam, though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurish.a peck on the cheek is of course a bollywood-style film and that means tons of music and melodrama. the melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors; however, i found the musical dramatizations of songs by a. r. rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick, high production techniques and fast-paced music video-style editing. yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the film's limitations. tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even within the country as being too clich√©d and commercial, yet a peck on the cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues. that it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute.

i am a big follower of indian movies especially malayalam and tamil.shame on india for not sending this movie as their official oscar entry. i have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up with.by the way to all we westerners, tamil cinema is more qualitative and very different from bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion.coming to the point what was india thinking when they sent a movie like 'devdas' to the oscars? that was a really a masochist move. i think they are trying to punish oscar judges with boredom by sending devdas since the judges toppled lagaan last year.'devdas' is just a brigthly colored but stale and predictable melodrama of love, fate and destiny. i would keep away from it. anyway, not sending a movie like kanathil muthital shows how much of a revamp indian administration needs to save them from poor administrators who lack intelligence. now i know why this country has so many issues. they are heavily talented but not showcased properly.

sri lanka... not a country i've ever given much thought to, i have to admit. i didn't even know it was near india, let alone that there has been a bloody civil war going on there since 1983. it seems that the rebels of the tamil minority have been in an ongoing conflict with the military regime that runs the country for many years, causing many deaths and widespread suffering on the island.mani ratman's latest film, a peck on the cheek, tells the story of a young girl named amudha, who is separated from her sri lankan parents by the war and raised by a young indian couple. amudha is a bright and mischievous girl, whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child. although her adopted parents love her as much as could be, and have raised her without prejudice along with their biological children, amudha cannot help but want to learn more about her biological family.mani ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film dil se, which hides a story about terrorism and politics inside a love story (or is it the other way around?). a peck on the cheek inhabits similar territory, but is perhaps more ambitious in the ground it covers. the central theme that binds the movie is of love between all the various members of a family, and especially that between a child and her adopted parents. it's a pretty honest and open look at feelings, that can be extremely touching and heartwarming at some times and quite painful at others. it's an emotionally complex film, with characters that are somewhat idealised but still behave in a very human way.the film revolves around 9 year old amudha, played with charm and vivaciousness by young actress p.s. keerthana in her first and only acting role. she's a princess and a monster, always getting into trouble but so disarmingly charming nobody can stay mad at her for long. the young actress is perfectly cast for the role, and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of her.a peck on the cheek has such an innocent name i was quite unprepared for the intensity of the experience. never has such a small act come with such an enormous emotional impact, i dare say. the film is a bold and artistic effort to explore issues that are not frequently covered on the silver screen.mani ratman's direction is superb, very confident and mature - the most sophisticated work i've seen from this director yet. the film is visually very stylish, with some excellent camerawork and imagery. a.r. rahman provides the film's soundtrack, which is not as good as his classic dil se or bombay music (based on first impressions at least) but still shows his great musical talent.i'm not aware of a dvd release for the film yet - i saw it in tamil with english subtitles thanks to the san francisco international film festival, of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight. the production is a truly world class effort, and i am sure it will be popular with western audiences as it begins to receive wider exposure.recommended.

this thing works on all levels -- it's intense as a thriller, full of lars von trier homages, but also very much its own film -- and it does have a message: happiness comes from within, best personified in the wounded soldier who practically (and, believe it or not, humorously) disintegrates limb by limb throughout the film, all the while apologizing to others for imposing on them. you laugh at him, but you envy him as well. the central character is a well-meaning but clumsy writer who spends the whole film trying to help those he befriends on a train from stockholm to berlin just after world war ii. he ties the parallel stories together, and really screws people up in the process. to say things go wrong is an understatement -- and structurally, the characters are all in perfect opposition to each other. it's like every one of them has an opposite -- just so tight, like watching anti-matter collide. you will not believe the sick stuff you end up laughing at. to say more would qualify as a spoiler -- all i can say is it is a shame this film has not been released in the us, not even on dvd. some moron probably told them americans wouldn't get it -- which is crap, because we not only "get" but produce things like south park... if this film gets marketed in the us, it should be sold as a mainstream black comedy, because that's what it is. over-the-top, sick and twisted, but fuuuuunnnnnyyyyy!

very funny film with some of the best swedish actors. it's all filmed in black and white with the true 40-ish feeling. most of the film you are aboard a train headed for berlin in 1945 among a mixture of characters from refugees to 2 gay guys and 2 nuns. i truly recommend this film if you like to laugh.

first of all - i hardly ever watch swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life i watch a swedish movie on cinema! therefor, i believe it's one of the best swedish movies ever! the combination of thrill and humour is outstanding, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! the plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to germany after world war ii and help the germans to start over. on the way to germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea. what a clumsy jerk! and poor robert gustafsson - the wounded soldier - always get in the way ... ouch!!! but he still got his great mood. a positive guy. robert gustafsson have done some less great movies the last years or so, and this is really a relief. he is great in this movie. after all - this is one of the best swedish movies ever, and peter dalle has made an excellent job! congratulations!

"jaded" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like "indecent behavior" or "friend of the family". "jaded" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. from the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. the raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. i think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie. that's why it looks sometimes dull and becomes boring almost near the end.the performances are extremely good from all the five female characters. these women gave strong, intense, but believable performances that demonstrate the actresses' dramatic abilities. the legal concepts helped a lot to understand the plot's difficulty because the legal term of sodomy is different from a simple raping. from the point of view of meg's defense, sodomy needs to be penalized as a raping (a huge crime grade b) although it's a different crime. pat and alex's defense claims that meg enjoyed and asked for it. this is where the movie turns interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth. the only thing for sure is that the sex scene fits into a legal definition of a crime. watch "jaded" if you like legal issues that aren't very common in your society. if not, give it a try because it's a very good and strong drama.

-it has carla gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* -"jaded" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. but one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. she is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital. after that, we spend the rest of the movie watching her attempting to bring down the two girls and at the same time learn some new info about who she is and where she comes from and a bit about her past.-director and co-writer caryn krooth does an excellent job with this movie considering its uber low budget. it hand-held and sometimes looks like 16mm but it fits the movie since the story demands a harsh look to it. the actors all do okay jobs with what is given to them and there's not really anything to complain about it. the standout feature in the movie is of course carla gugino who bares it all in this movie. she is actually more nude in this movie than she is in "sin city". christopher mcdonald is also in the movie but his character is really kinda pointless, but he is fun to watch. i didn't really pay much attention to the music since it doesn't really draw attention to itself but it gets the job done with what it's got. the movie is r rated and it's that for a very good reason. it's very sexual and very graphic at times. it's essentially borders on soft core at times but the sex scenes are necessary for the movie so it doesn't feel like it's just there for the sake of being there. although there is one pointless scene where we see chris mcdonald getting it on, that scene was a tad pointless but it's not really much of a problem i guess. the only fault with the movie is that we don't get to see the court trial after all that we go through in the movie. it's like having sex and not having an orgasm or something -it's a shame that the talented caryn krooth has never made a feature film since this. this is a highly gifted woman can do great things with a very little budget. i really hope that she gets back in the game soon because she is an amazing director. jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema, instead what we have is an enjoyable movie that shows a great director in the making.-hide the kids and close the curtains, you don't want people to think you're watching porn whiles watching this movie.

"jaded" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. in lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. this director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and d.a. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. it is not. to be a sexual predator is gender neutral. the nudity of this film is not erotic. the rape is brutal not sexual. we are looking at victims and not titillation.the gifted cast rings true. for a film that is so little known, i was surprised at the quality of the performances. they are good. carla gugino and rya kihlstedt are incredible.somehow, this film got lost. perhaps it is too smart for its own good. it is a "should see". highly recommend. a thinking person's sexual thriller.

i saw this film at the 2002 toronto international film festival.this is the first indian film i've seen in the tamil language, and while it does share some similarities with other indian films (wonderful music and choreography, sweeping storyline), the director attempts more than just to entertain. the film tells the story of amudha, a precocious nine-year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted, thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from india to war-torn sri lanka. gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point, though it is a simplistic one. amudha is played by p.s. keerthana, and she is one of the few child actors i've seen who can be precocious and yet not annoying. her charm and beauty held the film together.

i first saw heimat 2 on bbc2 in the 90's when i was at art college living and moving among artists and musicians, hoping for future success. so 'the second home' - of friendships made after leaving the familial home, of striving for a professional excellence - strongly resonated with my living reality. i was captivated by the characters, the storytelling, the lyrical camera-work and above all by the music. in it i could divine the beginnings of german electronic music, of 50's stockhausen, kraftwerk, can, neue, faust of the 70's, the sound experiments of john cage, walter carlos and the british electronic psychedelia of the white noise. the soundtrack composer nikos mamangakis studied with carl orff of carmina burana-fame so i found its tastes contemporary to the electronic pop/ sound effects world.i hadnt seen heimat or heimat 3 so i watched it as a whole in itself without a before or after. as someone else has commented, it is both epic and lyrical - historical and artistic. many favourite moments including the wonderful voice of gisela muller (evelyn), the bach marimba of daniel smith (juan), the piano-playing of henry arnold (hermann) and the cello-playing of salome kammer (clarissa).i could write more but it's already been said here. why can't british or us tv produce such masterpieces ? the wire had the realism and politics and epic sweep of a city, david lynch and dennis potter had imaginative tropes to their serialised tv work too but this is art-house and soap at its most cinematic and narrative sublime. it's never included in critics' choices of best films but it should be. still as poetic and powerful as when i first saw it over 17 years ago. i watch the 3 boxed sets every autumn for their 'mellow fruitfulness'. inspired and inspiring.

i've just finished seeing the film for the first time in it's entirety (although i watched some parts when it was first shown in britain in the mid-90's), i truly believe it to be a masterpiece of late twentieth century cinema. undoubtledly a film of this scope raises lots of questions, like why are there some narrative differences between the 60's hermann in 'heimat' and hermann in this film? for example, in the first film hermann has a fairly significant relationship with his stepfather (he funds hermann's electronic music), whereas in "die zweite..." there is little mention of his dad until the final episode.one other point does interest me; reading up on edgar reitz i'm struck by historical similarities between him and the stefan character, (spoiler coming) in the last episode it is revealed that stefan has won a prize at the venice film festival, (reitz won an award for best debut work there for his film "mahlzeiten"); reitz's film company is called 'edgar reitz filmproduktion' and stefan's is also eponymously named. i'm interested in stefan being an autobiographical character because aside from helga he is probably the least likable of the friends. maybe stefan's a red herring, i don't know, what i do know is that i loved this film and wish that more were made like it, with the exception of michael haneke's "cache" and werner herzog's "grizzly man" there's not enough ambition, audacity and passion of this sort in modern cinema. i can't wait to see number 3 now.

in 1984, edgar reitz surprised film-lovers all over the world with his epic opus heimat: a chronicle of germany. eight years later, he came up with a sequel, the second heimat: chronicle of a youth, which is even more astounding than its predecessor.actually, it's not really a sequel. it's more of a "midquel", as it covers events that took place between the ninth and eleventh episode of the first heimat cycle.the second heimat begins in 1960, four years after hermann simon (henry arnold) was separated from his first love, klarchen, courtesy of his intolerant mother and elder brother (the controversy had to do with him being a minor, while she was about 25). still angered by those events, the young man vows never to fall in love again (a grandiose, if creepy scene), and decides to move to munich (like the director himself did in approximately the same period), hoping to become a professional composer after a few years spent at the music academy. he stays in munich for ten years, and the thirteen two-hour episodes of heimat 2 cover that time-frame, each of them focusing on a different person among hermann's fellow students, people who, like him, are searching for a "second home country", be it music, film or something else, in which they can finally live peacefully.like the first heimat, this second cycle is a perfect union of film and television: the episodic structure and the various romantic subplots make it look like a soap opera, in fact the second heimat needs to be seen in its entirety to be successfully embraced, whereas some chapters of heimat 1 could be viewed as separate stories (in particular, the one concerning hermann's teenage years). the style and content, however, is pure auteur cinema, with the familiar black and white/color transitions (actually, a tad more predictable this time around) and ambiguous characters, the latter element being underlined by the relationship between hermann and cello player clarissa lichtblau (salome kammer): they clearly love each other, yet they keep embarking on affairs with other people, delaying the inevitable until it's too late. this time, reitz seems to be more pessimistic regarding his characters ( at one point, hermann is so disillusioned he says: "the beatles are much better than us!"), building entire episodes around dark, controversial themes such as abortion and suicide. the decade he's exploring is not suitable for everyone, as some are scarred in dramatic ways by the pivotal events of the '60s (the '68 revolution especially).reitz also seems to have made this mini-series specifically for movie-buffs, given the numerous film references (including a brilliant casablanca quote) and clever in-jokes (one episode is set in venice, whose film festival had an important part in the heimat saga's success). and since 1992, film-lovers have never ceased to thank him for delivering 26 of the most compelling hours ever committed to celluloid.

absolutely, i agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. it's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes german's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.in typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. these episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in germany,preferably in original language!!

seeing this film, or rather set of films, in my early teens irrevocably changed my idea of the possibilities of human interaction and the range of potential experience. this monumental exploration of individuals, and their historical setting, reveals how full bodied and intense every human existence is. the people are portrayed as they are to themselves: their experiences of the smallest to the largest internal and external phenomena are detailed with the greatest of artistry and perception. edgar reitz displays a fabulous appreciation of human motivations and longings.when these phenomena are set against the immense time allowed by the length of the work, one cannot help but apprehend the force and vivacity of happiness, defeat, lust, love, sadness, melancholy, that each person feels. when i saw these films i perceived my future experiences, how my life would inevitably twist and oscillate due to both intended and accidental events. i acquired a feeling of the longevity of being and what it meant to reflect upon past lives, memories and contexts. a masterpiece and a revelation. i only wish the bbc would screen it again.if anyone knows where i can get a copy, could they contact me

this epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to life that i find difficult to explain. to immerse oneself in die zweite heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. the language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. the film inspired me to go to munich and visit some of the locations, including the edgar reitz office. from then on, i vowed to improve my german skills - after die zweite heimat i feel almost german, as if i am in the head of the characters. i also try to match the piano playing of henry arnold (hermann), but this is the one thing that will always elude me ! this drama is unparalleled and i have been fortunate to see it on bbc2 in the uk and sbs in australia. the sequel, heimat 3, is currently being filmed in germany.

this movie includes one of the best characters and dialog that crispin glover has ever played. uma thurman and suzy amis are also great in this movie, but crispin makes it a great depiction of young people trying to make it in new york.

reanhauer (bill roy) is the leader of a desert-dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people, only to have a heart attack himself! he ends up dying on an operating table, and for the sake of revenge, his spirit takes over the body of the title character (jill jacobson), who then proceeds to go about hacking and slashing until her fellow nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demon.while i know enough about the directors' filmography to know that it primarily consists of outright schlock, "nurse sherri" is really not all that bad. sure, it's clear that this was very low-budget stuff, yet all that i found egregiously cheesy about it were the visual effects. the acting is not as bad as one might expect, either.there are two different versions available of this on dvd. a much more sex-oriented version featuring bountiful amounts of t & a is the original cut, with such hilariously silly vignettes as the victim and and her love interest sharing their "strangest sex" moments, including one involving fellatio during a college lecture!the movie would then be re-cut for theatrical version with the horror elements emphasized more strongly. some scenes are dropped with new ones added (with stevens, the role played by j.c. wells, expanded). the movies' most memorable sequence in this cut is a scene in a foundry, and it works quite well. this cut of the movie is more interesting overall; i would recommend that a viewer see them both and compare them.both versions hit their stride in the final third, and benefit from a marvelously scene-stealing performance from bill roy as the crazed reanhauer, and a moody climax set in a graveyard (although actually filmed in adamsons' backyard!). marilyn joi is also worth mentioning as the cute nurse who is attracted to football player turned patient marcus washington (prentiss moulden), who's lost his eyes in a car accident, and who incidentally is key to resolving the story with his knowledge of voodoo rituals. the movie also makes amusing use of music from composer harry lubins' personal collection, including compositions for such tv series as 'one step beyond' and 'the outer limits'."nurse sherri" (known by more alternate titles (including "beyond the living" and "hospital of terror") than any other adamson movie) is actually fairly entertaining low-budget fare. i ended up having a good time watching it.7/10

''meet sherri..for an evening of pleasure and terror!'' cheap special effects,cheesy lines,yep its the original 1978 movie ''nurse sherri'' starting geoffrey land as peter desmond,and jill jacobson as sherri martin and directed by al adamson.the movie is about an evil ancient spirit that possesses a nurse at a hospital,then she starts killing doctors one by one.the acting was okay but some of the acting was robotic.the storyline was good but the sex scenes were just thrown in there probably to get more views.the directing was bad,and the special effects looked like a drawing,the effects didn't fool anybody.the death scenes were pretty good but the director mixed too many things in there that didn't make any sense like the sex scenes,the nudity,the football player,and many more.overall its a good movie,but not the best.7 out of 10

i love just about everything the late al adamson directed in his long and varied career, but "the possession of nurse sherri" stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade-z schlockfests like "horror of the blood monsters" and "dracula vs. frankenstein". this film is actually scary! am i saying that you're going to jump out of your seat when you watch "nurse sherri"? no, of course not. but this pastiche of elements from "the exorcist", "ruby", and "carrie" is one of those nice, eerie little horror movies common to the seventies. you can't put your finger on what's so spooky about it, but the film drips with atmosphere. (and what an ending! don't worry, i won't spoil it for you.) adamson and producer sam sherman really nailed it with this one, and it doesn't matter whether "nurse sherri" was a calculated success or a happy accident. jill jacobson is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader (bill roy, who shines in his brief role). geoffrey land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend. there are some blaxploitative elements here (profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive-in flicks, after all) but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing. "nurse sherri" was a poverty row production, and it shows at times (sets, special effects, etc.). still, the film has heart, mostly decent acting and direction, and some genuine chills. sam sherman also saw fit to use harry lubin's theme music for the late '50s/early '60s television series "one step beyond" in this film, which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere. the dvd contains two significantly different cuts of the movie (the early version features a lot of t&a that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff) as well as the theatrical trailer, the tv spot, and a great commentary by sherman. does anybody know whatever happened to bill roy, by the way? next to john carradine, he's the best actor i've ever seen in an al adamson film, and he plays the cult leader like he means it.

what exactly do people expect when they watch an al adamson film? are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories? you'd think so by some of the reviews. al adamson's films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy, not much more, so if you go into them knowing that already it helps, and they aren't necessarily to be taken at face value, especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value. first off, this starts by ripping off the end theme music from outer limits, so you know things are looking promising. this is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body, the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital. of course nurse sherri tends to his needs and all, and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her. and nurse sherri begins to change. no longer the nice nurse, she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects. there's a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of sherri's co-workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo. this is not bad if you're a cult film fan, but it may be bad if you're a "spiderman" fan because you won't like it. at times this actually lurches towards "respectability" (for adamson, anyway) but then it "unredeems: itself with some ridiculous event. if you enjoy adamson's films and similar trash you may well like this, for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure, keep digging. 7 out of 10.

alter egos do not come funnier than the creation of sacha baron cohen's ali g. completely misled by his delusional and non-existent sense of the middle england suburban surroundings that his social background consists of. he persists on living the style of a los angeles gansta. while still living with his gran in the london suburb of staines, he keeps tight control of his posse, the west staines "massiv".spending his spare time between me julie, his girl, the posse and teaching local eight year old scouts at "keep it real (advanced)" lessons at the government funded john nike leisure centre.this is where the story takes off, being told that the government funding has stopped, ali g then proceeds on a one-man quest "in the struggle for justice i iz willing to lay down me life, just like martin luther van dross did". being his reply to the local media crew when interviewing him on hunger strike while chained to a fence.charles dance here plays david carlton, the sinister and devious deputy prime minster, who is "even more eviller than skeletor". using ali g, unknowingly, to lose the prime minster 18,000 votes three weeks before the general election. seeing ali g as a bumbling idiot, his plan backfires. ali g suddenly becomes an over night sensation and a saviour of the people, working directly with the prime minster. the story becomes more sinister and with hilarious consequences.ali g indahouse is a great british movie that brings the hugely talented attributes of writing, along with dan mazer, executive production and acting of sacha baron cohen. charles dance and michael gambon, as the p.m. play their parts with great seriousness among the gags and hilarity that is ali g.ironically, seeing the parodies playing their parts in a world that really is real, and who are continually preaching "keep it real" from their own little world that is the west staines "massiv" is true comic paradox.directed by mark mylod, his first full length feature film since directing television work such as shameless, shooting stars, the fast show and the smell of reeves and mortimer to name a few.very real and very funny.

this is one of those games where you love it to bits or hate it to shreds.even being a hardcore mario fan can make you dislike this game.you can hate it because it is 2 short and somewhat boring and easy.or you can love it because it is a mixture of amazing graphics(not a nintendo fan huge excitement) music or game play.i know a lot of people that say it is amazing,and others who think its the worst mario ever.it really depends on the type of nintendo fan you are.i personally love this game and i think it is the best wii game,but you should determine that for yourself.so i think you should absolutely get it if you are the right nintendo fan.but if you love the classics too much,you may not like it.so try it out yourself.

if you like his show you might be a little disappointed. this movie has some very funny moments and the laughs are pretty constant but none are very memorable or as funny as the things on the show. the beginning sequence is really really silly and funny, and a great start. yes! borat does make a cameo appearance.if you are a fan then watch it! if you don't know him or don't like him then don't bother. 6.5/10

no real plot, no character development, no scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? the only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as borat. sure, the ending drags a bit, but if borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. sacha baron cohen is possibly the greatest comedian alive, and here he gets more laughs than jude law on a nude beach. i dare you not to laugh.if you can pull the ten-foot pole out of your behind for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character, see this stupid movie. you'll be glad you did. keep it real!

the way i found out about this movie was when i watched american pie 2, at the start it had a trailer for ali g indahouse, i watched the trailer and it just forced me to buy the dvd, it looked incredibly funny! so the next day, i went to my local store and picked it up for ¬£3.99 (bargain!). the film is about ali g, who is a "gangster" of the west staines massive crew, who's rivals are the east staines massive crew. ali has a "cub scout" pack of children where he teaches them how to survive in the "ghetto" by teaching them how to swear and steal cars, after ali finds out the government are stopping the money coming to the leisure centre where ali teaches the kids, he runs for mp for staines and overthrows another mp in his attempts to get rid of the leisure centre to make room for an airport in staines. throughout the film there are laughs aplenty as ali gets up to some crazy stuff! borat makes an appearance for a few seconds in the film too, this is a definite must watch film for all you sacha baron cohen fans out there!

every once in a while a film comes along with characters we all know and love. a film where you see people you know portrayed on screen. it's cinema very at its best.lackawanna blues is that film. set in 1960s upstate new york, the story surrounds a rock- solid woman, who is the foundation for her community. this, based on a true story film, is told from a child she accepted as her own. this child, ruben santiago-hudson wrote the screenplay.*emmy winner, s. epatha merkerson stars as nanny, a woman who has wit, drive and determination for helping others in her boarding home. she does this as she wrestles with infidelity from her young lover, bill crosby, played by the **oscar nominated terrence howard. but make no mistake; see this film for the amazing performance of merkerson, who is brilliant in this role. she encompasses a person we have all known, and perhaps love.lackawanna blues is already on dvd; be sure to pick it up at your local video story today.*merkerson has already won an emmy, golden globe and screen actors guild for this role.**howard has an oscar nomination for his role in hustle & flow.

ever since 1981, nintendo has been making great video games such as super mario and zelda. most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years. games made by nintendo never seem to get boring because they're always adding something new. it went from arcade games to the wii and i hear that there's a new version of the wii scheduled for release in 2011. the thing that makes wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons. and i have more good news. super mario galaxy 2 is to be released in 2010.

(warning: may contain spoilers) let rosalina help mario lead the way and smile because this game will brighten your day. 120 stars will require luck and skill, but 60 will bring you as much of a thrill!blasting through stars show mario and luigi and what travelers they now are! walking upside down has never been more fun, especially a final battle with koopa near the sun! this is truly a super awesome game and it absolutely deserves a place in nintendo's hall of fame!

like some other people wrote, i'm a die-hard mario fan, and i loved this game. this game starts slightly boring, but trust me, it's worth it. as soon as you start, your hooked! the levels are fun and exiting. they will hook you 'till your mind turns to mush. i'm not kidding. this game is also orchestrated, and is beautifully done. to keep this spoiler free, i have to keep my mouth shut about details. but please try this game! it'll be worth it!story: 9.9 action: 10.1 (it's that good!) hardness: 10 attention grabber: 10 average: 10

the mario series is back, and in my opinion, better than ever. galaxy is the most creative mario yet; even more so than super mario 64. the controls are great; some of the best for the wii. beautiful graphical design as well. the levels are very big, and the good old bosses are back. there is tons to explore in this game; definitely a high level of replay value. i only have 2 complaints: 1: the story is a little to similar to mario 64. and 2: the difficulty isn't very high; though it does require some patience. mario fans: the game you've been waiting for. casual gamers: this game is more than worth the buy. 9.8 out of 10.

i saw the messiah:- the first killings and i thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes i have seen, ever. it was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, i cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. jamie draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is jez clifton, the cop. to be able to do that, well, i certainly wouldn't be able to do it, well not without cracking anyway. i really do love and care for jamie draven with all of my heart and i always will, until the end of time, i think that jamie is the sweetest, cutest, sexiest guy in the world. i absolutely love jamie in ultimate force also because he looks god damn sexy in the blacks that he wore. i love jamie love paula draven-x-

messiah was compulsive viewing from start to finish. the story centred on apparently random murders of men in london in various gruesome ways. dci red metcalfe (ken stott)has to find the truth which, to his surprise, is a little closer to home than he might think.gripping drama and ken stott was brilliant. hopefully we have not seen the last of dci red metcalfe.

obviously inspired by se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). great script and acting (i was especially impressed by ken stott and there were no weak points in te cast). good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. one of the best thrillers i've seen since years. although it was scheduled on bbc in three parts i watched messiah on video in one take. one point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.

i saw messiah 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of seven but it`s still compelling . much of my praise has to do with ken stott`s performance as dci red metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . it`d be easy for stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way . likewise the murders are very shocking but - unlike the sequel where the murders are carried out onscreen in a rather ott manner - there`s actually little violence shown .my only criticisms are that the red herring was too obviously a red herring which meant i wasn`t taken in by the shock twist ( and you would probably see the shock twist coming so i won`t bother with a spoiler alert ) and that when the real murderer was revealed it seemed both slightly far fetched and caused a few plot holes to appear in the story . if i remember correctly the sequel had similar problems once the murderer was revealed so maybe it`d be a good idea not to make messiah 3

having read the other comment about this superb piece of tv drama i felt compelled to balance things a little. if you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be british, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. ken stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including edward woodward and art malik. recommended. (in response to the earlier comments, although i accept that 'red' would not 'normally' drive away from a hit and run, he had just witnessed his brother arrested for murder, and i am fairly sure he does not see the boy move.)

*this comment will probably have spoilers!! i checked the spoilers box just in case but it might not have spoilers, but be aware anyways if i say something that you might consider a spoiler and i don't!* wow...best game since super mario 64. i got this game the first day it came out, and before i got it, i went on some gaming websites to look at its ratings (yes, they already reviewed it before it came out), and i was shocked. i was expecting something like sunshine because lately all the mario games have kind of been getting worse and worse. but this one totally beat the other games. the scores on this game even beat halo 3! it's simply amazing.story: not the best, mario games are never known for their plots, and this one isn't really much of a difference. bowser once again kidnaps peach but this time invades the mushroom kingdom on a festival celebrated once every century and gets a flying saucer and it shoots lasers on the ground and then they put anchors inside the ground and rip off the castle and its foundation into outer space.graphics: absolutely gorgeous, the best graphics on wii so far. the water effects are really nice too, if you ever see the water, it looks so real because the effects they put in it.music: simply amazing, the music in this game is orchestrated. not all of it, but even the ones that aren't orchestrated still sound very nice.gameplay: very entertaining, keeps you wanting to play more and more, and for me, since usually i tend to be very frustrated with games if i die a lot, i mean, i'm definitely not the only one, but this game for me didn't have that a lot. now it still kind of did, but not to the point like mario 64 where i totally go crazy and end up turning off the game because it made me mad, this one never did that.difficulty: there are two types of difficulty, because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 stars, which i think is kind of easy, but to beat the game 100%, you have to get 120, like always, and that quest is way harder, but at the same time still very fun.length: good length, definitely not too short. it took me around 15-16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars, but 120 took me more like 45-50 hours. now i didn't play it constantly that much, i played first a lot one day, then the next couple of days just a couple hours each day, then the next two days i played it all day. to me though, i think the quest for 60 stars was a tiny bit short, so if you want a long game, i suggest getting all of them.presentation: now, the cinematic scenes in this movie are superb. the way they are, it just looks so much like something i would see in the theaters. they are hands down the best cinematic scenes on any mario game so far.overall: this game is definitely a great game, and i advise you to not wait until christmas, get it as soon as possible. this game also is a good mixture of old and new, you'll have some sidescroller levels where you move just side to side, or up and down because they'll change on gravity, but even the music has some old classics in it. so this game seems to be like a masterpiece. to me, it's my favorite mario game of all time, but others may disagree. but it's still a great game. i recommend every gamer who wants to have fun in a game to get this.

i have to say when it comes to book to movie adaptations the bbc rarely lets me down. now regarding this mini-series. i love the starling novel, it's by far the best murder/mystery i've ever read. the mini-series, it defiantly made my day when i saw it. the primary story was kept near perfectly intact. the characters match the ones to the novel very well, the personalities and mannerisms were spot on for red and jez. i thought duncan was done very well as was kate, eric came off as too much of a simplistic character, he had a little more depth in the book, but they also altered his sub-story so that may have had to deal with it. of course there are changes, but most are cosmetic, but some i found disappointment in, the sub-story with eric murder charge was changed and that changed the whole dynamic between red and eric for the movie, and they cut out the triathalon training jez was doing. some of the other events in the book are changed to be viewer friendly. over all if you liked the book, you will like this, if you like the mini-series, then you'll love the book. i must say, this is the most accurate book to movie adaptation i've seen.

people who say that some of what the looney tunes cartoons show is inappropriate for children have apparently forgotten something: they weren't originally intended for children. they were produced for the cinema, to be shown before feature films, and so they could show anything that they wanted. "tweety's s.o.s." has that bad puddy tat sylvester finding tweety aboard an ocean liner and boarding the ship to try and get him. but two things work against sylvester: granny is vehemently protecting the canary, and sylvester easily gets seasick (we don't see him throwing up, but with his green face, they make it perfectly clear that he was doing just that!). and then of course, the seemingly cute tweety has a bad-ass streak.it's just great to see how these cartoons weren't afraid to go all out; whatever they thought about showing, they showed. we need to understand that cartoons weren't always supposed to be cute entertainment for children. really funny.

this is one of those tweety and sylvester cartoons that made this legendary pair second only to bugs bunny in terms of looney tunes popularity.besides having all of the stock situations for this duo (sylvester feeding out of garbage cans, the "i tawt i taw a putty tat" line, etc.), tweety's s.o.s also stars granny, who is one of those types of supporting characters that these warner bros. classics had in abundance to enrich the color and flavor of them. this time out the cat and bird are aboard an ocean liner and the gags that are extracted from this situation are creative and lively.what a day that was in cartoon history when friz freleng decided to pair his sylvester with the departed robert clampett's little yellow bird.

before i forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. from garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. if this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the "direction" in here, because it's really good.to the story: sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. while brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots tweety in his cage. tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat. anyway, sylvester runs over, opens the porthole and says, "hello, breakfast!" tweety slams the porthole window on his face and says, "you bad old peeping tomcat!" the cat falls into the water.the undaunted sylvester quickly sneaks back aboard ship, tiptoes into tweety's cabin, grabs him and is ready to leave when - wham! - there's "granny" at the door with her umbrella. sylvester takes a beating as the old lady protects her pet bird once again. but, "flippety gibbet," says granny, "i've dropped my glasses. i can't see a thing without 'em. heavens to betsey, where are those cheaters."now sylvester has the upper hand....and the normal cat-trying-to-catch-bird shenanigans are on again, like granny's glasses. sylvester's most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of tweety on them, so when she woke up and put them on, she'd see the bird and think it was okay.overall, a very entertaining animated short that was a lot of fun to watch. as you can tell by the quotes, i love the dialog in some of these old cartoons.

sit back and let director bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of india. when was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? this movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in india. if you didn't want to visit india before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. this movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. but it has a lot more. thanks, bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale. i loved the ending. we women don't want illusions in life, we want reality. p.s. i was carolyn's friend at the sonoma film festival and met you briefly. good luck with your distribution efforts and i'm talking up the movie a storm.

i just saw this at the philadelphia film festival. it was the most wonderful movie - the best i've seen in quite a while. the enticing character of isa is an open, exploring and (as remarked in the film) love-filled person - guilelessly portrayed by the beautiful camille natta. the accompanying music is soothing and transporting, a balm to the soul.each character seems to be conflicted in some way - and their interactions (w/ conflicts) make for a great story. the tale told by a.k. hangal as the old man was most magically done - i wanted it to go on and on.that hari seemed to remember his "place" throughout added get power to the story - a refreshing change to the bubble-headed plots of many modern writers.all and all, an excellent film. go see.

when his elderly mother emily (jeanne bates) is attacked by her lodger nestor duvalier (brion james) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, tv news reporter clay dwyer (mark thomas miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as flesheating mothers and rabid grannies, mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!), as well as a touching study of the close bond between mother and son: clay's devotion to his mother leads him to abandon all of his other responsibilities, including his job and his relationship with pregnant girlfriend alice (mary beth mcdonough), whilst emily's love for clay ultimately drives her to self-destruction.technically, the film could be sharper, with more stylish direction and better effects (the shots of the creature are kept very brief, so as not to disappoint), and certain more experienced members of the cast frustrate with terribly cheesy performances (yes, brion james and stella stevens, i am referring to you); fortunately, however, the strong emotional undercurrent in the well constructed story is enough on its own to ensure that mom is an effective, compelling, and occasionally shocking tale¬óone which i have no hesitation in recommending to those looking for something a little different.

mom should really be given a different title to distinguish it from all the other movies out there called mom or with the word mom in the title.this is a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that gets churned out time after time and all end up much the same as every other zombie movie out there.it is so different and refreshing it almost defies categorisation.the kind old lady who takes in a creepy lodger, who just happens to be a flesh eater, who then infects the old lady who also turns into a flesh eating zombie, or ghoul, quite which exactly is not defined.there is pathos in the story as her son realises what she has become and while at first horrified, attempts to help her by supplying 'food'. (i shall say no more about that, for fear of inserting a spoiler!) it is one of those 'quiet' movies as opposed to guns blasting, explosions raging, car chases, etc boring etc that makes so many movies all the same rubbish, but still with enough gory moments to satisfy horror fans, whilst also inserting sadness into the story, along with nice touches of humour as opposed to downright silliness of some so-called 'horror' movies.there is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film, where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her christmas tree for company and looks so 'innocent', but, what she becomes!! oh my! a gem of a movie and even if not your thing, should at least be viewed if only once by any true horror fan.

this film was made right in the area where i grew up and now live. i know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film. as a teenager, i worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with ron perlman, jonathon furr, and the car. i am told that jonathon furr and ben allison are are natives of nc. i was fortunate to see it at a local showing. at that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 greyhound) used in the movie. the bus had no reverse gear and during filming, the driver missed his stopping point a few times and had to drive several miles to return to the proper point. those details of the technical issues added to the enjoyment for me. the film accurately depicts life in this area during wwii. a well done film and i anxiously await the dvd availability.

much about this movie was beautiful. the acting, the scenery, and without a doubt, aaron's cinematography background showed through on the beautiful shots. definitely worth watching, as your attention will be captivated the entire time, and it ends on just the right note.the acting by newcomer jonathan furr was superb, as one would think he was a pro acting since he was born. he has gone on to act in other feature films, but this starring role will always be remembered.the film does have that academy award feel to it at times, where it's slow and scenic and quiet, so it's not a movie that a.d.d. kids can sit through. however, the rustic feel of east bend and yadkinville played out well as a 1940's era film.

william faulkner was one of the american writers to win the nobel prize in literature. faulkner mostly wrote about life in the south particularly during the depression years. many of his stories have been adapted to screen. short stories like two soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in december 1941 after the attack on pearl harbor. the older brother, pete greer, goes to memphis, tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. his younger brother doesn't take his departure well. he manages to get a bus ticket to memphis without any money to find his brother. he surprisingly becomes a soldier of another kind since he wants to enlist also at 10 years old. ron perlman does a surprising performance as the military leader who manages to take care and bond with the boy. this short film won an oscar for best short-live action film which is well-deserved. if it was longer, it could compete with the longer films. everything else like costumes, art direction, and recreating the era of america in 1941 is perfect. the film also shows the heartbreaking war at home as most americans were surviving the great depression. the actors and actresses are not known but they do a first rate performances. if hollywood would make more quality films, i would probably go to the cinema more. if broadway had more quality shows, i would go to the theater more.

although this was a film of only less than forty minutes, it is one of best directed and acted stories i have ever seen. it accomplishes in less than 45 minutes what most films cannot in more than 90.it is the story of two brothers, one 18 and the other 10. they come from a poor farm family in mississippi. both are caught up in war and the conflict of duty verses love of family.it brought tears to my eyes especially because the entire film is so well acted and directed, plus it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left behind.i can fully recommend this film as beyond superb !

this oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by william faulkner, takes us back to small-town tennessee in december 1941. two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the south around this time). well, the japanese bomb pearl harbor and the older brother, pete, decides to enlist. he gives his prize egg to his little brother, willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte. well, willie isn't having any of it, if pete can be a soldier so can he. he heads to memphis, showing his stubbornness and determination as he gets the better of several adults along the way. after finding the enlistment center in memphis, he demands to see his brother, pulling a knife on a lieutenant and wounding him in the process. we are shown the devotion and love of a little brother (jonathan furr). he delivers a impeccable performance as a stubborn strong-willed boy in the gentler times of yesteryear. the movie tries and mostly succeeds in showing how brothers can show devotion and the importance of family ties in one's youth. as the two brothers reunite shortly, the movie delivers a cathartic cry as the brotherly love envelops us all.this movie is like a cold bottle of water. maybe dasani or aquafina, good, clear water with a flavorful mineral packet, but not pure natural spring water like evian. still, it quenches your thirst and you don't doubt its purity and quenching effects. it is more run of the mill and less expensive than some, but gets the job done, leaving one refreshed and detoxified afterwards. 7/10

a beautifully photographed and paced short film. it evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after pearl harbor.i appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. great work by a great d.p., david boyd.though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. we understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. i understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does. i understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother in this time of crisis. the kid is tough, and the performance by jonathan furr is superb as is the veteran performance by ron perlman.

two soldiers is an excellent example of fine film-making. the director and producer took a heart-warming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast, excellent cinematography, and very creative artistry.the relaxed back-woods lifestyle of the brothers was depicted with great details, and contrasted sharply with the militaristic lifestyle that they were thrust into. the interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears, as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the back-woods of north carolina and an even harder life of war.the acting was great, particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen (played by jonathan furr), to the older brother (played by ben allison) and the powerful performance by the colonel (played by ron perlman). the performance was extremely well cast.it was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of two soldiers, and i heartily recommend it to audiences of all ages.

oh yes! hollywood does remember how to use the good old formula, and when lightning hits, it's a rather wonderful feeling. rarely hollywood creates a masterpiece because lately, there seems to be more concern with hurrying up and getting the most rewards in a hurried manner, or there is the matter of too many cooks in the mix. usually good screenplays are the result of a talented writer who is in full control of his/her property, understand his material and is a good writer. then, there is a little important part, often neglected by the marketing geniuses that so often lack creativity and vision: a good actor.a good actor can make the difference between a mediocre, half-cooked try, and a fully realized film that might not be an important and relevant movie, but one that contributes to its genre and might eventually become a classic of its type. we get very few romantic comedies, and we are people who are starved for them. buried in the sexy humor of "sex in the city" is the romantic, yet stormy relationship of big and carrie, and people flocked to "mamma mia" because it had some romance, skillfully played by streep and brossnam. it could have a silly musical, but it did touch us because it was played with intensity and conviction. "nights" offers us more of it, with the amazing talents of a woman who does magnificent work in romantic films, ms. diane lane. ever since her days as a child actor, we could appreciate how her talent, combined with her appreciative soul allowed us to see into the hearts of the story's protagonists. a few years back, she teamed up with mr. gere, giving us a tormented, romantic, and sexy performance as the wife who is not too sure of her actions' consequences in "unfaithful", work that should have garnered her at least an academy award. she is back, doing more formidable work in this romantic gem as a woman who has given up on her romantic prospects, and suddenly she realizes there might be another chance around the corner.ms. lane makes this film pulsate with intelligence and passion. her facial expressions communicate volumes about the different emotions her character undergoes. we can read frustrations, yearnings, desperation, anger, hope, loss, and a range that is way out reach for a lot of the marketable types that hollywood constantly push down our throats. here is a mature performer who has the gift to project real emotions and allows us to connect with the material in such a way that we are moved as we become part of the experience.ms. lane is such a triumphant joy to watch as she goes through transformations from the first scenes of the film until the very end. her discoveries become ours as we celebrate with her the power of hope and love. she is able to bring back the unsurpassed joy of a person in love, much like a teenager does, and yet she never lets you think of her character as silly or irresponsible. her eyes are expressive gems that can move even the cynical in the audience. she is one of the stars that can do wonders with just one look. in her the classic feel of those grand movies of yesterday are back. her work recalls the passionate and intelligent work of hepburn, davis, garson, women who played everyday types and made them memorable because they created complete characters.we admire those superb actresses who recreate real life legends and are rewarded for it. half their work is done by the mystique of the figures they impersonate; however as much as anyone might make you think, it is the roles such as lane's in this movie that are a more impressive achievement because they are created from scratch, given a personal imprint and are able achieve heights without any previous theatrical material support, such as plays, and the background of a famous legend whose life is paid tribute on the silver screen. lane's character is one woman whose experiences could be any of us. she represents our dreams and emotions with much quality, class, and just the right amount of sentiment. it is quite a remarkable achievement, and we should be grateful that we are still able to find such a remarkable performance nowadays.there are a few adjectives i could use to pay tribute to her work, but i can only say that in my humble opinion every single frame of her work in this film is testament to one of the greatest performances ever put on celluloid by a living performer. thank you, ms. lane.

dr. paul flanner (richard gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited james franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. adrienne willis (diane lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. they both need to get away. she watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in rodanthe at the same time he books a room. they're all alone together. you can pretty much figure out the rest.this is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film. it's beautifully shot with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes. there's tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an uplifting ending (sort of). the great acting by gere and lane helps disguise the fact that this film isn't really about much. every single bit of the plot is predictable. i rolled my eyes a lot at some of the events. also it's far too short--i didn't believe the romance between gere and lane for a second. if comes out of nowhere and moves very quickly. still the movie does work. the inn itself is absolutely gorgeous and i was in tears by the end along with most of the audience. so it's a predictable but gorgeous movie with some wonderful acting. it doesn't deserve all the criticism it's getting. i give it a 7.

before i talk about the ending of this film i will talk about the plot. some dude named gerald breaks his engagement to kitty and runs off to craven castle in scotland. after several months kitty and her aunt venture off to scottland. arriving at craven castle kitty finds that gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). gerald does not want them to stay but, kitty insist on staying by making excuses. one night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall. it scares her so much that she faints and (another excuse) they must stay longer. kitty becomes more worried about gerald after she tries to go in the maze but gerald catches her and is even meaner to her. kitty then sends for reinforcements, she calls their doctor who is actually their friend and his wide. then to make things not look suspicious they invite a couple other friends(who don't really do anything). blah,blah, blah kitty and her aunt end up in the maze where the most suspense of the story is. they somehow get separated and they try to find each other. but the aunt stumbles upon the creature...here it is the moment we've all been waiting for, what is the creature lurking in the shadows?...it is a giant frog!!! omg what is better than that! after seeing the aunt the frog literally goes crazy and runs, oops i mean hops up the stairs to the top of the castle. the frog then leaps out an open window. we then go on a shot from the ground and see the frog gall towards us (oh yeah this movie was in 3-d). but you want to know what is funny is the frog that falls out the window is actually a toy because it is 1/10 the size of the frog before it takes the leap. it is then revealed that this was all evolutions fault, blah, blah and kitty and gerald get married. then the last shot of this masterpiece is of the grave of the frog in the maze, the only place where he was ever really happy ;).

engaging characters, nice animation, dynamite songs...all this and cute kitties, too. there's a lot of excellent humor, but no real menace, so don't worry about your little ones. the two farm dogs steal the show, even though they only appear in two scenes. the artwork has a linear quality that may put off some people, but i find it charming.

*may contain spoilers*the first time i saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when i was around 8 years old. now i am 17 and still watch it whenever i get a chance to. "the aristocats" was a cute heart warming film that i immediately fell in love with. i loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. in fact i even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since i loved it that much. all three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats i ever saw. the ally cat had a great voice!my favorite part of the movie is when the kittens are playing the piano. that part is adorable. i also enjoy their journey home. it's incredible. this is one of the best disney films i ever saw and one of my favorites. everyone should see it. i give this film 10/10 stars.

this is one of my favorite films, ever. the story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. unlike the other disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 dalmations, peter pan, robin hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. this is funny, creative, and always on target. this movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. however, this is not the best animated film ever made. that title belongs to the brilliant toy story. but this is a respectable second, immediately followed by the lady and the tramp.just see it and enjoy what one of the cinema's greatest achievements. and by the by, i'm not a little kid, this is for the older audiences wanting to recapture their childhood. an absolute must!

i have seen this movie only once, several years ago. but i remember liking it a lot.**spoilers ahead** an old famous opera singer is retired and she decides to give all the money she has to her cats. her butler hears this and plots to get rid of the cats so he can have the fortune. he puts knockout drops in their milk. when they wake up, they find themselves miles away. they must journey back to their house before it is too late. with the help of an independent-minded tomcat and other animal accomplices, while evading the butler and foiling his plan.could have been better, but it also could have been a lot worse.my score: 7/10.

following the release of 'snow white and the seven dwarfs (1937),' walt disney productions has continued to produce quality animated feature-length children's film, many of which i still haven't had the pleasure of seeing. 'the aristocats (1970),' directed by wolfgang reitherman, was the twentieth film in disney's official canon, and is a romantic musical comedy revolving around a family of aristocratic cats living in paris, france in 1910. in the mansion of the elderly madame adelaide bonfamille (voiced by hermione baddeley), her loving feline pets ¬ñ including duchess (eva gabor) and her three young kittens ¬ñ are the most important residents. when the bumbling butler, edgar (roddy maude-roxby), learns that the cats stand to inherit the old lady's entire fortune, he sets about disposing of the pets, dumping them in the countryside far from the big city. lost and confused, duchess and her children strike up an acquaintance with a sweet-talking alley cat, thomas o'malley (phil harris), who agrees to show them the way home.animation-wise, 'the aristocats' isn't anything particularly notable, with much earlier disney films such as 'snow white¬Ö' and 'fantasia (1940),' demonstrating a similar, or even superior, visual style. however, the story is interesting and exciting ¬ñ particularly for younger audiences, i'll wager ¬ñ and the musical numbers {which i wish were more numerous} are terrific. for the sake of trivia, i'll name my two favourite songs as "thomas o'malley cat" and "ev'rybody wants to be a cat," the latter of which is a psychedelic throwback to the late 60s, with a swinging jazz band and delirious flashing colours, led by a trendy feline called the scat cat (scatman crothers). the family's journey back to paris is eventful and adventurous, and we meet such friendly characters as amelia and abigail gabble {two talkative geese}, uncle waldo {the pair's drunken relative}, georges hautecourt {madam bonfamille's ancient but sprightly lawyer} and napoleon and lafayette {two dim-witted hound dogs with a hunger for the butler's rump}.

after seeing the aristocats: special edition in a two pack with the fox in the hound, i decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.the aristocats is a classic, definitely. it might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. it is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious disney classics. the aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and i think it just about succeeds.the storyline doesn't really make much sense and i don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak. the animation and backgrounds are a bit scratchy in places, typical of disney's 70s films, but it does have a rustic, old fashioned charm about it.the aristocats strongest points are the characters, the music and the humour. the music is very memorable - try getting 'everybody wants to be a cat' out your head in a hurry! the songs are written by the sherman brothers, who also did the music for the jungle book. there was one song called 'she never felt alone' that was going to be in the film, but sadly didn't make it into the final feature. it is a shame, because i think it would have fit in very well.the characters are unforgettable. thomas o'malley is voiced by phil harris, and is basically baloo in a feline form. eva gabor gives duchess this warm and maternal feel and the kitten's voices actually sound like children, and not an actor imitating the voice of a child. the secondary characters are here by the dozen and yet you still end up understanding their personalities. edgar, the 'villainous' butler plays a similar role to cruella de vil, but he's more comical than scary, often ending up in funny situations. even though he's the bad guy, he's still lovable all the same.the two british geese - abigail and amelia really had me cracking up, along with their crazy (and drunk) uncle. i also like the dogs, who tend to argue over who is 'the leader.' i could go on, but i won't spoil it. but i can tell you, the aristocats is funny and will entertain everyone without having to resort to rudimentary toilet humour.the bottom line - the aristocats might not be disney's crowning achievement, or even their strongest film from the 70s (that award is a tie between the rescuers and the many adventures of whinnie the pooh). but it is an enjoyable romp and is sure to entertain. if you are looking for a dazzling work of art, you might be better off watching bambi. but if you want a fun night in, the aristocats is the way to go. it is a charming and lovable film and it's impossible to dislike. enjoy! (and besides, it's good to have a film where cats aren't seen as the villains).

duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. how can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of paris? only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat o'malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. after they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse. as always, it's really the voices rather than the animation that are the heart of the disney magic: phil harris is brilliant as o'malley, eva gabor as duchess is... well... eva gabor; but perhaps the most memorable turns are by pat buttram and george lindsay, who turn the old hounds napoleon and lafayette into a couple of bumbling southern-fried rednecks. their scenes with edgar, and the musical numbers with scat cat and his cool-dude band, are classic. most striking about seeing the aristocats now is how deeply disney's style of animation has changed since this was at the cutting edge in 1970. perhaps the nostalgic, dated feel are just a result of being plonked down in belle epoque paris, but the illustrations are fussier (a pity) and the animation and overall pace much less frenetic (sometimes a relief) than in more recent efforts such as aladdin.

when "madame" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. the snobbish butler edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. an adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat o'malley. he helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.the force of this movie is in its humor and music. edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings. one of the best scene contains him being chased by the two dogs lafayette and napoleon. the score is great and like in "the jungle book" you have scenes that is almost "musical" in the sense that the story doesn't progress and the focus is to let the protagonists express themselves via dance. and of course we like, that the score is quite jazzy.and of course it's not only me but also my children who love this one.regards simon

a group of cats look to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy butler.the aristocats is regarded as one of walt disney's finest 2d animations with its charming script and cool characters, but it doesn't quite have the magic that created snow white or the jungle book.the slow opening will have younger viewers raising their eyebrows but once the cats become established into the story does the fun and entertainment begin.the young cats create the most enjoyment with a charming young hearted rivalry, the special kind of bonding any brother or sister of any age can associate with.not the funniest disney picture out there but there are some great comic moments, especially involving the cats and the dogs. the representation of the gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusing.the story, after the boring beginning, is consistently entertaining and exactly what a family film should be. there are hardly any lapses and no dull moments. the journey to find home is interesting and you get a sense of exploring, not to mention two very strange british swans.with disney, you always get a strong meaningful message. with the jungle book it is where you belong, with beauty and the beast you explore the importance of inner beauty. however with this 1970 picture there seems to be something missing. the film has the importance and relevance of home but is not cemented enough; it seems very far fetched and irrelevant.my sister and i found it very strange watching this as some of the central characters were voiced by the jungle book cast.despite the bad beginning and the confusion of its preaching message, this is a consistently fun family film with a good music score and some cool crazy characters that viewers of any age can relate to.

walt disney's 20th animated feature was the last one to be greenlighted by the great man himself (he died in late 1966) and is not generally considered to be among their very best output. the main problem is that, on the surface, the film seems merely to be the feline version of either lady and the tramp (1955) or 101 dalmations (1961) both of which are certainly more beloved by fans even so, being both an animation and cat lover, i dug this reasonably bouncy concoction in which a pampered female cat (voiced by eva gabor) and her three little kittens are thrown out onto the streets of paris by a wealthy lady (hermione baddeley)'s greedy butler. luckily, they meet a streetwise alley cat (phil harris) who guides them on the journey back and are further aided along the way by a feline jazz band (led by scatman crothers) and two helpful and amiably dopey dogs; meanwhile at home, edgar the butler celebrates his supposed inheritance and the mouse and the horse do their bit to help their fellow feline pets. legendary entertainer maurice chevalier was whisked back from retirement to sing the title song (which includes a verse in french) and scatman's band indulge in a breezy number "ev'rybody wants to be a cat".

the aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on imdb. the songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the jungle book, but they weren't bad at all. the animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of paris in general. it looked beautiful. this is probably disney's most relaxing animation i think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? another great piece of animation was o' malley looking into duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.(a good thing)the plot(about a greedy butler and a fortune, reminds me of bailey's billions) was a little unoriginal, but worked very well, and the script was really funny, especially the fights between the kittens. they remind me of me and my brother and 3 sisters, always fighting. my favourite scene was the chase of edgar with the two dogs, who were always fighting about who was the leader. the voice talents were a delight, most notably phil harris, whom i recognised from the jungle book, and eva gabor, from the rescuers. the supporting characters, namely scat cat, were also well done. in conclusion, a really pleasant film, that is definitely underrated. 8.5/10 bethany cox

"the aristocats" is classic disney at it's best. it's not considered as the ultimate disney classic along side the more well-known disney-films, but it's a well-made and fun film that certainly deserves to be a disney classic. "aristocats" is certainly a sure kids-pleaser, cause it has all the components for a fun kids film. i'll liked it very much as a kid. i'm not sure if this film is a sure pleaser to the adults, who could watch disney classics for the nostalgia sake, but i still enjoy this film as an young adult.storywise, "aristocats" may not be so complex or innovative, but it doesn't matter. this film was made on that period where the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were the story and wise versa, which "aristocats" certainly shows. the characters make the film; they're all likable, fun, have great lines and have a great interaction with each other. the voice actors are also a part for making the characters so compelling (eva gabor as duchess, phil harris as thomas o'malley and etc). a misconception could have been the dogs napoleon and lafayette, since they're showstoppers and haven't so much to do with the actual story, but fortunately they're fun and amusing characters and the scenes with them are pure gold."aristocats" is both entertaining and cute, but it's also a very funny cartoon. the animation style and look fits perfectly for the film's french surroundings (especially the city of paris looks greats). the character animation and design is great. and the songs are really catchy too. my favorite is "scale and arpeggios", but the title song is a cute song, along with "thomas o'malley cat" and the memorable show-stopper "everybody want's to be a cat". and the score by george burns is a perfect fit for the film funny and emotional situations.overall, "aristocats" is in my opinion the best disney cartoon from the 70's and it's a film that deserves to both be seen and remembered. so what you're waiting for? do your self a favor and share this disney classic with your kids. it deserves to be in their memories.

i'm not a massive disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. we first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! ok, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.great characters, phil harris stealing the show as thomas o'malley, but edgar the butler not far behind. the music is superb - my disabled son always insists that i lift him up and dance with him to "everybody wants to be cat" this says it all. and "thomas o'malley" is just as enjoyable.i'm not sure why some people have such a downer on this film other than a dislike of cats! and yes, it does take a few of its cues from "101 dalmations", and maybe "the lady and the tramp" (it's been a long time since i've seen that, so i'm not going to compare them), and while "101 dalmations" is better in some ways, for me "the aristocats" is far more enjoyable. isn't that what these films are about? apart from "peter pan" (now that is a 10/10 film), this is my favourite disney film. my 7 year-old son loves it, his grumpy 41 year old dad loves it, so you can't ask much more of a family film.superb!

oh my gosh!! i love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is so incredible......i loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult. it is my favorite disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! you should watch it, watch it and love it. my friends and i watch it a ton.....it is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. i recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart. my favorite part is the song and dance number with all of the strays and thomas o'malley. the writers/producers/director completely nailed this one.....yeah, nailed it to the wall.xoxo~wolly~xoxo

plot in a nutshell - duchess (voice of eva gabor) is the well polished single mother cat of three little kittens. when their owner, the wealthy elderly woman known as madame adelaide, realizes that her time is running out she decides to write up her will, leaving everything she has to her cats, which will then go to her butler edgar when the cats pass on. edgar overhears this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would get everything before him, and plots to destroy duchess and her kittens; he drops sleeping pills in their supper one night and then leaves them stranded in the french countryside. out of their element, duchess and her kittens befriend a street smart stray cat known as thomas o'malley (voice of phil harris who did the voice of the big bear balloo in the jungle book); after making a pass at duchess, unaware that she is a single mother, o'malley decides to escort them back home, with duchess genuinely falling for o'malley as the usual codependent surrogate family bond develops; chaos and mayhem ensues, culminating in a violent clash between o'malley, his brother cats from the streets and edgar. also features appearances by british geese, american southern hound dogs (what they were doing in france is anyone's guess), a mouse who sounds a lot like the rabbit from "alice in wonderland" (he was in fact voiced by the same guy who voiced winnie the pooh) and a horse. sometimes slow paced but still enjoyable disney venture. features the memorable "everybody wants to be a cat" musical piece sung by the late scatman crothers (better known to 1980s fans as the voice of jazz on transformers). of course, if this was being made now, it would probably be a dark social commentary on class division represented by the divide between well bred & well fed duchess and the street born o'malley.

duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in paris. when the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. so he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. when the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. a street wise cat named thomas o'malley meets up with them and offers to help them. when edgar sees them arriving home, he is furious, and starts to mail them to timbucktu. but thomas' friends arrive to help save the day. the wealthy lady decides to leave her home for every alley cat in paris.this is a charming film. the songs, including "everybody wants to be a cat", are lively and upbeat. the voice cast is excellent, with eva gabor(who would later play miss bianca in disney's the rescuers films) as duchess, phil harris(baloo in the jungle book, little john in robin hood) as thomas, giving interesting personalities to their characters. supposedly walt disney, before he died in 1966, gave the go-ahead to this film. recommended for disney fans or cat lovers everywhere! 10/10.

this movie is great i really enjoyed it.this movie is about a cat mom named dutchess and her 3 kittens.t dutchess and the kittens love music.they have to practice the piano everyday.but the butler named edgar tries to kidnap dutchess and her kittens he tries to make them sleep. but he fails. them dutchess meets a cat named thomas o maily. thomas falls in love with dutchess. the cats break into song. with the song everybody wants to be a cat. thomas gets to love music like the other cats. thomas and dutchess really like each other.i loved this movie and i like the cats to!

this is one of my favourite disney films. it has everything you could hope for in a disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. the story begins in paris, where aristocat duchess and her three kittens live with their mistress in a mansion. life is perfect for them until the mistress' fiendish butler edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. he realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way. an excellent, often forgotten masterpiece from the 1970's - a time when the disney studio made few animations - which features songs such as the title number "the aristocats" as well as "ev'rybody wants to be a cat", this will enchant viewers young and old with its enduring jazziness.

there are a select few cartoon films where animals or something "not human" is portraying human beings and i think that this film is one of them. apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. although - it's good someone did not - i feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)this film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a disney film. it mentions alcohol*, shows a dog teaching another dog how to attack "tresspassing" humans and it shows a male cat called (abraham delacy gieuseppe casi thomas) o' malley, fancying a female cat, in a surprisingly human and adult way.as a cartoon film - or just a film in general, i feel this is pretty good quality - the storyline and characters are especially good. the film (in general) is set in france and you meet a family of cats - the mother duchess and her kittens marie, toulouse and berlioz. you also meet the kind (rich) old woman who adores the cats, the butler edgar and an old man (who has clearly lost his marbles) called george. the kind old woman discusses her will with george and edgar overhears that what he receives from the will he will have after the cats have it. he is incredibly cross with this - and has an evil scheme in mind...a very cute film for every age - enjoy "aristocats"!*not including "basil the great mouse detective" and a few others maybe which i cannot think of at the moment.

i must say one big reason why i thought the aristocats was so great is because i love cats!!!!i love cats,which probably gave this film a big score from me,but not only that,it was definitely a good movie as well,and i love where they make the setting of the film take place.this is one of my favorite animal films,although it's animated,and i really love how the actors\actresses didn't sound so unprofessional behind the animals' voice's.to me this film seems like a classic,but i guess to imdb it's not,because it has,yes i think too low of a rating.you take a peek at all the other "original" disney films and they have a much higher rating than this,but nonetheless aristocats is one of the best animation movies there is and i could enjoy it over and over again!!

the aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. there is nothing wrong with it at all. it's my favorite of the disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. like beauty and the beast, snow white, and peter pan. the reason why the aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. i hate to say this, but i don't blame edgar for what he does. i probably would've had them taken care of too. i'd be devastated of some old bag who i'd been working with for so many years just decides to give her will to the cats. i'd of killed them also. i don't even like cats, so i wouldn't give a damn. i think that the aristorcats is so funny and cute. there are many characters that are hilarious, like edgar. the aristorcats is my favorite of the disney classics, and that's final. the cat's out of the bag.the aristorcats: ****/****

as the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, i adore aristocats. it is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the "best" kids movies these days. the story line is sweet and interesting. the music is great. the love story is quite romantic. the kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. the action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. the characters are quite well-cast as well. i love listening to eva gabor's velvety voice, and there are so many others that are familiar from childhood and also fit the characters so well. it's really a movie about love, tolerance, good manners, and faithfulness. who doesn't want their kids exposed to these values? it is a movie that i don't mind watching over and over, unlike happy feet where i couldn't watch the whole thing even once because it was so irritating. i wish production companies would move toward making movies more like this one.

the first disney animated film without the strong involvement of disney himself, this film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting (this is, i believe, the only animated disney film since the 1940's which is not based on an earlier book or other work, but is rather an original story). as others have noted, the plot is essentially a cross between the romance in lady and the tramp and the kidnapping/journey home story in 101 dalmatians.but to overcome this flaw, the filmmakers have successfully used many of the better features of most of the disney animated films of the previous 10-15 years: phil harris (from the jungle book) voicing one of the main characters, follows his duet with louis prima in the previous film with another here with scatman crothers. the quality visual look of this film is virtually carried over from "dalmatians" (with some nice nods to french impressionism, it appears), and the villain here (the butler) is strongly reminiscent of the henchmen in that film as well. (this is probably one of disney's least memorable villains.) the main story goes back and forth between the cats, and the butler's ongoing difficulties with two rural hound dogs (with great voice work by pat buttram and george "goober" lindsey"). the various animal characters are similarly familiar to those who have seen "tramp" and "dalmatians." the cats' owner, while bearing a striking visual resemblance to the wicked stepmother in sleeping beauty, bears none of that character's nasty traits and comes across as very warm and generous.the real strength of the film is the voice work; after first going toward the use of mostly familiar actors in the jungle book, the tactic is continued strongly here with disney veterans harris and sterling holloway from the jungle book, and eva gabor (who would do a very similar character in the later film the rescuers), as well as crothers and nancy kulp. all are excellent here, particularly harris and gabor in the leads. the character animation is as excellent as one would expect, showing a variety of emotions well.smaller children may be upset by a few brief episodes (an escape from the path of a speeding train, a near-drowning by one of the children), but these are not presented in a particularly frightening or dark manner and are over very quickly. overall, there's very little of the type of more frightening scenes found in many other disney classics.one minor oddity is the way some visual aspects of 60's culture are depicted among the jazz-performing cats in supposedly 1910 paris; one can't help but wonder why the story wasn't set solidly in the present, other than the great deal paris had changed much of its appearance in the intervening time. it really would have made more sense that way.the songs, while being pleasant and sometimes very enjoyably performed, are not particularly memorable. nonetheless, the general energy applied here, the excellent voice work and fine animation all contribute to overcome the relatively few and minor weaknesses. far from the greatness of classic "10"s such as pinocchio or aladdin, and not quite up to the "9"s one might give to sleeping beauty or 101 dalmatians, this is probably a rather marginal 8 of 10; perhaps a 7.

i'll make this brief. this was a joy to watch. it may or may not have been more effective if the characters had resembled their real life counterparts, but aside from this minor observation i found the fantasy animal characters to be most enjoyable. the visuals were most stunning except for the second-rate cg scenes, which could have been left out. i dislike computer generated animation anyways, it defeats the purpose of a biopic such as this one. watch it, you will appreciate it too!

all the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. norman the viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill max with some insane cackling. the writing is the best. i was glued to the set when this would come on when i was younger. if they came out with a dvd of all the episodes they made i would be forced to buy it. this and a conan the barbarian cartoon are the ones i miss the most from childhood. i think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons. i used to watch these cartoons on channel 13 in the los angeles area. i remember the owl was always afraid, warning max that he was in trouble and that he was the chosen one. max didn't believe that he was the chosen one and always gave the owl trouble. norman was less talkative but his simplicity was funny. he would say things like "i eat monsters for breakfast" when he was battling them. and then when he was battling zombies he would say "i eat zombies for...nevermind." classic cartoon comedy and action.i vote that they re-air mighty max.

a surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as batman:tas and its ilk, i enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from tim curry, richard moll, tony jay, and maurice lamarche in various roles. the only qualm i had was rob paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending. some people say it was a cop-out, but i found it refreshing compared to many series that just leave things hanging. hopefully one day they put this series out on dvd, unfortunately it came out at a time when dvd's weren't yet prevalent and the cartoon probably only served to sell a particular type of toy, which i never found appealing despite the entertaining cartoon.

the title of my summary pretty much covers my review. this is to me what teenage mutant ninja turtles was to someone 5 years older. while i missed out on that little pop-culture wave, i embraced the toy line and t.v. series that was mighty max with both arms.you wanna know how into this i was? i went as mighty max for halloween.thank god for the internet. thanks to demonoid, last week i was able to watch this great show from my childhood for the first time in over a decade.i'm watching this right now, having just been blown away by recognizing rob paulson of animaniacs, and am also loving the celebrity humor in "tar wars". 4 minutes in, and they have already mentioned, by name: clint eastwood, governor arnold, dustin hoffman, john wayne, and ace ventura. hells yeah. damn, it is only upon writing this that i realize there is no way in hell i can give this series anything less than a perfect score. any imperfections have been lost in the fog of time. this is my childhood. this is awesomeness. this is the mighty one.

wow. this movie is the voice of a climbing generation. director sam keith takes us to the darkest depths of man's soul where we find love, life, and top-roping. world-weary telly (leo fitzpatrick) follows his heart and his anchors through a cerebral journey to find sanity in a post-apocalyptic colorado. instead, telly meets confrontation in don (jason bortz), the embodiment of machismo and a zeitgeist of humanities foibles. the epic film comes to a climbax at a gut-wrenching top-roping competition that will make even the strongest willed viewers squeamish at the dizzying heights.this movie has it all: top-roping outside, top-roping in the gym, cut-off shorts and sleeveless flannel shirts, awesome climbing footage (some so good, you see it 2 or 3 times!), bear and snake attacks.i gave the movie 8 out of 10 because i wanted to see the romance develop a bit more. it seemed as if the film was leading up to a spicy, top-roped sex scene between telly and his new lover, but alas, it wouldn't fit into the already jam-packed hour and a half thrill ride.fans of cliffhanger and mission impossible ii will find this flick to be a diamond in the rough. overall, if you are ready to challenge your world view on humanity and climbing, this is the film for you!!!1

my friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. the only good that came from it was this movie, "take it to limit" right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. the music is probably done by rural white boys from colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. the star of the show, actor leo fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie. this movie is based on climbing, and i'm not a climber, yet even i think it's hilarious when they have the climber struggling to climb and there's a guy in the background who is basically walking up the 'cliff'. you don't want to miss this movie, you'll get to see the same clips over and over again. you'll get surprises at every turn. you'll find yourself quoting the unforgettable lines. i highly recommend this movie to anyone. take it snow. disclaimer: this movie is poorly done, but that is what makes it great

wow. we watched this film in the hopes that it would have at least some decent rock climbing scenes. we were disappointed there, but it was still a great movie! it was soooo cheesy it was great! i haven't laughed so hard at a movie in a long time. if you are into rock climbing, and you enjoy cheesy movies, then this one is absolutely for you!

sadly, this movie is relegated to 'curio' status it seems. many people that i've asked "did you know the monkees made a movie?" usually answer 'no.' that being said, if you are one of that large number, i recommend you see it, but with the following caveat(s): if you expect monkey style humor, it is in there. it's just not all over the place like the tv shows.yes, they are trying to break their tv mold a bit by poking fun at it like a bunch of no-longer-teenagers who have been on the short end of a lot of sticks.no, you don't have to be inebriated to enjoy it.no, you don't have to be inebriated to understand it.if you like classics, you'll love the interspersed clips throughout.if you like the psychedelic era, you'll love some of the cameos.if you are a monkees fan, you might recognize some of the jabs they are taking at the heavy commercializing of the band.in the nigh-immortal words of one of my best friends after seeing 5 minutes of it: "this is a weird movie, man." in fact it might be better if you don't try to understand it, just sit back and react to it. it's weird, it's funny, it's a bit surreal, it's experimental (still)...it is many things. overall, it is an experience.

to experience head you really need to understand where the monkees were when they filmed it.this was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. their inventive and comedic series (sort of an american idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.this is their take on their "manufactured image" and status as the 2nd tier beatles. they always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.it is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (i have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.see it with an open mind.

i can't believe this isn't a huge cult hit. perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the monkees as a silly factory-made pop band rip-off of the beatles, refused to see it. that cynicism probably covered it from sight ever since. don't make this mistake. _head_ is an amazing film that most open minded people will appreciate. it is very funny and very intelligent (and very trippy).

the cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. starting with both "breathless" and underground american cinema (such as kenneth anger), films became more and more experimental. all of this accumulated when hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with "easy rider". one of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially. "head" was made when the monkees career was seriously waning, which is what damned one of the best psychedelic films ever made.the plot? well, there really isn't one, as many have said. it involves the monkees going from one surreal scenario to the next one. however, these sequences are all obviously lsd-tinged and basically mock how the monkees were sick of being confined to their light pre-fab reputation. its a shame that the film found no audience. the teeny boppers who loved them had moved onto a new fad as they always do. the psychedelic / haight-ashbury crowd to whom the film was garnered would never be caught dead at a monkees movie. its all their loss. this film may be plot less, but it is certainly not without meaning and is very intelligently put together. the crew later made both "easy rider" and "five easy pieces". the film was later revived at a 1973 raybert retrospective and it gained a very positive response, which granted it the cult following it had deserved for a long time. ironically, the monkees would fall victim to the same commercialism they protested in this film with their later 80s reunion. (10/10)

this all-but-ignored masterpiece is about the monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie (head), and that everything they do or say had already been written in an (unseen) script they seem to be following. head was written by jack nicholson, rafelson, and peter tork during a three-day lsd trip in a suite at an expensive hollywood hotel. the other three monkees only acted in it.they fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script. they deliberately flub their lines, walk off sets, tear up scenery, punch other actors for no reason; and ultimately, commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. for instance, in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene, if you watch frame-by-frame, you can see rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman, very deliberately shooting into a mirror. he is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the director yells "cut!"the monkees, however, never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are. that ends up being the core of the revelation soon to come.at every turn, they realize their increasingly-bizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they can't escape being in. you say they went crazy and walked through the sky (which turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the set's background)? no problem! hey, hey, they're the monkees, and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around! in the end, even their deaths did not set them free. that was how the movie was supposed to end, and their motionless, waterlogged bodies are fished out of the river, put in another box, and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio production.this is made all the more poignant by the fact that the monkees really are fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world. they did it through the power of their music.ironically, near the end, peter tork has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem, but unfortunately, no one listens. peter realizes: "it doesn't matter if we're in the box (the film)". he means that it doesn't matter if will is free or illusory, and that "the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur... you need to just let 'now' happen, as it happens", without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is "valid" by some abstract definition.when you can't even tell the difference, will being free or not doesn't matter--tying to figure out if you are the "real" you is just a pointless waste of time.i saw this film at a very important time in my life. i was trying to figure out how to escape being just "that geeky, creepy nerd girl" by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun (i.e., sex) like everyone else did. but the revelation in head broke my self-imposed recursive trap and helped me more than rafelson or nicholson or tork will ever know.for decades, i've watched "head" and wished i could thank pete.was this a good movie?uhh, how about, like...==< yes >==

forget easy rider - head is the film about the 1960s.almost laugh: as the monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute tv commercial about dandruff! see: the 50 foot victor mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film! hear: frank zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell davey jones "your music is awfully white"! experience: the monkees' only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (circle sky)! listen: as davey jones sings a harry nielsen song about having a transsexual father! be confused: be very confused, as confused as terri garr is when mickey dolenz makes sexual innuendos about her in her film debut! witness: futile protests against the vietnam war leap out of nowhere and just as quickly disappear! watch: mike nesmith spit on christmas while wearing a velvet victorian smoking jacket in a cobwebbed gothic horror-movie sound-stage! let yourself drift: into the karmic bliss inspired by a comic-book version of indian mysticism delivered by a hammy white character-actor in black-face, while peter tork pretends that he knows how to play a guitar! discover: academy award winning director bob rafelson's first feature length film, as written by academy award winning actor jack nicholson! pretend it's not happening: when the monkees commit group suicide by jumping off the golden gate bridge! take drugs - take a lot of drugs: take as many drugs as the cast and crew evidently did while making this film!with head, the monkees revealed themselves as the angriest, snottiest entertainers in hollywood history, bar none. it is bewildering to discover that they blamed the failure of this film on bad promo. to be sure, the promotion was virtually non-existent; but did they not recognize how angry, how down-right depressing, how self-destructive this film actually is?! i mean, this film is a trip - on bad acid - to the suicide ward of a mental hospital. the only film i know to be this depressing is terry gilliam's brazil; and like brazil, this film reveals why life in the later 20th century was almost unbearable - if you were lucky. it's not simply that western culture was suffering from serious information-overload, but the information itself was just bad, bad, more bad, and dismal. in fact, it was the overload effect itself that kept people going, since this allowed people to keep distracting themselves with one crisis or another - if news from vietnam became too much to bear, they could turn the channel and watch a documentary on the rising unemployment rate.the "positive" response to the reality revealed in head was woodstock - three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and bugs and bad food and dirty drink and poop and pee and bad acid and peter townsend almost killing abbie hoffman. all taking place behind a steel fence, under the lovingly watchful eyes of a veritable army of ny state troopers - meaning that the "freedom" of woodstock nation was as illusory as the song john sebastion thought he was singing while so strung out he could barely speak. "500,000 assholes too stupid to come in out of the rain," was one critic's judgment on woodstock (i think it was andy warhol). the one good thing occurring there was jimi hendrix's star spangled banner. two years previously, the jimi hendrix experience had gone on their first national tour of america, as the warm-up band opening for - the monkees. see, it's all connected somehow.you owe it to yourself - nay, you owe it to your unborn children - to see the real 1960s, only to be found on film in this bizarre, miraculous, and utterly absurd tribute to one of the more interesting capitalist scams of the later 20th century.

the beatles had just done 'magical mystery tour.' there was the general feel that performance, peace and drugs went together naturally. in la, there was a film subculture that knew something was up. nicholson was in several of these gangs.before he decided to seriously become an actor, before 'easy rider,' before 'pink flamingos,' before 'day for night,' there were several experiments with what to do about this. an important one is 'saragossa manuscript.' this is another.jack writes. he plays with circular narrative, self-reference, film reference, performance self-loathing, the pain of creation, all on the outskirts of safe kiddiepop. you must see this, if only to know something about jack.certain actors act by digging into themselves. it is a common technique. some dig deep, but after a while, they become boring because they are incredibly shallow people. there isn't just enough stuff in there to sustain a career. think of deniro and hackman.others are pretty interesting people, who seem to become more interesting over time. when they dig into the barrel, they put stuff back in because of the pain of the digging. think sean penn and jack. at the bottom of jack's barrel, at the end of the thread he spins, as the base of every character is this experimental, risky writer/filmmaker.who cares if it is a bad movie? it is bad because it took risks. watch when a tear is wiped from annette's cheek by the director. it is a loving goof on the whole brando thing, something that i heard marlon laughed about. that is one of the richest moments in hollywood film history.there's another reason to watch this. music in film is has a strong root in dance. revolution in film often relies on music. whole cultures are thus swept along.an unsung giantess in inventing how billions now dance is toni basil. she was as influential in pop choreography as the beatles were in music. she was already well into her career when called upon to work on this. but this is one of her earliest screen appearances. you can see her work throughout and she herself in the pretty cool 'daddy's girl' segment, over one of nilsson's better songs. (followed by the frank zappa cameo.) mccartney would reference this scene in his teevee special years later.a third reason to watch is early (about 6 1/2 minutes) in the film: a character named 'lady pleasure' kisses each monkey in a long continuous shot and then dismissively departs. she is credited as i. j. jefferson but is really mimi manchu, nicholson's lover at the time and lsd partner. red hair, psychedelic demeanor. lovely. that scene says it all for me, about how jack feels about the boys.ted's evaluation -- 3 of 3: worth watching.

i will admit, i had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, i felt like many did. i was expecting a monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead i was given... well, i didn't know what i was given to be honest.however, after finally watching this film, i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, i also found myself watching it over and over again. it's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as i try to attempt to decipher it's meanings. and just when i think i've figured out something in the film, it's answer is destroyed once i watch the film again. brilliance indeed.it seems that most people who disliked this film are wanting to watch a film with primarily a clear plot. they want everything explained and all questions answered in the finale. well sorry, if that's what you're wanting, this is not the movie for you. but if you liked movies like the matrix (and better yet, their sequels) i think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.think of the film being like a dream. in our dreams, things make no sense, things we expect to happen don't, people places and things don't speak, act or function in the same way they do in reality. to complain about "head" is like complaining about a dream you've had that you felt you could not understand. the mind is a complex system, and being that a film titled "head" is just as complex, is it that difficult to relate the two?the music (and musical numbers) really stand out, especially peter tork's two compositions, which remain the best tracks in the film, "can you dig it?" and "long title: do i have to do this all over again?"this film proves that the monkees were much more than just four zanny guys in a 'pre-fab' group (as their critics called them) on a television show, but that they are actually much more intelligent and talented than the world would give them credit for. there's so many messages that can be derived from the film, both in regards to the monkees and to the 'entertainment industry' in general, that it stands as a masterpiece of film-making that was far ahead of it's time.i feel, had this film been released as an independent piece at this point and time, it would actually garner the respect and admiration it deserves.and one finale note:one could compare this to the beatles "magical mystery tour" film, since the beatles film appeared to be just as strange and bizarre. however, in my opinion, "head" stands far above anything the beatles put on celluloid.

you would really need to remember the monkees and have a clear understanding as to where and how they fitted into the second half of the 1960s in order to fully appreciate this movie.there is no plot as such. basically, it's a crazy, mixed up pastiche of various, unrelated sequences. but, it is interesting and entertaining in its own peculiar way once you get onto its wavelength. in short, it was a classic, cleverly conceived and well crafted example of late '60s experimental cinema. it contains some good songs, some ultra-groovy cinematography and plenty of other worthwhile ideas in terms of film technique.i give it 7 out of 10 for several reasons. first, it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox movie in the commercial mainstream where both its stars and its producers were firmly ensconced at the time. if a feature movie flops at the box office, the consequences can be dire for all concerned. secondly, it was, for the most part, a creative success. and, finally, as already mentioned, it is, unquestionably, a classic of the genre and, as such, it is now historically important.unfortunately, "head" came too late in the monkees career. but, there again, they would not have been allowed to make it earlier on because it was essentially a very pointed and cynical satire of their own image. clearly, the members of the group knew, only too well, that the whole monkees juggernaut had just about run its race when they started work on this project. in a way, it was to be their swan song and they were determined to let it all hang out. they were tired of being treated like mere pawns in the high powered corporate game in which they had been manipulated and exploited over the preceding few years. in short, they "wanted out" and they were going to say a few things before they left.history, however, has vindicated the band. let the critics be damned. the monkees, left behind some of the best, most polished and successful pop records of the decade. yes, they had plenty of help. but at the end of the day, they stood in front of the studio mikes, they fronted the movie and tv cameras and they did the concerts. they were fun and just a little bit crazy. but, unlike some of their contemporaries, they were never threatening. you could safely introduce a monkey to your elderly aunt."head" probably borrows a bit too heavily from the beatles "hard day's night" but it's still worth another look for those who were around at the time or for younger retrophiles who have the ability to appreciate its significance.enjoy!

"i am ... proud of 'head'," mike nesmith has said. he should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.yes, it's unconventional. to many, frustrating. it's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: "you figure it out."you probably already know that the monkees tv show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. tv shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain. that the monkees broke out of the box for a short time to make "head" is a testament to the group's popularity and importance in pop culture, despite where your head's at. get one thing straight: "head" is not the monkees tv show.so what we have here is a "psychedelic documentary" about western pop culture from a source that has authority on the subject. "head" is a movie that could only come from those "inside the box". by 1968, the monkees' cast and crew were seasoned and weary professionals who had seen their share of promise and disappointment. the movie was a deliberate attempt at market repositioning. so, it did three things: make a film the way the monkees envisioned. most importantly, reinvent the group to one not subservient to it's old bosses - and yas, hipper than before. make a film that exposed american attitudes of information dissemination."head", therefore, really is about media manipulation and its net result: deception. the mass media is supposed to inform, educate us on the happenings in the world at large, and ultimately asks us to form opinions of these events that can shape thought into positive action. thus we assume the information we absorb to be complete and unbiased - otherwise, how can one establish a valued conclusion on any one idea presented by a book, newspaper or tv show? in one of the street interviews in "head", a guy admits, "i haven't looked at a newspaper or tv in years." is he lesser or better the man? even the drug parallels are a soft veiling of "things are not as they seem." remember the old joke, "everything you know is wrong"? the screenplay starts with the monkees' public admission of it's own "manufactured image" and runs with the football - literally. is the football scene in the movie a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind "head"? is the film a stream-of-consciousness exercise? is the film the culmination of pot smoking marathons? there are too many coincidences that occur in the film that suggest otherwise. my guess is that "head" is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intended and unintended.largely, the insiders responsible for "head" seem to enjoy themselves in the revelries that take place in the film, but there is anger - anger at the chaos that characterized the late '60s and anger at the way the media, television especially, had changed culture in negative ways. drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late '60s and still are, but the producers of "head" want you to know that poor "information" is a far greater danger.wars have been attributed to hoaxes and lies. what perfect way to spread disinformation than through tv? repeatedly, the mysterious black box is seen as an obstacle to the monkees and seemingly, all of us as well. in one scene, peter is sullenly sitting in a saloon holding a melting ice cream cone, and is asked by a fellow monkey, "what's wrong?" "i bought this ice cream cone and i don't want it." the movie suggests that the first purpose of the media is not to inform, but to sell en mass blindly. "head" goes further: put any idea into someone's head, and merrily goes he.the filmmakers know this, and the danger is real. "head" is either a movie that creates itself "as we go along", or is a deliberate statement. perhaps, perhaps not. maybe it is just "pot meets advertising", as critics scathed in 1968. the jokes are on the monkees and us. be careful what you ask for, you may get it.cheers: a true guilty pleasure. very funny. intelligent. will please the fans. find the substance, it's there. unabashedly weird. bizarre collection of characters. good tunage. length is appropriate. lots of great one liners, including my all time prophetic favorite: "the tragedy of your times, my young friends, is that you may get exactly what you want."caveats: dated. drugs. no plot. no linear delivery of any thought in particular. at least twenty-five stories that interweave in stop-and- go fashion. so, may easily frustrate. may seem pretentious to some. people who can't stand the monkees need not watch, though that in itself is no reason to avoid it. the psychedelic special effects may kill your ailing picture tube or your acid burnt- out eyeballs.match, cut.

"head" is one of those films you'll have a lot of trouble convincing your friends to see, but once they do they'll fall in love with it. i don't know how many times this has happened to me. this film is just so funny and bizarre, really a deconstruction of everything the monkees had been up to this point in their career. a lot the credit goes to bob rafelson who pretty much ended the monkee's career with this film. my guess is he wanted to get out of directing the tv show and get into features, which he did in a big way after this one. micky dolenz is absolutely hilarious. i can't believe he didn't have a second life as a comic actor after this film. this film has a lot of great cameos and a lot of wonderful psychedelic nonsense. i feel like the reputation of this film is continuing to build and it wouldn't surprise me if it eventually becomes a full on cult classic

this is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. my wife has never seen it, and when i just rewatched it last night, i waited until after she went to bed. she might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but i know she would have had enough within ten minutes.head has nothing like a conventional story. the film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. it could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres. if you're not a big fan of those things--psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernism and the "acid trip aesthetic" (assuming there's a difference between them), you should probably stay away from this film. on the other hand if you are a fan of that stuff, you need to run out and buy head now if you haven't already.oddly, the film has never received much respect. that probably has a lot to do with preconceptions. after all, it does star the monkees--micky dolenz, davy jones, michael nesmith and peter tork--and the monkees were a musical group of actors put together by producers bob rafelson and bert schneider to be a kid-friendly, bubble-gummy beatles for a television series. in their era, they had as much respect as, say, menudo, new kids on the block, the spice girls, and so on. as a fellow imdb reviewer rightly notes--"perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the monkees as a silly factory-made pop band rip-off of the beatles, refused to see (head)".the monkees and head have never been quite able to shed that negative public perception. it's a shame, because there was a lot of talent, both musically and otherwise, in the monkees. it's probably odder that rafelson, who directs here and co-produces with schneider, and jack nicholson (yes, _that_ jack nicholson), who wrote the script and also co-produces, decided to take the monkees in this unusual direction. it's as if new kids on the block suddenly put out an album equivalent to pink floyd's ummagumma (1969) or atom heart mother (1970). in fact, the songs in head, written by the monkees and frequent collaborators such as carole king and harry nilsson, have a floyd-like quality, somewhere between the syd barrett era and the immediate post-barrett era. this is much more prominent than any beatles similarity. some people have complained about the music in the film, but to me, all the songs are gems. for that matter, some people dislike barrett era (or other) floyd, which is just as difficult for me to empathize with.but what _is_ head about? the basic gist is just that the monkees are taking a trip through various film genres--there are war scenes, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comedy scenes, drama scenes, western scenes, sci-fi scenes, romance scenes, and on and on. except, in the film's reality, this turns out to be happening primarily (if not exclusively) on a studio lot. at root, we're watching the monkees shoot a film. of course all of the scenes in the various genres have something surreal and self-referential about them, and they, and individual shots within a scene, tend to lead to one another using dream logic not dissimilar to the monty python television show. as a dream, head tends to vacillate between a good dream and a nightmare, while often being one that would cause you to laugh in your sleep (something that i frequently do, by the way).technically, rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to realize the above. there are scenes with extensive negative images, there are a lot of very fast cuts (including a great sequence that features davy jones and tony basil dancing alternately in a white and a black room, wearing a combination of white and black reversed in each, that occasionally toggles back and forth as quickly as two frames at a time), there are a lot of bizarre segues, there is an animated cow mouth, there are odd editing devices, and so on. for my money, i wish this stuff wasn't just a relic of the psychedelic era. this is the kind of artistic approach i relish. it seemed like a good idea back then and i still think it's a good idea. i'd like to see films like the life aquatic with steve zissou using (2004) using these types of extended techniques. now that would make that film surreal.interpretationally, some folks who aren't so in tune with the acid trip aesthetic have complained that it's basically b.s. to offer meanings for something intended to not have any. i disagree with such a pessimistic/nihilistic view; head was intended to have a lot of meaning(s), and it's not just films without conventional plots that have multiple interpretations. nicholson, rafelson and schneider have a lot of interesting things to say about the monkees--the film postmodernistically comments on their manufactured status; pop stardom--way before pink floyd, head conflates pop stardom and violence, from images of war to images of fans cannibalistically dismantling their idols; and na√Øve u.s.-oriented ideas of international perceptions and respect--well-armed foreigners in a desert surrender to micky dolenz just because he's an american, then later they blow up a coke machine (again in the desert) for him because he's thirsty and can't gain access. the film comments on many other topics--from big industry to police, surveys, spectatorship (especially in relation to tragedies), and on and on. head is full of ideas, appropriately enough, with intelligent, multifaceted things to say about them.head deserves to be considered a classic--it's basically shooting for the same vibe as the beatles' yellow submarine. both premiered in november of 1968, interestingly enough, and both were intended as something of a summation of the psychedelic aesthetic. yellow submarine wasn't quite successful. head is everything yellow submarine should have been.

after winning a championship fight, boxer john garfield (as johnnie bradfield) celebrates with a drinking binge, which leads to the manslaughter of a pushy reporter. although his manager killed the man, mr. garfield is blamed. when the manager dies in a car crash, wearing garfield's stolen watch, authorities think the boxer is dead. still a wanted man, garfield changes his identity to "jack dorney" and moves to an arizona ranch. there, garfield meets "the dead end kids": billy halop (as tommy), bobby jordan (as angel), leo gorcey (as spit), huntz hall (as dippy), gabriel dell (as t.b.), and bernard punsly (as milt).garfield bonds with the young "dead end" lads, who were sent to stay with sweet "grandma rafferty" (may robson) as an alternative to reform school, courtesy of her brother, deceased priest "father rafferty". garfield falls in love with halop's sister, pretty "peggy" (gloria dickson), who is there to keep any eye on the kids. of course, garfield's past comes back to haunt him¬Ö "john garfield and the 'dead end' kids" make beautiful (max steiner) music together, thanks to effective direction and photography, by busby berkeley and james wong howe. the story is predictably comfortable, with the warner brothers support team in fine form. garfield and the "dead end" kids are a winning combination; although garfield made no further movies with the "east side" gang, the studio had him re-team with both billy halop and bobby jordan, almost immediately, for "dust be my destiny".the boxing scenes are nicely staged. but, the most exciting sequence has garfield and four of the new york "kids" (halop, jordan, hall, and punsly) climbing into a giant water tank for a swim - which unexpectedly puts their lives in danger. other, more brief, highlights include floozy ann sheridan (as goldie), boozy barbara pepper (as budgie), and young ronald sinclair (as douglas) losing at strip poker.******** they made me a criminal (1/21/39) busby berkeley ~ john garfield, billy halop, bobby jordan

i had heard of john garfield, but, didn't know him. i loved this movie. i had never heard of it. i just picked it up randomly. john garfield is a boxer in the movie. he had been in real life also so he knew his part. he was a fugitive throughout the movie. someone else killed a man. he character was blamed. he is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. all sorts of minor plots ensue. my favorite was the scary swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and one dead end kid couldn't swim, and none of them could get out.john's character saves the day. the dead end kids were great as his friends and followers. one of them right to the very end. ann sheridan played the family's daughter and john's eventual love interest. she was believable, but not lovable in my opinion-the only weak link in the movie.

whoever plays the part of j. douglas williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. he apparently received no credits. too bad.all the dead end kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. it is odd to watch them in a western setting with their brooklyn accents ( i guess that should be bowery ). they even show some swimming abilities.i think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. my favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film. busby berkeley shows his dance movie expertise when john garfield shifts his feet and as we watch that move, the camera moves up to his face. i will not give away why or when, but the look on his face at that point probably brought the 1939 audience to its feet in the theaters.some will think john garfield looks a lot like frank sinatra in many scenes. just his face. actually frank was not yet making movies so maybe frank looked like john. the boxer named smith in the movie looks like a clone of ed begley, jr.now i must tell you something that is not a spoiler, but if you watch the movie, watch grandma's hands. may robson does her part well. she seems to have hands that wander a bit. in a scene where she and a crowd go into the boxer's (john garfield) dressing room, watch where she touches the reclining john garfield while he is wearing only his trunks.a great ending. lots of wonderful characters.best line might be at the gas station, "...eight gallons, that's a dollar twenty-eight..." tom willett

very good 1939 film where john garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he has committed a murder. trouble is that the killer and garfield's girl, ann sheridan, in a brief but good performance, get killed while trying to elude the police.a crooked attorney persuades garfield to flee n.y. he lands in arizona and meets up with the dead end kids.. they've been sent there by a funding program to keep them out of further trouble.of course, garfield finds a new love interest but must conceal his identity as everyone thinks he was not only the killer but was the victim in the car crash.may robson is fabulous as the grandma type running the place for the wayward youth. claude rains is also effective in the role of the detective who suspects that garfield is still alive and pursues him when a picture is snapped of him in arizona.the film really deals with garfield's relation to the boys. while the ending is good, you want to see garfield go back to n.y. to proclaim his innocence.

as a fan of old warner brothers gangster movies i had to check this out,its the 2nd best movie in the adventure classics dvd set that also had one of my favorite movies;scott of the antarctic on it.this was made in 1939 a good year for a lot of warner brothers movies,it boasts a great cast;john garfield,claude rains,ann sheridan,and the dead end kids,who would be later known as the bowery boys at monogram pictures. well a boxer(garfield)gets framed for a murder he did'nt commit and is on the run and being tailed by a tough new york detective(claude rains) he ends up at a fruit picking place run by a pretty woman(gloria dickson)and the dead end kids(huntz hall,leo gorcey,benard punsley, billy halop,bobby jordan,gabreil dell)he later returns to boxing but tries to keep a low profile.this was directed by famed director busby berkley who directed timeless classics like 42nd street,goldiggers of 1933,and 35,footlight parade and many others.i would like to give a shout out to platinum dvd/video for putting out a lot of good budget priced dvd's like adventure classics(see my scott of the antarctic review)i give they made me a criminal 10 out of 10,great movie. ill have to point out that i have only seen 2 john garfield movies,this one and body and soul.i thought he was a very good actor.

i wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. it's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, john garfield.garfield plays jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. he must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with gloria dickson and the dead end kids. here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? garfield was an actor ahead of his peers. before the term 'method' was even coined and before brando ever screamed 'stella!' he brings 'natural' to the screen. his earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production. also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that 'golden boy' role he so desperately wanted to covet on screen. garfield looks the type and goes the distance as a boxer, proving his acting worth.ann sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as jack's trampy girl goldie. i haven't ever thought much of sheridan, but i liked her here. she plays well off garfield. dickson's' performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with garfield. the dead end kids are here, and garfield seems their natural idol (even more so than cagney). claude rains is miscast, and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene. strange, as he always was such a reliable actor.also interesting to note is the director- busby berkeley, best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images, directs a different genre here with remarkable ease. he maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirably.a very good film that deserves greater attention 8/10.

the early films of the dead end kids (before they were re-christened "the bowery boys") were all very entertaining and well-produced films from warner brothers. despite their being rather formulaic, they still had excellent writing, acting and hold up well over time. do not confuse these with the cheap bowery boys films from monogram pictures--despite the presence of huntz hall and leo gorcey, these films were several notches below the earlier films in regard to quality.the film begins with tough-guy john garfield winning the lightweight boxing championship. unfortunately, shortly after this he's on a drunken binge and is blamed for a murder he really didn't commit. the problem is that he was so loaded that he wasn't sure he didn't kill the man, so he runs away and lives the life of a hobo. eventually, he meets up with feisty may robson and the dead end kids--as well as a lady you just know will become his girlfriend given time.where the rest of the film goes was not all that surprising, but because of the quality of the film, it doesn't seem to matter. garfield and the kids are at their best and this is a film sure to please all but the pickiest of viewers.

another enjoyable warner flick. i really liked john garfield in this, though i'm wondering why cagney wasn't in the role. perhaps it was too similar to angels with dirty faces? i mean, it's another dead end kids story of sorts too, but i really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. the boys work great with garfield. a nice sequence was the whole "swimming" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.one negative comment: claude rains was grossly miscast. as the detective, the fine actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a whorehouse.

***spoilers*** even though the movie "they made me a criminal" is nowhere as good as the later john garfield anti-hero classics like "body & soul" in 1947 "force of evil" in 1948 and his last and very underrated "he ran all the way" in 1951 it's the film that defined his career from that point onward until his untimely death on may 21, 1952 at the young age of 39. garfiled plays the part of light weight champion johnnie bradfield and later the fugitive from the law jack dorney who's innocent of the murder that he's charged with, even though he's been declared officially dead. jonnie's manager doc ward, robert "doc" gleckler, who during a drunken victory party killed reporter charles mcgee,john ridgely, who was going to expose to the public his fighter johnnie bradfield lies about him being a one women guy as well as non drinking momma's boy. doc gleckler smashed a bottle over mcgee's head killing him as jonnie was almost dead drunk with a number of women partying in his hotel suite. doc was later killed in a car crash with johnnie's girlfriend goldie, ann sheridan, but doc burned to a crisp and with johnnie's watch on him was mistaken for johnnie. told to stay dead and buried by his lawyer malvin ,robert strange, who took $9,750.00 of the $10,000.00 of johnnie's money that he had for this great piece of advice. malvin told johnnie to take on a new identity and call himself from now on jack dorney and get the hell out of the state of new york; talking about sleazy shysters. johnnie now jack dorney travels the rails from new york down to arizona ending up at the rancho rafferty date farm where most of the film takes place.if it wasn't for john garfield in the lead role as both jonnie bradfield & jack dorney the movie would have long been lost and forgotten. garfield who was only 26 at the time brought the best out of everyone in the movie. even the transported dead end kids, i guess we can call them the arizona kids here, acting were notches above what you would have expected from them and they came across as real and sensitive persons not a bunch of slap stick clowns like in almost all of their movies. all that due to being on the same stage, or filming location, with john garfield. "they made me a criminal" is a good story that has the undercover champ acting like anything but not to draw any attention on himself and end up not only behind bars but in the electric chair. in the end jack showed just what kind of man he is by not fighting the big fight and against all the odds dramatically winning at the last moment but by going four brutal rounds to get the money for his new found family at the date farm including his girl peggy, gloria dickson, to open up a gas station with it. giving the european champ gaspar rutchek, frank riggi, the fight of his life and getting $2,000.00, thats $500.00 a round, for doing it jack showed everyone who looked up to him like the "arizona kids" that sometimes taking a punch is far braver and more courageous then throwing one.the fact that jack could have easily clobbered rutched but didn't in order not to expose himself to the police, as on the loose killer johnnie bradfield. but instead went as far as he could taking everything that rutchek could throw at him to help out his friends showed more then all the fights that he won in the boxing ring put together. i for one didn't find the ending of the movie contrived at all but fitting right in with the story. the cop morty phelam, claude rains, who came to arizona from new york to arrest jack had to live with for years the fact that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair. we were told all this right at the start of the movie. why knowing that jack/johnnie was innocent of the murder that he's charged with and not knowing for sure if he'll be found innocent of it in a court of law would he want to make the same terrible mistake again? i can easily see this happening in real life why not then in the movies.

the young john garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 "they made me a criminal." celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer johnnie bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. and the whiskey.a problem develops when another couple arrives. the guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose bradfield's phony life on the front page. the manager kills the reporter and he and the floozy depart. the murder discovered, cops, later, are on the lookout for the now somnolent boxer whose car is driven by the manager with his new girlfriend-johnny's now instant ex. a police chase ends with a fiery car crash. manager and girl are dead and unrecognizable.johnny discovers that he's supposed to be a killer. but he's also presumed dead. seeking advice from a lawyer, he entrusts the counselor with the key to a bank deposit box holding his sole savings, $10,000. the lawyer later gives johnny $250 and tells him that the balance is his fee for giving him professional advice: get out of town, fast, and go far away. (i would never charge a client more than $5,000 for such pithy, succinct and wise direction.) johnny, now a freight train hopping hobo, winds up conveniently passing out at an arizona date ranch where he's nursed back to health by beautiful goldie west, ann sheridan, a fine actress whose career was in the ascendancy. taking jack dorney as his moniker, the pugilist loses some of his rough edges as he falls in love with goldie. he becomes a mentor and pal to - the dead end kids. familiar screen characters to pre-war moviegoers.a chance to make money arises when an exhibition boxer shows up challenging any suckers to last several rounds in the ring with him. it's a natural temptation for bradfield/dorney but there's a fly in the ointment. who should show up but new york detective monty phelan, the laughing stock of the department? he's been on morgue duty for ages because of a slight mistake early in his career that sent an innocent man to old sparky (we all make mistakes, don't we?) phelan recognized bradfield from a news photo and he's there to watch the fight and make the pinch. claude rains is the cop who's endured slights and barbs from his fellow officers for years.what follows is predictable but it's well acted. i hope this was a main feature when it was released-it's too good to rank as a "b" second on a marquee.busby berkeley, best known as an outstanding choreographer, directed "they made me a criminal" and max steiner, one of hollywood's all-time prolific score composers, wrote nice but not extraordinary music for the film.now available on dvd from alpha video, the movie set me back a mere $4.99 and gave me real pleasure. i'll view it again.8/10

a beautiful film.john garfield's character is a distant relative of "les miserables"'s jean valjean while detective rains recalls victor hugo's javert,the ruthless arm of law.like in many films noirs,the city epitomizes evil whereas the country and the nature represents sanctuary,redemption,and a second chance for those whose life seems forever doomed.but even in the luminous daylight,danger may appear suddenly,as the excellent scene at the reservoir shows.john garfield -an actor who,as leonard maltin points out,should be rediscovered:i've never been disappointed by any of his films except for his supporting part in "gentleman's agreement " but it was not his fault-gives a heartfelt sensitive performance and the audience sides with him as soon as he is unjustly accused (the first sequence shows a rather unkind hypocrite person,but all his trials redeem him and how do we feel for him during the last scenes with detective rains.colorful characters (grandma and the kids ) add a lot of joie de vivre which is necessary .humor is also present in the strip poker game as the dead end brats fleece a rich kid.i recommend this movie.

this is breezy highly entertaining drama with an excellent cast. garfield is fine as a boxer hiding from the police with that motley crew the dead end kids. most notable of these is the beautiful billy halop who has some very moving moments. gloria dickson, who in real life died very young in a house fire, is strong and very attractive as halop's sister, and in the early scenes ann sheridan, on the brink of stardom, is a knock-out. may robson is very funny as a crusty old granny, but claude rains proves here that even a great actor can flounder if mis-cast (whoever thought of casting him as a tough new york cop?).busby berkeley proves here that he was a fine director with or without musical numbers. the film moves at a terrific pace and the water tower sequence is very suspenseful and well photographed. the ending is contrived, and the plot nothing startling or original, but i still found this a highly enjoyable experience.

they made me a criminal is a remake of an earlier warner brothers film, the life of jimmy dolan which starred douglas fairbanks, jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.even with the restrictions now upon production by the hays office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. douglas fairbanks, jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. john garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.they made me a criminal was directed by busby berkeley who jack warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. berkeley in fact would soon be leaving warner brothers for mgm. berkeley does do a fine job here, keeping the action flowing at a good pace. i particularly like the scene where four of the dead end kids and garfield are swimming in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down. they get it out of it quite narrowly and with some good ingenuity.other performances besides garfield and the kids to remember are may robson who runs the summer camp for the kids and claude rains as the obsessed detective on garfield's trail.

it's always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods when you weren't expecting it. the dead end kids/bowery boys found themselves in a lot of uneven films, and usually did better when in a support role, as in "angels with dirty faces". here, their presence as a backdrop to the story of a boxer framed for murder gives them a lot of screen time without distracting from the main action.john garfield is light heavyweight champion johnny bradfield, a southpaw hitter who's a lot different from the image he portrays to the sports world and the press. when a newspaper reporter inadvertently learns that johnny's a party loving womanizer, his plans to spill that information in a column is interrupted by a whiskey bottle to the head from johnny's manager doc ward (robert gleckler). in turn, doc talks johnny's girlfriend goldie (ann sheridan) into running off with him to avoid the legal hassle of dealing with the reporter's death. as both flee, a police chase winds up in a fiery car wreck, and doc's body is misidentified as johnny from the gold watch he was wearing.claude rains adopts an edward g. robinson sneer that doesn't quite work as a detective who's been reassigned to morgue detail after a bad arrest years ago. his character is monty phelan, and he has a pretty good hunch that the body in the car crash wasn't johnny. he pesters his boss to hand over the closed case to him, and is given the assignment to get him out of town and out of the way.meanwhile, johnny looks for advice from his lawyer, and winds up being screwed even worse when he gets conned for most of his ten thousand dollar savings. making his way cross country, johnny winds up at the rancho rafferty date farm in arizona, run by a crusty granny rafferty (may robson). the farm is the legacy of granny's brother, a deceased priest from brooklyn, and is now the home of a band of rag tag street boys (the dead end kids) who work the farm. billy halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this one, and his sister peggy (gloria dickson) becomes the romantic interest for johnny, now going by the name of jack dorney.i get a kick out of the historical perspective offered in these pre-war era films. when johnny and the boys take a joy ride in the farm's truck, they fill up at a gas station for a $1.28! tommy (halop) gets the idea that a gas station on the farm would be a good way to earn some extra money, and with that thought, jack dorney decides to take on a barnstorming boxer offering $500 a round to anyone who can stay in the ring with him. the clich√©d premise is turned on it's ear somewhat when jack gets knocked out in the fifth round, but by then he's earned enough to give the fruit farm a fighting chance of it's own. maybe grandma rafferty should have been in the ring, she just about took out everyone sitting around her at ringside. as johnny/jack comes around in the locker room, detective phelan is on hand to take him into custody. knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this collar, it's a toss up as to whether phelan follows through on his arrest - you'll have to watch the film to find out.i like the dead end films where leo gorcey's in charge, but he doesn't have a lot to do in this one. however he does a great film flam on the ticket taker at the gate of the boxing match. another thought - wouldn't it have been great if the ever present picture on the wall of the priest had been that of pat o'brien?all in all, this is a pretty good entry in both the john garfield and dead end kids filmography, and an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half. if there's one downside, it's not enough screen time for pretty ann sheridan. the film might have wound up even more satisfying if the roles of sheridan and gloria dickson were reversed, as the on screen chemistry between dickson's peggy and jack seemed more forced than natural.

i must have been around ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to see this martial arts movie at the " drive in " at the circle drive in in long beach. the title was " hammer of god " from which i can never forget for some reason, but what i do remember are the different scenes that have left an imprint on my mind forever.my brother always reminds me of the movie although it has been forever it seems since we seen the movie. from time to time throwout the years i would look for it at the rental stores and from time to time i would check on the web and for some reason it appears like it is never available or no one knows what movie i'm talking about.if i only knew if and were it was available i would love to purchase that movie. if anyone is aware of its availability please inform me.

jimmy wang yu, an authentic asian superstar, directed and wrote this film which i have only seen in a dubbed videotape version. the widescreen (shaw scope!)shape was lost and the original actor's voices absent but this is still good to watch. the story is the usual martial arts school fights villains from japan plot with our young hero winning out in the end by beating up loads of assorted thugs.the combat gets better as the film unravels. early in the film it looks stiff and dull but later there is a great scene where wang yu fights hordes in a gambling joint then walks out into a snowy scene and takes some more villains on with knives, sword and fists. that part is very exciting.quite good then but it would be interesting to see a non dubbed widescreen version if there is one.

i will be honest, i rented this movie solely on the fact it was part of the "child's play" series. i was expecting a boring dull 4th part too the series, but i was surprised. this movie was surprisingly good, and i found it to be quite funny. there was a lot of dark humor, and the idea to have two dolls was a good way to spice things up. the two dolls worked well together and added a bonnie and clyde type fell to the movie. overall it was very good for a 4th movie in the series, with some gruesome death scenes (just watch the marilyn manson type get killed at the beginning, not to mention john ritter getting a face full of nails). applauds to the writers for spicing things up, and the ending although i found it a bit strange leaves room for yet another sequel...maybe "son of chucky"!!!

it's just that. chucky 1 was good. chucky 2 was better. chucky 3 sucked. now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. jennifer tilly was just great in this movie. for dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (freddie prince jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies i've seen in the past.the plot wasn't great, but i really didn't care about it. just to see chucky and tiffany bicker and fight each other. and the ending leaves it wide open for a 5th sequel (which i hear is in the works). idle hands premiers next week and looks to be another horror/comedy, but i doubt it'll top this one.

the first child's play was an original and effective little horror movie. as expected though, the 2 horrible sequels seemed to spell the end for this franchise.well, when i heard they were making a 4th one called "bride of chucky" i just rolled my eyes and muttered a "...when will they ever learn."but when i heard that they had gotten a great director, ronny yu and a solid cast including the awe inspiring jennifer tilly my interest in it perked up.this film is extremely well done. it has a great sense of humor, highly stylized graphic violence, great cinematography and the stunningly sexy jennifer tilly strutting her most impressive stuff during the first half. (i should add that she is also a fantastic actress as well.)it keeps it's tongue firmly in cheek without veering into campy territory. the doll effects are great and the verbal interplay between them is priceless. it's more of a horror/comedy than straight horror but the humor is welcome and well integrated. i've already heard that they're planning a son of chucky. if they can match the quality of this film, than maybe this franchise will have made a legitimate comeback.rating:8.5

i¬¥m from germany so please excuse my style of writing. as i¬¥ve seen chucky 4 for the first time i was a bit surprised, i knew chucky as a usual 80s scarymovie, but bride of chucky was very different from the old ones. first there is the artwork of the very good director ronny yu, who we still have in mind from a chinese ghost story. his visual style is in a wired kinda way comparable to francis ford coppola. also the voices of chucky an tiff are very impressive. i¬¥ve also liked the screenplay very much, especially the scene in which tiff throws the champaignbottle in the ceilingmirror.i give it a 9.0 vote for funny, gory and progressive entertainment. if you have any comments on my opinion, just send me an e-mail. mfg schawez

chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!when chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. tiffany and chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk!!don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. it is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!my rating : 9/10.

after visiting the kimbell museum in forth-worth, texas, usa, enjoying the art and the architecture (also of the adjacent modern art museum), and having a delightful conversation with the knowledgeable bookstore lady, i purchased this a propos dvd with rather high expectations¬Ö and was not disappointed in the least.the thematic approach, dramatic tension, revealing interviews, archival footage and stunning architecture are also mixed in a coherent whole to explore the life of the late iconic louis i. khan.the documentary begins: contemplative classical music plays, archives are scanned with a reflective shadowy face superimposed, blurring letters symbolically referencing a train window passing a backdrop landscape ¬ó a journey ¬ó, focus and out of focus, the search eventually culminates to an article in a newspaper. nathanial khan reads from the front page of the new york times where his father is simultaneously praised as the best american architect alive and his death announced. "when i first read that obituary, i have to admit, i was looking for my own name. i was his child too, his only son. i didn't know my father very well. he never married my mother and he never lived with us (¬Ö) he died when i was eleven."so years later, this illegitimate son is still haunted by unclear fragmented thoughts and feelings about his father who seems to be a great professional and public figure, but who's secretive personal life escapes him and affects him to the point where he intends to do something about it."for years, i struggled to be satisfied with the little pieces of my father's life i've been allowed to see, but it wasn't enough. i needed to know him. i needed to find out who he really was. so i set out on a journey, to see his buildings and to find whatever there was left of him out there. it would take me to the other side of the world, looking for the man who left me with so many questions."so the documentary is two-fold, by a slow systematic discovery of the world-renown architect, we get to know: 1) his ideas, buildings and the architectural perspective and 2) his families, coworkers, people's life he affected and the human perspectivethe dvd also offers added insight with a q&a with the writer/director and additional footage that includes such great louis i. khan quotes as "everything that everybody says is the truth. it's their truth. it might not be factual." and "a good idea that doesn't happen is no idea at all."this movie is a journey of discovery. self-discovery and discovery of a man, a great man, yet a human, imperfect like all of us. we get to know him through the eyes of an admiring and slightly bitter son, but with the openness and objectivity to really explore without making easy conclusions and without judging.by key interviews with people who interacted with him in various capacity. we slowly put some pieces together until that final interview with this man from bangladesh who really seems to bring it back home with visceral and sensible comments.brilliant architect, brilliant documentary.

first of all i have to say that i'm a huge lucio fulci and dario argento fan. although i have not seen absolutely all of their movies, i really enjoyed almost every one i did see. i really like giallos and i thought argento was the master of this genre, after seeing films like "tenebre" and "phenomena". but after i saw "new york ripper" by fulci, i found out that he could do pretty good giallos besides his graphic zombie movies and even outdo argento, on a certain level.i love fulci's style, and yes i love gore, but this film i think, although it has a more developed plot and characters than his other films, is not his best one. what i don't like is that it can be confusing at times, especially at the end. and the fact that we go from one suspect, to another, and then another until we even suspect the retarded little girl for a moment, i think it goes too far. i know giallos are supposed to keep you guessing until the end, and the killer should be very hard to find, but this film plays a little too much with our minds. however i did like the scene when the witch is killed, i think it is very well done and gave me the chills. the acting is also pretty good and the photography is great.although this is not a bad film, i think lucio fulci has made better films than this, and i think his best one is "the beyond", a very different movie but a more atmospheric and visual experience.i give "don't torture a duckling" a 7 out of 10.

i saw this movie five times and never get tired of it. this features traces of the "giallo" genre, but also with a vivid italian countryside setting, where ignorance and superstition are deadlier than any serial killer. featuring excellent location (reminiscent sometimes of fellini, sometimes of the taviani brothers), good characterisation and some of the finest genre actors (including the great tomas milian and ida lupino in an unforgettable role), this is not euro-trash, just a masterpiece that should be discovered generation after generation (it recently recieved great acclaim at the paris cinematheque at a double-feature tribute to lucio fulci)

this film shows a serious side to the often thought of as gore-fest works of fulci. not a lot of blood and guts here , but a fine tale about murder and the lives affected by it.a real find, considering it was made in 1972 and will soon celebrate its 30th anniversary.check this one out, but be warned it is hard to find!ron

i was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.this film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (the beyond, zombie 2, city of the living dead, house by the cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of italy. the scenery is at moments reminiscent of cherished folklore and then immediately contrasted by mud and blood-soaked terror shrouded by crumbling ruins. the gore in this film is not quite as prevalent and seems restrained compared to fulci's later films however, splatter and giallo fans will most likely be satiated by a few close-ups of oozing wounds and the last 5 minutes of the film.overall a fantastic and mature film from one of our great italian horror directors.

cult-director lucio fulci is probably most famous for his gory zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the "godfather of gore". fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. "non si sevizia un paperino" aka. "don't torture a duckling" of 1972 is not only by far fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre. the stunning atmosphere and tantalizing suspense, the great sizilian setting, the intriguing story the brilliant performances or the intense moments of sheer shock - i don't know what to praise most about this ingenious giallo! "don't torture a duckling" truly delivers cinematic perfection in every aspect, which makes it an absolute masterpiece of italian horror cinema.contrary to other gialli, it is not seductive beauty queens who are slain one by one, but little boys who fall victims to a killer on the loose. bodies of little boys are found in rural sicily. while the police are desperately searching for the killer, the little town is basically full of strange people, and the townsfolk are screaming for a culprit...the film is stunningly suspenseful and uncompromising from the very beginning, with a gritty, dark, and constantly tense atmosphere that has yet to find an equal. the acting performances are among the best in italian horror cinema. tomas milian (one of my personal all-time favorite actors) is excellent in the lead, as journalist andrea martinelli who is investigating the crimes. sexy barbara bouchet delivers both eye-candy and a brilliant performance. equally outstanding performances come from irene papas and florinda bolkan, who is utterly brilliant in her role. the great score by riz ortolani brilliantly intensifies the suspense and atmosphere, and the film is ingeniously shot in fascinating sicilian landscapes. although not as gory as many other fulci films, this film is definitely gritty and uncompromising in its violence, with a few shockingly brutal scenes."don't torture a duckling" has everything brilliant horror requires. this is not quite as easy to get hold of as most other fulci flicks, but i assure that searching it will pay off. any horror fan must see this personal favorite of mine, and i highly recommend any true lover of film in general not to miss this. a masterpiece!

in this early fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. personally i think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. it's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on. the comparative lack of gore in the film shows a more urgent and psychological imperative to this film in its prevailing "mystery" but the gore and puppetry he does utilise is put to good use here most notably in the scene where a falsely accused murderer is senselessly lynched by a mob of men in a graveyard and left for dead in a show of vile and antiquated vigilantism, expertly choreographed to the modern tunes off a diegetic radio.another example was the final scene (which was indeed awesome) in which a strikingly handsome priest falls from a cliff and the puppet used is markedly showed in a medium closeup which accentuated its demonic appearance and evident ugliness. curiously, considering his later works, fulci also invokes the idea of modernity seized upon the hamlet holding on to its anachronistic superstitions and ignorance when the idea of black magic is just that, a quaint idea of supernatural evil that never really ends up manifesting from the voodoo dolls while making its witch nothing more than a disturbed woman. another thing i liked was that he adds to these character layers by making a bourgeois city girl into an ambiguous figure - is she the corrupter the priest fears for his wards and perhaps more tellingly, for himself? this giallo does lend itself to becoming one of fulci's more personal and substantive films, in that we actually get a fair influx of ideas from him.

i saw 2:37 at the toronto international film festival in september and was blown away by it! a scene of panic opens this film, at 2:37 pm set in an adelaide high school. this scene is left unresolved as we revert to the beginning of the day, and are introduced to the teenagers getting ready to go to school. the audience becomes intimate with each of the main characters, and explores the day-to-day issues facing teenagers - including drugs, promiscuity, being gay, bullying and violence. each scene is played again and again from different teens' perspectives, and is reminiscent of gus van sant's elephant. this is a remarkable film by first-time director murali k. thalluri. it was made with non-professional student actors, and work-shopped through an unprecedented 76 drafts of a script. it features stunning performances by a number of the student actors, particularly teresa palmer in the role of melody. this coming-of-age film is both intimate and thought-provoking with a surprising and disturbing ending.

hilarious, clean, light-hearted, and quote-worthy. what else can you ask for in a film? this is my all-time, number one favorite movie. ever since i was a little girl, i've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble.the clich√© characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun. the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen furst (harold) and andy tennant (melio) make up most of my favorite parts of the movie. and who didn't love the hopeless awkwardness of flynch? don't forget the airport antics of leon's cronies, dressed up as hari krishnas: dancing, chanting and playing the tambourine--unbeatable! the clues are genius, the locations are classic, and the plot is timeless.a word to the wise, if you didn't watch this film when you were little, it probably won't win a place in your heart today. but nevertheless give it a chance, you may find that "it doesn't matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do, you've gotta play."

a few years ago i saw this remake of the sixties classic with the mini coopers for the first time and i remember liking it a lot. now, about two years later it was shown on television and i just wanted to know whether i would still like it as much as when i saw it in the cinema. well, the answer is yes.the movie is about a team of robbers that will do one final job in venice, italy. the plan is flawless and the execution perfect. they escape and won't have to work for the rest of their lives. but there is one problem they didn't take into account: someone within their own ranks doesn't like to split the loot, but wants to keep it all for himself, even when that means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. but all but one survive and they are out for revenge. one year later, in los angeles this time, the surviving team members create a smart and devious plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the traitor...the story on itself is of course not very original, since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has plenty of goodies to offer to make you forget about that. this is a typical heist / action movie but it certainly is one of the better ones in its kind. the action is very nice, the landscapes and venice are real eye-candy, the story is ok and the special effects are stunning. even the acting is very good, something which you'll not often see in an action movie. i must admit that i really liked what i saw and i give this movie a well deserved 7.5/10.

the greatest compliments to the other commentator here at imdb who asked himself why this series didn't "get stuck" in its time to last a lot longer like many other series in the 80s did.it is not true the series would have gotten worse if further continued.i will at the end of this my comment post some thoughts about the other movie realizations, rather: attempts of the robin hood legend.first of all, robert addie (gisburne), you are among us all, you live forever.nothing is as fun as the entire two, if one wants, three seasons of this absolutely unique series. and at the same time absolutely agreeing with the mostly new and revolutionary findings of terry jones' history documentations about egypt, greece, rome, konstantinopel, the goths and barbarians, and the middle ages and crusades (...yes, the monthy python-terry jones):if you have seen those brilliant and funny jones-docs you will better, much better understand all the historical background stuff carpenter, the writer of the robin of sherwood-series (which happens to be the brother of john carpenter, who made "the thing", their third brother makes music), intended to tell us.the writer of "dick turpin", "catweazle" and the first two seasons of "robin of sherwood", called "kip" carpenter, is my movie overlord. he's better than all those others who criticize his "sword-and-sorcery" element or "defectiveness" (taken from the robin of sherwood webring) of this series (that i can not see) or have other non-fundamented criticism of which there existed a lot back then and still now.that's why, when you get to know this "robin of sherwood" better, you'll be severe. you will at first loathe the third season. not only that: i did myself go thru this, and on top of it, i have only taken up the first two seasons into my deepest heart - despite the fact that praed, the actor of robin, left this series, because after the series had enormous success, he was offered a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous canadian series called "the new adeventures of jules verne" - already the title reveals the emptiness of the whole project. praed went for money, and not for fame, he didn't stick with his gang and kin, i mean: as actors.actors who personally represent the afterwards "really", in our present time famous and legendary faces and characters of the robin-legend. the potential of this series could and should have been let blossomed a lot more without any degrading niveau of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issues.again, obligatory to say: a change of the main role was forced by praed's stupid decision of leaving robin of sherwood for a silly remake-series of the verne-tales and brilliantly woven into the filming of the story. still it is in some aspects a catastrophe.anyway: if one is informed about this, and that connery was maybe really advertised by his father, but that the young connery did not at all "chase praed away", how i prejudicially thought in the first place, then one can absolutely enjoy the 3rd season. sad here is that the script was not anymore written by superman kip carpenter, so we don't have anymore that critical and free-thinking historical background like i.e. in "the witch of elsdon", or in "the king's fool", two episodes of the first series that is a) funny, b) historically educating and c) brilliantly acted. ==="don't trust the lion!"unlike many other characters that wished him dead for the sake of their own gain of power, richard lionheart, as shown in ros and as in real history, was a greater authority than john or others, but used it only for his wicked idea of the crusade and the war against normandie in france. he slaughtered and had slaughtered much more than tens of thousands of christians, muslims and jews in the "wholy" crusades, and his soldiers even devoured the children they slayed out of hunger or poverty. on top of that, after his capture by the saracens (muslims) in the crusades, britain was squeezed out for his ransom, 100.000 marks (at that time, 11th century, comparable to approx. 30 billion - 30'000'000'000.- dollars of current value), to get him safely back, and then he just visited england for a month to return to normandie (in france, where the norman invaders went first) for the crusades (one learns that in the episode "the king's fool"). for this new crusade, possibly kind of a revenge for his capture, richard lionheart again "drains the country of money" (cited out of clive mantle's mouth, when he lectures robin in being critical with even the king). robin criticizes this warfare unsocial ruling of richard's, he addresses richard himself, telling him "the poor gave everything to set you free, how can you ask more of them?" - richard: "...give me your courage and strength, not your words!" ...later, in private, richard orders the assassination of robin...so, the crusaders were the real "barbarians".p.s: already when i watched kostner in 91, i got upset, because after-wards, i found out in history course in school that richard was not that good just man as displayed by sean connery in his appearance at the end of "prince of the thieves". well, as terry jones would put it: it is a lie, a treacherous lie!" sean plays humorist and charismatic, and his son does a better job than expected in the third season of "robin of sherwood".again: praed is, according to my info up to now, the one who left sherwood for a stupid verne-series nobody with brains will ever remember or want to remember.

i watched this series on pbs back in the eighties and still watch the old tapes every couple of years or so. very atmospheric and creepy sometimes. this is a very good show as the characters are all well defined and acted. you are drawn into the plot and come to care for these people. the villains are almost laughably evil, especially the sheriff of nottingham. man, i would love to beat the s--t out of that snotty little bastard. nicholas grace does an excellent job and must have had a great time being the sheriff. his whipping boy, sir guy, is equally hissable but is also pathetic. lots of murder and mayhem in this series, along with tons of black magic and devil worship and things of that nature. i noticed it got an award for children's television which is surprising. if i had kids, i would not let them watch this. outstanding use of locations in this show also. it is now on dvd, so go out and buy it.

never had i seen such a powerful true story movie. i discovered a city, a country, a lost revolution and even a nobel prize winner thanks to this masterpiece of cinema.if you haven't seen this movie, you can't say you've seen anything .a great lesson of courage, humility and life.i haven't seen anything as good since.t.e. saturday, january 9th, 1999

patricia arquette plays american doctor laura bowman, who takes a holiday to burma in an attempt to heal her spirit after the murders of her husband and young son. she is left behind in rangoon during a military crackdown and leaves the city with an aging man who works as a "tour guide." but he is no simple tour guide; he is a professor who introduces her to the life outside of the tourist traps ... the two of them get caught up in the political upheaval and laura sees with her own eyes how the government betrays and oppresses its own people.this movie is one of my favorites because of its themes. first, it's informational (describing some of the injustices that are occurring in burma). secondly, it's about a woman's struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss. thirdly, it's about compassion and sacrifice, and people coming together - without even knowing each other - to endure pain and fear.just about every beautiful scene in this movie is important; nothing is wasted here. it's an earnest and moving film. there is also a very emotional score composed by hans zimmer which complements scenes nicely.a definite recommend, especially to people concerned with human rights ... and people who want to know, "what purpose can i serve?"

this is one of the most underrated movies of the 1990s. if you allow yourself to identify with the patricia arquette character, you will find it to be a very moving story of a woman regaining a sense of purpose to her life, and finding a new will to live.arquette's performance is brave because it is purposefully "wooden" -- it's a way of defining her character's spiritual death, her complete lack of a desire to be alive. she moves through life like a zombie because her family has been murdered and she can't see the point of living. what is moving is how in the course of the story, she is reawakened -- by the burmese landscape, by the beautiful quality of its people and landscapes, and by the primal choices she is forced to confront.boorman supports this visually (and hans zimmer supports it with one of his most gorgeous, haunting scores) with an often static camera and with a propensity to shoot through glass, windows, windshields, etc. we are on the outside looking in, just like arquette.... until she finds herself deep in the jungle and is forced to choose whether or not to fight for her life.i recommend the 1954 movie the purple plain as well. it's a similar story in a similar setting, and makes for a fascinating comparison.

chris noth plays a maniac who wrote a children's book as a young lad, posing as a doctor who menaces a community in order to push his sister's son into the position as his school's genius. the only man that can stop him is a cop who plays by his own rules, and is forced to go undercover with the help of his mute father who communicates via oujii board. will rick springfield find out whats up? or will somebody sabotage his recording studio! does the mentally retarded boy who operates the book mobile have clues? watch to find out! i'm not making this up!

an eye opening documentary about the 1993 siege of a religious sect compound near waco, texas. seventy-six people, including sect leader, david koresh, perished in a flaming inferno that destroyed the compound. there is still heated debate over how the fire started. homicide or suicide? can you still trust government ethics?

strong evidences and it clearly shows government cover-ups and lies. very convincing documentary. a little bias but it hit hard on the government. i'm not very remorsed about the adults but the children............. it's very sad. strong evidences and it clearly shows government cover-ups and lies. very convincing documentary. a little bias but it hit hard on the government. i'm not very remorsed about the adults but the children............. it's very sad. strong evidences and it clearly shows government cover-ups and lies. very convincing documentary. a little bias but it hit hard on the government. i'm not very remorsed about the adults but the children............. it's very sad.

i think the filmographic lineage may run like this. pay attention, please, because i had to look this up. in 1967 peter yates, an ex auto racer, directs the english caper movie "robbery," the most thrilling part of which is a car chase through the streets of london, down alleys where there are crowds of children playing and all that. it's a success.a year later, yates directs "bullet", starring steve mccool, i mean mcqueen, featuring another even more spectacular car chase up and down the san francisco hills, with dumbfoundingly authentic engine sounds that seem to include double clutching, full race cams, no mufflers, twelve-cylinder engines under forty-foot hoods, supercharged, superdupercharged, and all five-thousand horsepower running at full tilt. lots of shots of mcqueen's gum-chewing visage scowling with concentration as he tries to bump another car off the highway, though a passenger in the other vehicle totes a shotgun. the chase is staged by philip d'antoni. bill hopkins drives the criminal vehicle.a year or two later, sensing a good thing, bill friedkin directs "the french connection," featuring a chase between a commandeered cop car(gene hackman) and an elevated train in new york city. lots of shots of hackman's cursing face as he wrestles the battered car through the streets. the chase is staged by philip d'antoni. academy awards follow.sensing a good thing, a year or two more brings us "the seven ups," featuring a chase between a car driven by roy scheider, with lots of shots of scheider's cursing face as he tries to bump the other car, which is driven by bill hopkins, off the road, although the criminal car, to be sure, carries a shotgun-toting passenger. no hills in new york city, just bumps, but they are still sharp enough to elevate the cars a few feet. the pursued car screeches around a corner and dashes down a street on which a dozen children are playing. shots of the screaming kids as they scatter off the pavement and allows the car to zoom through. but once is not enough. the children immediately run back into the street and must repeat the retreat for the pursuing cop car carrying scheider.i once witnessed a pursuit at high speed on the streets of philadelphia. both the criminal and the cops drove through the streets at about 25 miles an hour, coming to rolling stops at each stop sign and red light -- very dull stuff compared to this movie.speaking of this movie, it's pretty good. "robbery" and "bullet" were cool. everyone dressed neatly. but the new york movies are filthy. there's garbage all over the place and the subway cars are covered with graffiti. shoot outs and beat ups take place in vacant lots surrounded by crumbling brick buildings, or in disposal dumps for industrial-sized freezers.the acting is pretty good too. roy scheider seems whippet sleek. the other actors have faces made for the camera, especially richard welsh. and the story is engaging, if not entirely unfamiliar. what's best about the film is the way it captures new york city in its almost total indifference to human depravity and nobility. at a funeral, the limo drivers stand around with their collars up, butts hanging out of their mouths, kicking their cold feet together, utterly bored at the ritual goings on. the film wants us to believe that the seven ups are an elite group of untouchable cops who stop at nothing to get the job done, and here it's a bit of a sell out. they always seems to be threatening to do something unethical and illegal -- beat hell out of a suspect or physically damage a hospitalized and helpless hood -- but they always manage to avoid doing it. (if they actually did it, their characters would become lifelike and ambiguous and we'd rather have our heroes and villains of a more biblical nature.) very enjoyable, even if you've seen it before, and you very well may have in one or another of its previous incarnations.

this movie is an all-time favorite of mine. i'm sorry that imdb is not more positive about it. i hope that doesn't keep those who have not experienced it from watching it.i've always loved this movie. i watch it about once a year and am always pleased anew with the film and especially the stellar performances by entire cast.i've always wondered whether jean stapleton actually did the ending dance with travolta???? if anyone knows this piece of trivia, please leave a comment.thanks and enjoy!

wow, i think the overall average rating of this film on this site is incredibly low. there's really no reason to dislike this film. "michael" is a simple, but fairly original, and easily enjoyable romantic comedy. the plot involves a group of reporters/experts going to examine the mysterious appearance of an angel (john travolta) in the midwest. the angel proves to be less saintly and more worldly than we would expect, and that's what makes it entertaining. his interest in women and the beatles takes a new spin on the angel thing. the romantic side of this film involves michael the angel trying to get andie macdowell and william hurt together. the two of them may not have the all-time greatest on-screen chemistry, but they certainly have enough to make it work well. everyone who has rated this film so low (a 5.4??), come on! the film is not that bad. in fact, i found it quite funny and memorable. sure, it's not the best thing you'll ever see, but it's still good. this is a film i feel has been remarkably underrated. it's fun, romantic, and recommended by me.*** out of ****

i have done a lot of international travel, both on business and as a tourist. for both types i assure you the best advice is also the oldest: always drink the wine of the country. in this movie the archangel michael comes to earth on business, wraps it up quickly and decides to hang around for a little touring. boy! does he "drink the wine of the country."could man be drunk forever with liquor, love and fights he'd lief rise up of mornings and lief lie down of nights.these are things you can't do in heaven so he enjoys them while he's here! of course it turns out he had a couple of other jobs to tackle and, if he is less direct about them than he was about the first one, he is just as successful. the final scene is a little schmaltzy but it is also wonderful. jean stapleton gets to dance with john travolta.

warm hearted flic depicting arch-angel michael as a brawling, overweight, cigarette smoking slob who loves to dance and cavort with the opposite sex. he does have a good side, however, as he strives to set things right in the lives of a couple of burnt out losers before being recalled to heaven. funny, well played out film; very enjoyable although somewhat irreverent.

an off beat but very delightful performance by john travolta sets off this very funny comedy. his interpretation of the archangel is as a scuffy, womanizing, overweight, ladies man. and, he certainly has a mesmerizing effect on the women he encounters on his trip to chicago. john hurt is very low keyed in his role as chief reporter for chicago tabloid owner, bob hoskins. angie macdowell plays role much as she did her role in "four weddings and a funeral." maureen stapleton is neat in a cameo. her comment, "michael doesn't suffer fools," is just one of many memorable moments. bob hoskins is the only one of the lead performers who fails to connect, a little to off the wall. mainly you're there to see michael take on a bull, mesmerize the waitresses and lady dancers at a western style restaurant, and fully demonstrate that he is complete free soul. it is a memorable comedy that is worth more than one viewing.

i found the movie to be very light and enjoyable. one knows that the story is not real life like, yet the depiction is superb.lyrics are really good and john travolta in his usual style. i like the scene wherein he as an angel gives up his own stuff to bring life back to the dog.

honestly, i loved michael. although there were "give me a pillow i need to take a nap" parts, it was cool. i think everyone did a great job in this film. and nora ephron is in my "ok" list of directors.it's nice to see john travolta as a pot-bellied angel. it's not very often i see one in a movie. some people might call this a boring movie, but for me i loved it. angels and all.

i enjoyed this film which i thought was well written and acted.there was plenty of humour and a thought-provoking storyline. a warm and enjoyable experience with an emotional ending.good fun.

that pretty much sums it up ... corny. macdowell's inability to act is at times painful, and hurt must need money to take such muted roles, but i still enjoyed it.why? in a single word, travolta. he is great in this movie. still, i can't give the movie too high a score, but it certainly deserves better than it seems to be getting.

as an earlier reviewer said, travolta stole every scene he was in. recognize the character? it was vinnie barberino, all grown up and still a bit sleazy, but still likable, oh yes! disappointing were william hurt and bob hoskins, perhaps because their characters were badly written, or they just didn't care. i kept seeing one of the baldwins (never can remember which) in the hurt role so hurt's incredible talents weren't wasted. andie mcdowell is a sweetie, but not very believable; partly the writing. character development just wasn't a big thing in this film. just watch it for travolta, sit back and enjoy.

chicago reporter frank quinlan decided to go to iowa to confirm the existence of a so-called angel. he was not alone. his partner huey driscoll and new colleague dorothy winters also joined him. when they arrived at the destination, they found that the angel michael was quite different from what they expected. however frank still persuaded michael to go to chicago with them. so an interesting journey began.although michael did not look like a saint, he was a kind and funny angel. in fact michael owned irresistible charming for women. even due to jealousy of other men, he was involved in a riot. the climax appeared in the pizza restaurant. dorothy sang lively country songs for frank. that was just what michael wanted to see. but the next day huey 's dog was crashed to death by a running car. michael was asked to save it. that would be used to verify whether he was a real angel.andie macdowell shined in this comedy. she also showed her singing ability. john travolta proved his comedian talent again. of cause pulp fiction still was his typical work.a comedy that will warm your heart. 8/10

though this film doesn't stand out particularly from the movie crowd, its still a very nice film to sit down and watch with your feet up! there maybe the odd one or two mistakes you catch, and the cinematic are a little slipshod, the film itself is very enjoyable and has a wonderful atmosphere to it. the music contributes a lot to the mood of the movie.the acting is none the less impressive (especially the dog he he!) with john travolta taking the lead of the fun-troublesome-loving michael. other characters feel very genuine and perform very well within the film.so after a long day at work, stick "michael" on in the evening with some ice-cream and enjoy a very quality film in its own right :)

michael is probably too cutesy for most action movie fans and too hollywood for the intellectual crowd but i found it both extremely funny and very touching, despite it being both cutesy and formulaic.when three skeptics are sent to investigate a man claiming to be an angel they end up escorting him on a grand tour of the mid-western country side only to find that it is each of their own hearts that need investigation.when taking this film apart, as with most films today, there isn't a lot of new material but when taken as a whole it has a refreshingly original approach and is off-beat enough to entertain one all the way through.while not being a "family" film it is suitable for all ages and a good film to share with the whole family or that special someone."michael" isn't a great film but it certainly is a good film, a touching film, and well worth seeing.kwc

continuing his comeback, john travolta played a mildly twisted angel in "michael". he may be a messenger of god, but he's not the nicest guy, as reporters andie macdowell and william hurt discover. when i first saw this movie, it was before i had started watching "all in the family", so i didn't recognize jean stapleton as edith bunker. now that i recognize her like that, i try to imagine archie snapping at her for harboring an angel (whom he would probably rank alongside blacks, jews, etc).i know, that doesn't really relate to the movie. but i just like to associate things that way. anyway, it's a pretty interesting movie. also starring bob hoskins, teri garr and richard schiff.what john and paul said...

this is another of john travolta's "come back" movies, and if he continues on with characters and movies like this one, his come back will take hold.this is so sweet...sickeningly so if you're not into the romance comedy scene. if you are, this is one innovative romcom. every performance (including that of skippy the dog) was beautiful, without much more than a trace of the irreverence found in "dogma." (although, as movies go, i loved dogma!)travolta is not nearly as brash in his performance as the previews would lead you to believe. he is an angel and if you consider yourself to be well read, then you understand that angels were far from perfect. you will not, therefore, be insulted by this film. even those who are overly sensitive to such things shouldn't be insulted by this work, as nora went to great lengths to see to it that it was the least abrasive as possible, given the subject matter.i love this, and love it more each time i watch it. it's beautiful and sweet, engaging, and endearing.it rates a 7.3/10 from...the fiend :.

caught this movie on tv and i watched it again. i said to myself, it's been a long time since i watched this movie, so why not. and once again this movie thrilled me. it is so easy, so watchable and so human that i don't know why some people dislike it. john travolta shines as michael (his dance and every move), angel that can hardly be related to this word. he smokes, drinks and he eats like some savage, but he's got big heart. on his way michael helps all people he meets. dorothy winters (andie macdowell) in her singing and finding a right man. frank quinlan (william hurt) in developing himself as a good and decent man. michael even helped dear old pansy milbank (jean stapleton) - that last scene is beautiful when they dance on the street.travolta had great help in other actors. andie macdowell is so beautiful and likable, william hurt is great as usual, late robert pastorelli shows his talent. jean stapleton and teri garr are also good, but my favorite supporting actor in this movie is bob hoskins as the tabloid owner.so we've got here a solid movie about people with a warm story also and attractive cast. just don't take this movie seriously and i can guarantee you'll have fun.

this is one of my favorite "capra-esque" comedies. this movie is just meant to be enjoyed, not deconstructed, microscopically analyzed. it's not religious commentary. it's fun. it's fantasy. the surprisingly negative comments (imho) reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think must be a part of every movie.others have described travolta's role (it's the reason you'll watch the movie over and over) and the excellent supporting cast (including sparky!).sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; sometimes a movie is just fun.enjoy!

john travolta was excellent as "michael" in the movie by the same name. i don't think a better portrayal could have been done. the movie was funny, yet touching. michael is a very "human angel" (if their is such). andie macdowell is superb in her role as a reporter, as she goes from disbelief to belief. bill hurt and robert pastorelli are great as fellow reporters, each bent on proving the hoax of the angel on earth. each of the supporting cast is wonderful, especially the older woman (i do not know her screen name), who plays michael's mother! one of the cutest movies i have seen in years... i could watch this movie dozens of times!

i really enjoyed this movie for what it is: a funny little film that doesn't take itself too seriously. plot summaries are available everywhere so i won't go into details. michael isn't about a complex plot anyway. it just builds on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful road trip.john travolta's performance as a chain-smoking, lady-loving, bar-brawling, pie-eating angel is just perfect. and who doesn't love sparky?watch this if you want to have a few laughs and a overall good time. highly recommended.

angels are a bit of an american obsession, but are often rather boring. they are the messengers of god, and also the arc angels are great warriors (lucifer being the toughest and best looking until he was kicked out of heaven).so what happens if you don't believe in anything, let alone angels and you are sent to investigate an angel story, only to meet one with wings and less than angelic attitude.maybe that is what america needs, being a puritan is different from being good. michael is a rude, obnoxious, womanizing messenger of heaven who will fulfill your wishes, and make you care enough about the world that you will be touched.funny, but not greatly so, touching but not overly sentimental, intelligent without being clever...it is just a good simple, small comedy. watch on a lazy sunday afternoon.

possibly the best john travolta role ever. saturday night fever was a great movie & role, but a long time ago. i can't think of many of his movies or roles i've even liked, and it's easy to think of rotten ones. he can do meanies like in pulp fiction, but he makes the perfect funky angel, and it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better (equally slobby) job with it. plot summaries are available everywhere, but the plot isn't the point. just go for the ride and enjoy the cleverness of the little funnies along the way. there is nothing to dislike about this movie, unless one is searching for something profound. i wish there were more movies like this. we need a break from deep or awesome or grisly or complex or hysterical.

1996's michael is warm and winning comedy-fantasy that features one of my favorite performances from the john travolta library. travolta gives one of his breeziest and most likable performances as michael, an archangel whose quiet existence at the home of a lonely innkeeper named pansy (jean stapleton) is disrupted when pansy reports michael's presence in her home to a "national enquirer"-like newspaper and the editor (bob hoskins) sends reporters (william hurt, andie mcdowell, robert pastorelli) to the motel to check it out. hurt, mcdowell, and pastorelli are quite good as the jaded news staffers who have a hard time accepting they've met an angel but this is travolta's show and he rules as the pot-bellied, sugar-eating, cookie-smelling, pie-loving, aretha-loving, bull-chasing michael, an angel who just isn't what you think you of when you think of angels. and you have to love the scene in the bar when he and the ladies dance to "chain of fools". i love this movie more and more every time i watch it and it's mainly because of the completely winning performance from john travolta.

the title of the film seems quite appropriate given the persona of the lead character, fanda. he's an older man living in the late autumn of his life, yet frolics about as a jubilant school boy who's just entered a spring meadow. the frailties of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions to him. his wife supports this idea when she observes, "fanda laughs at funerals and death." in other words, death is not something fanda takes too seriously; he has more important things to do than worry about what already is inevitable. life, however, and the pursuit of living life to its fullest, is the philosophy that governs fanda's existence. he is not one to merely exist, but must live for each day and each passing moment, for tomorrow is not guaranteed. the film seems to make a strong commentary about living as though there is no tomorrow, let alone death. too many people take life much too seriously and consequently miss out on the actual living part of life. fanda's wife for example; she's so worried about preparing for death, not in some religiously connotative way, but in a far too practical, even lifeless way that she forgets how to smile, laugh and just have a good time. her humanity seems to have transformed into zombie auto-pilot mode. fanda, to the contrary, is perhaps too blithe and absent-minded for his own good. he needs a person like his wife, emilie, to help balance him. it's as though fanda possesses the invincible spirit of a child, like a kid trapped in an older man's body. he is introduced as the adventurous type; he pretends to be people he's not in order to get gain, squanders money, factiously lies and is always up for a good laugh. deep-down, though, he is a kind-hearted and gentle old man who wishes to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife. the two off-set each other quite nicely, though neither one of them truly appreciates the binary quality of their relationship until they metaphorically chance upon death: meaning, their divorce. it is during this courtroom scene that fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love. his wife emotionally recalls all of his flaws, yet is tenderly drawn to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior. in this moment of her forgiving him, fanda realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife bonkers and makes an internal commitment to make her happy. ironically, though, after making this commitment he becomes what his wife later calls, "a living corpse." the life-blood within him drains away as he becomes more like her¬óa zombie going through day-to-day motions. he doesn't seem to live anymore, but exist. for example, he gives up his zany pranks, doesn't squander money, quits smoking on account of his wife (not his health), and overall, just acquiesces to whatever she wants of him. succinctly put, he changes on account of wanting to make her happy. thus, the binary quality of their relationship begins to slowly vanish. realizing that her husband is not who he used to be, there is a part of emilie that misses the old fanda. she misses her husband's aloofness and the fights they used to have, because it was in those moments that they were truly living, not just simply existing. i believe the filmmakers were trying to get across a specific message here; that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient, but often times will take sacrifice and endurance to wade through the seemingly bad times. the possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live for every moment. life is often taken for granted, but when threatened with death¬óbe it literal or figurative¬ópeople awake from their ungrateful slumbers and are aroused to start living life to its fullest. it's as though they are scared that they'll never live again, so they better make the most of it while they have it. fanda and emilie had been married 44 years with fights along the way, but it wasn't till they were both threatened with the possibility of death-like-separation that they began to show their true colors. as the old maxim goes, "love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation." they both begin to see what matters most in life and that is the people they meet along the way. more importantly, the intimate relationships they make with their significant others.

the main cast:vlastimil brodsk√Ω .... frantisek h√°na stella z√°zvorkov√° .... em√≠lie h√°nov√° stanislav zindulka .... edadirector vladimir michalek gives this charming story of elderly folks enchanting twists that make the characters appealing, really universal.frantisek hana is retired and on a pension, his previous occupation unknown. he lives in a very nice apartment with his wife of forty-four years, emilie. his son jara covets the spacious apartment as a problem-solver as he needs to house one of his ex-wives and several of their children. the son isn't a vicious schemer, just a guy with one past spouse too many and a blind eye to the attachment his dad has for the flat (which he moved into after relinquishing a previous residence to the son).hana and his also elderly close friend, ed, spend there more than ample free time doing small con jobs not for money but for the pleasure of putting one over on easily duped folks like estate agents. a favorite ploy is for hana to act the part of a retired divo of new york's metropolitan opera returning home in need of a sprawling mansion. ed is his companion as gullible realtors fall all over themselves proffering chauffeured limousines and fine french restaurant meals in hope of a lucrative sale.when not engaged in well-planned scams, the duo engage in quick ploys such as pretending to be railroad security agents so as to snatch kisses from breathless and ticketless teens trying to sneak onto trains. chaste kisses, that is: there's no lechery here.hana's long-suffering wife is obsessed with saving enough money to insure that the couple, individually and jointly, have a grand funeral, an event the life-loving frantisek is in no hurry to experience.disagreements about money and frantisek's promiscuous disposition of marital funds lead to a crisis whose resolution rings both real and endearing. michalek fishes for the viewer's emotions but he does it openly, honestly and effectively."autumn spring," subtitled of course, is a product of an increasingly vibrant czech cinema. it wasn't shown widely in the u.s. but its availability on dvd will, hopefully, bring this affecting flick to a wide audience. sadly, brodsky recently succumbed to cancer so this movie is a valedictory to a fine actor who imbued his character with a passion for life's pleasures that must have reflected the actor's own values.9/10.

i found this film to be one of those great heart-warming gems. the story line is tightly woven and the character development throughout fantastic! i am a big fan of non-us films anyway and this is right up there with: "happenstance," "the closet" even "king of hearts." vlastimil brodsky as fanda, is fantastic. it is a love story in the true sense of loving life and the twists and turns it takes to get the viewer to understand/enjoy fanda's view of life (which nearly costs himmore than he is prepared to give) are wonderful. his co-star stelle zazvorkova is unforgettable as his fed-up wife. i highly recommend this movie for the whole family--my children loved it.

"autumn spring" tells of the misadventures of a dapper, walrus faced, 78 (approx) year old czech man who haplessly befuddles and bemuses all who know him with his mischievous ways while his wife meticulously plans her funeral. centerpiece hana (brodsk√Ω) shows us how to get babes to kiss you when your 78 and how to cop a feel in an elevator and get thanked for it as he pranks his way from day to day in this warm and glowing look at old age and one man's creative, amusing, but socially unacceptable ways of enjoying life while refusing to be relegated to the old folk's home. "autumn spring" is a plodding, subtle comedy with messages for all ages which will have the greatest appeal with more mature foreign film buffs. (b+)

this film just won the best film award at the cleveland international film festival. it's american title apparently is autumn spring. the acting is superb. the story takes you into the life of an elderly man who takes what life deals him and spikes it up a little bit. abetted by his best friend (and partner in not-so-serious crime) he puts people on at every opportunity but still often reveals his heart of gold. his longsuffering wife has come to her wits end and makes a life-changing decision which is heartbreaking to watch. the resolution of the story is beautiful.

not much to say other than it is simply a masterpiece. this film contains a myriad of messages that all should take to heart. especially- women do not squelch your man's dreams -honor them -that's why you loved him in the first place! those who plan for death will live in the grave. those who carpe diem will awaken those who live in fear. even our lord spoke of this when he chastised the the one who buried his talent in fear that he might make a mistake and displease the master. take a risk, get out of the boat and you will walk on water. life is a journey that does not end in the grave but in our minds and souls.

this is a fantastic film. h√°na is a very old guy with a very young heart. he knows how to live his live fully everyday by teaming up with his friend making pranks on just about everything, even his own death. while his wife can't deal with his "irresponsible" behavior, she also knows that it's exactly why she loves her husband for almost half century. i would love to hang out with this old guy because he knows how to enjoy live and never fear of death. he is joyful, witty, mischievous, and never boring. vlastimil brodsk√Ω brilliantly played h√°na at the age of 79. every look from his eyes and every move from his aging muscles deliver so much about the character to the audience. this is a film that leaves a big smile on my face afterwards, and it makes me look at my own live a little closer. tomorrow i am gonna go and buy myself a mansion and have some fun. if h√°na can, so can i. but i think i will skip the smoking part.

to qualify my use of "realistic" in the summary, not many old folks i know go around pretending to be famous maestros, blind people, etc. -- nor have i ever been elderly. those minor issues out of the way, the relationships between the characters in this film and the emotions expressed therein were completely realistic and genuine. in fact, though we're not yet 30, i could see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife in the interactions between the main character and his wife. for those that don't die young (there's a great line in the movie about this, when the two best friends are talking about dying young, and one of them says--and i'm paraphrasing, we missed our chance--we'll just have to stick it out), we'll all be where these characters are some day. i know many movie-goers would prefer to be swept *away* from reality as opposed to being *faced* with it, but even they might enjoy the sweet reminder of our mortality--and the importance of living life to the fullest--that this film is.

some people think this was a rather bad tv series, with cheesy effects. (considering it was filmed between 1977-1979) but really, look back at those years and think, "we didn't have computers back then." so if you think about it, it's a rather good tv series.i always figured bad ratings killed the show, but no. the network did. they canceled out their theme as "the superhero network" and abandoned a short lived spider-man series. if it had gone on, it probably would have run well into the 80's, and if it was really lucky (and i mean really lucky), the early 90s.and no one wanted to pick this series up.anyways, jolly old (or young) nicholas hammond, of the sound of music fame, is brought to the tv screen as peter parker, the secret identity of the amazing spider-man. along the series, peter deals with a clone, a beautiful girl from a foreign country, and a corrupt politician.while the series is way out of timeline (being that peter is already graduated from university, and thats when he gets bit, and uncle ben is already dead,) the audience is treated to action, suspense, and the attitude that the characters have towards peter and his alter ego, spider-man.while it's also slightly disappointing that robert. f simon looks nothing like j.j.jameson, it's not so disappointing that betty grant isn't betty grant, but a hot african american girl (who reminds me of halle berry, who is one of the hottest women on the planet) so really, this one wasn't so bad.but considering the time, and how much drama they packed into this one, it kind of foreshadows what bad tv is today. either way, it's entertaining, even for today.8/10

leland follows the story of leland p. fitzgerald (ryan gosling), a disaffected teenager who has apparently murdered a severely retarded peer, the brother of a girl he was dating. the issue is not whether he did it or not ¬ñ leland admits to it, straight away ¬ñ but rather, why. interestingly, rather than a crime drama, leland becomes a character story, examining why people do what they do ¬ñ not necessarily the easiest ground to till.and leland features the required indie group of screwed-up people. aside from the title character, there's also pearl (don cheadle), who is his teacher at the juvenile correctional facility and who sees straight off that leland is different. we meet leland's distant and egotistical father (kevin spacey in an extended cameo), who never seems emotionally stirred in any way by what his son did. but the real flavorings come out when we immerse ourselves in the pollards, the family of the retarded child. first, there's leland's girlfriend becky (jena malone), a drug addict who can't keep herself clean; her sister julie (michelle williams), perhaps the most normal person in the film, who merely seeks to get away from it all; and allen harris (chris klein), a young man who lives with the pollards and is julie's boyfriend. lastly, there's ryan (michael welch), whom all the others call goofball, who cannot communicate and seems barely aware of his surroundings.leland focuses primarily on its eponymous protagonist, but the movie slowly ¬ñ occasionally too slowly ¬ñ burrows into everyone's lives, asking the chief question, why do people do what they do? while leland discusses it openly in a journal pearl allows him to keep, examining notions of good and bad and personal responsibility, all the characters at some point in the film face a moment where they must make the fundamental choice of their own happiness or another's, perhaps the most basic choice any human can make. and the movie takes a good look at what goes into those choices, and the consequences of them.in the beginning of the film, you're simply struck by the depth of the cast. spacey. cheadle. gosling. michelle williams. even chris klein ¬ñ these are people who for the most part tend to elevate any film they are in, and putting them all together makes for a heady brew. for a space in the middle the film seems to stall, sputtering along as it unfolds; it looks for a while as if it will be content merely to ask questions and not supply any answers. but when we arrive at the home stretch and the movie starts to hit its stride and come together, leland becomes a quietly powerful piece of film-making. leland's explanation of the world and his actions, in the end, bring every story into focus, and all the investment you've made in the film pays off.saying ryan gosling is excellent is like saying a sunny day is nice. at this point in his career it's redundant ¬ñ this is one of the finest young actors working today, and it is a pleasure to watch him craft what could have been an unlikable character into a thought-provoking protagonist. gosling employs such subtlety here that it hardly seems like acting; he has to face off most of the film opposite don cheadle, whom we know has the goods, and he not only holds his own, he elevates cheadle's game as well. cheadle himself is in top notch form, imbuing pearl with a fully-rounded humanity ¬ñ for good and bad. spacey is kind of one-note, but that's the character, and he handles it excellently. i was surprised by chris klein; with this level of acting, i thought he would be buried in the mix, but he gives probably the turn of his career so far. terrific work all around.leland is a bit of a downer, and again, it's draggy in spots. but it finishes strongly and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer (on this one, anyway). there's also a subtle commentary on racism in the film (in leland's first day in juvenile hall class, he's the only white person in the room) that, like much of the movie, is very effectively handled. i wouldn't go so far as to call this required viewing ¬ñ some might find it too slow or too odd ¬ñ but i thought it was one of the better films i've seen in a while, far stronger and more satisfying than most fare out there. i'd recommend it ¬ñ with the above caveats ¬ñ if for no other reason than to watch gosling further perfect his craft.

i noted that the official imdb review refers to leland as a sociopath. i believe that this diagnosis is manifestly and profoundly incorrect.this is a movie about sadness, and about the ability of one particular teenage boy to see sadness in daily life, as it lies in wait around every corner, in advance of the unfolding of the lives that it impacts. a sociopath is a person who cannot empathize with others, and who, while understanding the difference between right and wrong, does not care about this difference. a sociopath is a subject who places himself or herself at the center of that subject's universe, with total disregard for the impact that the subject's actions have for those around him or her. one of the defining characteristics of a sociopath is that a true sociopath lacks the ability to feel empathy -- lacks the ability to feel that which others feel, and does not correlate changes in the moods of others as the result of that sociopath's actions with those actions. a sociopath cannot feel the pain of others, or understand that the pain of others is the result of the sociopath's own actions. a sociopath is a person who is not completely formed. a vital chunk is missing from the psychological and emotional makeup of a true sociopath, rendering the sociopath immune to "talking therapy" and other treatment modalities that involve human interaction and the exploration of personal feelings. sociopathy is devastating, even when the subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment aimed at containing the damage that the sociopath can do to others. many sociopaths function more or less normally and never raise a blip on the radar of the criminal justice system, although they tend to leave a trail of emotional debris in their wakes.leland fitzgerald is no sociopath. he is a person who is blessed (or cursed) with the ability to foresee what he considers to be the inevitable consequences and outcomes of human interactions. leland literally sees sadness written into the eyes and faces of people around him, as he slowly assimilates and internalizes the philosophy that life is about loss, and that people slowly succumb to the inevitable and inexorable fact that, for want of a better metaphor, things fall apart. people who fall in love and who kiss and cuddle today turn into "pathetic" elderly couples. the electricity in the eyes of leland's "mother" (a wealthy new york socialite who loves leland and who invites him into the home that she shares with her family when he arrives in new york city, alone and determined to remain in the city at the age of 12) fades as she explains to him, on the last of his visits to new york city, that she learned that her husband had been cheating on her all the time, that she got a divorce, that having one's heart broken happens to everybody, and that such loss is an inevitable part of growing up. her eyes still reflect light, but the electricity that once illuminated them is gone. this scene -- this explanation, late is it is in coming -- is crucial to understanding why leland commits a seemingly savage, senseless crime (killing the retarded younger brother of his ex-girlfriend). leland knows what lies ahead for this little boy -- a lifetime of unattainable goals, of being taught only words that signify danger, of never knowing the love of another human being, of never feeling such love, and of never connecting with another person. more than any other character in this movie, this little boy personifies everything that leland sees as being inevitable and horrifying about the world. leland's act -- killing this little boy -- is, for leland, an act of mercy, committed because this was the one thing that he could do in a world in which actions cannot change outcomes. whereas a true sociopath knows that actions can and do change outcomes but does not care about the harm inflicted on others by those actions, leland does care. what most people view as a barbaric and horrifying act is, in leland's eyes, the only decent thing that he can do to alleviate the suffering of just one person.it would be comforting to be able to present this as an explanation of leland's actions -- comforting, but incomplete. for in the end, "blame" for leland's actions lies elsewhere. as is so often the case, there are no easy explanations and no balm to apply to the outraged soul. why did leland not learn something that even the most pessimistic people usually acknowledge -- that sometimes -- just sometimes -- people do remain in love, and that relationships do succeed, and that even the saddest lives are transformed? for leland, there is no middle ground, no inner core to which he can retreat and regroup. there is only pain and sadness. one is tempted to blame his arrogant and thoroughly unpleasant father -- the brilliant writer (played by kevin spacey) -- for not being there at critical times during leland's development, but given this man's thuggish nastiness, that may have been a blessing.in the end, this viewer was moved by a tremendous sense of sadness. why was leland doomed to view the world through a veil of pessimism and depression? there is a maturity to leland's character -- present, for example, when he repeatedly insists that nobody was to blame for his girlfriend breaking up with him -- that is both stoic and heartbreaking. stoic, in that it is absolutely genuine, notwithstanding the heated denunciations of leland's teacher. but heartbreaking, in that it is born not so much of understanding as of despair. leland's indifference to his fate is merely a reflection of the utter certainty of his belief that nothing really matters. nothing that he does can change his fate.this is not sociopathy on display. this is, if anything, its polar opposite......

one wonders about the state of a society that produce a father like albert t. fitzgerald, who we first meet on a plane, as he is heading toward the place he abandoned a long time ago, and where he left a wife and a child who is now accused of murdering a mentally challenged boy. when we first see him, he has caught a headline in the paper the woman in front of him is reading. rather rudely, he asks her if he could have the newspaper, and the lady offers other sections. well, that's not what he asked, what he wants the woman to do, is to give him the front section she is reading.matthew ryan hoge wrote and directed this disturbing film that reflects, in many ways, our society as it is today. in fact, mr. hoge is pointing out exactly at what is wrong with it.the film presents leland, a teen ager who can't even differentiate between fantasy and reality. it's evident that killing a human being, even the sweet and innocent boy who hasn't done anything to deserve it, will have fatal consequences, not only for himself, but for his own family, and the family of the slain boy. in fact, leland seems to have no idea about what motivated him to commit the crime for he does not show any repentance about it.it's obvious leland has been traumatized by his parents divorce. his own father is an aloof man who couldn't care less about him. it's pearl, the teacher in the juvenile detention center who sees the turmoil inside the young man and wants to help, but unfortunately, he doesn't have a chance.the best thing in the film is don cheadle, a great actor who always delivers. the ensemble cast does good work under mr. hoge's direction. kevin spacey has a good opportunity playing the egotistical father of the accused murderer and makes us detest him for being an arrogant idiot.although a bit long, the film leaves us with more questions than what it answered.

''wallace & gromit in the curse of the were-rabbit'' is the same type of animation and from the same creators of ''chicken run'', but the story now is other: wallace, a inventor who loves cheese and his smart dog gromit who is always helping wallace in his problems,are trying to keep the rabbits away from everybody's vegetables,since there is in their town, an annual giant vegetable competition. but when wallace tries an invention he did, to make the rabbits avoids vegetable, the one who is going to be cursed is him. before watching this movie i didn't knew that these two characters already existed and were famous.i loved gromit, and i think he is one of the coolest dogs i already saw.aka "wallace & gromit-a batalha dos vegetais" - brazil

my only problem with the curse of the were-rabbit is that the movie does not take the time to properly introduce wallace and gromit to those not familiar with park's short films. strangely, "a close shave" manages to do this with a lot less time to spare. still, i loved seeing the boys back in action and loved all the new characters, human and otherwise. i especially loved ralph fiennes voice as the scheming victor quartermaine. it is also interesting to see the series on the large screen. the workmanship with the clay characters really stands out. it's a hoot, and great for the whole family! i buy very few dvds but i have every wallace and gromit and will happily add this one.

in 1989, aardman animations introduced the two heros in the grand day out. in 1993, they fought an evil penguin in the wrong trousers. and in 1995, they had to rescue sheep from an evil robot dog in a close shave. in 2005, they're back and they are going to fight something that used to be cute and cuddlely in the curse of the were-rabbit. in this full feature film, wallace and gromit work in anit-pesto, a pest-control business. there's going to be a giant vegetable competition, but rabbits keep eating the neighbors vegies. wallace and gromit takes care with that problem. but wallace had an idea. he will brainwash the bunnies with his machine. after doing that, something suddenly eats all of the vegies in the neighborhood and it's big. it's up to wallace and gromit to save the day. as a fan of these two characters, i was impressed. it kept what the 3 previous chapters had and instead adding a lot of hollywood actors for voice-overs, they put a no name cast to the job and boy, they did a fantastic job. wallace and gromit has not changed. wallace is still the cheese-loving freak like he always was and gromit is the silent newspaper reading dog. also, the script was not too shabby like other family movies were. there is a twist of who the were-rabbit really is. the direction from nick park (the director of the 3 previous chapters) does a really good job with the storyline. instead of adding the hollywood formula in it, he just took the style of the previous chapters and adds a bit of a dark fantasy twist in it. well done, nick. the rabbits are also funny and adorable, but the funniest rabbit in the movie is one who has the mix of wallace in him. the characters were not bad and they weren't annoying, but they'll never top wallace and gromit. the animation is indeed fantastic and wonderful. i've never seen a clay-animated movie that is so amazing since chicken run. overall, fans of the two knuckleheads (including the teens) will love this fantastic film. it is a well done film that should get an oscar next year. hooray, wallace and gromit. 10/10

this was very good, except for two things which i'll mention at the end. the animation is great, highlighted by nick park and company's trademark of exaggerated teeth and mouths of the characters, which make you laugh almost every time you see someone. the color was magnificent, too.the best part of the film, however, is the clever comedy woven throughout. this is another of these animated films in which there is so much to see and hear each frame that it would require many viewings to catch all the gags. it's just a funny exaggerated look at the oddball "wallace" and his silent-and-smart dog "gromit." along the way, it pokes fun people who get carried away with their vegetable gardens, something akin to how the obsessive dog lovers were pictured in "best of show."my only complaints were two typical traits of today's films, animated or not: 1 - let's make the cleric in the film look like a total idiot; 2 - let's overdo the final action scene with the predictable result but way overdone. those aside, this is still a very amusing film that should provide a lot of laughs to many people and a movie to enjoy multiple times.

having just come home from my third viewing of the curse of the were-rabbit, i decided to jump on imdb and see what others thought. i noticed a lot of brits loved it, while those in america just didn't get it. that really doesn't come as any shock, as america doesn't get what "english" is.wallace and gromit are very english. middle class english, in fact, with a hint of eccentricity throw in for good measure. the film is a lot like our two heroes; simple and unassuming. it has a nice and gentle plot so the children don't get lost, yet there's enough beef there to keep the adults amused too. there's some light innuendo (which seems have to have offended the evangelic - oh noes, drama!) but there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment. when people get offended by a plasticine anus, you know the world's messed up...one quick note to those (all american so far that i have seen) who think chicken run is a better film: chicken run was made to pander to your sense of humour, and i think it suffered because of it. curse of the were rabbit is witty, english, and intelligent. thomas the tank engine's film was ruined because it was made to please the americans and i'm glad nick park did not let that happen to another great british institution.to sum up: you can keep your chicken runs, your shreks, your madagasga's - that kind of crude, crass, slapstick comedy just doesn't compare to the wit and grace that is wallace and gromit in curse of the were-rabbit. english to the core, and long may wallace and gromit stay that way.

wallace & gromit: the curse of the were-rabbit (2005) **** (voices: peter salis, ralph fiennes helena bonham carter)fantastic feats of clay: wallace & gromit save the day! crackin' good entertainment!nick park, the creator of the animated team of wallace & gromit, is a genius. his painstaking art in the form of plasitcine claymation is a unique process involving literally thousands of hours (it takes roughly an 8 hour work day to contribute 3 minutes of action to a film; this foray into feature length storytelling took 5 years!) in making his lovable master & loyal dog team take form is finally on the big screen in the duo's first full-length motion picture and it's cracklin' good (to coin a phrase from wallace's usual reply to all things good!) park, who co-directed with steve box and co-wrote with mark burton and bob baker, sends up the horror genre in this rollickingly funny and swift paced action comedy with the geeky inventive wallace (voiced by british vet thespian salis) and his mute yet loyal (and sharper-minded) mutt gromit (all furrowing eyebrows and mouth-less insouciance) have devised a service to their community: pest control ("anti-pesto" as they are known) for the upcoming giant vegetable festival that has the entire town in the mood for all things vegetative a gigante and the biggest pesk are troublesome rabbits eating the crunchy goods. wallace's inventive mind has created a vacuum container that is quick, efficient, and more importantly harmless to the cute vermin that plague the estate of lady campanula tottington (voiced by bonham carter, making a fast-break to be the first lady of stop-motion animation what with her earlier turn in "corpse bride" a few weeks ago), who is housing the competition and is a love interest for the nerdy wallace.the only fly-in-the-ointment is vainglorious, bombastic loud-mouth and jerk victor quartermaine (voiced by fiennes, his first attempt in the animated arts coming across as a patrick stewart lunged braggard with hilarious results), a badly toupeed wearing macho moron who is plotting to marry lady tottington for her riches while he is a chief competitor to w&g's humane attempts by resorting to his trusty guns and nasty bulldog.to add insult to injury the duo are facing a terrible plight in the form of a huge were-rabbit (the titular monster a nice nod to both universal and hammer horror flicks) that is terrorizing the village and devouring every veggie in sight. the two set out to trap and dispose of the creature but there is more than meets the eye as things progress.relentlessly funny and with such amazing elastic, and kinetic energy to his wonderful clay counterparts, park and box have created a truly magical and highly entertaining film with so much amazingly detailed production design to their little world that it may take more than one screening to absorb just how much effort in their blood, sweat and tears have gone into making this instant classic for children of all ages. wallace, the cheese loving balding inventor, could easily be homer simpson's uk cousin with his rotund body and constant knack for getting things wrong while attempting to do the right thing; his heart is in the right place but his head is in the clouds. his sweet crush for lady tottington (resembling a pre-plastic surgery carol burnett) who is a head taller than our hero will perhaps remind those of their first unrequited love with a smile of awkward admission. his rube goldberg-like gift for making the complicated into ease is inspired lunacy that fans will recall from the earlier shorter films "the wrong trousers", "a close shave" and "a grand day out".but it is in my opinion the wise, silent and long-suffering gromit, his poached egg eyes of slow-burns and disbelief at what is transpiring, is one of the best animated characters ever created with such an amazing arsenal of exasperated, mouthless expressions and subtle nuances that most live-action actors would kill to accomplish in the attempt of conveying dismay, concern, grief, genuine surprise and relief. his final chase ¬ñ a signature of the immensely popular comic team ¬ñ is ingeniously set and quickly improvised especially his literal dog-fight with the equally soundless bulldog with tenacity, wit and a chuck jones fueled smartness that would have bruce willis and arnold schwarzenegger green with envy.wallace and gromit match the best of laurel & hardy, abbott & costello and any other classic comedy team that comes to mind; here's hoping their longevity continues on screen for just as long as their predecessors. the waiting is most eager.

there are a few aspects to park's movies, and in particular wallace & gromit, that i would say make them so great. the first is subtlety and observation, the flagship of which is the character of gromit. he doesn't speak, he doesn't make any noise, all he has are his eyes, brow, and body posture, and with these he commands the film. park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression. the comedy and the emotion is conveyed through the subtlest of movements and it works superbly well.watching the movie you have to be aware of the entire screen. normally you'll be guided to things in the movies, the screen won't be cluttered too much, there won't be many things to take your eyes away from the main clue or action. park seems to need to look the other way with his movies. he throws extra content at his audience, there's action in the background, to the side of the screen, even off screen, and there's just about always something in the foreground to catch your eye. his movies are about multiple viewing and discovery, they're layered with jokes and ancillary action.throughout this film there are layers of things happening on screen, jokes in the foreground maybe on a jar label and background shadows that give away action. you can imagine that for park the movies has always been an event, and the movies he loves are ones which he wants to watch again and again. this is what shows in his movies, and in through his most beloved characters.then there are the bizarre and wacky inventions which wallace make, something which is reflected in the storyline and the twists and turns of the plot, everything is bizarre and off the wall, yet it seems so perfectly normal in this world. you can imagine that inside park is the mind of wallace.there's also one more thing that make these movies so unique, and that's the modelling and precise hand animation. i must admit i was concerned when i knew dreamworks was involved in the making of this movie, and i thought that they would bring their computer animation experience to the forefront. what i was scared of was wallace & gromit becoming cgi entities, or at the smallest, cgi being used to clean up the feel that the modelling brought to the movie.not so. you can still see thumbprints and toolmarks on the characters, and far from distracting from the movie, this just adds so much real feeling to it and a feeling of physical depth to the characters and the scene on screen.so what of the movie? well i must say that the plot twist was something i had thought about well before the film was in the cinema and it came as no surprise, but that did not affect my enjoyment one little bit. actually watching the twist unfold and the comic timing of the discovery and reactions was everything, and it had me just as sucked in as if it was a thriller, yet all the time i was laughing.watching the movie was fascinating in various ways. to see the animation completed, how wild the inventions are, how wallace is going to get into trouble and gromit get him out, where all the cross references are in the movie, and where all the jokes are! i must admit afterwards talking with my friends i couldn't believe how much i had missed.there's something different in this movie than with the others, there's a new level of adult humour in here, and i don't mean rude jokes (although there are a couple that are just so british you can't help laughing), i mean jokes that simply fly over kids heads but slap adults in the face. the kind you are used to seeing come out of somewhere like pixar. this just adds even more appeal to the movie.okay though, let me try and be a bit negative here. i didn't notice the voices in this movie, you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can recognise them? well i was just too wrapped up in the movie to care or to notice who they were...okay, that's not negative. let me try again. the main plot wasn't as strong and gripping as i'd expected, and i found myself being caught up in the side stories and the characters themselves...again...that's not a bad thing, the film was just so much rich entertainment.i honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie, probably the worst thing i could say is that the title sequence at the end is quite repetitive...until the final title! really, that's the worst i can say.the story is a lot of fun, well set-up, well written, well executed. there's lot's of fantastic characters in here, not just wallace & gromit. there's so much happening on screen, so many references and jokes (check out the dresses of lady tottingham), cheese jokes everywhere, jokes for all the family. the characters are superbly absorbing and you'll find that you've taken to them before you realise. there's just so much in this movie for everyone.there's so much i could say and write about, but i know it will quickly turn into a backslapping exercise for park and aardman, it would also just turn into a series of "this bit was really funny" and "there's a bit when...", and what i would rather do is tell you that this is a superb movie, to go see it, and to experience the whole thing for yourselves. i will say though that the bunnies are excellent!

i really refused to see this movie. i refused to go with the school and i refused to go with my parents. just by looking at the trailer it looked stupid, to me anyway. one of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and he offered me 2 choices, "the dukes of hazzard" or "wallace and gromit: the curse of the were-rabbit." it took me 17 minutes to decide. time was running out. i had to choose. it came up on the screen "few" as in a few tickets left. by the time we had to line up and get our ticket, only one of us could go in. i desperately wanted nicholas to go in to see it. but he forced me. i crossed my arms and was very moody and disappointed that i was going in to see this childishness. i walked in, sat in the only seat that was available and prepared for the movie! must say i was very surprised that i sat through that masterpiece! it was amazing. i don't know what i was complaining about. the clay animation was by far the most best i've ever seen in my life. the story was brilliant. about a rabbit disrupting and crashing a carnival that had been planned for over 500 years. basically anti pest control are protecting the people who are competing in the vegetable competition. anti pesto known as wallace and gromit (who are in charge of this business) try to keep all the rabbits away from the vegetable carnival. i wont say anymore. it's just too good to tell. i'll admit that the whole idea of a were-rabbit is ab-it unbelievable and ab-it childish, but nick park adds substance to it which what makes everyone love it. i mean, there wont be a 10 foot rabbit on the loose and there definitely wont be 8 foot werewolves as said in " dog soldiers." then again, were-rabbits and werewolves aren't actual creatures. but either way, it worked out very well. the jokes also were more grown up. the kids wont get some of the jokes. it goes way above their heads. it had a lot of british jokes in there. if you love british humor, this is the movie for you.i also loved the cast and the voices. everything about the movie is so incredibly well done. the direction and pacing was absolutely...fantastic! i recommend this to fans of the old wallace and gromit shorts (and no, i haven't seen them yet), and i recommend it to fans who liked "shrek" and "shrek 2 and most importantly, i recommend it to the people who love clay animation. cracking good movie! 10/10

what-ho! this one is jolly good. i say jolly good, ol' chap. or should i say "ol' bean"? my mastery of british terminology is a little dusty. anyway, my biker boots and i walked into this screening with no prior viewing experience of wallace and gromit. i'm happy to say that my boots and i walked out pleased to have made their acquaintance.while not as adult-accessible as toy story, w & g still manages to be clever enough to provide the grown ups with a little humor that will most definitely soar over the heads of the young 'uns who are too busy guffawing at the were-rabbit's belches to have any clue that something is amiss. i highly suggest that you pay close attention any time you see books or words on the screen because there are quick glimpses of puns that you'll miss if you aren't paying attention. my favorite is a book of monsters that refers to the loch ness monster as "tourist trappus." if you've ever been known to say, "i can really relate to kevin federline," or if you're just illiterate then not only will you miss out on these jokes, but you probably should be spending your time learning to read instead of going to movies. consider this a public service announcement.the most impressive aspect about w & g is its clay animation. thanks to the tedious process, it took five years to finish the film! according to the press notes, there were some days when the optimum goal was to merely accomplish 10 seconds of completed film. folks, i sometimes have trouble finding the motivation to finish responding to a handful of emails or adding captions to pictures for my reviews (a point that is proved by a lack of pictures in this review); so i can't even imagine having the required patience for that.i really like the rough, hands-on quality of the claymation figures. the fact that you can see fingerprints in the clay is a nice, personal touch. how can you not be impressed with clay characters that show more expression and emotion than paul walker and keanu reeves combined? the curse of the were-rabbit is, as director nick park calls it, the world's first vegetarian horror movie that should entertain both kids and adults alike. relying on (and as a male who prides himself in his shaggy-haired, cool-bearded masculinity i hesitate to use this word) cute and (oh man, i probably shouldn't use this word either) lovable characters rather than outdated m.c. hammer references, w & g is proof that dreamworks can create entertaining animation when it chooses cleverness over the cheap joke.

when wallace and gromit burst onto the scene in their academy award winning short, "a grand day out," they created a fresh new look at claymation. after two more shorts, aardman's dynamic duo returned for this thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie. it has an excellent voice cast, humorous jokes and good animation as only aardman could do! in this movie, wallace and gromit run "anti-pesto," a rabbit removal company. when word gets out about a "were-rabbit" eating all the vegetables in town, a frenzy ensues. of course, victor quartermaine, the town's handsome, toupee-brandishing huntsman, wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the lovely lady tottington...but can our favorite aardman duo save the day before chaos ensues?the jokes, i should say, were hilarious. one point, the villain, victor quartermaine's, booty-crack was showing, prompting a character to cry out: "beware...the moon!!!" vintage aardman!the characters are crisp and hilarious. our favorite aardman team of man and dog entertains us as only they could do, earning them their second oscar (remember "a grand day out?"). helena bonham carter was terrific as the lovely lady tottington, wallace's love interest. ralph fiennes was especially funny and foreboding as the cunning, toupee wearing hunter victor quartermaine. but the one who really stole the show was the priest, whose antics proved to be some hilarious comic relief. hats off to aardman for creating another wallace and gromit masterpiece!

wallace and gromit are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever crafted. the excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes "a grand day out," "the wrong trousers," and also "a close shave" some of the best animated footage ever put on television. winning several oscars and also countless other awards, nick park became quite the popular man in the u.k., yet his impact on the united states has not been big. after the third wallace and gromit short, there was all this speculation about a full-length wallace and gromit movie, yet for years nothing had happened. then in 2000 instead of a full-length wallace and gromit film, we get another brilliant claymation film from nick park, which was chicken run, which almost got nominated for best picture in the academy awards. perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove park to finally work on a wallace and gromit project.5 years later (these kinds of films do take long you know) and a lot of anticipation, wallace and gromit finally hits the big screen. despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign, this movie delivers in so many ways. this film will be a delight for both kids and parents. with tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation, wallace and gromit: curse of the were-rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults. this rather difficult technique is one that only pixar has already perfected and dreamworks has had a lot of trouble doing lately. despite the dreamworks logo slapped onto the poster, this film is mainly from the very creative staff of aardman animations.wallace and gromit are first seen running a business that protects the townspeople's crops from being ruined by rabbits, which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately. their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection. complications arise when wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits into not liking vegetables and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area. it is up to wallace and gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their approval from the townspeople. to add to that, wallace wants to impress lady tottington, which also captured the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of victor. simple plot yes, but there is more than meets the eye, be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way, kind of like in the other wallace and gromit cartoons.in animated films with little dialogue, it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film. despite requiring 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage, the payoff is fantastic. there is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice. even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film. whether it is a creatively placed shot or normal labels put into the funniest position possible, or it is the oh-so-adorable rabbits that is constantly shown in the film, most curse of the were-rabbit's humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late. just picture the movie madagascar, except funnier much fewer pop culture references, and better animation.casting was great, even though in a film with not much dialogue, it was not that important. peter sallis yet again does a wonderful job as wallace, even though in this movie there was no stand-out quote that can be used anytime (the wrong trousers: "it's the wrong trousers gromit, and they've gone wrong!"). ralph fiennes does a superb job as the lead villain victor and also helena bonham carter (known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit "fight club") lends her lovely voice as she plays wallace's love interest. even though nothing could top the final chase in "the wrong trousers," curse of the ware-rabbit did have plenty of action scenes, including one fantastically done chase scene between gromit and victor's evil dog. last but not least, the rabbits really steal the show at some moments. whether it is their cute expressions, their funny movements, or their howling, the rabbits in the film even take some of the glory from the main stars. the funniest rabbit in the movie is the "cursed" rabbit himself, to the very end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter.bottom line: despite not being as memorable as "the wrong trousers", this film is just as good and entertaining as chicken run. unlike almost every movie to come out this year, the movie does not drag at all, clocking in at a short 85 minutes yet containing so much joy and fun, it will leave everyone watching it asking for more. there is very little wrong with the film; it was a pure delight to watch. this film is a total contrast of the decent yet vulgar, uncut, raw movies that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year (40-year-old virgin, wedding crashers, and sin city) and for families and those who want harmless entertainment; that is a good thing. highly recommend, this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we have seen this decade. wallace and gromit: curse of the were-rabbit: totally harmless fun from second 1 to second 5,100.

this first (and hopefully not last) wallace & gromit feature lives up to expectations. there are plenty of jokes (some a bit cheeky) as well as some great tributes to past science fiction movies. with the barrage of awful and formulaic movies being spewed forth from hollywood it's great to see such a great film like this that's enjoyable for almost everyone. if there is any justice it will be top of the box-office and be at least nominated for best animation at the next oscars. the animation is wonderful; the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are great fun. this is one of those films that the whole family can enjoy. charming, clever, fun and well made, what's not to enjoy?

being a "wallace and gromit-fan", i was looking forward for this full-length movie. surprisingly i saw it at the world-premiere in vlissingen (nl), at the film by the sea festival. a wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this very amusing and merry movie. it's about wallace and gromit (whom i believe don't need an introduction) having their own pest-control company in the city which is hosting a giant-vegetable contest in a few days. everyone, including an eccentric baroness, is hoping his or her giant carrot or melon will win the golden carrot. unfortunately the town is plagued by lots of hungry rabbits. this is where w&g come in. the have their own cracking contraptions to control these cute creatures in a human way.it's a very funny and colorful story. anyone who liked the three proceeding short movies of w&g (which are more than great!), will love this full-length movie. nick park really delivered a wonderful and original result with a great sense for humor. like in chicken run, it truly amazes me how he can capture so much story and emotions in just a few frames. "job well done, lad" ;-) oh yeah: the music was fantastic! it really completes the ride. enjoy!

i saw it at a german press screening. without giving too much away: most critics really seemed to like it very much. there was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for that species. from my point of view and until now, it was the funniest movie of the year. it keeps the charm and wit of the three w+g shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies. of course, there are obvious allusions to monster- and werewolf-movies, especially to "an american werewolf in london", "jaws", "king kong" and even to peter jackson's "braindead"/"dead alive", but also to other genres.characterization was better done in "chicken run", but that movie had a complete new "cast" where introduction was necessary. here, you are already able to know the two main characters. so, the new "wallace and gromit"-movie is enjoyed best if you watched (and liked) the shorts already, yet it also works on its own. "chicken run" had the more convenient, but also more "storytelling" plot. instead, this new aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more "isolated" feeling of the w+g shorts. children should also enjoy it very much, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love cute bunnies, this is a must-see for you!!!) and because gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show (children also love dogs... :-) ). but many jokes are thought for a more adult audience (there are even soft sexual allusions in it). the movie manages, like "shrek 1+2" and "the incredibles", to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family, with adding a british and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of american animated movies.the animation is ¬ñ as expected ¬ñ superb, and they kept true to the aardman style because they didn't put in too many digital effects - i realized just a few when it came to wallace's inventions.finally, the score works fine in the movie, although one of the main themes definitely is "borrowed" by randy edelman's "dragonheart" score.the bad thing is: it will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from nick park & co.

this is the kind of film they used to make, amusing, heart-warming, troubling, authentic, with convincing performances by people without nose jobs, boob jobs, eye jobs, in other words real people. shauna macdonald plays the female love interest, and she is so real you want to give her a cuddle at the very least. imagine that, a real girl in a movie, whatever next? hollywood would hate her, because her freshness is a sharp rebuke to every false starlet in tinseltown. this story has the same hilarious feel as sandy mackendrick's classic 'whisky galore', with the gnomic humour of remote scottish islanders puncturing the pretensions of intruders from outside and enjoying a wee dram from time to time (the actual intervals between those times often being rather short). director stephen whittaker displays a rare skill in pulling this off just right, and it is shocking to discover that he died before his film's release, aged only 56, which was clearly a substantial loss to the screen. ulrich thomsen does very well at playing a german rocket scientist who in the late 1930s goes to scarp in the isle of harris to build a small rocket to carry postal packets between the islands. there he falls in love with the alluring macdonald lass, and she reciprocates the affection. some wonderfully colourful local characters decorate the tale, and the film is pure delight. there is of course the threat of imminent war with hitler, and we learn that hitler executed 1000 rocket scientists who refused to build weapons of war, which is a shocking statistic. tragic love is never far from view, but lips must remain sealed in a review as to what happens in the end. this film is a magnificent example of just the kind of films which people in britain should be making. but are they being properly released? in a nation whose tastes have been so corrupted by reality tv shows, where repulsive nonentities have become the national heroes, is there even a market anymore for a film like this? after all, there is no grunting sex, there are no close-ups of suppurating wounds or of anyone's genitals, there are no drugs taken, there are no mindless celebrities prancing around wanting to be looked at, and so one wonders whether there is anything to interest a public which has become so decadent and jaded that only the most extreme sensations can briefly alleviate the tedium of their pointless existence. anyone who is looking for an antidote to the vacuity of contemporary britain can take refuge in this refreshing and honest film.

set just before the second world war, this is a touching and understated romantic story that is loosely based on a real event.it concerns a german rocket scientist gerhart zucher (ulrich thomsen) working in britain in the advent of the second world war. fearing hitler may recall him to germany to assist him preparing for war, zucher and his slippery assistant heinz (eddie marsan) are evacuated by the british authorities to a remote scottish island. they are given the task of building a rocket post box that will enable the islanders to communicate with the mainland.mocked and bullied by the islanders, they set up home with local girl catherine mackay (the stunning shauna macdonald), with whom thomsen begins an affair but complications arise when germany comes calling...the central romance between zucher and catherine is subtle and sincerely played and the supporting cast is a colourful bunch with an array of respected scottish character actors including gary lewis and clive russell.fine cinematography and a brilliant central theme song sung in the local dialect round out this movie.intelligent but undemanding, it is good for a quiet evening in.

an excellent film for those who simply need to switch off and enjoy the beautiful scenery of scotland. based on fact, the film takes you on a journey of love amidst spectacular scenery. the cast are 'dressed down' for the parts they play, so no glamorous costumes or coiffured hair in this film where acting is superb, gritty and down to earth.each character is believable giving a convincing portrayal of island life, beliefs and culture of the time a definite for those who have even the tiniest drop of scottish blood..... as it will tug at the heart strings and stir the soul. something that can be shared with the family and watched time and time again..................a real classic, one that i am sure will walk alongside some of the great films that never die.

i saw this at the 2004 stony brook film festival in ny and it was very warmly received. in this pre-ww2 film, a pair of german rocket scientists are working on the scottish isle of scarp as war looms on the horizon. the characters encountered on the island are priceless in their creation and their portrayal. shauna macdonald is particularly memorableafter getting up to speed on the "scootish" accents, the viewer feel right at home with these folk who watch with amusement as the germans work to link their isle with the mainland via a rocket-based mail delivery. as implausible as it seems, this film was based on an actual story.all in all, a memorable film that will stay with you for some time thanks to its casting, its story or its scenery.

a wonderfully thoughtful and involving movie that leaves an imprint well beyond it's initial liftoff. based on a true story , one of the many "small" stories prior to ww ii , that lend an understanding to the mindsets of the majority of common man cultures, impacted by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future foes, with the darkening of war clouds on the horizon. viewed at the stony brook film festival, the film was enthusiastically received . well written and expertly cast. the characters were most believable and drew one in to experience their trials and tribulations.

the first time i saw brotherhood of satan i was 12 yrs old i saw it in a little town in central washington state it played before tales from the crypt which we left early because my sisters were already scared from the brotherhood of satan. all in all i thought it was a pretty good movie. the beginning was good we had just sat down and that tank did a number on that station wagon.what struck me about the movie was the scenery around the town in which it was filmed it looked almost like the area around chelan wa where i saw the movie especially when they were driving towards the town of hillsboro which is the location of the movie a small town in sw new mexico. i have always liked lq jones and strother martin and also charles bateman who was on get smart another show i like. i gave the movie a 7 and later on when i did get to see tales from the crypt i thought brotherhood of satan was better.

a young couple -- father ben (solid charles bateman), wife nicky (the lovely ahna capri) and their daughter kt (the cute geri reischl of "i dismember mama" fame) -- find themselves trapped in a small california desert town populated by hysterical lunatics. worse yet, there's a pernicious satanic cult that's been abducting little children for their own diabolical purposes. director bernard mceveety, working from an offbeat and inspired script by william welch and l.q. jones ("devil times five" director sean macgregor came up with the bizarre story), relates the compellingly oddball plot at a slow, yet steady pace and ably creates a creepy, edgy, mysterious ooga-booga atmosphere. strother martin delivers a wonderfully wicked and robust performance as doc duncan, who's the gleefully sinister leader of the evil sect. the top-rate cast of excellent character actors qualifies as a substantial asset: jones as gruff, no-nonsense sheriff hillsboro, alvy moore as friendly local toby, and charles robinson as a shrewd, fiercely devout priest jack. john arthur morrill's bright, polished widescreen cinematography, jamie mendoza-nava's spooky score, and the wild, rousing climactic black mass ritual are all likewise up to speed. the idea of having toys come to murderous life is simply ingenious (the opening scene with a toy tank coming real and crushing a family in their car is truly jolting). nice eerily ambiguous ending, too. a pleasingly idiosyncratic and under-appreciated winner.

i was 10 or eleven years old when this movie came out, and it has stayed with me for 35 years since. when the movie came out, all of the theaters in the st. louis area distributed, as a 'lure', a pack of flower seeds that had the movie name, etc. on the front. on the back of the pack it read, in so many words....plant these seeds at midnight. if a white flower grows, you are saved.....but if a red flower grows, you are doomed!!! suffice it to say, that for an eleven year old kid, i did not plant the seeds for fear of what may pop up. here is the spoiler: as the movie starts out, you see a small toy tank moving about in the dirt. on a small road a family is leaving town, and suddenly the camera turns to the tank again, and it is full size. it rolls over the car, and you see bloody limbs protruding from the wreckage, then, just as sudden, the tank is small again.the reason this movie stuck with me for that long, was because i had a exact toy tank as the one in the movie!!!! unfortunately i don't know what happened to it, but i did keep a wary eye on that thing ever since!!!turn out the lights, put in the dvd, make a sandwich, and watch this movie. it is very good!!!

one of the best lesser known occult oriented horror movies of the seventies. it's gritty, exciting, scary, surrealistic here and there and at moments even very smart, which can't be said about many of the movies this kind. i can't help seeing some stinging symbolic and metaphoric points at the seventies society and generation stuff of the time this movie was done. the scriptwriter has obviously been cooking while delivering also some good old "from the crypt" kind of scenes. with a job well done from a creative director the result is entertaining and thought provoking. the simple, yet effective ending specially shows how these things are treated right by those who can.the excellent cast were mostly unknown to me, except l. q. jones as the moody but funny sheriff and strother martin as the town doctor. martin, not surprisingly, always ends up stealing the movie. with that voice and skill he is one of the greatest loonies in movies, for me anyway. what an actor!so, it is a little bit of mystery to me why this movie has not gathered far greater recognition. i think it would deserve almost equal place in the occult horror canon alongside rosemary's baby and the exorcist. one helluva movie!

not everyone likes this movie. it is still one of the best "you have to be thinking" movies about satanism ever made. the fact that it doesn't have mtv-era jump cuts or gore every seven minutes is irrelevant. also, speaking as someone who actually knows satanists, the (spoiler warning!) portion of the film where the brotherhood exchange their old bodies for those of preadolescent children, it has some genuinely scary scenes. the section where (second spoiler alert) strother martin orchestrates the changeover is almost hyper-real in that it uses very few special effects, a hallmark of this film. mceveety was seldom given a big budget but was often effective. it worked in this case, too.

susan sarandon. she made this movie for me. i've never appreciated her acting more than as i did in this movie. she really acted as though she were adele august. i can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who's truly believable. natalie portman as ann august helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie. the movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral.i gave this movie an eight rating, but susan received a ten from me because of her performance. as far as relationship movies go, beaches and terms of endearment had a greater impact on me than this movie, but i highly recommend it.

it¬¥s a movie to see on tv and only once.. i mean, it¬¥s good, but it¬¥s a little too lengthy and the plot is so well-known, it isn¬¥t very original but it isn¬¥t boring. the best thing of the movie are the performances, natalie portman and susan sarandon are great actress and in this movie they have done a great job. i give it a 7.

i was laying in bed, flicking through the channels... and boy do i have channels... 500 of them. with over 70 movie channels, i probably watch a movie on cable, once or twice a month... dvd has spolied me.anyway, i'm flicking through and i come to this movie and because i see natilie portman, i take interest. 110 minutes later i am still interested. how could this be? when i first saw the previews to this movie in the theater i remember making fun of it. i never thought i'd watch it... nevermind like it.the story is based on a book, and you can tell. the movie is very episodic, andit's not like the movie has a great plot, it just sucks you in. may-be its that performances that do it. i'm pretty sure in must have been.this movie was good for no reason...peter's movie rating (out of 10): 7

i was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script. susan sarandon plays the part of a flighty, irrational and possessive mother, who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together. she removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in hollywood. the daughter is dubious, but at first she has no choice--- the bond with mother is pathologically strong.in time the girl sees that the mother is off into flights of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground. she sees her mother go head over heels for a handsome, seductive guy who loves 'em and leaves 'em. she sees that the mother doesn't get it. so how can she look to her mother for guidance?the mother directs the girl to a drama try-out and sees the daughter act out the part of the mother in such a way that a shockingly painful mirror is held up to the fly-by-night mother. this causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified at the impact on the mother and is apologetic, but the lesson takes hold.there is character-growth as the mother realizes her selfish claim on the daughter and eventually is persuaded to let the girl go. it is a touching scene and a valuable lesson, that parents, however emotionally dependent, have to let the child go and become her own separate person.

anywhere but here is not exactly anything new, but the excellent performances by both of the main actresses made it worth watching. sarandon and portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural wisconsin to sunny beverly hills, california, in search of a better life. the main conflict comes from the fact that natalie would much rather have stayed in wisconsin with all of her friends and family, and she felt that she was forced to go to california with her overbearing mother. (spoilers) while it's true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable, susan sarandon and especially natalie portman give performances that are so good that they almost make the material seem new. anywhere but here doesn't cover any new ground, but it does have the rare quality of being able to take overused subject matter and make it fairly interesting again. also seen in this movie is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen in years, seen on natalie portman's face when her mother drops her off on the side of the road and she watches the car fade into the distance. particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot about natalie's mother pressing her to become an actress, as well as a very convincing performance from shawn hatosy as one of natalie's very close cousins from back home. his death is a tragic clich√© almost always seen in movies like this one, but the rest of the film makes up for numerous weaknesses like this. not great, but anywhere but here is definitely worth a look.

chick flick? of course.... been done before? many times.... predictable? yes..... worth watching? you bet! i was delighted with sarandon and portman's portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line. i am a great fan of mother/daughter stories. what makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones are the performances and the character development. although this is not the best of its genre, i will buy it and watch it again. i felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior.

regarded as another one of the recent over-the-top drama's brought upon us by hollywood, this movie excels where others have totally failed(especially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of natalie portman), this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both susan and natalie share. they seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family. they go through so many mother-daughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities. i feel that these two actress' talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar (full of cliche's) and really saved the suffering plot. i would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of the two actresses or such over-the-top drama's.

i thought anywhere but here was a good movie.it stars two wonderful actresses, susan sarandon and natlie portman, which when i heard they were in a movie together i resist watching it.overall, it was a pretty enjoyable movie.it had it's moments where i felt as if they tried to hard, and there was also some really overdone and worn-out material, but there wasn't anything in the movie that i absolutely hated.i even liked how they used the pop-up performance of the uncredited thora birch, and all the little happy/sad moments are touching and effective.if you want to watch this movie, go ahead, because even though i don't recommend it, it's not something you should avoid, and a 5.9 rating seems unfair in my opinion.

this film is about a single mother who is happy go lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible, and her sensible teenage daughter who is undergoing adolescent turmoils."anywhere but here" is an engaging film from beginning to the end. both ann and adele are described well right at the start, so we get to know how different their personalities are. clashes inevitably ensue, and they are engagingly presented. i find myself so drawn to their state of minds and their circumstances. it is as if i am living their lives, feeling what they are feeling.susan sarandon gives another excellent performance in "anywhere but here". she is charismatic, happy go lucky, hedonistic, warm and loving all at once. i have always liked susan sarandon, and i think she is grossly underrated."anywhere but here" is a captivating emotional journey.

the main attraction of anywhere but here is the superb performance of natalie portman. she gave her rather thankless character a lot of much-appreciated emotional depth. susan sarandon, a fine actress, is suitably sincere as the mother figure. i thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable, a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script. i am not saying the script was bad in any way, i am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times. i don't think it was the script writer's fault. the film did suffer from being overlong, and became sometimes unfocused in the longer scenes. the film does look beautiful, with some good direction and excellent performances. all in all, watchable certainly, but maybe more for an older audience. 7/10 bethany cox.

i just wanted to write a quick response to all those people who give this film a bad review because they think it isn't funny or that it's boring. here's the trick --- the film is not meant to be just a comedy. it's got some depth to it. like many demme films it deals with people living in some of the odd corners of our society who are trying to work out how to put together a fulfilling life for themselves. unfortunately, the movie and home video industries don't deal well with subtlety and drop this in the "comedy" bin. it is funny, but a lot of the humor is off-beat. however, the heart of the movie is not about the humor but about the people in it.it may not be one of the greatest films in the world but it is solid and entertaining. and the cast is one of those that shows why casting is an art unto itself. michelle pfieffer is great and this may be the film that showed she had some acting chops to add to her beauty. mercedes ruehl is a big hoot and gets to chew the scenery in the way only she can, in a role which requires it. throw in oliver platt, joan cusack in smaller roles and the talented dean stockwell ... and even chris isaak and you've got a great cast throughout which here, as usual, makes a great difference.matthew modine is fun, but more important, he's a major hottie in this movie. hot, cute and sexy.sit back, expect the unexpected and let the movie take you where it wants to go and you should have a great time.

if you're looking for a not-so-serious mob movie, with a female as the lead, you're in the right place. pfieffer has acted much better than this. you can see she has matured beyond this picture.when i first picked this movie up, i expected pfeiffer was poorly miscast, however, she plays her mob wife role to the hilt. not a bad performance from baldwin, either.if you don't pay attention to the hair, you might enjoy this movie. but don't take it too seriously...

michelle pfeiffer is ideally cast as the frustrated mob widow in this colourful black comedy. matthew modine plays a clumsy fbi agent who has taken a fancy to her. dean stockwell steals the show as the big shot who keeps on pestering pfeiffer; mercedes ruehl is dynamic as his jealous wife. it's all very eighties, but that just adds to the fun. a nice little flick, though not for every taste.

broken silence or "race against fear"1998): starring ariana richards, william bumiller, susan blakely, tracy ellis ross, teryl rothery, scott vickaryous, marissa rudiak, ken camroux, david neale, bruce dawson...director joseph scanlan, screenplay sara charmo, jean gennis, phyllis murphy.this is another lifetime channel film, made exclusively for television, released in 1998, directed by long-time tv series director joseph l. scanlan. inspired by true events, it's a lot like the majority of lifetime movies, a cautionary tale for women, raising awareness of the predator lurking within the family (a mother, father, wife, husband) and mentor (teacher, in this case track coach). the young and little known actress ariana richards (she played the small girl in jurassic park)delivers a highly convincing performance as high school track athlete mickey carlyle, who is raped by her coach, kurt ansom (william bumiller) and must suffer in silence as no one believes her story, except for, of course, her own mother (susan blakely). together, mother and daughter fight to put kurt ansom behind bars. the film drags on quite a bit, is ultimately predictable, at times far too melodramatic for the sake of drama itself, but is genuinely powerful in the end. ariana richards' performance is of the daytime soap kind, but she is the strongest in the entire cast. her facial expressions, body language and overall acting is realistic in terms of how she, as an aspiring athlete, idolizes her coach, is in turn violated by him and must now live with the shame, trauma and further, fight him in court. william bumiller plays the part with a nasty sort of duplicity, though he is far from subtle. he has abused other star athletes before, who have remained silent and made it to the top, and appears outwardly innocent. william bumiller, a lesser-known actors like the others, has has never done a role like this but but he does a believable and strong performance overall. it's especially disturbing to see him in this role because he is a sexy lead actor in everything else he does including some lesser known films and on the soap opera "guiding light". the only real problem i had with this film is the manner in which the film is structured. as the film opens, we watch coach ansom about to rape mickey, letting us know right away that this guy is no good. but this makes for weak character development and story. if the first scene had instead been the sequence with the opening credits in which we see mickey running/jogging in the city across a lake, we would have better character development because we don't know that coach ansom, while seemingly interested in the success of his star athlete, is really a nasty piece of work and we would have seen mickey idolizing a person whom she thought she knew and then received a rude awakening when she realizes she was wrong about him. director joseph scanlan is no stranger to drama for tv (knott's landing, star trek, quantum leap, the outer limits, lois and clark, earth final conflict and movies like la femme nikitta. in 1996, scanlan had directed another lifetime movie, similar to this, "stand against fear" (1996). he manages to convey the gravity of the event. we are genuinely disturbed by the coach lurking around the showers where he rapes his own student. these scenes are graphic and ought to be viewed by mature audiences, but its message is clear: sexual predators and rapists are not always a stranger and can assume different forms, and their preying grounds can even include a high school. this film supports the cause of fighting to prevent violence against women and urges women who have been silent victims to testify and fight so that rapists will cause no further harm to others. despite other negative reviews, this film does a great job in expressing its message and ought to be given to mothers, daughters, high school students (including both male and female). as bad as rape is, staying silent when it happens is even worse.

race against fear has to be one of the most moving tv movies i've seen for a long time. all of the performances from the main actors were superb, especially that of ariana richards (mickey carlyle), william bullimer (coach kurt ansom), and susan blakely (margaret carlyle). ariana in particular put on an extremely emotional performance, with facial expressions to match. she portrayed the emotions that mickey was feeling perfectly, and you could easily believe that she really had been raped, so realistic was her performance.raf is an incredibly realistic movie, due to the moving performances from the cast. bullimer came across as a rapist incredibly well, and you hated him more and more as the movie progressed. blakely also put on an emotional performance as the mother of the raped girl (mickey carlyle), and you felt increasingly sorry for the carlyle family because no-one believed them about the rape.all in all, raf is a great movie. it is both moving and full of suspense, as you are continually unsure if ansom would be prosecuted for the rape, due to the lack of witnesses, evidence, and belief in the claim. i thoroughly recommend seeing this movie.

this film is probably hal hartley's best one. the subject, of a unusual originality, is treated (that's usual with hal hartley) with great humor. this characteristic isn't at all the only quality of this film: the fussy frame composition (everything is parallel, until the smallest details), shooting angles, lighting, giving a more supernatural dimension to these blurred images (jesus' coming down couldn't be filmed in a conventional way), the falsely "poser" acting, are qualities that make this bible re-reading, carried out in the form of an apocalyptic delirium, essential.

in this peculiar movie, the themes of the end of days and satan versus jesus are treated in a new fashion. jesus doesn't want to open the two last seals, and satan is thwarted in his attempt to get another soul into hell... armageddon, armageddon and jehosaphat turns out to be a - company!, and the book of life is a little hard to open.what's memorable about this movie are the slanted image, out-of-focus shots and light effects, which are effective, but sometimes irritating. and of course, donovan is great as a disillusioned jesus trying to come to terms with what the world and its people have become! so, do see it if you get the opportunity!

in the book of life, martin donovan plays jesus, who shows up at jfk airport on december 31 to usher in the new millennium by battling with thomas jay ryan (satan) and deciding the fate of the world. there is also david simonds (kurt the accountant from amateur) as a compulsive, homeless gambler.as usual, hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary made strange and otherworldly flows through artfully-framed scenes and urban/industrial landscapes filled with dazzling light and shadow. as usual, he introduces seemingly incidental details early, then brings them back later in hilarious and unexpected contexts--the humor is simple, but giddy and irrepressible. hartley has an amazing ability to build toward small and rapturous moments of the simultaneously mundane and outrageous. as usual, he creates a tone that is jaded and world-weary but at the same time, vulnerable, open, and honest. he moves within minutes from uproarious humor into language that is metaphysical and poetic-the kind of writing that is so dead-on and perfect that it's difficult to hold back tears despite the lack of obvious emotion. another awesome and highly entertaining film. the book of life is shot (a digital camera?) with a blurry effect: a sense of the celestial hand-in-hand with impending doom and a hyper-awareness of the present as fragile and fleeting in it's last moments. all of hartley's films have a way of prioritizing the present, but this unique effect compounds it as the images wash across the screen in a way that is at first jarring, but becomes increasingly beautiful as you settle into it. the final shot is spectacular. all this may sound precious, but the film is a comedy and it makes fun of itself even as it makes fun of the concept of armageddon, judgment day, and `urbanity.' although it is actually quite profound, moving, and life-affirming, it is for the most part lighthearted and playful. the acting is flawless in terms of the kind of the subdued tone that hartley has developed in his films (a tone that some people don't get and that prompts them to judge such acting as hollow--the same people who have a negative response to peter greenaway). as always, there are bound to be people who respond to this film with cynicism and scorn-people put off by hartley's abrupt shifts and what they see to be pretentious or mannerist techniques, but who has time to consider the opinions of such dull and callous fools? anyone who is a hartley fan will love this film-if they can get a chance to see it, that is. it's hard to say what it would be like on video.

the promise of martin donovan playing jesus was, quite honestly, enough to get me to see the film. definitely worthwhile; clever and funny without overdoing it. the low-quality filming was probably an appropriate effect but ended up being a little too jarring, and the ending sounded more like a pbs program than hartley. still, too many memorable lines and great moments for me to judge it harshly.

hal hartley has been likened to a modern day william shakespeare, by virtue of the fact that he gets his actors to deliver their lines in an iambic pentameter. he certainly knows how to assemble a cast and once again martin donovan is sensational, whilst thomas jay ryan plays his role with an intensity that is unforgettable. although the film is only 1 hour, the time frame works wonderfully and keeps the audience on a fast tracked race right till the very end. without a doubt hal hartley is one of the best directors to come out of america in the last 20 years, with a vision that is unique, funny and heart warming.

while the camerawork was certainly "funky" - perhaps one dutch-roll short of "stoned" - the premise of the film was fantastic. it really took a scathingly satirical (in the true traditional of hal hartley) look at god, jesus and devil. the interaction of jesus and satan provides some hilarious scenes... even the monologues of jesus were great - this was by far the best jesus i've even seen. so laidback, zen-like, son-of-god-ish but still such a nice guy. on one level this is a very general look on the paradoxes of christianity, but yet there is still a personal level, where you can relate to jesus christ without having a god-complex (thanx to martin donovan and hal hartley).

the book of life was rather like a short snack, whetting the appetite for hartley's next full length movie.this movie doesn't need to be seen on the big screen, watch it with a few friends who are hal hartley or wayne wang fans, or better still, try to convert some newbies.

hilarious film about divine retribution. camera work stinks (shot on digital video) and looks like early mtv videos. turn the other cheek by looking past the visual and concentrate on the story. laughs galore for those with a well-developed sense of irony.

though not hal hartley's best work (my personal favorite is "surviving desire"), there is still much to like about this movie, especially for fans of hartley's dialogues. even to audiences new to hartley, i would definitely recommend this movie over the sophomoric "dogma." this movie is more intelligent, truer to its source material (the bible), and more fun than any of the other pre-millennium apocalypse movies. this movie is actually part of the french "2000 as seen by." (2000 par vu) series; as such, it is perhaps even a lower-budget film than hartley's other works. while the need for simple scenes shot with digital camera is understandable in this context, the main problem with this movie is the unfortunate overuse of the blurry/jittery effect. i'd be happy to never see this effect used in a movie again; especially at the beginning, it almost makes the movie unwatchable. but overlook this flaw, and you'll be treated to a fine film. especially notable is magdalena (played by p.j. harvey) relating how jesus saved her from being stoned to death; a short scene i found surprisingly moving. (despite the fact that it was not mary magdalene that this happened to; the woman in the bible was unnamed.)

one of my favorite hartley movies. (as if there could be a "bad" one.) although, this may be a bit more on the religious side of things than we would normally expect. nonetheless, it still maintains that hartley slant to which we've all become accustomed.first picture jesus and satan discussing their ideas, opinions, hopes and regrets about the impending end of civilization. now imagine the entire conversation taking place over a few drinks in your neighborhood bar. and as an added conversational (not to mention visual) distraction, let's toss in pj harvey as the sultry companion (aka magdelena) to mr. chist. then, just for grins, in the background, an ever present salvation army band (played by yo la tengo) to serve as an added diversion. the road to moral justification has never been such a pleasure.quite possibly more questions than answers, but therein lies the fun. and mr. donovan is subdued brilliance, as always.

this 1-hour 30-minute inside joke is best understood by catholics, the number one religion of self-medicating comedians the world over. that isn't to say it can't stand on its own which it does, that the film isn't without its flaws, which its got. technical issues, mostly: belief that in 1998 digital was the answer when in fact it was in its infancy - a beta of a beta if you will, and re-mastering will never improve it. for the love of god, hal...please get yourself a red one. or three.if you like hartley films of course, you'll like it. i liked it, because i liked grim/fool, and there were added benefits of retrospect: i couldn't help noticing a disturbing self-prophecy, an airliner soaring overhead, used as a harbinger of armageddon in this 1998 movie. it was as if cheney had gotten the whole idea from hal. it's true - hartley moves his players round into the camera like it's the house of commons, just one piece of the gimmickry that needs a rest. after all, we're already paying attention to the actors, and the writing is alive. not great writing, but...fervent. can i use the word fervent? purposeful, intelligent, not condescending.absolutely love pj harvey in this, course i'd love her anywhere. oddly, if helen mirren needs a younger self, she should look harvey up and bring a bottle of blond.

this is my favorite hal hartley movie. all his movies are small gems. i love independent movies and i hope hal hartley never goes mainstream or sells out. what if the lord jesus did come back and loved his people so much that he could not open the final book and destroy the unbelievers? it was nice to see p. j. harvey in a movie since i am a fan of her music. don't watch this if you are a fan of cookie cutter hollywood movies, you will be disappointed.

hartley on low-key form: martin donovan, born to play jesus, comes as messiah to millenial manhatten; p.j. harvey is excellent as sidekick magdelena. a slight film, but drily amusing, short and sweet.

one of the many speculations about y2k was that the world was going to end at the stroke of midnight on december 31, 1999. in `the book of life,' writer/director hal hartley takes a look at the possible ramifications of a new millennium armageddon, beginning with the return of jesus to earth on new year's eve, ¬ë99. the story examines the task of the son of god, who must open the remaining three of the seven seals contained in the book of life (now contained in a mac laptop computer), in which there is also the names of the one-hundred and forty-four thousand good souls who will be spared on the last day. jesus (martin donovan), along with magdalena (p.j harvey), arrives in new york city to make the preparations necessary for carrying out his father's will, but he begins to have second thoughts; must he judge the living and the dead? do they deserve what must befall them? it is a cup he would prefer not to embrace at this particular moment, which gives encouragement to satan (thomas jay ryan) who fears that the fruit of all his hard labor is about to be washed away at midnight, for he can only continue his work so long as there are people around who cling to their pitiful hopes and dreams. an artistically rendered, high concept film, hartley presents the story in an intelligent, thought provoking manner, taking great care in dealing with the sensitive subject matter so as to make it inoffensive even to the most ardent fundamentalist. the dialogue between jesus and satan is intriguing and stimulating, as is the effect of their presence upon those they encounter during their corporeal stay in the city. it's an engrossing meditation on the spiritual side of man's fragile existence and a contemplation of that which has been prophesied in the revelations of st. john in the apocalypse, the last book of the new testament. and there is logic in hartley's approach to the second coming; he maintains the aesthetic of the contemporary setting while employing altered film speeds which visually give the film an ethereal quality. christ inconspicuously wears a suit and tie, effectively blending in with the populace, while satan's attire is a bit more casual, his appearance somewhat scruffy; he sports a bruise above his left eye. donovan is well cast as jesus, lending a benevolent mien and a sense of restrained urgency to his character that is very effective. it is, of course, a unique portrayal of the saviour, and possibly the best since max von sydow's in `the greatest story ever told.' he successfully conveys a feeling of inner peace and tranquility, of serenity, that is the essence at the very core of the character. and ryan is thoroughly engaging in his role of the prince of darkness; he has a distinct manner of speech and a resonant quality to his voice that make him absolutely mesmerizing to watch. his eyes are darkly penetrating, a trait he uses effectively with furtive glances and captivating stares. he's the guy who could sell you anything in exchange for your soul before you ever knew what hit you. it's a memorable performance that contrasts so well with donovan's portrayal of jesus. the supporting cast includes martin pfeffercorn (martyr), miho nikaido (edie), dave simonds (dave), d.j. mendel (lawyer), james urbaniak (true believer), katreen hardt (lawyer's assistant) and anna kohler (hotel clerk). in his own, inimitable style, with `the book of life,' hartley has crafted a perspective of the last days that is interesting, entertaining and truly unique. he has a way of capturing life as it is just off center, a method which works especially well with a film like this. comparatively short for a feature film (running time of 63 minutes), it nevertheless is one of hartley's best, and more than worth the price of admission. it's a film that will stay with you and perhaps make you think about some things you may have tucked away in a corner of your mind for later. and that is part of the attraction of this film; it makes you realize that `later' most likely is now. i rate this one 9/10.

hal hartley entry into a european film series is one of his two or three best efforts to date, and, lucklily, one of the few available on dvd. at only 63 minutes running time, my only quibble would be with hartley i always leave wanting more, but never so much as this time. martin donovan is astonishing as jesus. pj harvey is beautiful and interesting as magdelena, but the high point for me was thomas jay ryan (henry fool) as satan. hartley gives him excellent dialogue and a chance to use his resounding voice to full effect. look for three scenes in which a microphone awaits him, as if a poetry slam is about to be won by the devil. i have read other comments on this film and had to add mine because there is not enough praise going around. if you like henry fool, martin donovan in anything (opposite of sex), and/or very clever comedies based on biblical ideas, get this as quickly as possible.

i thoroughly enjoyed this movie...and i watch it from time to time still. i've used it in my music classes at the school where i teach. the kids seem to enjoy it, although, they wish it were in color.the best thing about this movie is, for me, who grew up after heifetz had died, is the chance to actually see the master violinist work his craft! i was surprised at how "up to date" the story line is. although, references to "reform school" are outdated. a boy, whose father had died, and is being raised by his mom and stepfather....most of our kids today are being raised by stepparents, although the movie makes it seem like most stepparents are cruel. i get very angry when his mother doesn't take his side and defend his actions against the step-father.also, the musical selections are difficult to believe. i find it unbelievable that a child, who looks to be about 8, can play the "minute waltz", or that a 13 year old girl could sing an aria from rigoletto.other than that, it's a really fun, feel good movie and i do recommend it. i wish it would come out on dvd.

as you can tell from the few comments posted here - mine may very well be the last you'll see, unless there is a big dvd-release or tcm plays it again ! - this is a kind-of "our gang" movie with a bunch of different kids. mgm certainly was the musical studio - if the musicians, dancers and singers weren't under contract, they were on tap. heifetz was one of the most expensive.....that does it for a little charity work !!! the fee he received in that era was unheard of. another musical film with jose iturbi (mexican pianist) featured about 100 kids playing some simple tune on 100 pianos......so, those skeptics who think young children aren't musical are mistaken: i was one.as all write, "frankie smith" - good-ole american name - (gene reynolds) was the bad-but-good kid who is taken-in from the streets by the owners of a music-school. can you believe that walter brennan ("prof. lawson") of all those western movies was the man running the school? joel mccrea ("peter mccarthy") and andrea leeds ("ann lawson") were the bigger stars in "they shall have music", with a host of well-known extras (many of whom went-on to become stars in their own rights). as others have commented, almost all of the kids in the orchestra (actually, the meremblum symphony from los angeles) made big successes of their lives, either as musicians (for the studios) and other businesses.sad to say, there aren't that many young-people's orchestras today - a sad mistake. parents with children in school are usually so busy trying to keep their heads above water, and many don't even know what is happening to the kids in school. musical instruction can get to be pricey, and almost everyone would rather had a football-team.....this is the cheapest concert by jascha heifetz you'll ever hear is contained in this movie.....in those days, a quarter. his playing is brilliant, even if he looks like he'd rather be someplace else.....emotionless. by contract, any concert by yo-yo ma is so joyful, it makes you want to run right out and buy a cello.....this guy is having a good time....like the kids in the "street" concert, when they hoodwink heifetz to play at their school.all of the orchestral numbers were played by "the kids," and they make it sound easy. i love this type of movie - their plots are so simple, it doesn't take you two days to figure-out if you enjoyed - or understood - the movie, at all. we need some new movies like this - can't do anything but inspire younger kids to play other instruments than guitars.......bravo!

i really enjoyed this movie, and i'm not a classical music fan. the story of the tough street kid discovering classical music and changing his ways was great to watch, without being sentimental or too unbelievable, although some details had me scratching my head (frankie and his dog can live in the basement of the school without any of the students or teachers discovering him? where did he eat? bathe? did he ever get a change of clothes? what did he feed his dog? the owner of the school didn't think it was important to notify the police about finding a missing boy, but let him live in the basement indefinitely? :-) ). but we can let such unrealistic details slide and just enjoy the touching, fun, and slightly suspenseful (for me, anyway) story and wonderfully talented children.i loved the scene with the mothers standing shoulder to shoulder on the steps barring the policemen from entering the school: i doubt they would get away with that nowadays. and i liked the nice touch about the boy frankie stole from turning the tables on him (although that never really went anywhere), and frankie's friends helping him out in the end.all in all, a great movie for everyone!

although many audio recordings of great musicians like jascha heifetz survive, the cinematic or televised record is limited indeed. this is why musical offerings like "they shall have music" are such rare gems. while, with modern eyes and ears, one can quibble about the plot, the perceptive viewer should put this film's unique delights in their proper perspective. the plot was designed to appeal to both young and old audiences of the era, but it remains enjoyable to this day. a important aspect of the experience of watching classic films is to see them through the eyes of the moviegoer of that era.i must take issue with reviewer who complains about a film that is in black and white, or who feel obliged to report that their students express such reservations. these are juvenile complaints which reflect a limited historical perspective. for the teacher, this should offer up an educational opportunity to explain the unique qualities of black and white photography and its place in cinematic history. color can, in fact, get in the way of a good storyline, or the music. for example, the black and white photography of john ford's "stagecoach," is, like the still photographs of ansel adams, an artistic masterpiece.as for heifetz being wooden, i could not disagree more. if you want blatant emotional posturing, go to a rock concert. the role of a classical musician like heifetz is to move the audience, not him or herself. heifetz's emotion is conveyed through his playing, not through his body language. he had a rare ability to extract every emotional nuance out of the music and transfer it to his listeners. it is the listener who should be moved, not the artist.incidentally, one reviewer asked about seeing heifetz on youtube playing the 1st movement of the tchaikovsky violin concerto, with frank mchugh in the audience. this is from the 1947 film "carnegie hall," not "they shall have music" "carnegie hall" is an even greater treasure of many great classical artists in their prime. we are blessed that there were film producers who, at least in these limited instances, chose to showcase these artists. in was still an era not totally overwhelmed by the lowest common denominator tripe we get today.

a bright youngster interested in "serious" music (admittedly a vanishing breed--who'll play the fiddle when no one can play the violin??"--could find this an interesting fiction about street kids and great musical stars. heifitz was indeed the greatest violinist of his generation and the film gives him a rare on-screen chance to display his technique. the kids, especially gene reynolds, are fine and, all in all, the pic is a good example of first-rate studio family fare of the late 30's. it doesn't hit the top of the great '39 list, but it's a nice way for an intelligent family to spend a rainy afternoon with amc or the video store--- good luck at blockbuster!!!!

i think samuel goldwyn was trying to accomplish two things in this film. first the film is a homage to jascha heifetz, considered to be the best violin virtuoso of the past century. secondly having brought to the screen the dead end kids with his film of the same title and seeing them sign with warner brothers, he was trying to create a second gang of appealing urchins. though the film was good there certainly was no demand that the kids from this film be reteamed for another feature. leader of the gang is gene reynolds who at one time played the violin, but now leads a street gang of disreputable urchins. his stepfather, arthur hohl, breaks the violin his late father gave young reynolds and threatens to send him to reform school over the feeble protests of his mother marjorie main.young reynolds happens to stumble onto a music school run by the old music maestro himself, walter brennan and his daughter andrea leeds. they take him in, but they have their financial problems with a lot of creditors led by porter hall.this film is mostly to be seen today because it's a chance for classical music lovers to see and hear jascha heifetz who as you gather is the solution one way or another to everybody's problems. joel mccrea is in this film also, but has a rather colorless part as andrea leeds boyfriend. besides heifetz, one thing the film does do is touch on, albeit gingerly on the topic of child abuse and battered spouses. arthur hohl is one mean man and marjorie main is very clearly a much battered wife.the kids in the cast do well, reynolds, tommy kelly, terry kilburn and a young girl under the name of jacqueline nash who grew up and performed as gale sherwood, nightclub partner to nelson eddy. she had a nice soprano even as a child.but it's heifetz you see the show for.

for many years, samuel goldwin tried to bring his friend jascha heifetz to the screen. one evening when goldwyn and his wife frances were having dinner with heifetz and his wife, silent screen star florence vidor, goldwyn proposed that heifetz star in a movie. after some persuasion, heifetz agreed, on the condition that his acting be kept to a minimum. and the movie, originally titled "music school" was born.the story itself is rather stock: a streetwise boy (gene reynolds, who is best known as the producer of "m*a*s*h"), runs away from home and ends up at a financially troubled music school run by professor lawson (walter brennan). while attempting to raise funds for the school, the boy and some other kids happen across heifetz at carnegie hall. after much ado, heifetz ends up appearing at the school concert and sponsoring the school. the story, while predictable,is surprisingly well written, although the film contains several minor gaffes where different scenes were patched together, the most obvious being the young cellist who is sent out of the orchestra room on an errand and is seen sitting in the orchestra a few seconds later.what is not surprising is how good the acting is. as was customary for studios then, the studio surrounded the inexperienced star with veteran talent: brennan, joel mccrea, andrea leeds, porter hall, marjorie main (later of ma and pa kettle fame), arthur hohl, paul harvey, and a who's who of character actors. actress diana lynn and singer/actress kaye connor made their (uncredited) debuts in this film, as did longtime nelson eddy singing partner gale sherwood (as jacqueline nash). child veteran actors reynolds, walter tetley and terry kilburn also appear.goldwyn hired the peter meremblum symphony, a highly regarded youth orchestra from the los angeles area, to appear in the film. most of the kids in the orchestra weren't actors, but they were excellent musicians, as good as professionals (which many of them later became). many of the kids in the orchestra went on to noteworthy careers: kaye connor and diana lynn both starred in the theater and movies, richard berres was a producer and director, mitchell lurie founded a well-known music supply company, elliott rapaport went on to be a prominent cardiologist, lewis elias was a band leader, thomas facey a conductor with different symphonies, channing robbins a prominent instructor at the julliard school, his sister joyce robbins an instructor witn suny stonybrook, and many of the kids in the orchestra pursued musical careers with major symphony orchestras.while heifetz's acting was kept to a minimum, his salary wasn't. he commanded $70,000 for seven weeks. when some scenes had to be re-shot at a later date, he got an additional $50,000 for another four weeks. what thankfully wasn't kept to a minimum was his musical output. composer alfred neumann (who was once a meremblum orchestra conductor) handled the scoring. heifetz performs the "introductionne and rondo capriccioso" by camille saint-saens, his own arrangement of manuel ponce's "estrellita" (with an off-screen teddy saidenberg accompanying), dinicu's devilishly difficult "hora staccato" (from a vitaphone recording, with emanuel bay at the piano), an excerpt from tchaikovsky's "melody", an excerpt arranged for violin solo from tchaikovsky's well-known "adante cantabile" from his opus 11 string quartet (played during the opening credits at the beginning of the movie), and the final movement from felix mendelssohn-barthody's e minor violin concerto. during all of these performances, there are many closeups of heifetz's performing, including some very close shots of his fingering and bowing, something that would be of value to violinists desiring to study his technique.the meremblum orchestra also shines here, performing the arias "caro nome" by verdi and "casta diva" by bellini, (both with sherwood singing ), an arrangement of the overture from rossini's "barber of seville", a short excerpt from mozart's "eine kleine nachtmusik", and the previously-mentioned mendelssohn concerto (with heifetz). diana lynn can be heard in the background of one scene, performing part of chopin's nocturne in b-flat minor, and a five year old mary ruth performs chopin's popular "minute" waltz.all in all, this is an excellent movie. amc showed this regularly up until early 1992. i haven't seen it on television in recent years, but copies of it are not difficult to obtain. if you have the chance, i highly recommend that you view the movie.

the story itself is routine: a boy runs away from home and ends up in a struggling music school for kids. he convinces a famous violinist to sponsor the school. the film is a splicing of shootings over 11 weeks, and leaves many amusing holes which the observant viewer may find for him/herself.however long the whiskers of the plot might have been, the movie is justified by its music and acting. there is plenty of music, featuring classical works played by heifetz and by the meremblum orchestra, one of the leading youth symphonies of that day, and said music is excellent. by itself, it would make the picture worth viewing. the conducting and scoring duties were put in the best of hands: those of alfred neumann.the acting is a study in contrasts. the kids in the orchestra, most of whom had little or no acting experience, must have driven director archie mayo crazy, looking into the camera, overacting the parts that they had, and overstudiously following directions given to them. but the spontaneity that results from their lack of training adds an interesting charm to the picture. the veteran actors were marvelous with the material they had to work with. walter brennan was perfectly cast in his role, one that he emulated in real life. joel mccrea and andrea leeds were ideal fits for their parts. and the supporting acting was a veritable who's who of character actors: marjorie main, arthur hohl, paul harvey, , charles coleman, perry ivins, and porter hall in his typical role of the heavy---all ideally cast. and the bit players: jessie arnold, john hamilton, marjorie wood, jimmy flavin, dulcie day, the gravelly voiced lee phelps in his usual role as a policeman and many many more. if you're a fan of character actors, this movie will bring back a lot of memories.overall, the picture is very enjoyable and is recommended, even if you aren't a fan of classical music.tvcat

david lynch shot his first film, 'erasurehead', over several years, adding new scenes each time he managed to raise a little bit more cash. kevin smith made 'clerks' at work, while working as a clerk, and robert rodriguez has boasted that 'from dusk till dawn' cost precisely $30,000. but $30,000 is still a hell of a lot of money to raise if you work as a cleaner in a cemetery. and what if an aspiring film maker not only had such a job but also had all the ambition of such luminaries, and all the dorkishness of smith, but absolutely none of the talent. such a figure is mark borchardt, the subject of this hilarious documentary which chronicles his attempt to make a pair of movies over many many years. borchardt combines his lunatic dreams with flights of depression and a fatal inability to call it a day; one senses he almost prefers the endless labours of searching for an impossible perfection to an accommodation with the reality that he's simply (on the evidence presented in 'american movie') not very good. and like a modern day ed wood, he surrounds himself with an epic crowd of fellow losers, his genuine affection for whom is his greatest redeeming feature. the collection includes his warring parents, his best friends (one a criminal, the other a reformed drug addict), his own hapless children and best of all his aged uncle bill. bill may live in a trailer park, and just about have given up on life, but he is the owner of a small fortune ($280,000 to be precise) and the touching but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men lies at the heart of the film. borchardt manages to enlist a few actors to perform (alongside himself, of course) but in the main he is wholly dependent on friends and family to complete his work (even bill has a role on camera). on british tv, the bbc brilliantly scheduled a screening of 'american movie' back-to-back with 'lost in la mancha', the story of terry gilliam's ill fated attempt to film 'don quixote'. in that film, one was impressed by the huge amount of professionalism on display (inadequate as it was to the task in hand), and just how damn difficult it is even for experts with millions to spend to make a film; whereas borschadt is not only penniless, but also such a clown that he can't even pronounce the name of his own work ('coven') properly. ultimately, borschadt is human enough for you to want him to succeed, but awful enough for the viewer to still be able to laugh at his failures. if this film was fiction, you'd dismiss it as unbelievable; but as it is, it's one of the funniest documentaries you're likely to see.

chris smith is a superior filmmaker with the seldom-seen talent for spotting a good story, then getting the hell out of its way. smith's "american movie" is the true-to-life record of filmmaker wannabe mark borchardt, a loser intent on milking his elderly uncle for cash to complete his horror short. but never, under any circumstances, to pursue gainful employment or support the children he's conceived.such is producer smith's skill that mark appears more sympathetic than otherwise. even as he entices uncle bill with sugar-spun dreams and executive producer credits, it is his desperation to be somebody, to have his name coupled with the likes of scorsese and spielberg that touches us."american movie" also belongs in that rare, often attempted but seldom achieved sub genre that successfully blends hilarity with horror. the humor comes from borchardt's ed wood-style belief in his own genius. from his appalling attempts at acting, from his substituting his less than film-savvy mother for a missing cameraman and from his employing sweet but brain-damaged friend mike whenever he's short an actor or crew member.the horror comes from seeing what borchardt cannot: it is this very american attitude--i want, therefore i am entitled--that keeps him from seeing just how much he has to learn about his chosen craft. he is so confident he can't fail that failure is guaranteed.

let's face it, lot's of bad movies are made all the time. for those people who work in film, you have probably poured a lot of time and effort into many of these plot less wonders. sometimes, and this is my opinion, it is the act of merely making the movie that is important to us. to tell a story, (no matter how simple and unrealistic). also, the collaborative process is one key characteristic that is unique to film and theater. to put on a production of any caliber, requires the talents of a varying amount of people, depending on its scale, to bring its story to life. the most intriguing part of american movie, however, is not the movie being filmed. it is the movie maker himself, as a character of his own life, which demands our attention. none of them serve as models of the filmmakers we know and have worked with. but, i will argue, they are archetypes of small parts of us which try to be a part of this cult activity of independent film-making. (alright a very small part of us) these are the people who live under the rocks of their own lives and just so happen to be snared by the romance of cinema. this leads me to my next argument. american movie captures the raw spirit of independent film-making. bad stories told on (nowadays) digital film with sloppy effects and horrible performances- because this is the best they can do with a budget of a couple thousand dollars rather than a studio budget of several million dollars a day. that is the difference between low low low end productions and studio productions. the independent filmmaker just wants to create a linear or even a nonlinear story to shoot as well as he can with the money he's investing in himself and the resources around him in order to see a finished product on his rundown tv. rugged individualism materializes in every art form. i find this film to be a brilliant document of truth for many filmmakers. and no, i'm not full of myself. man, these people are hilarious. their problems seem hilarious, their characteristics are hilarious. best line of the movie: "it's alright!. . . it's okay!. . . there's something to live for!. . . jesus told me so!!!" said a million times by a funny old man. hat's off to tom beach. chicago rules.

chris smith's american movie is an insightful examination of the american dream. the movie focuses around mark borchardt, an independent film maker from wisconsin. mark has dreamed of becoming a great writer and director since he was a teenager and had an out of focus hi8 camera. the movie follows mark through his attempt to make his dream feature film, northwestern. there are a number of hilarious scenes in the film as mark goes through pre-production of northwestern and later his short film coven (pronounced co-ven, the correct pronunciation, mark says "sounds too much like oven,") which he plans to use to raise money to complete northwestern. this film's insight and humor is on par with roger and me, michael moore's great film. i first viewed it at a chaotic sundance film festival screening that brought out the spirit of the movie- a giant air duct fell from the ceiling at the beginning of the movie, hit seven people and caused a twenty-five minute delay; half way through the film the sound started fluttering and the projector had to be stopped to fix it, and in the last twenty minutes the projector stopped and the film burned up. despite the delays, the audience stayed through the movie and gave it a standing ovation. american movie also won the grand jury prize for documentary at the end of the festival. i highly recommend this fine film, worth sitting through any hellish screening.

american movie is a wonderful documentary. it follows the trials and tribulations of a very determined independent filmmaker as he struggles to finish his first film.the raw footage and insightful content of this film is an excellent example of how documentaries should be produced. i also feel that the film can very inspirational to those of us that want to be filmmakers ourselves.

this documentary is such a wonderful example of what an entertaining and amazing experience a documentary can be, if done so well as this. the subject, mark, is smart, funny and very driven, and this story of his personal fight to live his dreams will be inspiring to anyone who knows what it is like to harbor an "impossible" dream. see this mov

the subject matter of this film is potentially depressing: a man about thirty, with no job, little education, three kids from a failed relationship, living in his parents' house, but with a dream of directing feature films. but about a half-hour into the movie you realize that mark borchardt has a bottomless supply of drive and ambition--it's just that it's all channeled into his need to direct movies, and nothing else will make him happy. the movie jumps all over the emotional spectrum, but in the end you come away feeling happy, because you've just gotten to know some wonderful people. go to see this--you'll end up wishing it was longer.

anytime i'm not giving 150% to my dreams or my goals i think of mark borchardt, the real-life subject of "american movie". mark's dogged persistence at having his first feature film produced and shot is so captivating that it will have you laughing, shaking your head with sadness and rooting for him.i haven't seen a documentary this honest since the movie on r. crumb. the supporting "cast" (mark's real-life family and friends) are all great. give this movie a chance and you'll see a great film and a wonderful portrait of the stuff that the american dream is made of.

my companions were astounded to find that this movie was a documentary. it was so funny, it seemed scripted, yet it gives a stirring picture of real life in the indie film life. we felt moved to purchase coven and wanted to meet mark and mike. as college students, this film gave us a much needed glimpse of real life.

i'm proud to say i'm a student at uw-milwaukee, where parts of the film were shot. yep, i recognize mitchell hall, where i took a film class, possibly the same course as fellow student smith.that's where i learned about "american movie." our professor told us about it shortly before its release. to be sure, i was intrigued, but for some reason, i put off seeing it for several months(it must've done pretty well if it was still playing, at least in milwaukee).when i finally got around to seeing it, i thought it was an entertaining documentary. it's not a masterpiece-it goes on a bit too long-but i find mark's passion and commitment inspiring. i hope this film signals the beginnings of bigger and better things him. maybe his forthcoming "northwestern" will propel him to fortune. who knows?rating: *** (out of ****)108 min/released by sony pictures classics

i rented this movie for two reasons. the first was all of the good things that i read about it. i definately was impressed, and couldn't agree more with all of the reviews i read. the second reason is because i know these guys. i don't know mark as well as i do mike. he hasn't changed much from the years we knew each other. i know him as "the reaper" from a local milwaukee radio station (wmse). the way he is in this film is genuinely mike 100%. he once gave me a table that he made. it was a little one, about 15" high, that said metallica on it. the odd thing about it was it only had two legs. sometimes it's the thought that counts, and mike always has thought about others first.

this may actually the finest film of 1999. no i'm not kidding. this documentary directed by chris smith captures the very spirit of artistic compulsion. smith does the smart thing any documentary filmaker should do: he keeps invisible and refuses to judge his subject. as the viewer watches mark and his efforts, no matter how funkily aggressive they may prove, to finish his films. he refuses to compromise and suffers repeatedly as a result. but lest we forget, remember speilberg, scorsese and others started just as humbly.and what a great subject he chooses. mark, his family and friends are all fascinating characters, far more than any character created in last year's fictitious cinematic products.this film oscillates on the dime between comedy, tragedy, touching sympathy and leads us ultimately to inspiring any viewer with an urge to create, despite talent issues, to get off their butts and make something.the film is about maverick artists and their passions. it is also about families, no matter how co-dependent and disfunctional they may be and how unique and beautiful that organism truly is. mark proves in the film to be utterly devoted not only to his dreams, but also to his family as well- and they to him. why this film was not nominated for documentary of the year is beyond me and criminal (that is assuming it was eligible last year). this film is to be sought out and treasured.

i enjoyed this one, because i can relate to it. at one time in my life i was trying to make films, and experienced many of the same problems mark borchardt did in trying to make his film. and i also went through a protracted period of self-absorbed arrested development, where i refused to grow. but then, miraculously, i got married, and had kids. i realized that being a struggling filmmaker was, in all likelihood, not going to feed my family. so i got a decent job and did what i felt i needed to do to make that happen. that is what an mature, responsible adult does. mark hasn't faced up to that reality as yet, and so, in that sense, he is a retarded adolescent. for this reason, there is a hopelessness about him. like don quixote, he seems so inept and self-deluded that he doesn't realize how bad off he really is. the viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle. mark has kids and an ex-wife and bills to pay, but the film depicts him caring basically only about pursuing his "artistic vision". despite this, mark comes across in the film as a likeable individual, surrounded by a very interesting family and group of friends. unfortunately, mark lacks many of the things necessary to be successful both in life and in a career: maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, prioritization, financial clout, etc.. yet he trudges on, much like ed wood, apparently without any semblance of a clue. i guess we are supposed to feel encouraged by the spectacle of the "never say die" attitude of this noble individual, struggling against the odds. and man, what odds there are! kiefer sutherland, colin hanks, tori spelling and angelina jolie are all offspring of big-time film or tv people; no doubt, they will all want to direct some day, if they aren't already. how much room is there for an independent like mark? it's like watching a guy hit himself in the head with a board, over and over again. come to think of it, that is pretty close to what happens to one of mark's actors, with the kitchen cabinet door, in one of the funniest scenes i have ever seen in any movie.despite these misgivings and seeming criticisms, i truly enjoyed this movie, and would heartily recommend it to anyone. uncle bill is amazing. i have a friend who met both mike and mark and he told me that, in real life, these guys are just exactly the way they appeared in the movie.

what gives this movie its personality is the knowledge, in the end, that it is all true. while it is a compelling and humorous documentary that does border on mockumentary in some parts (are they staged or is it really happening humorously?), it does seem to get a bit long towards the end.this movie is funny in places it needs to be, and flows relatively well. reminiscent of christopher guest's movies, if you liked those or adaptation then i recommend you keep a look out for this one.b+

this is probably the greatest war film and certainly one of the greatest films. there's no sentimentality, no patriotic agenda, not even a hopeful message of universal brotherhood in this bleak glimpse of what we can only call hell. it's this quiet rigor and lack of manipulation that give the film its astounding power. there aren't any attempts to make a hero out of ichikawa's protagonist tamura either. he's just a poor doomed sap trying to stay alive in a world of horror who hopes, but isn't sure, he can hang on to his humanity in the process. ichikawa's fierce lack of cant and illusion make fires on the plain stand alone. ichikawa died february 2008.

my first ichikawa in many years, and the first of his war films that i've seen, this was gripping and brutal from the very get-go. in the very first scene, nominal hero tamura is told that he can't continue on with his unit, to which he has returned from the hospital. he apparently has tb ¬ñ but he is not sick enough for the hospital to take him given the quantity of war-wounded they have. but his old unit won't take him back either; his co gives him a grenade, and tells him that if he feels truly hopeless to blow himself up¬Öit's the honorable thing to do.the phillipines, 1945, and the situation really does seem hopeless, for pfc tamura and everyone else. nobi is an odyssey through hell, or rather hells ¬ñ denuded forests, dead rocky plains, and the dead and dying japanese soldiers hoping just for an end, through peace or death. ichikawa's film is photographed in stunning b&w scope which serves to highlight both the desolation felt by tamura and those he meets on his journey towards his doom, and to show how truly small and naked they all are amidst the immensity of the mountains and the forests¬Ö.this small affair of humans will end soon, the earth seems to be saying, but i will survive and barely notice it.tamura travels back towards the hospital, but is (not surprisingly) rejected there, and spends the rest of the film trying to stay alive, stay human, and get out of danger. he doesn't manage to do very well on any account, slowly starving and eventually committing some fairly repellent acts. eventually he hooks up with two other desperate men who have lost, or survived their units, and have resorted to cannibalism¬Öand in his weakened state facing other armed men, finds that the only way to live is to break with everything that he believes in.ichikawa's film is as brutal, uncompromising and intense as any war film i've seen. there are moments of humor and tenderness, but they are fleeting and don't stick in the memory such as the scene with the man on the mountaintop who practically begs tamura to eat his flesh¬Öthe recurring black-comic bit with tamura exchanging his ragged shoes for the better leathers of a fallen comrade¬Ö.the degradations that humans will endure to survive¬Ö.the truth that this is any war, all wars, all mankind as long as we continue thus. a masterpiece that i probably won't watch again for a long, long time. watched via the beautiful criterion collection dvd.

kon ichikawa had lived through world war two, and saw what its effects it had on his people in japan. but so did novelist shohei ooka, whose book was the inspiration for ichikawa's film, fires on the plain. it's a film about the men in this war, or perhaps more universally in wars in general, who lose their humanity. the soldiers trudging along through these fields and jungles of the philippenes in this story are almost completely without hope, if not already just that. it makes stone's platoon look like a picnic: at least they had certain things, like food, after all.they have little to no reserves or supplies or ammunition, no back-up, no sense of anything going their way in this combat that they've been thrust into. they can't even get some proper hospital care, unless if they can no longer walk at all or have lost limbs (for example, say, if you have tb, you're on your way). but its really through the prism of one soldier, a private tamura, that we get a full sense of the futility of war, both in its bleak scenes of nothingness and boredom and decay, and those flashes of intense and brutal violence.in the film tamura just wants to get some medical care. this is right at the start, and his told by his superior officer- already he is with eyes that stare off and an expression that has been drained by years of battle- that he will die if he doesn't find a hospital. he doesn't, really, but does end up in with some soldiers: at first with a platoon that seems to sort of have their act together, but is really led on by a power-hungry brute who just wants tamura's stash of salt, and then later with two other stray soldiers who are part of a group that had previously been ambushed while crossing a road at night.the story isn't entirely a straight line, but it doesn't need to be. tamura's path in fires on the plain is told in vignettes, little stories like when he comes upon a seemingly deserted enemy village. two of the populous comes back to get some supplies, and tamura sneaks up on them. it's an excruciating scene, since so far with tamura we haven't seen him do anything outright *wrong*, but he does so in this scene, not even so much out of evil but out of fear and desperation (this is also, without spoiling it, how he gets a stash of salt). little scenes build up so brilliantly and with devastation, like a simple task of finding a pair of walkable shoes, which there seem to be none. or when tamura, later in the film, discovers his teeth are becoming torn apart and falling out from lack of total hygiene. so much for food, so it goes.it should also be mentioned that this is a hauntingly realized film from ichikawa, shot in a stark black and white view of the fields and woods, the cinematography filling everything we see in black-blacks and white-hot white. ichikawa also makes sure to get everything authentic from his actors, not simply emotionally but with their own emaciated look and looks of desperation right on them. it's as if ichikawa has to have them all surviving the film as well as characters surviving out in the wild; by wild, by the way, i mean also cannibalism. the shock of this is two-fold; first is the way that a soldier says half-jokingly early on about eating other soldiers to tamaura, who asks if it was true and only in response getting a "don't ask" word of caution, and the second with the depiction of cannibalism itself, from the crazy starving man on the hill who pulls out guts out of his lap and says with a straight face to our hero that "you can eat me when i die." this makes thing especially more brutal when it comes to the director filming the brief 'action' scenes. these are, i would argue, more brutal than 'private ryan' in their depictions of violence in battle, the carnage that is completely random. a scene i would point to, and that contains just a shot that is excruciating to watch, is when from a high angle we see a group of about twenty soldiers walking slowly along, a hail of gunfire comes that kills only four or five, but it just happens so fast, and the soldiers just keep walking along at the same crawl. this isn't the only shot of horrible carnage that's shown - when needing to be bloody its there, but splashed across the screen like something completely of the macabre - but it drives the point completely.all of the acting is staggering (funakoshi especially, who looks to be both most at peace and most horrified by what he sees in the subtlest of looks most of the time), all of the major set-pieces provide something else to the gruesome experience, and it all amounts to the ultimate question with an anti-war film: how can, or why, do people fight in wars like these? it's almost too depressing to put into words, and so ichikawa pushes our noses right up into the muck and filth and blood and demands for us to take it in, so maybe, some day, it will never happen again. or one can hope this, by the end of such a bleak and great film as this.

an unflinching descent into psychological and physical oblivion that will undoubtedly burn images of the truthful brutality and suffering of war into your cerebral cortex in a way not many other films will. in fact, there is simply no other war film like it.director kon ichikawa witnessed the unthinkable horror of hiroshima first hand only 10 days after the bomb was dropped. he has said that from that day it would always be his mission to express the pointless, empty violence humans inflict on each other and themselves. mr. ichikawa shows us that there are no winners in war... for the paths to victory and defeat are paved with the same soldiers soullessly marching down roads which only have death and destruction at their end.mr. ichikawa succeeds in bringing his message to the world thru this haunting piece of cinema.

i saw this in 1993 on a vhs tape but have been unable to find it at any source since. this is a very bleak and uncompromising look at the last days of the japanese army in the phillipines. anyone with an interest in the pacific war would do well to view this film and see what conditions the other side fought under.from what i can tell, this is historically accurate, and depicts how easily men can descend into complete barbarism. i understand the japanese army was completely cut off from any re-supply in the phillipines by 1945, so there is no doubt many of the horrific incidents depicted here happened. i might not have been able to identify with the film's characters, but i appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive. if i had to compile a list of the ten greatest war films, this film would be on it. see it if you can get it.

fires on the plain (1959) ****you don't see films like this anymore. 'fires on the plain' is an incredible depiction of the lives of the soldiers of the japanese imperial army. kon ichikawa's masterpiece follows tamura, a soldier with tuberculosis as he wanders around the philippine landscape in the last year of the war. he is sent away to the hospital by his commanding officer only to be refused treatment and so he is sent back. his co tells him to go back and if they refuse him again then his last order is to kill himself with his grenade. he is refused again, but meets up with a band of squatters sitting outside the hospital. the next day they are shelled by american troops and tamura flees, choosing not to kill himself, and from there he wanders from place to place trying to get to palompon. he discovers that some men have been eating human flesh in order to survive, while others trade as much tobacco as they can for whatever they can get back.the film is filled with a quiet sense of desperation and desolation, with a hint of insanity. everyone we see is skin and bones, covered in dirt wearing torn and tattered rags. ichikawa uses his camera to catch some beautiful shots of the destructed landscape and the japanese soldiers who walk it. kon ichikawa was famous in japan for making many comedies and satires, and there are moments in fires on the plain that are bitingly hilarious. take for example a shot of what appears to be a dead man lying face down in a pool of water; a soldier walks but and asks himself aloud if that is how they will all end up, to which the man lifts his head out of the water and replies "what was that?" and then drops his face even deeper into the puddle than before. another hilarious sequence involves one man finding a pair of boots along the trail. he takes the boots, replacing them with his old ones. another man walks by and sees that pair of boots and switches up for his old boots. the scene continues until finally tamura finds the exchange spot and examines the boots left without hardly any sole. he looks carefully at his own and at ones on the ground, and deciding that they're both kaput he removes his own and goes barefoot. the film is filled with incredible scenes, one after another. like mizoguchi and kurosawa, ichikawa knew how to use his camera to paint beautiful and stunning pictures. there are many stunning shots of men in barren empty plains surrounded by nothing but smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies on the broken earth. there is another incredible scene where dozens of japanese soldiers attempt to cross a road guarded by yanks in the middle of the night, all crawling on their hands and knees as the camera watches on from above. the film gets its name from the columns of smoke rising up from fires on the plains seen throughout the film. they represent to the soldiers life a little more ordinary; the lives of japanese farmers back home burning husks of corn. their beacons of hope for the normal life however are in hostile hands.the film caused a stir in its day with its graphic content. much emphasis is placed on the horror of war, not just with the enemy but within your ranks and yourself. kon ichikawa's fires on the plains is an incredibly authentic and moving, and somewhat disturbing, portrait of the horror suffered by the men making up the lower ranks of the imperial army. clint eastwood's letters from iwo jima, while it is a very good film, comes nowhere close to realizing the horror of war depicted in fires on the plain. (eastwood was no doubt influenced by the film, seeing as he claims to be such a classic japanese film buff.) many war films show that war is hell through the eyes of the winners. in fires on the plain, we're shown that war is even more hellish when you're on the losing end 4/4

this film is a knockout, fires on the plain referred to is, (the burning off at the end of harvest time) a happy memory for tamura, he relives this in his mind many time's,and at the end of this bleak film, like a man dying of thirst, he believe's he is home and this last illusion is all he has left. billy wilder's the big carnival (ace in the hole) is the only film (that comes to mind)that is as bleak as this little masterpiece by kon ichikawa. while i think the whole film is brilliant two scenes that come to mind are when a platoon of japanese soldiers trying to escape (crawling on there belly's)are ambushed by americans and massacred,true horror, and as an american soldier and a pretty philippine girl soldier are having a cigarette on the side on the road, she smiles as she flits with the yank,then her face changes to rage as she see's two japanese soldiers trying to surrrender, she grabs a gun and kills them with joy, the american soldier attempts to stop her but has no chance , to me this speaks volumes at the atrocity's committed by the japanese in the philippines, all in all a great film if you have the stomach for it.

the main achievement of this film is that though racially unipolar, the film still manages to carve out a tableaux of war portrayals that leave a lasting identification with whoever may view it, and whoever was present at this time. though good films may have the ability of universalizing their subjects, which is often a hard thing to do; great films have the ability of universalizing their unipolar subjects, which is what this film does.instead of carving a context of unity, the film depicts the japanese in the sick finality of the phillipines war-front in february, 1945, making signs for pacifism or war, but rather making signs of the feelings, death, destruction, victory and sickness of war with the bloody hands of the defeated.far different, and superior, to films such as apocalypse now and full metal jacket, both which needed a satirical methodology of trivializing and depersonalizing the american troupes, and using all races as one struggle, which is fine, yet not as grand as a film that uses one race and view, which would look fascist if created in america, to convey the horror of war and show what it is really like.the only way the main character makes it through this movie to the end, is by being sick, thence inedible; hence through this character, through his sickness, his saving face, we see the end of wwii in the phillipines in february of 1945, and the way in which the americans, japanese and phillipinians came together in bloody acts of warfare where you live to die.the film is patently influenced by a neorealist way of filmic portrayal, which is original and beneficial to a viewer, whether then or now, for the neorealist techniques it employs conveys all the horrors of war in pictorial form, whether a showcase for pacifism or 'militaristic responsibility'. like germania anno zero, by roberto rossellini, a story emerges from the environment and the conditions associated with it.the film's opening, with the two-way discussion between the two japanese soldiers, prefigures and reechoes the events. through this opening we feel that the struggle is human against human, and human with human; it shows that they relied on each other to face the enemy in the past battles, but now, in this opening, or 'pivot' of the experiences of the japanese in the phillipines, new information is relayed to the main character tamura, giving a presentiment of a cannibal reliance on one another if they wish to survive.the jungle is gritty, wet and thick, and the sky is not infrequently cloudy and pouring. we wade with the stragglers though puddles and marshes, as sick as the land around them. nameless cadavers are strewn everywhere. every now and then one can not tell if they are bodies, rocks or corn. apparently there is no difference here, all is dead and sick. all is dying. all they have lest to feed upon are rare monkeys and dead bodies of fallen comrades and/or nameless enemies.often tamura meets a fallen other near death. though crushed in spirit, and crushing his, some offer up their bodies for him to eat, but he refuses; he still, like hiroshi kawaguchi as nishi in giants and toys, will not droop into the death of dignity and japanese morals; for this is all he really has to hold up for his survival, a dignity of self. hence, when nagamatsu is dissecting a soldier for consumption, he shoots him because of it. tamura may be used to the killing, but to the sickness of killing and pillaging he can't decipher. he is neither a good man or a bad man. he wishes to survive, but will not go the extra mile beyond simple straight-war-killing. his self belonged dead on the battlefield, he isn't happy here to wade and wipe the weak for his survival.the sickness he carrys he sees everywhere, in everyone; and sadly he lacks the ethical rationale of thinking either thinking entirely about others, since he can't give up his body for them since of his contagious malady, or thinking entirely about himself, since he sees the sickness in everyone, though still killing them even if they do no harm. seen in his attack on the two philippians's in the hut. he can't see anyone. no one can see anyone. the only see an aversion from malady and an adversion to health, the heart of survival instincts.often, an arm appears pointing to the left of the screen, towards what must be hope, for there, in that far thule lies their freedom. yet it is blocked by american soldiers, leaving the japanese stragglers to slowly die in this disconsolate dirt. even a church tower appears, reflecting the light off an unseen sun. but on closer inspection crows flutter wildly about it; religion too is an air of poison.nobi, the japanese title of the film, gives more evidence to the themes, or feelings of the film: the servitude to fate, the heaviness of existence under leaders and lives controlled by others. its proper anglophone translation has a subject of heavy debate among historians, as non-koreans translate it as "slave" and "slavery", while many koreans argue that nobi was not a slave system, but a servant class system that does not meet the criteria for slavery. a way to typically to escape wrenching poverty. this improves upon the war theme, and symbolism of soldiery.isn't it important at the time period to ask ourselves what the purpose is of what will become our won history? should we be comfortable of letting it unroll without conscious effort for change? is it not who we are fighting, that age old history question, but rather why are we fighting? fires on the plain is with eiji funakoshi, osamu takizawa, and mickey curtis; based on a novel by shohei ooka. in japanese with subtitles.

"nobi" or "fires on the plain" is a film that is so excellent on so many levels, that not enough good things can be said about it. my only regret is that i was not able to see this 1959 film sooner.being something of a film purist, i tend to look at films for their artistic merits based upon dialog, acting, photography and even the efforts to remain true to the period in terms of costume. ultimately, i want to know if the film is "truthful" enough in revealing the human condition to make me think without oppressing me with what the director wants me to think."fires on the plain" is a great film because it crafts a portrait filled with realistic human reactions to the dying fires of a great historical catastrophe.ichikawa's film is a condemnation of war on all levels -- as any good war film should be. war is horrifying, bloody, destructive. it is also murderous on the psyche. however, what is fundamental about "fires on the plain" is its unapologetic look at the japanese soldiers. it shows them slowly collapsing under the weight of superior american firepower and their nation's inability to wage a war of its own making. a fatalistic code encouraging death before surrender is at the heart of this madness.i was astonished to see such an honest and brutally close look at the bitter fruits of japan's military misadventure made just 14 years after the end of what the japanese call the "great pacific war." ichikawa, reveals what the germans called the "war life," the plight of the common soldier.ichikawa's film is interesting, since even today japan is having a hard time fully coming to terms with its wartime fanaticism, its subjugation of conquered peoples, the racism of its war against the chinese and war crimes which included cannibalism by soldiers and officers practiced not only against one another, but against allied prisoners of war.ichikawa produces a stark representation of the victimization of soldiers by a confluence of bad political decisions and cultural pressures.this stark examination is skillfully done by portraying the doomed soldiers as human beings who exhibit, at various times, fear, brilliantly laconic humor, dialog enriched by its sparseness, and a plot whose complexity is belied by the grim, wilderness setting.ichikawa's portrait is a ragged and painful tapestry of defeated men. the tubercular tamura, played as a woebegone and gentle soul by eiji funakoshi, is a good soldier who can't abandon his humanity, though he is as frightened and lost as his comrades. before he departs for a hospital that will reject him as too healthy, tamura is given a hand grenade by a superior who, recognizing the hopelessness of their situation, advises tamura to kill himself.why tamura's hopelessly ill-supplied and militarily incapable unit was not ordered to surrender at the start of the film is telling. ichikawa makes it plain that the war is over and everyone is merely waiting to die. as tamura leaves his unit for his hopeless search for physical and spiritual salvation, he sees his comrades pointlessly digging an air raid shelter. they appear like corpses looking up from their own mass grave.we later watch as the overworked hospital's medical staff abandons the dying patients to an all-consuming american artillery barrage. the pathetic patients, who crawl from their huts in a vain attempt to survive, appear like pathetic, serpentine creatures dragging themselves from an omnipotent force. you know they won't survive.ichikawa makes it plain that the only thing worse than a defeated army is one that has lost its honor by abandoning its humanity and its comrades. as tamura staggers through the jungles of leyte we encounter the noble, the dying and the exploitive. cannibalism rears its ugly head as soldiers begin to eat one another rather than surrender to american "corned beef."when the men do talk of surrender, the propaganda of how americans kills prisoners is countered by a worldly-wise soldier who reveals that the approaching americans feed and care for prisoners of war because they, unlike the japanese, respect brave soldiers who are forced to give up.it is the japanese who intend to die fighting for the emperor long after resistance has lost all meaning. those willing to fight to the death will be killed. it is the calculus of war.after shooting a murderous and cannibalistic comrade, whom he earlier offered his own body to as food, the fatalistic tamura's careless surrender also seems to be an intentional form of suicide. his death is a lonely image. was ichikawa trying to tell us of the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live, but who is still trapped by his nation's suicidal cultural codes?if someone watches this film carefully, he or she will see that absolutism and fanaticism is the enemy. the americans are portrayed as a technologically advanced people willing to employ that technology in the form of inexorable military power -- a lesson that transformed japanese postwar society. ichikawa's film isn't so shallow that it indicts america. ichikawa indicts the sedimentary layers of japan's destructive policies that created the war and then to continue it when all was lost.ichikawa does not mention the nuclear weapons dropped upon nagasaki and hiroshima. he doesn't have to. the slow-motion destruction of the imperial japanese army in the philippines reveals the seeds of japan's immolation.

a harrowing masterpiece on the sheer madness and despair of war, fires on the plain (nobi) is not going to be to everybody's taste: this is a war movie in the truest possible sense of the term, one that resorts neither to flag-waving patriotism nor saccharine sentimentality. nobi cuts deep, it's ugly, tenebrous and bleak as few things ever committed on celluloid will ever be. this is war behind the cannons, with no triumphs or heroes, no moral victories or defeats to be had, just a handful of gaunt and terrible-looking men strewn across a land ravaged by war like penitents fleeing a great disaster. the characters defy moral judgment because they are creatures beset by a great woe, a woe that does not permit questions of a moral nature. war and survival. pitting one's will against the other's in a battlefield arena. the loser is simply removed from existence.tamura, soldier in the japanese imperial army, is discharged from his platoon and ordered to report in a nearby hospital on account of him coughing blood and being disliked by the rest of the platoon. he's told to never come back and instead commit suicide by hand grenade in case the hospital rejects him. which it does. the hospital is nothing but a shack made of wooden planks and the hospital surgeon simply tells him that if he's capable of walking he's just fine. it is in that shabby excuse of a hospital that one of the most harrowing scenes of the film takes place. as the area is carpet bombed by american planes the doctors and those who can walk and sustain themselves flee from the hospital and into the woods. moments before the hospital is blown to pieces, the gaunt and crippled figures of the sick and injured crawl out of it in every manner of posture, dressed in their sickly white robes, as if the building is some kind of beast spewing viscera and filth out upon the earth.that is nobi's greatest success; the stark and brooding depiction of the suffering of war in simple but evocative images, without melodrama or pseudo-heroism. soldiers cross a marsh, wading knee-deep in mud, move across the opposite bank and into a field only to discover enemy tanks hiding in the woods, their lights shining like malignant eyes as they scan the dark. a procession of injured soldiers, dirty and half-mad, crossing a road, dropping to the ground on the sound of enemy planes. buzzards feasting on a pile of dead bodies. an abandoned village. a mad soldier that believes himself to be buddha sitting under a tree, covered with flies and his own excrement, offering his arm to be eaten by tamura when he's dead. these are the images kon ichikawa conjures for our eyes, merciless and unflinching in their poignancy but honest and raw.nobi doesn't rush to get somewhere. it is content to follow tamura's travels through the war-torn land as he tries to reach the regrouping center of palompa, and observe the madness and obscenities of war. the movie wades through the sludge of the horror of war, slow and brooding, just like the characters it follows. the final thirty minutes with tamura taking refuge with two deserters who feed on 'monkey meat' are the closest nobi comes to adhering to conventional narratives and they're no less powerful for that matter. strikingly photographed in black and white, with great performances from the cast, and ichikawa's assured direction, nobi is not only among the best war movies to be made but also among the finest of japanese cinema.

every american who thinks he or she understands world war two should see this movie. few hollywood films about the war have defied the stereotype of japanese soldiers as emotionless brutes obeying orders without thinking. we like to think that every japanese man was ready and able to fight to the death, right up to the day we bombed nagasaki. "fires on the plain" shows a different reality: troops pathetically undersupplied, demoralized and starved to the point of cannibalism. they euphemistically refer to human flesh as "monkey meat." the movie and novel on which it was based also put to death the myth that japanese soldiers all preferred death to surrender: they had good reason to believe that their enemies were in no mood to take prisoners. to me it raises a question most americans would rather avoid: if the japanese military was so beaten down at this point in the war, why was it necessary to nuke hiroshima?

this is undoubtedly the most harrowing black-and-white war film that i've watched; as a matter of fact, the only western director during this time to remotely approach its level of intensity and sheer visceral power in his work was samuel fuller. by the way, i had attended a kon ichikawa retrospective at london's national film theatre in september 2002, but only managed to catch some of his work made between 1960 and 1973.the film is certainly as depressing as it's reputed to be; however, it also displays welcome touches of black humor throughout - the 'dead' man who wakes up to answer a querying soldier and promptly 'dies' again, the deliciously ironic shoe exchange sequence, a moribund eccentric telling the famished hero which part of the body he should eat, etc. incidentally, the script was written by a woman - natto wada, the director's own wife!ichikawa is a versatile and prolific film-maker whose reputation may not be as high as it was during his peak years (1956-65), but his direction here is often striking - the startling pre-credits sequence (the hero is violently rebuked by his superior officer for being discharged from hospital earlier than expected!), the death of a surrendering japanese at the hands of a gun-toting philippine woman, the bombing of a hospital (with the medical staff running away to save themselves, leaving the wounded soldiers behind to crawl out of the shack at their own limited pace), the automated march in the rain of the disillusioned soldiers (which also involves the afore-mentioned business with the shoes that, actually, recalls a similar scene in all quiet on the western front [1930]), a hill littered with the bodies of soldiers attempting to climb it, the finale, etc. surely one of the film's major assets is the stunning cinematography of the unforgiving and desolate muddy landscape.the film is notorious for treating the taboo subject of cannibalism (almost 10 years before it became a staple of horror movies) but ichikawa's approach is not only subtle but highly effective: the flesh is actually referred to as "monkey meat", while the hero is seen partaking only once (and promptly spits out the piece along with most of his decaying teeth!); conversely, when the weak underling soldier (played by mickey curtis who, despite his name, was a japanese pop idol of the time!) rabidly indulges, the ground nearby is splashed with blood.in the supplements, ichikawa remembers that method-practicing lead actor eiji funakoshi (whose portrayal is unforgettable, by the way) arrived on the set at starvation point - with the result that production was forced to shut down for two weeks until he recuperated! donald richie's perceptive interview favors the nihilism of the film over the underlying patriotism behind such gut-wrenching recent hollywood fare as saving private ryan (1998).fires on the plain is universally considered to be one of its director's top efforts and, out of the several films of ichikawa i've watched, the closest to it in spirit are the burmese harp (1956; another character-driven war film but with a spiritual tone, and which is also available on dvd from criterion) and enjo aka conflagration (1958; which was actually given a limited theatrical showing locally, as part of a foreign-film week, a couple of years ago). personally, i also have a particular soft spot for the director's stunningly stylized color extravaganza, an actor's revenge (1963), which i've actually caught twice at the nft in 1999 and the afore-mentioned 2002 retrospective.

this is one of the most anti-traditional war movies about was i have seen. instead of the typical films that stress glory and perhaps super-human characters (like john wayne), this film is the exact opposite--stressing the de-humanization that also happens in war. the story concerns the japanese who are stranded in the phillipines after the us returned in late 1944-early 1945. by the time the movie begins, the japanese have clearly been beaten but because of the insane logic of bushido, they cannot allow themselves to consider surrender. at one of many poignant moments, the lead character is told at the beginning of the film to report to the hospital since he isn't capable of fighting due to his tb. the problem is that the hospital won't accept him, so his commander tells him to once again go to the hospital--and if they won't accept him he should blow himself up with a grenade! well, this happens just in the first five minutes of the movie--a lot worse things befall this soldier and the few stragglers because they won't surrender. plus, there is a case in the movie where a soldier does try to surrender but is gunned down. this happened a lot later in the war because so often the surrendering japanese soldiers booby-trapped themselves to blow up when they came near. in addition, the film shows the most vivid depiction of starvation and the accompanying madness of any film i have seen. in addition, cannibalism, cowardice and betrayal all accompany this very gritty, realistic and depressingly realistic film. you simply couldn't have made a better film of this type. horrible but great.

during ww2 in the philipines, japanese soldiers are starving, dying, growing weak, and becoming more and more insane. a small group of soldiers, trying to stay alive, have eventually resorted to cannibalism. this film perfectly portrays the insanity that overtakes people under extreme conditions. there are a few humorous parts in this movie, but the majority of it is just a very slow moving and realistic film. it follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another, and eventually to death. a very interesting film, showing the death, and the horror, of what may have been the worst war the world has ever seen.

although it has been a failure in movie theaters because mainly mylene farmer, one of the 3 top stars in france had not the first role. fans had changed their mind after that and were waiting for it on dvd. when it has been released on dvd this year it has have a tremendous success ! the others fails was the slow pace and the incredible length (3h) at that time (1994) that have annoyed critics. but the melancholic story makes mandatory that slow pace and long time. the moral of the film is you cannot escape from the death you are destined for. it is the same theme than in the movie "final destination" and makes it a gothic tale. the atmosphere is very melancholic.

i finally managed to see this movie...after so many years of expectancy...i was so curious to see if this movie it is as bad as some people say..and my opinion is that this movie it wasn't bad at all,on the contrary it was amazing...i enjoyed every second from it...from the beginning until the end...the actors were great they sent me the feeling that i was living the story at the same time as the movie was playing...the landscapes were so beautiful were the film was shot...and it did charmed me.. also the music was extraordinary and i have nothingto reproach..i think that the plot was very original i don't think that i saw a movie like this...it is a shame that it isn't recognized all over the world..to bad for those who didn't get the chance to see it. i give this movie 10/10

how to summarize this film ? it is simply impossible. why you should see it ? maybe for the story, very probably for the actors (giorgio, catherine...), above all for the universe and the poetry. this is a tale. sad, sometimes dark, but a tale. i love this film !!!! just waiting for the dvd !! thank you mister boutonnat.

giorgino can to some people look a bit long but it's one of rare real romantique adventure film. it could be compare to docter jivago with a bit of sleepy holow. you must see it.

i think it's incredibly hard to write any kind of full-scale review to giorgino, merely because it's one of those viewer-dependent, complex, poetical and philosophical movies that are brain-wearing if, while watching them, you're trying to enjoy their shell and get to their core simultaneously, yet there are several things which are certain and beyond any doubt for any man of art (which, i hope, i am). the first thing: it's a certain masterpiece, even of that kind of art which remains through a long long time; the second: it's one of those rare "dark" movies in which darkness is poetic, even romantic, attractive and much more sad than depressing, like the art of pieter brueghel or caspar david friedrich. as to the core of the movie, someone called it kafkian, though i don't agree with that because actually it's far beyond kafka's misanthropic logic and much more like edgar poe's parables: dark and scary but through that touching the most gentle strings of our souls. actually, on the poetic side (which is much more important than the narrative), giorgino is a tale about eternal peace and love which can be achieved only through eternal childhood of soul. those who have such souls are usually branded as crazy by our society, but from another point of view, they all have the virtue all the others lost when become "grown": the virtue of god's love. indeed, giorgino is a very christian movie, "be like children" (mt 18:3) is it's real hidden tag-line, though the movie never deals with any kind of moral and concentrates only on the christian philosophy for, dare to suppose, true god is beyond any human moral. yet i think that boutonnat is too harsh portraying "grown" people as a sort of demons trying to steal childhood from rare survived souls, but it's his point of view and he has a right to think so. while watching giorgino don't try to look for some hidden symbols (though there are some), better look for thoughts expressed through characters and their behavior, and do learn from them. also i cannot mention that the movie looks astonishingly through excellent photography, especially through rational use of color filters, incredibly apposite editing, wonderful acting of all the cast and, of course, due to the atmospheric beauty of winter mountains that reminded me of the brueghel's "hunters in the snow". also, interestingly enough, the scene with death in the form of an old woman with sunken black-ringed eyes riding a cart, instantly reminded me of pesta (plague) from the series of drawings by the norwegian painter theodor kittelsen, depicting how a black plague is sweeping out the population of a small town in the mountain valley. is it a coincidence?

that's certainly not the best film ever. but that's certainly worth seeing for people with a special kind of mind. so the one who loves sadness and depression, and scary fairy-tales at night, and wolves and real madness - welcome! if you find a copy, of course:) as for me, i could stand it only once... but since that the wolves, and saint-lucy, and children's drawings, and a headless christ live in my nightmares.

giorgino is a long, excruciating journey from bad to worse in the life of protagonist after whom the movie is named. young demobilized, gas-poisoned first world war lieutenant of very delicate health, who previously was a doctor in an orphanage for children with some mental deprivations, goes in a search of their new location and finds much more than he ever intended to and quite of a different nature. depressive atmosphere of ultimate despair, where the insane ones are much less horrible than the sane, where the madness is a kind of poetry, will hold you hypnotized from the very first frames of this film to the last. and all the beauty: beauty of the winter and mountains, beauty of snowy landscapes and wild woods, i don't even know how all the sorrow and sadness of last days of war could be made so beautiful.

giorgino is a strange, dark, obsessive object; the casting is impressive, the plot is powerful, reminded me of edgar poe's tales. probably not a masterpiece, but it does leave us with the remembrance of strong images, fine music, fear, sadness, confusion, and a sentence that says it all : the wolves are coming. giorgino is quite forgotten now, and when it was released nobody seemed to appreciate it. that's a shame. if you ever have a chance to see this, well... give it a try.

simply one of the best movies ever. if you won't get it - sorry for you. i believe that someday people will include this one in their all-time top 10's. not now, but in the far future.

a wonderful film - a charming, quirky family story. a cross-country journey filled with lots of interesting, oddball stops along the way (& several very cool cameos). great cast led by rod steiger carries the film along and leads to a surprise ending. well directed & shot - a really nice movie.

i found this film rather brilliant. initially i wanted a "when animals attack" flick along the lines of "frankenfish" or even "rogue" but was delivered a truly horrific ordeal that was not devoid of humanity. having been to the areas this was made (including the croc farm at the start of the movie, even sharing the same guide!) it added to the fear factor. those crocs really are everywhere up there, though i don't think they had the "attitude" of this beastie. yes there were some melodramatic moments but they contributed rather distract from the whole atmosphere. i genuinely cared for the characters and shuddered contemplating "what would i do?" in their boat. not knowing where your enemy lurked or the sound of the croc chowing down at night was genuinely frightening. i would argue that this flick is one of the best horrors i have seen in years (coming close to the descent). i give it four alligator handbags.

in retrospect, the 1970s was a golden era for the american cinema, as demonstrated and explored by this documentary directed by ted demme and richard lagravenese. this ifc effort serves to illustrate and clarify the main idea of what that time meant for the careers of these illustrious people seen in the documentary.the amazing body of work that remains, is a legacy to all the people involved in the art of making movies in that period. the decade was marked by the end of the viet nam war and the turbulent finale of those years of jimmy carter's presidency.one thing comes out clear, films today don't measure against the movies that came out during that creative decade because the industry, as a whole, has changed dramatically. the big studios nowadays want to go to tame pictures that will be instant hits without any consideration to content, or integrity, as long as the bottom line shows millions of dollars in revenues.the other thing that emerges after hearing some of america's best creative minds speak, is the importance of the independent film spirit because it is about the only thing that afford its creators great moral and artistic rewards.this documentary is a must see for all movie fans.

the 1970s opened the door to the largest, most diverse era of film in the history. some films were great ("the godfather", "the conversation", "mean streets", chinatown", "the french connection", "five easy pieces", "jaws", "mccabe and mrs. miller") others were not so great ("the getaway", "the outfit", "badge 373", "joe", "the taking of pelham one two three", "brewster mccloud", "castle keep") and others were barely worth the price of admission.yet every one was a fresh breath of air compared to today's corporate hollywood. where every film is given a big weekend to recoup its cost. or go straight to hbo and rental.what "decade" does so well is to relate the sudden and rarely experienced sensation of freedom to be given money to make and direct a film. perhaps personal. perhaps not. sometime with a clutch of extras. sometimes, in the middle of a busy street before the cops show up. long before the corporate overseers, suits, committees and lawyers ever became part of "the system".the commentaries are superb. especially julie christie and dennis hopper. though as you listen, you'll slowly discover just how many big directors today (coppola, scorsese, ron howard, dennis hopper, peter bogdonovitch) got stated as "roger corman commandos". working long hours with short pay. shooting a film in under a month. learning all the steps and tricks of the trade by doing it themselves. turning in product that was on-time and under-budget.see "decade" for its message. and for a long and varied list of films to watch made through those wondrously turbulent years.though, i would not complain if ifc decided to devote another documentary solely to that most under-rated grand pioneer of film, roger corman.

john leguizamo is a great comedian and storyteller. every time this has been on hbo i've had to stop and watch it. john tells the story of how he grew up (probably some fact and fiction) and adds hilarious stories in the midst. if you like john's comedy i would have to say this is probably his comedy at his best.

this one man show may be the most fantastic show i've ever seen. to call this simply a stand up act is to do it a great injustice, there is a definate reason that this was a broadway show. john leguizamo is a master of making people of every culture feel at home listening to his story of growing up and dealing with his family and life in general. i would reccomend this show to anyone, as long as they can handle the language.

after watching john preform this one of a kind show, i had to share.....it was really something to watch a grown man portray himself as a child. i like the fact that with every character he "became," you could picture what they looked like. it is more entertaining when you can understand the individual. "freak" is what real "stand up" should be. john is real talent.

john has made two one man shows. spic o rama and freaks, and neither one has shown up on dvd... john!!! why do you this to me john?? put it on dvd john, so the people can see,they need to see john!! :d... just in case anyones keeping a watchful aye!!

this was very energetic and well played show. i saw it back in 98 and my friends and i still joke about it. each time i watch it's always as funny as the first. i also love the way that everyone can relate to it in their own particular ways. i am very much looking forward to seeing more of john's own scripts and productions. unfortunately i can't find it anywhere for sale, and i've done quite a lot of looking. if anyone knows a website or store to refer me to, i would very much appreciate it as i am looking for his other live performances as well. please send me a message if any of you have info on the subject. thankyou.

i never saw any of john leguizamo's stand-up before i watched freak, and after seeing it again on hbo comedy recently it was better, more enlivening and with things that, at the age of 14, i couldn't understand quite before. spike lee did a wonderful job directing, keeping the visual angle up to par with leguizamo's theatrics and the style of personal storytelling; it's substance and style merging together but unobtrusively. we get leguizamo's rants about race and sex (the bits about sex are classic), but a lot of it is about family, and what sticks still fresh in my mind is about his father. even when things get dark in some of the stories, there's something fresh or crazy or random that leguizamo pulls out to get a laugh, and it works more often than not. if something does fall flat (for me at any rate) it might be his personality tics here and there. but overall, it's the kind of fun material that isn't heady, but is so true to itself that it stings. find it if you can!

after seeing this routine by john leguizamo, i finally realize why he is such a talent. i enjoy great stage work, and this is stage work at its best. i cannot label it as a stand-up routine, because leguizamo is so intense when playing the different characters. the only time he breaks character is when it is necessary for him to complete his part in which he does so coolly, that you cannot help, but appreciate his talents. i wasn't really sure how i felt about him as an actor, but freak solidified my appreciation of him. for those out there that have not had the opportunity to see this show, i feel for you. definitely check it out. it is one of the nest routines i have ever seen. ranks with eddie murphy, bill cosby and chris rock. four stars and more.

john leguizamo's one man shows are hit or miss: mambo mouth showed off his intense characterizations and great timing but the material was average, spic-o-rama accomplished the former as well but this time the material was funny, freak is a classic followed by his disappointing sex-o-holic. but his stuff in freak showcases his genius and when he's in the spotlight he's without peer.freak's semi-autobiographical look at the journey of a young man has power and resonance i don't think even it's creator knew about. by allowing us the chance to see his soul, mr. leguizamo gives us an opportunity to project our own life onto his and there can be no greater gift a performer can give. the willingness to drop 'the wall', expose and share is too terrifying for most actors-they use characters to hide behind-but jl goes full-throttle and gleefully smashes any pretenses. lenny bruce and richard pryor were our best cultural observers/comedians/actors because they spoke from their heart about whatever they noticed in society and the truth provided slashing humor. combine that with a great actor's gift of mimicry and being in-the-moment (not to mention a sense of humanity) and you'll see john leguizamo has the power to do the same. at least in freak he does.from birth to his first big break and every life altering moment in between, a viewer sees our host and other characters in their most private moments all the while experiencing the pain, hope, and humor that comes with. looking drained and lean muscled-tight jl is ringing with sweat by evening's end having offered up his crazy life for an audience; spike lee's fluid camera work captures the actor's nuances down to the last lip curl and slow blink. the scenarios range from drinking with his machismo-fueled father (when he was 9) to seeing a chorus line with his gay, deaf uncle; his first girlfriend's vicious humiliation when he strips naked, eager to have sex. a nightmarish first sexual encounter with a large german woman in the back of a kentucky fried chicken follows an unsuccessful attempt to pick up a "drunk lapsed catholic" in a bar on st.patty's day. climaxing in a serious showdown with his mother and father, it's here that he shows his true genius: he plays a scene between these two characters and himself and his brother with such a strong dramatic/humourous intensity, you forget you're watching only one person. there's no costume changes, bad wigs, lighting tricks, or makeup. just an actor giving his all. it's simply amazing.other actors/comedians that stand out right now are eddie izzard and chris rock but they don't dive into themselves as deeply as john leguizamo does; that's not a criticism, not by a long shot. i love their work but freak is different. it's moving in a no-b******* way. it's the best one man show out there and no one will be able to touch it for a long time.

definitely not a film to revolutionize the industry or introduce any new techniques of film-making, this is a very handsome and solid production. it's miraculous that we can today enjoy it in superb quality on dvd - probably most of the viewers about a 100 years ago saw a black and white copy, as the stencil tinted de luxe edition was available only at the very best theaters. even if you are not fascinated by this film or the subject of it, you can't but marvel at the copy released by image entertainment (together with another gem, from the manger to the cross, 1912). it's virtually impossible to see a film that is over a century old but shows so little damage. the process of stencil colouring was a very effective one and, compared to the occasionally blurry and smeared images of hand coloured film, the colours are crisp and well defined. filmed within the limitations of the film-making as known back in 1902 when the filming commenced, the static nature of the scenes can today be considered almost intentional, meditative and solemn. the tableaux keep moving at a steady paste, so the film never gets tedious. you might not be fascinated by this film as a work of cinematography, but it sure is handsome as a work of academic, picturesque art. if you are a religious person, the fact that you are watching anonymous, long since departed people playing long since departed characters, adds to the mystery significantly. a proper viewing for christmas or lent. p.s: i've ticked the "contains spoilers" box just for fun. as you can see, i haven't revealed the ending.

i have always been fascinated by silent films. there is something about seeing actors and actresses from 100 years ago performing. jaded by today's high-tech special effects, i always try and imagine what it was like to watch a particular film at the time of it's original release. it helps to appreciate the crudeness of early cinema."the life and passion of jesus christ" is a very charming production from pathe, originally filmed in 1902, but expanded and finally released in 1905. imagine a series of famous religious paintings coming to life, separated by title cards, and you will have a pretty good idea of what this film is like. for example, the scene in which mary and joseph rest as they are escaping to egypt, is almost identical to luc olivier merson's 1879 painting "rest on the flight to egypt", right down to mary sitting on the famous sphinx. while some might find these "living paintings" an unimaginative cop-out, i found them to be very charming, and very nostalgic.the sets and costumes appear to be right out of a stage production of the life of christ. possibly from and elaborate passion play of the day. the make-up on the cast is very theatrical, so much so that a close-up of jesus is almost comical. again, where others might be bothered by the cudeness of them, i was quite charmed.having been filmed over a period of 3 years, the continuity isn't too bad. the biggest flaws are in the casting changes made over that time. the characters of john the apostle and the 12 year old jesus change in mid scene, much to the audiences surprise!the best unintentional humor, of the film, is in the birth of jesus scene. the baby literally appears, as if by magic, in the manger between mary and joseph. maybe it was simply my frame of mind at the time i viewed it, but i laughed out loud! if only child birth were that easy!!!! to top it off, the actress who plays mary looks bored through the whole scene (actually, through the whole movie), as if this sort of thing happens every day! my, how times have changed!as simplistic as this film is, compared to today, it's really a wonderful window into the past. i recommend it!

tempo di uccidere (time to kill) by guiliano montaldo is a bit of a strange film, but it's good in it's own way.i won't bother with a summary of the plot. most that i've read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most people who wrote those didn't really understand the film. and you need to understand it to some level, even if you cannot describe for yourself what it's actually about. this film is strange in a "once upon a time in america" way- only shorter.many 'hollywood' stars (whatever that may mean...) have played in lesser known italian productions. it's known that many actors who are past their prime or slowly rising to it do this. cage was not yet a real star when this was made. i'm not a fan of him. he's very good in some roles (raising arizona, bringing out the dead) and weak when he plays the hero. i don't really know what to think of him in this one, but he sure doesn't portray the typical hero main character. this film could have done without him, but the fact that he starred may be the only reason this one ever made it to dvd.the supporting cast is good. not one of them looks fake and they act as if they are really there. solid support.i have seen 3 films by montaldo (marco polo, sacco&vanzetti and this one) and i think he is one of the greater directors of this time. unfortunately, nobody knows him. this movie was his last in a long time (a break of 19 years). i think that this movie might have failed at the office, but from the way it is done i think that for montaldo it was a personal project that he really liked.the production is great. it's always enough. the dusty army camps, the claustophobic cities and the magnificent landscape all play a great part. it all feels very real. in some scenes you can almost feel the heat. the sound itself is nothing special, but the music by ennio morricone is very good. it's not a piece that you will whistle when in the shower, but it sure works great.so this movie looks, feels and sounds just right. it doesn't serve the lessons learned from it on a golden platter, but that may be the biggest difference between hollywood and euro-cinema all around. it might sound strange to give it an 8 and not recommend it to people, but that is what i do. if you are looking for action; avoid this one! if you are looking for a well made apocalypse now in a different time and setting, but with a bit of similar journey into a 'state of mind'(sorry if this sound corny but i don't know what else to call it) you just might enjoy this one a lot.

in the wake of my personal research into the pending "end cycle" time of 2012 presented by the mayan calendar system, i believe this movie should be seen every bit as much as "what the bleep do we know?" while some may believe that matters of top level science should only be communicated in doctorate level "speak," "the elegant universe" breaks such barriers. the visuals and the select dialog make it easy to comprehend this walk through the history of physics. there are numerous messages in this movie, the least of which is that academic science must always be ready to revise what's being taught. true, pure discovery science is beautiful because there's always something additional and exciting to bring to the fore if we have the courage to seek it out in the face of "established" science.

the elegant documentary -don't watch this movie ... if you're an egotistical know-all student of physics. this much less than one percent (miniscule fraction) of the population may find that this show just tells them what they have already learned and already know.do watch this movie! - if you're one of the massive majority of people that fall into the greater than 99% of the population that does not study or already have a sound knowledge of the theories of physics including relativity, quantum, string and m-theory.what a brilliantly architected documentary. starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a universe of pure magic - and dimensions beyond. i have always had a huge appreciation of mathematics. this movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics is without making you feel like you're about to fail the grade.the show is repetitive at times as the original format was a mini-series split over three shows. it therefore makes sense to give us polite little reminders of the principles being presented. i found this immensely helpful as it kept reminding me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence.we are all (and everything around us) is vibrational-energy with a natural tendency towards harmony. this movie may blow your mind - or at least help you realize that the universe is far far bigger than that which we see around us (even with the hubble telescope) and far far smaller than the protons and neutrons within the atoms we learned about in high-school. m-theory holds many magnificent magnitudes of 'possibility'.it just seemed so appropriate that all of this elegance should by it's very nature move (by admission by the many brilliant scientists presenting) out of the realm of science and into the realm of philisophy.you do not have to be religious at all to feel like this movie brought you one step closer to god.bravo brian greene. well done indeed.p.s. if you're interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place in the universe and would like some more insight into the 'possibilities' quantum mechanics blended with spirituality (of all things) can bring then i highly recommend that you also watch "what the bleep!? - down the rabbit hole". yes i know they make a few silly mistakes by suggesting a shaman may not be able to see a boat if he hasn't seen one before (my eyes process light reflections just fine - i see things everyday that i've never seen before) and brain cells are cells in the body that actually don't divide. but if you can get over these little hurdles and put down the things you don't like and hang on to those that you do - there is a lot to like about this film.then watch "the secret" (2006 documentary about the law of attraction - search for imdb title "tt0846789"). this information just might change your life profoundly - forever. if you search deeper you might even find the universe is talking to us with thought (if you'll listen) - and some are - and that is truly incredible. there is a modern day jesus/mohammad/buddha (those, among others, that history suggests have communicated with the non-physical) alive today and she lives in texas. i know some of you know what i'm talking about.i do not consider myself religious by any traditional definition but i have never felt more at home or as comfortable in the universe as i do now.

ok. on the whole, this three part documentary will bring most interested people up to date with going's on in the world of physics, and the last 300 years of discovery of our universe. if you have read stephen hawkings brilliant book "a brief history of time" and understood it then you might benefit from the visual description of certain concepts..which i did to a certain extent. greene is bearable, but obviously for the sake of the masses, tends to explain things in a slighty patronising way. this is of course deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who watches this series.the guest scientists were good. (no hawking, but i suppose he has his own dvd(s) ) i kept waiting for him to appear but they rotate through the same ones for almost 3 parts... (very american weighted here, with a few brits and one antipodean) i bought the nova 2 disc edition (ntsc) and there were a few inclusions that really detracted from the overall experience.1. the "this is brought to you by.." at the start of each part was a necessary evil for the first part, but seeing it 2 more times before it was over was very ordinary.2. can't be helped i suppose but there is quite a bit of overlap at the start of 2 and 3 which had me reaching for the ffw button a few times.3. this disc set was straight from tv..(ie ads, what happen last show for those that missed it, and frequent "goto pbs.org for more ...." )appearing throughout the presentation. (quite unlike bbc material which is unmatched for presentation..planets, the blue planet, etc) my 7/10 is based on content alone. the niggles were there but i got over them. if this had have been done with that classic british accented presenter( you know the one) it would be a perfect disc set in my opinion.if you have seen this and want more...then i highly recommend hawkings book " a brief history of time"... i wish it was a movie too.happy viewing.

i myself am a physics student, and i have to say i think this is one of the best 'popular' introductions to string theory that's out there. the elegant universe manages to make the entire topic of string (although it's actually m) theory accessible to a wider audience.some 'popular science' programmes feel that the best approach is just to throw the audience in at the deep end, throwing technical jargon at them without so much as an explanation, and presenting the theory in a boring, stale style. this programme goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics, and explains the issues that need to be resolved between the two so we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe on both a large and small scale.i suppose some could say it's slow and takes too long to get to the interesting stuff like extra dimensions and wormholes, but the thing is: that's against the point. explaining string theory from the start is nigh on impossible without at least mentioning the physics at its base, and the way it's explained in the elegant universe is clear and entertaining.whether you'll like this program really does depend on if you're willing to perhaps be initially dumbfounded by some of the ideas that greene presents: extra dimensions and warping of spacetime aren't exactly prevalent in everyday life, are they? but, if you persevere with some of the more exotic concepts in this programme, you'll find that it will give you an insight into the research that drives the world of physics today. and if you're studying physics, well, it's great entertainment as well as you'll be likely able to follow this and appreciate it even more!

billy wilder continues his strong run of films during the 1950s with a biopic of charles lindbergh, the young american pilot who became the first man to fly solo across the atlantic in 1927. jimmy stewart plays lindbergh, and while he might be a bit too old for the part, he still brings the sincere warmth and confidence needed as well as his trademark down-to-earth goodness that makes him an iconic film star. wilder directs solidly, balancing the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what lindbergh was up against when he decided to take this challenge. it certainly isn't his nor stewart's best work, but it is a gem of a movie. it lifts your spirits with the plane and makes you proud to be an american. overall, it is just plain good.

i would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released. all these years later at 37 and i had no qualms hiring it on dvd. great entertainment for all ages. and what about the song the rainbow connection? see:why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side? rainbows are visions, but only illusions, and rainbows have nothing to hide. so we've been told and some choose to believe it i know they're wrong, wait and see. someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers and me.who said that every wish would be heard and answered when wished on the morning star? somebody thought of that, and someone believed it, and look what it's done so far. what's so amazing that keeps us stargazing and what do we think we might see? someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers, and me.all of us under its spell, we know that it's probably magic...... have you been half asleep? and have you heard voices? i've heard them calling my name. ... is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors? the voice might be one and the same i've heard it too many times to ignore it it's something that i'm s'posed to be... someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers, and me.laa, da daa dee da daa daa, la laa la la laa dee daa doo...

this was a truly epic production that had all the elements that one would want in a fantasy film. the costuming, the music, the cinematography - all artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and provided a rich experience.ted danson, best know for his tv roles in "cheers" and "becker," was excellent in the role of gulliver. mary steenburgen (time after time, cross creek) performed equally well in her limited role as his wife.other performances i really enjoyed were james fox as dr. bates, alfre woodard as the queen of brobdingnag, and peter o'toole as the emperor of lilliput.this would make an enjoyable children's film, but it also would definitely appeal to adults for it's deep social commentary.

i remember when this nbc mini-series aired when i was in high school. after reading the novel, i thought i'd check out some adaptations. didn't expect much out of a tv mini-series, but now i might have to check out some more. this is actually excellent, and the best possible film version that could be made. writer simon moore, who wrote the teleplay for the original traffic mini-series, upon which the soderberg film was based, came up with a brilliant narrative conceit which helps the story flow very smoothly: he frames gulliver's adventures as flashbacks, with the actual story beginning as gulliver first returns home (everything having happened on one journey). gulliver, played by cheers' ted danson, is sort of crazy-seeming when his wife, mary steenburgen, welcomes him back into his home. unfortunately, the house is now owned by the local doctor, james fox, who has designs on steenburgen. gulliver seems merely disturbed at first, but when he starts telling stories of tiny people, that's all the evidence fox needs to throw him into an insane asylum. all four of gulliver's travels are related in this version, in the same order as the novel (the only time this has been done on film). i love the way his present situation reflects his flashbacks. gulliver's small son, whom he has never met before, reminds him of the lilliputians. the doctors who observe him in his cell from a mezzanine loom above him and remind him of the brogdingnagians, and the doctors' scientific inquiries remind him of the insane scientific experiments and theories of the laputans and the professors at the academy. finally, when he is put on trial he is reminded of the houyhnhnms and the yahoos. the cast of this thing is amazing, and includes peter o'toole, ned beatty, alfre woodard, john gielgud, kristin scott thomas, omar sharif and warwick davis. the biggest flaw of the mini-series is that the acting is really uneven. you have all these fine actors, but the lesser characters are often played by actors who were probably fine in episodes of l.a. law, but don't do well in a costume drama. ted danson isn't especially great, although he has a few sequences where he excels. it's probably better that he didn't attempt one, but all the other characters of the film speak in an english accent. steenburgen is actually pretty good at it, and is quite good overall. another flaw the series has is that the adventures happen a tad too quickly. it's not believable that gulliver spent eight years away from home, as is claimed. but, in general, it captures swift's tone and purpose very well, while, with its structure, adding a new emotional level.

first of all i'd like to say that this movie is the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind. it is the best out of all the excellent muppet movies, and every other movie out there! so boo-ya for jim henson!this movie is the first of all the muppet movies and the best. (boo ya) it's about a frog (kermit) who tries to make to hollywood. along with the awesome friends he meets on the way comes a couple of the greatest songs ever made that are bound to become classics, including "the rainbow connection"in conclusion i would like to say that watching this movie was the greatest thing ever!. if you havn't already seen it, then get off your computer and get you tushy to your nearest video store!!! (if they don't have the muppet movie, i'd sue them big time )

in a style reminiscent of the best of david lean, this romantic love story sweeps across the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert regions against which it is set. it's a film which purports that one does not choose love, but rather that it's love that does the choosing, regardless of who, where or when; and furthermore, that it's a matter of the heart often contingent upon prevailing conditions and circumstances. and thus is the situation in `the english patient,' directed by anthony minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune of places and times, proving that when it is predestined, love will find a way.it's wwii; flying above the african desert, hungarian count laszlo de almasy (ralph fiennes) is shot down, his biplane mistaken for an enemy aircraft. and though he survives the crash, he is severely burned. to his great good fortune, however, he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and winds up in a hospital. but existing conditions are governed by circumstances of war, and almasy soon becomes one of many patients being transported via convoy to a different facility. upon reaching italy, he is too weak and ill to continue on, and a canadian nurse, hana (juliette binoche), volunteers to stay behind with him at an abandoned monastery.hana soon discovers that her charge is something of a man of mystery, as almasy remembers nothing of his past, and not even his own name. thought to be english, the only clues pointing to who he is are contained in a book found in his possession after the crash, but even they are as cryptic as hana's patient. slowly, however, under prompting from hana, almasy begins to remember bits and pieces of his life, and his story begins to unfold. and his memory is helped along even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named caravaggio (willem dafoe), who suspects that almasy is the man he's been looking for-- a man with whom he wants to settle a score. but, burned beyond recognition, almasy may or may not be that man. meanwhile, almasy's memories continue to surface; memories of a woman he loved, katherine clifton (kristin scott thomas)-- as well as memories of katherine's husband, geoffrey (colin firth). and, crippled in mind and body as he is, those memories become the only thing left to which he can cling with any hope at all, even as his life seems to be slipping farther away with each passing moment.in addition to directing, anthony minghella also wrote the screenplay for this film, which he adapted from the novel by michael ondaatje. the result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of lean's `doctor zhivago' and `lawrence of arabia'; a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty. simply put, minghella's film is genius realized; crafted and delivered with a poetic perfection, watching it is like watching a monet come to life. from the opening frames, minghella casts a hypnotic spell over his audience that is binding and transporting, with a story that has an emotional beauty that equals the engagingly stunning and vibrant images brought to life by john seale's remarkable cinematography; images that virtually fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer. in every sense, this is a film of rare eloquence, with a striking emotional capacity that facilitates an experience that is truly transcendental. nominated in twelve categories, it deservedly received a total of nine oscars, including best picture, director, supporting actress (binoche) and cinematography.if one had to choose a single word to describe the `essence' of this film, it would be `excellence.' even an extraordinary film, however, does not receive nine oscars without performances that are extraordinary in kind; and the performances given by ralph fiennes and kristin scott thomas here transcend the term `oscar worthy.' nominated for best actor for his portrayal of almasy (geoffrey rush was awarded the gold for `shine'), fiennes has never been better, achieving an emotional depth with his character that is nearly palpable. private and introspective, almasy is not by his very nature an individual to whom the audience will be able to form an intimate connection; fiennes, however, finds a way to open that emotional door just enough to let you in, enough so that you taste the honest passion welling up within him. and it works. almasy does not seek your friendship; he will, however, gain your compassion.kristen scott thomas, too, received an oscar nomination for best actress (frances mcdormand received the award for `fargo') for her portrayal of katherine, a woman whose stoic countenance masks the emotional conflict raging within her, born of the forbidden passion that enslaves her and yet to which she gives herself willingly, casting off her shackles of repression to embrace a love so strong it threatens to consume her. the reserve katherine must maintain evokes the empathy of the audience, as scott thomas successfully mines the emotional depths of her character to the greatest possible effect. it's the kind of performance that draws you in and holds you fast, taking you as it does beyond that curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what must be if only for the sake of appearances, and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion. understated and shaded with subtlety, it's terrific work by kristin scott thomas.binoche gives a stunning, affecting performance, as well, as the kindhearted nurse, hana; it is her humanity, in fact, which defines love in it's purest sense and offers a balanced perspective of it within the context of the film. her relationship with kip (naveen andrews) affords us a glimpse of passion of another kind, which contrasts effectively with the intensity of that between almasy and katherine. `the english patient' is a film that will move you and fill you emotionally; one you will not want to see end. 10/10.   

the biggest heroes, is one of the greatest movies ever. a good story, great actors and a brilliant ending is what makes this film the jumping start of the director thomas vinterberg's great carrier.

this must be one of the funniest danish movies ever made. ulrich thomsen and thomas bo larsen are hilarious, as they drive across sweden. i don't know how ulrich thomsen does it, but somehow he can manage to play insane in a very sane way. but if you don't understand danish (i am not referring to your pastry here) don't waste your time on this ¬ñ i don't think it would work with subtitles.

this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. it is about true love and friendship. about turning your life around and doing something good for someone else. thomas bo larsen may play the same role he has done in so many other movies, but recently we have seen him in other roles which he does great too. but so what if he plays the same role that he has done in other movies ¬ñ he's perfect for that role. ulrich thomsen does a great job too. these two criminal "low-lifes" are the best friends ever. they share everything and they do everything for each other no matter what the costs are. when they find out that peter's daughter is being abused they put everything on hold (things you can't put on hold unless you have to make even more criminal acts) and takes her to a better place. they do the best they can ¬ñ these two men are not masterminds but they have their heart in the right place. all i can say is that peter and carsten are my biggest heroes too¬Ö

it's all there: two classic anti-hero buddies, a headlong chase through beautiful swedish scenery, guns, violence, sex, and a butch cassidy / sundance kid - style finale.add a touch of surrealism and some distinctly danish humour, and you've got this excellent road-movie.

"hit and run" is a shattering story starring the always wonderful margaret colin as a society lady who "has it all" until she hits a child with her car and leaves the scene. hence the title. the tragedy is that she goes to call for help and returns, but is frightened away by angry passers-by who think the hitter abandoned the scene. this was made in the days when not everyone had a cell phone or there wouldn't be a story.colin's guilt and anguish are palpable and cause her to act so strangely that a detective gets onto her right away. her lies sink her deeper and deeper into a self-loathing hole, causing her to make a bad situation worse.this is a very thought-provoking story, and one can't help but to feel this lady's pain, wishing throughout that she would simply come clean.as a tv movie, thanks to colin and a strong script, this is a well above average tv movie.

the main point of the movie, imo, is the fact the joanna's whole life has been nothing but a series of facades. the movie opens up with her secretly dying her gray roots, and hiding the used kit in an empty tissue box. what is strange is that she is hiding this from her husband. if she has to hide mundane things from her loved one, one can bet that she is hiding even bigger things from others involved in her life.when joanna accidentally hits cory, she leaves the scene to call the police. by the time she returns, the police and ambulance are there, as well as people from her community, remarking "what kind of person hits a child then just leaves her there?" well-respected in her community, she makes the decision to keep quiet about what she had done. but, she never realized how difficult it would be the keep up her facades...great movie-i have seen it many times!

this is such a great movie to watch and all the actors put together a great film which would be enjoyed by everyone! it is very emotional in parts, so when you watch it grab a box of tissues to keep you company!! this movie doesn't deserve a rating below 10/10!

margaret colin stars as the principal figure in this story; as i watched it, i remembered her bit part in adrian lynes's "√ºnfaithful" as diane lane's neighbor in a tony ny neighborhood.this movie was surprisingly good, and diane stillman deserves credit for an accurate portrayal of class, crimes, and misdemeanors, which actually occur in upscale neighborhoods (perish the thought!!!).it is real but not over-dramatized; the audience lives through her accident, the pain it has caused;denial; and the ultimate resolution.it is more than just a question of "what is a good person" as colin speaks to her husband....is a person's character defined by one single act; and should they be condemned forever because of their action?? the questions are pertinent; it is also amusing to see several cinematic references to martha stewart (i.e. the fussy, bothersome mother);colin is reputed by her sometime friends to be a "perfect hostess, with perfect genes"....(gag); and a scene wherein colin is confronted by police;(the "friends" also betray her, later)....the denial and facades of american society are addressed; (oh, murder doesn't occur here; similar to the theme in "√§ season in purgatory", by author dominick dunne, about the true murder of martha moxley; in greenwich, connecticut); colin is aware of her crime; but consciously finds herself perpetuating the facade, until she finally breaks down;rent or buy this film; she is an underrated actress who does quite well in these roles.

absolutely one of the best aviation movies of all times on so many levels. hardware junkies will drool over the largest single massing of flyable spitfires outside of a battle of britain reenactment. no less than eight flying spits are on hand for very accurate ground and air sequences.those that marvel over the lore of flying and get misty-eyed reciting high flight will identify with the central characters' reverence for the freedom of being fast, free and high in their dark blue world. be warned: romantics and even dog lovers are treated to a very emotional ride in this movie. the core message is one that is shared by many war vets, in that their finest hours, their period of life when they felt most alive, was in fact during the war when everything else is sad and gray.the plot concerns czech pilots who escape from their country when the nazis invade and join the raf free czech squadron. there are a few subplots, all of which are worth careful attention. this is just a plain old excellent movie that even the most ardent anti-hardware romantic will love (keep the kleenex on hand). beautiful photography, first-rate acting, accurate details of raf life during the battle of britain. easily a candidate for any aviation enthusiast's personal dvd collection.

sleeper cell attempts to swim both sides of the pool (terrorism/patriotic muslim americans), and it does neither very well.i had put off watching this show for a very long time, because i had a feeling it would be too predictable, but after a year in my netflix queue, i finally moved it up to the front.the show is about an undercover muslim man working for the fbi in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the united states. the undercover agent in the show actually is a muslim, so we see his conflict/resolution between his patriotism and his religious beliefs. personally i would have rather watched a drama about a muslin american family living in the united states, but it is doubtful that an america tv channel (cable or network) will ever produce anything that shows muslims in a flattering light.i am not a muslim, but i have a lot of muslim american friends, and i can honestly say that none of them are terrorists and they all love america.sleeper cell comes close to busting stereotypes of muslims, but it also focuses on the worse muslim stereotypes. in the first episode we see an "honor killing," which is a very poor portrayal of islam, but in the 3rd episode we see a very respected moderate muslim scholar teaching the viewer that the real jihad is actually a personal struggle that is not meant to incite violence towards others.if only the moderate muslim scholar had been the main character of the show.americans need to learn a lot more about islam, sleeper cell helps a little bit, but it comes up far short of giving the america audience what it really needs to knows.that said, the acting in this show is superb, and the drama is extremely engrossing. if only they had made this show about islam in america without the terrorism, it would have been first rate.

to be completely honest, i completely intrigued by the original concept of 'sleeper cell.' having watched the best part of the series on fx channel (uk), my sky got broke meaning i missed the crucial finale. but what i did see of it, i assumed it to be a great story line, good acting and as i don't watch '24' i thought it was great, and it's been confirmed for a second season...one of the best tv programs i have seen. much more realistic and believable than "24." excellent character development and plot line. does not bash islam, but gives a thoughtful and considered approach, showing the difference between radical terrorist islam and true islam. everybody should see this show!stringy xx

nice description of the situation in the us, it explains different kinds of islam, not just show terrorist and extremist. islam can be other thing that killing, they show why some people become terrorist and how to be muslim without being extremist. it is a great series that muslims and no-muslims should see. now we hope that other series or films will be done to change the idea of all muslims are terrorist and all americans want to destroy islam. it gave me the interest to discover what islam is exactly and what the us and also european government do to help cohabitation between people of different religion.

the problem with this series is that it is too real. i am watching it on amazon "unbox" and having just finished episode 2 i hate, absolutely hate, fark, the leader of the cell. i cannot recall any television series ever having this emotional impact. remember the old tag line for horror movies "just keep telling yourself its only a movie"? well i find myself repeatedly reminding myself that its "only tv". but of course it isn't only tv is it? the possibility of a cell such as the one portrayed here actually operating in the united states is certainly within the range of plausibility. that's what gives this program its vicious authenticity. and that's why i hate it so much.

a scarily real drama, there isn't another drama out there that has scared the crap out of me like this has, the characters are not your typical islamic terrorist, you have a blonde haired, blue eyed guy who is as dumb as he looks, he is a converted muslim. a well respected business man, who pretends to be jewish and a frenchman who has converted to islam, but has clearly taken the word of the koran to a whole new level. the hero of the plot is darwyn, who is an undercover fbi agent who has infiltrated the terrorist cell, and has to do all sorts of god awful things to prevent himself from being detected. the first episode is a small taste of what's to follow. although it is about islamic terrorists the drama has a unique way of pointing out that not all muslims are extremists, which is comforting to those concerned with racism, considering half the terrorist cell are islam converts, it makes you think that maybe they are the ones to be afraid of. the most chilling drama i've ever seen. the reason its so chilling is cause you never know who your friends, your husband or your neighbours really are. terrorists can be anyone, anywhere, anytime.

i have found this show by accident and was surprised to find out that nobody i know has ever heard of it. this was by far one of the best shows i have seen in months if not years and i cannot wait for more episodes to come out. sleeper cell portrays a psychological struggle of an undercover agent inside of a terrorist cell who has to constantly make difficult decisions in order to maintain his cover while staying true to his real cause. this is an extremely well done show. it keeps you intrigued from the first episode till the end and though progressing slowly, is fast enough for you to feel on the edge. quite realistic and humane, it touches on important topics and every episode presents an interesting question to ponder about. this show is not 24 or any of the cop shows on tv and is not trying to be anything either. it is genuine and unique. it is a show about a human being, his difficult choices and his life of struggle where a simple mistake can cost him everything.i gave this show a 10 for great storyline, good progression, excellent cinematography, excellent music and realistic characters each with a story to tell.

imagine "24" completely uncensored, given free license to explain the situation in any detail needed and showing how and why both protagonists do what they do to kill/prevent and you have an idea of how good this tv series is. people in the us have known for a long time that showtime is the new hbo, they are making far better cutting edge, powerful shows and this is no exception. the show takes the viewer all the way through the creation of a sleeper cell to when an attack is attempted, taking in important facets such as faith, religion, funding, means and needs. to the uninitiated, there is much to be learnt about the muslim faith here. unlike on mainstream shows like "24" where the terrorists are merely nutcases who the good guys shoot, their purpose and reasonings here are fully examined. what gives the show more credence is the latest technology the cell/fbi uses and the authentic shots in europe, the us and the middle east, no expense is spared to tell the story accurately the cast are relatively unknowns but the acting is superb with the aid of a tautly-written script that constantly keeps the viewer on edge with many unexpected twists and turns. this show has not got the credit it deserves and ironically is a bit of a sleeper hit itself, must see for anyone at all interested in this genre

smartly written, well acted, intense and suspenseful. this show lives in the real world, not as fantastical as is "24",(and i am a huge fan of 24,incidentally). it has believable characters and in many ways is much smarter than most in this genre. it tries to present both sides of islam. so far, i have watched the first 4 episodes and find the story to be more evenly balanced. the terrorists are more complex and not one dimensional. and as a result of that balance, the terrorists become more frightening than the typical villains being portrayed in film and on television. last but not least, the hero is truly heroic without being a cartoon. i recommend this show for anyone who is a fan of 24 and the like.

if you watch this series you will get an interesting 10 chapters about a sleeper cell's story and each characters. and more intense with a fbi's infiltrate.nice story, nice characters and performs, but something is wrong (for me, of course). the final is wrong. you wait ten chapters hoping a great final (it doesn't matters if they fulfill its objectives or not) but.. well... i think is not enough. its a small final for a big series. also i hoped more definitions about characters stories.but, i repeat, it's and interesting miniseries. if you don't want to wait with large series (22-24 chapters), watch it. i give 7 of 10.

i'm not sure how this could have been better, so i gave it a 10. the acting was excellent - the main woman was so hot - the chap who played darwyn was a smouldering, pensive character who showed the inner turmoil he was suffering (the truck driver's death is one example)excellently. the storyline was believable and the series length was just about right (i.e. i love lost, but will it ever end?). as a brit i tend to think of yanks as gung ho. the lapd were in their ill advised attempts to arrest him, but the other agencies were portrayed positively. my main thought about programmes like this (and the also excellent 24) is - could it happen? would it happen? is it happening now? possibly, probably.i hope they do another series, but after reading some of the previous comments, it would appear not.to summarise - if you haven't seen it, make sure you do.

*be warned of possible spoilers*a friend told me to check out this series, and i'm glad i took her words for it.i read the synopsis on the dvd cover and i was immediately intrigued. the main protagonist is muslim? no way, this is a first! it's about an fbi agent who is under deep cover to penetrate a possible sleeper cell in la; and get this - he is a practicing muslim. i was a little skeptical at first, half-expecting some hero or the antagonist to spout maybe silly, gratuitous and mindless holier-than-thou fanatic drivels... let's face it, a lot of shows have been guilty of this.but then i watched the first three episodes, and i thought: okay, this is good. it wasn't until episode four ("scholar") when i was well and truly impressed. i would like to commend on the great writing and also, superb performances from the actors. i just love how complex every one of these characters - they're not straight out two-dimensional cardboard cutout good guys/bad guys. michael ealy gives a wonderful and believable performance as the muslim fbi agent darwyn al-sayeed, treading the fine line between being the good muslim and being a man with flaws. oded fehr gives his character farik an interesting depth - farik is not the typical oily middle eastern stereotype, but simply someone who truly believes in his cause and doesn't see himself as a fanatic but a man willing to do whatever extreme measures to justify his beliefs. he's very charismatic and authoritative. but i would say that it was alex nesic's performance that clearly left an impression in me in "scholar". his portrayal of his character's emotional struggle was amazing - torn between the softly spoken words of a muslim scholar encouraging him to return to the non-aggressive way because it is the only acceptable way in god's eye and farik's persuasion to believe otherwise.i'm looking forward to watch more shows like this, and not some ridiculously high-octane one man show series. it's clever and open-minded.

sleeper cell is what 24 should have been. 24 is a cartoon. (i watch 24 but feel cheated with every stupid episode, all four or five seasons so far. who can keep track as they are all the same. jack gets in trouble, jack gets out of trouble and then immediately gets back in to trouble and then...) sleeper cell is really well done and is far superior. unfortunately they blew it with the ending in season two. i can think of a half dozen better endings off the top of my head that would have worked better for the writer's obvious goals and not been so contrived. shame on the writers for wrecking what had been up to that ending a really good series.

i don't understand why this show didn't go on there could've been various ways to continue on the line of darwin and farik after season 2, obviously darwin couldn't have been the uc agent infiltrating cells and sabotageing them from the inside, but still they should've given this show at least another season.the show is well casted, believable, and views the islamic religion from both the normal and the extremist point of view. it touches controversial subjects in detail and it has a dramatic meaning that can be said of very few shows nowdays. i'm actually sad that i didn't know about this show until late 2007.

i enjoyed this series, but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording/mixing.for whatever reason, they've had to employ an awful lot of what's called adr, where the actors replace the original location sound with a re-recording of it in a sound booth.the reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location, or because somebody screwed up somewhere in the sound production chain.it wouldn't be so bad if the adr was done well, but at times it's just plain distracting. it's not just the adr that's the problem - the sound mix just doesn't match up to the quality of performances and the pictures.i'd be curious to know what went wrong.

has the drama, suspense, and character developments you would enjoy if you like drama that engages you and entertains as well as educates.the writers know their material and it shows. the direction is always engaging and not blase, and the acting terrific. why this show didn't win any awards tells me the "powers that be" in hollyweird don't know drama or much else for that matter. there is a plot twist in this episode at the end was a complete surprise and was very well played out. i'm glad it wasn't used as a shock scene for any climatic end to this series which would have been more typical and dull. rent this series at once! let's hope its brought back from celluloid extinction.

i watched sleeper cell with a bit of trepidation worrying over whether the terrorists would be glorified. this mesmerizing series not only handled the subject matter responsibly, it created depth and substance to almost every character. oded fehr just gobbles up the screen in every scene he's in¬óand even though his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell, he still has hypnotic appeal. michael ealy held his own well, though in some scenes i wondered why he wasn't shot on the spot because of the scowl he wore on his face.the pros of the series are the two leads, fehr and ealy, the well written characters--all of which were believable and tragic, and the disconcerting issues addressed in the story. having been married to a muslim myself, the atmosphere created was quite realistic. the cons, for me personally, were that the female t&a was overkill¬ómost seemed gratuitous, as well as some of the sex scenes. despite that, it is a raw gripping series that will make you think. somebody give fehr more juicy roles like this one and let him run with it. he's got incredible screen presence and a strange kind of innate power emanating off him.

this is an extremely involving series that is well casted and portraits a sensitive subject with great splendor. we follow michael ealy as the undercover fbi agent darwyn, set to infiltrate a terror cell lead by farik (oder fehr). the series is very well written, and has enough plot twists to keep you sitting at the edge of your seat waiting for whatever happens next.michael ealy is by my definition one of the best actors i've seen portraying an undercover agent. icey cold on the outside, but still a good human being underneath trying his best to keep his head afloat in a highly emotional roller-coaster ride that fbi has had him embark on. oder fehr on the other hand comes off a guy that pretty much could fit into any social scenario. big and strong, but yet able to disappear into the gray mass if so needed. highly authoritative and extremely cunning. the way the two communicate on screen is nothing short of spectacular.the way the story develops, and the level of detail that the script offers makes the whole story extremely believable, and also very true to life i would imagine. it is of such magnitude that you're left with the feeling of being insecure, not knowing what might happen next in real life. we read about terror every day, and here we are given a good sneak peak into an underworld which most of us know very little about.it's a series that will for sure have you coming back for more, sitting there at the edge of your seat just waiting for next weeks episode to come on. it's a sure winner in my eyes, and i have no problems stating that this series is on my list of all time best.

a real sudsy soap opera here as spencer tracy tackles the role of an illiterate until the age of 20. he marries the woman who teaches him and her ambition and his drive leads him to success.success but no happiness here. a n'eer-do-well son and a faltering marriage leads to disaster and tragedy. tracy buys a railroad and succeeds only to be subjected to a disastrous rail strike and the death of 406 workers.the film appeared at the beginning to be uneven but is rejuvenated thanks to the excellent use of flashbacks here.a double separate suicide here. we know that riches can't buy happiness but this is a little too far fetched. nonetheless, we have riveting performances by tracy and colleen moore. ms. vinson, as the 2nd wife, is also quite effective.

despite later claims, this early-talkie melodrama has very little in common with "citizen kane": it's a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat, told in flashback but hopping around time. the scriptwriter, preston sturges, shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog, and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of "kane" are evident. still, it's very watchable, with a young spencer tracy (his old-man makeup makes him look just like, well, an old spencer tracy) showing depth and authority, and colleen moore -- a little past her prime, and not physically well matched -- playing a multifaceted woman-behind-the-man. there's also helen vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history, sending the final third into ecstatic soap-opera reverberations. the surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets, and there are some plot holes left open (how would she know whose son it was if she's sleeping with both of them?), and the music is awfully hokey. for all that, i was quite fascinated.

a precursor to "citizen kane" in its analysis of the life of a just deceased tycoon, here reviewed by his faithful secretary in a series of interlocking flashbacks. in spencer tracy's 15th film he already looks middle-aged even in the scenes where he is meant to be young!a little silent-screen type emoting is understandable given the vintage but this is a most enjoyable, well-written drama.

preston sturgis' the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kael's the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz - orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis' screenplay here. as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site, kael overstated her case.there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane: the newsreel (representing ralston - the henry luce clone), thatcher's memoirs, bernstein, jed leland, susan alexander kane, and raymond the butler. each has his or her different slant on kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane's story. this method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.this is not the situation in the power and the glory. yes, like kane it is about a legendary business leader - here it is tom garner (spencer tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. but there are only two narrators - they are garner's right hand man henry (ralph morgan) and his wife (sarah padden). this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner. henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in henry.typical example: although he worked his way up, tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. henry describes tom's confrontation with the union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. but henry's wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the union's headquarters - killing many people). so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.i'm not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane's success (few films do - including all of orson welles' other films), but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.when they marry, tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. but in america great business success comes at a cost. tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). but it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with sally. and he also notices eve (helen vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.similarly tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry). eve marries tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be eve's son by tom's son tom jr. (philip trent). the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself.the film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. so on the whole it is a first rate film. no citizen kane perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america.

the story of tom garner opens with his grand funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks narrated by his faithful lifetime friend henry. henry and his wife debate whether tom was a great man and a genius or an utterly worthless scoundrel. the film is beautifully written, acted and directed, and i highly recommend it.tom was the fabulously rich and successful owner of a large railroad, dominating his board of directors and his competition, terrorizing his employees, slaughtering strikers. tom's ambitious wife sally was responsible for all of tom's success. when he met her, he was illiterate and entirely content with his work as a trackwalker for the railroad. sally teaches him to read and takes over his trackwalker job while tom goes to school. he starts to rise one step at a time through the railroad hierarchy until he eventually takes over as president.but as tom becomes a business tycoon, his marriage to sally gradually falls to pieces. his spoiled son despises him, and he takes up with a much younger woman (the aptly named eve), with predictably catastrophic consequences. in his business life, tom is a total success; in his personal life, a disastrous failure. much like the hearst figure in "citizen kane," tom symbolizes the best and the worst of the capitalist system.spencer tracy is terrific in the role of tom garner and the business scenes ring with authenticity. colleen moore is also excellent as sally; both of them age beautifully in the multi-generational story. the film was written by preston sturges, but is nothing like the screwball comedies for which sturges became famous.

blademaster is definitely a memorable entry in the swords and sorcery category of movies. i found blademaster along with quest for the mighty sword at a thrift shop attended by mentally handicapped people and was very happy to pay 2.00 each for them. believable sets and costumes, good sword fighting and a beautiful female warrior, mila make this an enjoyable watch. a few problems though, there were a lot of details in the plot that didn't quite fit, like the cave men for one. i didn't understand their purpose. also, this movie could have really benefited from some more monsters. the snake was cool, but i guess it does borrow a little from conan. however, any primitive sort of movie where someone winds up with a hanglider is ok by me (see yor and battle for endor). i think ator is cool! oh, and was anyone else reminded of gallager by the villain or is it just me? i give blademaster a 7/10

the ator series is a shining example of what b-movies should be. they fail in every aspect, but in such a hilarious way that they are funny rather than sad. "ator l'invincibile 2" aka "the blade master" aka "cave dwellers" shows us europe's favorite conan clone, ator where we left him in the first movie- after showing us a lengthy recap of all the events of the first film. this time the world must be saved from "the nucleus", a kind of bomb, represented on screen as a bright light (i guess they couldn't afford a prop). this one features invisible attackers and samurai. as with the first film, lots of stock footage is used (including one rather obvious bit from "star wars"). thoroughly laughable and unforgettably bad- this is an exception b-movie.

this film, blade master, may be cheap, clumsy in appearance and it is sometimes, but it shares thoughts on problems that are way beyond the era this film is set in. ator is the chosen one that has to protect the earth against a terrible weapon, that is compared in an unforgettable and unpredictable way to the atomic weapon. he goes through obstacles as a witful character who is just more than muscle power, although he has quite is lot. i would say this aspect of the movie makes it surpass a film like conan the barbarian, which is the least i can say, quite brainless. it doesn't diminish in any ways the great adventure movie that is conan, but it gives ator his wholesomeness that he shares not with the barbarian. for a lower budget movie, this film does good in terms of setting and the fights are most of the time believable. zor, the villain, has with is prisoner throughout the film one of the most interesting psychological confrontation that gives tension to the movie, even if ator seems way too fit for the task to loose. what gives this movie that little extra are those scenes that may look quirky, but worth of mention. the fight with the serpent god, even though he is a gigantic puppet, is well handled as the snake, with good lightnings, remains a silhouette and the fight is quite convincing. the movie climaxes in a most unusual way, quite anachronic, but breathtaking : the deltaplane sequence. the scene itself is not introduced properly, read not at all, where did ator get that machine, it's pretty unconvincing, but it leads to a really poetic and beautiful midair sequence, that standalone, is the culminating point in the movie, elevating ator in a place where few human fantasy heroes have been. if blade master is not among the great fantastic movies of all time is no surprise due to its lacks, it's a bigger surprise, considering the philosophical way it chooses on the confrontation between good and evil, the truth it speaks and the heart it shows, that this movie is so unwlecomed. i suggest it for every fan of the genre and try take it seriously as an intelligent movie that's to be taken more seriously than it seems.

this film must have been quietly released on some other side of the world, perhaps even in english. hopefully nobody understood a word, not there's anything to understand in this movie anyways! haahaa! call me a nut, but i think this is one of the best movies ever. why would i come to that conclusion?? because it's my national pasttime to sabotage horrible films and this one begs for it every other minute! once i became a fan of myster science theater 3000, i had no doubt in my mind they'd find it somewhere and use it. sure enough! the version they acquired was entitled "cave dwellers" using some strange intro footage not even from the film itself (apparently, they were ashamed to use footage from their own film!). i can't say i recommend buying this film. rather, i highly recommend getting the mst3k version. sure to find it most anywhere mst3k dvd's are sold, don't miss out!

expectacular the ator's second part!! directed rapidly by joe d'amato, specialist in all kinds of subkinds(subgenres) of exploitation, and interpreted again by miles o'keeffe. the budget of the movie debio to be derisory or minimal. in spite of not being a better movie of his antecesora not mas entertained, ator 2 either, it has something, something that makes it enterteining. his introduction you prop it explains ator's origin to us with images of the first part. the script is incredible, is like any comic-book of the brilliant roy thomas. has so fantastic elements inside dle world of the sword and such fantasy as invisible men, black gentlemen, cannibals - monkeys ... the role of the villain this one interpreted brilliant. the final this struggle very well. lacking mas violence and blood, but this one well. never it becomes boring. it has everything what there was lacking ator 1. be charmed with to my me!! 4/5

when the italians and miles o'keeffe work together nothing can go wrong! as ever, miles is great as the almost as great ator; the most lovable barbarian of all times. totally lives up to the first movie.

miles o'keeffe once again assumes the role of the mighty ator in this the first sequel to the original film.what can i say? - this pretty much represents b-movie nirvana! the plot is ludicrous, the script is terrible, the acting is hammy throughout, the special effects....well let's not even go there! - all in all this movie is a veritable delight! highlights of the film include ator and thong (his mute companion, not his undergarments) being attacked by invisible assailants in a cave (certainly saved on the fx budget there!), ator battling what has to be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid, and of course, the infamous hangliding scene! there's one question i have though......at the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when ator supposedly destroys the geometric nucleus (as the narrator tells us)......how in the hell did ator destroy it and manage get out alive?! did he fashion some form of primitive timer/detonator or something? oh well, such an illogical ending really only adds to the movies overall charm - they just don't make them like this anymore!

the jazz singer is one of a number of films made in the late 1940's and 1950 about the jewish experience in the united states. other than crossfire(1947) and gentleman's agreement(1947) which dealt with anti-semitism they usually had a musical-theatre background. these films included the jolson story(1946), jolson sings again(1949), the eddy duchin story(1951), the eddie cantor story(1953),the benny goodman story(1956) and margorie morningstar(1958). the leading actors in these "jewish" films were always played by non-jews. for example larry parks a non-jew played al jolson and gene kelly played noel airman in marjorie morningstar. this casting was probably done to make the jewish theme palpable to a mainly non-jewish audience. the jazz singer(1952) is no different. danny thomas was a devout catholic and peggy lee was certainly not jewish although she plays a non-practicing jewess in the film. the clue to her background is when she attends the golding's family meal before entering she says "i haven't been to a sader (passover service) since i left home".the film is about a cantor's son who has just left the service after seeing action in korea. his dilemma is whether to become a cantor, a family tradition or to be a singer in musical theatre. his choice of theatre leads to an inevitable conflict with his father.however, there is much more to this film than this. this film was made after the rosenberg trial during the mccarthy whitchhunts and the hollywood blacklist. therefore in this film the jews are shown as good loyal citizens andare quintessentialy american. the synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice. the cantors friends also talk about baseball in fact one of them is a major league umpire. the synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and george washington is said to have visited. therefore jews are presented as part and parcel of american society. nobody in this film has a eastern european accent. peggy lee appeared in very few feature films. in this film you get to see her sing "lover" and "just one of those things" wonderful. danny thomas is quite credible and he acts and sings the part very well. the comedic routines could have been left out. yes, the film is schmaltzy and sentimental but it is well worth seeing. i enjoyed it very much.

to be frank, this is probably the best version in my book as a sound movie version of the jazz singer. the 1927 version is really a silent movie despite its build-up as the first talkie.danny thomas is a great comedian, and he sings very well. he does the jewish stuff with feeling. peggy lee is great and any film that has her is always entertaining. allan joslyn is not too entertaining and we could have done without him. one question: since when do cantors live in such luxurious houses???

by 1952 hollywood decided to remake the al jolson first-talking classic.this time the cantor's son was played by danny thomas. coming home from the army, it is expected that he follow in the footsteps of his father and other male relatives by becoming a cantor. however, young mr. golding has quite a zest for show business.at this time, he meets peggy lee, an aspiring singer. she acts very well and her rendition of her favorite song, lover, is remarkable. the film writers were smart not to plug the obvious jewish guy and non-jewish girlfriend relationship. if anything, this is glossed over. in his anger, for betraying his pledge to become a cantor, his father makes the traditional jewish sign indicative of a loss in the family. this would not be done under circumstances of breaking a pledge, it would be done if among the orthodox, an inter-faith marriage would take place.thomas does a really good job of playing the cantor's son. his singing is up to par as the film ends on a positive note.am surprised that technical advisers did not realize that women do not carry pocketbooks into synagogue on the sabbath or at all during that period.

this is like something i have never seen before. it had me cracking up the whole time i don't think there was one scene that i didn't laugh through. it is about a girl from the country in south who goes off to a big town for college. at the school she befriends the ra across the hall. when she realizes that he has no family to go to for thanksgiving she invites him to come home with her. rabecca and her family and her serious boyfriend all go out to dinner one night and becca realizes what her boyfriend is about to do...propose. she urges cral to do something so he stands up and shouts something like... sorry mate but you are too late i already asked becca to marry me a couple of weeks ago back at the school and she said yes. that all turns into chaos. please watch this classic it is totally worth it... i swear.

the cast was well picked. pauly shore is hilarious and does a good job of bringing the plot of the movie together. however, tiffani amber thiessan is who really makes this movie special. her talented acting combined with her great looks makes this movie a definite see.

this movie is extremely funny and it also contains the best looking girl, this young man has ever seen. tiffani-amber thiessan is a great actress and she has the looks that stop traffic. tiffani completes this movie, which contains funny scenes put on by shore.

this movie was great and funny. pauly is funny. the best looking girl is all the way tiffani, she is totally hot in this film and she proves she can act with this film. this movie is a must see comedy.... and its not all about tiffani, its a great movie in general but tiffani adds the zest to this film, cause she does her scenes very well and she is all the way sexy........

i was cast as the surfer dude in the beach scenes. almost got cast as the muscle guy, since the real muscle guy was really really late that day. pauly had my brother and i (the skateboarder in front of the tattoo place) do some vj stuff in between takes live from venice since he was still doing his mtv thing. this movie is really good as well. would it have made my top 100 if i wasn't in it........?

i think this is pauly shore's best stuff, he played the part perfect. i really enjoyed this movie, patrick renna is really funny as zack the annoying little brother. son in law is a good comedy worth your time, but the only thing i wish tiffany thiessen was the farm chick instead of the one they had.

when i first saw that this movie was going to be playing on tv, i only new of pauly shore as this joke of a comedian who wore really weird outfits back in the day. i still decided to watch it and i was impressed. shore brings a fresh breath of air to the screen. in this movie, he plays crawl a college adviser that probably needs his own adviser as well. carla gugino, in an underrated role, plays becca, a midwestern "farm girl" with a simple family and a movie-clich√© boyfriend travis. when she heads off to ucla, she meets crawl and he quickly turns her into a bubbly, blonde californian girl. she decides to bring crawl home for the thanksgiving break. when travis decides to propose, becca needs a distraction. crawl then decides to make everyone believe that him and becca are engaged already. this leads to crawl spicing up the romance between becca's parents, befriending her brother, and even getting the dancers at the local bar to get a little loose. i'm not going to reveal the end, but i liked it. anyway, don't rent it if you want a poignant performance; rent it if you want to laugh your butt of and enjoy an often-missed part of 90's humor.

this was such a funny movie, which was soon forgotten about, probably because there are so many teen and young adult comedies, such as this. the movie is not quit as predictable as one would think. crawl is an unattractive, but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend. still, an unlikely match for rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend back home. when he helps feel more at ease at school, by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more, they become buddies, but it is completely platonic. when she realizes her boyfriend might propose, she does not feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to be enjoying her free laid back party life at college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility. you kind of learn what a good friend crawl is when he tells her he will help get her out of getting married. when her boyfriend proposes to her, in front of the whole family, she kicks crawl and puts him on the spot. he tells the whole family that he proposes to her, and gives her his diamond ring, which it tunrs out was his the whole time (he must have come from money or something. well they never really show a close up of the ring). the message of the movie seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and not to judge people before you get to know him. rebecca's boyfriend, who her parents love, turned mean when we find out he druged his new girlfriend after rebecca,(amber thesan) and crawl, so that rebecca would have broken up with crawl, thinking they were a couple. although they were not, rebecca was mad at him, which when you think about it, was kind of unfair, since they were not a couple, but i think they were starting to like one another. and i think she thought there was more. the movie never showed them actually become a couple, they left it open for the viewers to decide. they never even actually kissed at any point, although there was one part where they almost did. that was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand. many people saw it and said, that he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock, but they were just friends the whole time, even towards the end. and she did not introduce him as her boyfriend; still they never told her parents they were not engaged. rebecca almost did. even if he would never become her boyfriend, they could have still been friends. in the 90s for some reason femanin men were in, and there was this big stereo type that woman liked femanin men (not that there is anything wrong with that), think it came from the fact that women like the kind sensitive type, which crawl proved to be, through his friendship with rebecca. but when i saw the movie, i must admit, if i went for looks, i thought i would have gone for the first boyfriend. still it was a creative movie, that tried to teach a lesson on friendship and judging others.

i've sat through several pauly shore movies, but this is the only one that i've liked. of course, it helps that he is far less irritating than usual, perhaps even a little likeable. the rest of the cast does a fine job, especially underrated carla gugino. the film itself is basically a harmless and silly comedy, and although few of the jokes are especially funny, the film is quite entertaining overall.

if you like pauly shore, you'll love son in law. if you hate pauly shore, then, well...i liked it!

this is the only pauly shore movie you should ever see. o.k., it's the only one i've ever seen, and i think i've made good choices. i normally find shore's shtick kind of tired, but he is very funny in this movie. actually, the script is pretty funny, and shore doesn't overwhelm the other actors with his ... what do you call it? tomfoolery? anyway, this is a funny, if ultimately forgettable film. --frink-3

"miss cast away" is an amusing trifle, which dispenses with serious plot or character development to pack in as many gags as possible. best enjoyed with a large audience that is open to such entertainments and perhaps, has had a few drinks. most of the jokes are current-event based so in future years this film may become a time-capsule of turn-of-the-21st-century pop culture references.the 30i to 24p conversion of the footage does create a jerky appearance in some parts, most noticeably the opening aerial shots.the appearance of micheal jackson is indeed a strange non-sequiter event. but i, for one, find it encouraging that mr. jackson has shown a helpful interest in one of his prot√©g√©s even after he (the director) has passed from the cute-preteen-boy stage.the effects work is not as bad as one review suggested. most of it was done by a one-man crew in a brief span of time consisting of animator william sutton, whose name seems to have been omitted from the imdb credits. his work is an extraordinary achievement and really helps to fill in the gaps in this movie. i hope he's finally been paid!

i love this movie, one of my all time favorites. ann blythe as sally o'moyne is sweet and trouble-free. she believes that praying to saint anne will solve all her and her friends troubles. the sub-plot of the dastardly bad man to get her father's property is funny and clever. her brothers are what kind of brothers any girl would love to have. also, look for "aunt bee" as her mother, a strong irish woman who won't leave her house that she brought her family up in. they don't make them like this anymore, that's for sure.

sally and saint anne is a very funny movie. the first time my mom told me about it i was 7 and saint anne had just been the saint i had for my communion saint. my mom knew this, so she told me to watch this with her. i did, and have seen it many times since because it is really funny. aunt bea from the andy griffith show was in it and sally's grandfather was the guy who played santa claus in miracle on 34th street. so, there were lots of actors we seen on tv shows too. there is a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house away, and sally keeps trying things with st. anne to help raise money so they can keep the house. that includes a boxing match with hugh o'brian who plays her older brother. this is a good and funny movie that i still love.

this film came as a gift - a late-night offering out of the blue - so unlike other reviewers i had no preconceptions whatsoever. i found myself glued to my seat as the film slowly dictated its own rhythm, its own unfolding. i was drawn to acknowledge my own deep love and humanity as i willed for "good" to prevail - but also forced to wryly acknowledge that sometimes i was on the side of the "bad" guys. the film is quite quite beautiful - the word "elegiac" comes to mind, and this more than because the film begins and ends in an elegy. far from being depressing or confronting, to me, the film acknowledges deep suffering - and then, by its cyclic nature - with the births and re-births as well as the deaths - the film celebrates the fact that to quote an aussie poet, there is "sometimes gladness." oh gods, i feel as tho i've just written a love letter to this film - but there it is. hola!

i was very lucky to see this film as part of the melbourne international film festival 2005 only a few days ago. i must admit that i am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life. i also love the majority of scandinavian cinematic offerings, there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn. character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth. this is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community. the audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive. i am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and i am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness.

so far miguel bardem's career it's been one of the more dreadful of recent spanish cinema. he's made nothing but rubbish... until now. "incautos" has been quite a surprise: it's a serious film, with rhythm, with a great cast and very entertaining.the art of robbing, that's what "incautos" is about. a film much alike to david mamet's "house of game" and stuff like that. a thousand of twists in the script, and a story where nothing's like it seems.the weak points in latest bardem's movie may be the so-american language, that makes some of the characters look rather unnatural (especially victoria abril's. she's a hell of an actress, but in "incautos" she looks a little bit forced). ernesto alterio is not that bad, but he's not half as good actor as his father... and what to say about luppi?? well, he's the man.in short: a good movie. the best that miguel bardem has ever made. i hope this is the beginning of a brand new stage in his career.*my rate: 7/10

ernesto is a man that makes a living out of duping other solid citizens of their hard earned money. together with manco, an older man with a lot of experience, he pulls out capers that allow him to make a decent living, but that is not making him a rich man by any means. enter federico, an older man who is more experience in the art of deception. together with the younger ernesto they prove a winning combination. that only lasts until pilar, federico's former love interest, appears in the picture.this spanish film directed by miguel bardem, is light in tone and pleasant to sit through. other, better made caper films have been made with much clever plots than this one, but the film is easy to take, and at times, it has a lot of funny situations.this viewer will see federico luppi in anything, even reading the telephone directory! he is an actor's actor. we have had the privilege of having seen him in the buenos aires stage doing excellent work before his international film career. as federico, he does what he does best. it's impossible to imagine anyone better in his role. ernesto alterio, the son of hector alterio, is a young actor who promises to have a great career. victoria abril makes pilar fun as she gets involved with these con men. miguel alexandre, a veteran actor, is also good as manco.

shame is rather unique as a war film (or rather quite the anti-war film) in that it not only doesn't focus on the soldiers or politics involved (there is politics but not how you'd think it'd be shown), it deals with its two main subjects as the only two beings that can possibly be cared about at all in this brutal, decaying society they inhabit. ingmar bergman, in the midst of his prime, and following two other heavily psychological films, persona and hour of the wolf, is far more interested in seeing what the effect of war has on usually civilized beings, that it brings out the worst in them, and also in a cathartic way is a reminder of what is truly crucial in living. his two key actors are frequent collaborators and friends max von sydow and liv ullman (as the rosenbergs oddly enough), who are musicians living on a farm on an island (not too dissimilar from 'wolf' when one thinks about it).they see the tanks roll by, and a couple of old friends already getting worn down, but they try not to put it too much to heart; there's a sweet scene where the couple just talk, rather frankly but with heart (all one shot, as is repeated through the film is to perhaps create a sense of being provoked)...then comes the trouble, including a fake film of propaganda made at gunpoint with the rosenbergs, the psychological turmoil in being prisoners of war, and the terror involved with a 'friend' in the military (one of gunnar bjornstrand's most subtle works with bergman). needless to say this is not one of the easier films to go through in terms of bergman's filmography, however for some it may be one of his more accessible works. his religious themes this time is kept very low key, even as the idea of keeping a sort of faith pervades the film's atmosphere. when there is war action it's shot in unconventional, quick ways (via great amigo sven nykvist).and the deconstruction of the relationship between jan and eva is corresponded successfully with the backdrop of a chaotic kind of war-ground where the lines are never too surely drawn. in a way this film, shot right at the height of the worst times in vietnam, is even more relevant for today; i couldn't help but see chilling, uncompromising coincidences between iraq and elsewhere with some of jan and eva's scenes with the fighters, or those 'in charge'. the very last scene, by the way, is one of bergman's very best, all around (acting, directing, lighting). it's not the kind of war picture (or, again, anti-war, i find little of the john wayne spirit in this svensk production) that i would recommend right off the bat to my friends all into saving private ryan- it has a little more in kinship with paths of glory, looking at the effects of the hypocrisy of war. but in reality, like any of bergman's "genre" films, it stands alone, however one that packs a wallop for the art-house crowd.

a gruelling watch, but one of bergman's finest films. interesting to compare this with the hour of the wolf, as both feature the same lead actors as artists (or an artist and his wife) who have taken sanctuary on an island. in the earlier film it's largely inner demons that lead to von sydows disintegrating personality (at least that's how i read it) whereas here it's very much circumstances beyond his control.much has been written about the unsympathetic central characters, particularly von sydow's. for me there are flashes of a good (if flawed) man early in the film, but one who copes badly with adversity. the flaws become all that is left as his humanity is gradually eroded by one horror after another.i watched a passion (ullmann and von sydow on their island again) soon after this, and was amazed to recognise many of the same locations. and then there's a dream sequence...

first of all the story is not so simple as many earlier reviewers tend to emphasize, it is actually a very complex story, unlike bergman's other movies that are more bend towards character study. in skammen we have two main characters but as we are thrown from the start in the middle of a war we have no idea who is fighting and why, everything is open for any resolution. this creates a huge tension and makes every event meaningful. as the story unfolds we are introduced to numerous characters, that are turned into symbols of humanity, both its dark and luminous sides. we have the example of the innocent bystanders who try to get by during an absurd war, the cynical doctor who makes fun of his patients and provides the only bitter humor of the whole movie, the perverse opportunists who try to make the best of an atrocious event (bjornstrand's character), the innocent dead children, the nameless figures almost turned into animals from the boat etc. all of them are somehow seen through the eyes of jan (von sydow) and eva (ulmann), their characters are more restrained then in other begrman films (en passion) and this is exactly because what is important here is the story, the way exterior events have the capacity to radically change human nature.bergman made this film two years after persona where the main conclusion expressed by the only word uttered by liv ulmann's character is ingenting, nothing. that's it: the meaning of art and the meaning of life, the latter being nothing more than a play that includes all plays. but what about war? and especially the annihilating ones of the xx'th century. in persona, the only real emotion suffered by ulmann's character is when she sees a victim of the vietnam war turned into a human torch. in skammen that idea is extended to a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war. in a nameless region of a nameless country (we only assume it's sweeden) two factions speaking the same language fight an absurd war. jan and eva are two dreamers caught in the middle but their dreams are woven in a sort of counterpoint. jan is at first an idealist, unable to react properly to the world and a subject to his wife's will. towards the end he turns into a radically different personality, capable of unmotivated murder, strong-willed, pitiless (watch carefully the suicidal on the boat..the simplicity of the act is harrowing). on the other hand eva progressively looses touch with reality and at the end she is completely suffused in her own unfulfilled dream.from a technical point of view the whole movie delivers its message in a very effective way. bergman places the viewer alongside the character, putting the camera in the car with the actors, or in an extreme close-up behind the actor. nykvist manages an extraordinary control of the camera, there are some masterful "hand-held" effects, very good in making everything seem "real". the shots when the characters are captured by the army look remarkably documentary-like. the screenplay is minimalist but the story is quite complex for that matter. actually the whole movie is paradoxical, it has an intensity in the subject that is in a sharp contrast to the coldness and lack of emotional involvement with which it is directed and filmed. nothing is melodramatic here, there is no compassion, no hope and no apparent redemption. but, as in liv ulmann's dream at the end it is all so beautiful one cannot help but being amazed at it...it was not so awful since it was so beautiful!

good lord... how this ended up in our dvd player i'll never know...my wife thought it was a new release she'd missed somehow...nevermind it's a couple of years old and in danish ( i think)... she kept looking for the english soundtrack...all in all...the film wasn't bad... good production values,better performances, and a clever story that doesn't get too far away from itself make for tidy, dark-humored fare from across the sea! the ending will make you chuckle...in fact, the whole film will. incredibly strange characters that we grow genuinely interested in make a film that might be worth your while...without spoiling the plot, the film's title and dvd jacket give you a good idea where this thing is going!

i first saw this as a kid (the little rascals first went on tv the year i was born) and fairly recently bought this on dvd. in between, i watched it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes at 1) the pie fight itself and 2) how racist some of these parts were: farina as a nubian slave, doing voodoo, for example. i think roach and mcgowan would have been beaten to death if they'd tried to do that now.notice how the pie fights in the three stooges' halfwits' holiday and in the sweet pie and pie resemble this one...and this film came out a few years before their initial contract with harry cohn at columbia pictures. there was obviously some inspiration from ss and laurel & hardy's the battle of the century for these films...remember, at that time, they all stole from the best, each other!!! one more note: laurel & hardy buffs, that bake sale lady was none other than dorothy coburn, who also appeared in tbotc-the 'flapper' getting into her car and getting it in the rear end. it always escapes me why she was never credited?

although this film looks like a crime thriller noir, the plot is actually a bit simplistic and with very few surprise twists or turns at all - and those that do appear, are not exactly shockers.however, if you slip out of 'intense action thriller' mode and into 'mindless entertainment,' then this is really quite a fun movie, with several hilarious moments. most of these can be attributed to the witty dialogue between alan rickman and emma thompson's characters - but that said, sadie said it all in her hilarious opening greeting to friedman, and it left very little else for anything else to develop between these two characters. i didn't find these esteemed british actors version of the southern accents that bad (ok, thompson sounded like she was rolling marbles in her mouth as she tried to spoke southern, but rickman was surprisingly rather good with very few minor lapses into his customary english accent) - if you want to critique accents - lets discuss that of coco - she only spoke southern periodically!

this is one gripping movie, reminiscent of the mgm crime movies of the late 70's. excellent cast, crisp editing and good acting keeps the pace of the movie developing rapidly,. one of the better crime movies of the decade. kudos to the director & cast.

this was the first directing job by sebastian gutierrez, the writer of snakes on a plane and gothika. anyone who has read my reviews knows that i love capers, and this was a doozy. a kidnapping and a woman shot in the process. the fbi has emma thompson on the kidnapping case and the police chief (roscoe lee browne) assigns alan rickman to solve the murder, which happens to be a senator's (hal holbrook) wife. these two make an outstanding pair as they work together.the kidnappers/murderers have lovers simon baker (land of the dead) and the ultra hot carla gugino (sin city), along with a couple of partners. they kidnapped a hotshot computer mogul and they run his accountant all over town before they get the dough. things go fast from there as new twists and turns are brought in. the whole thing is brilliant and definitely a "piss in your pants because you can't go to the bathroom or you'll miss something" thrill.now, to be completely honest, i would have given this movie a 10 if there had been more of the movie the security guard was watching in the opening. i would have loved to see more of beverly hotsprings and yvette lera, but, hey, that wasn't part of the caper; just icing on the cake.thompson and rickman should definitely make more movies together. one treat:agent hawkins: so fill me in. detective friedman: that remark could be misconstrued as sexual harassment, agent hawkins. agent hawkins: let's get it out of the way then: you've never worked under a female superior before. i got to where i am by pushing paper and playing nice - i've never actually fired a gun before, i'm only in this job to prove to my father i'm not a coward. i give decent head, so i got promoted before all the worthy candidates, all of them men, all of them equally gifted at fellatio but there was a gender quota to fill. i'm also stupid and idealistic; you are hard and cynical, and usually right. i am secretly in love with you but i have a hard time showing it. did i skip anything?damn, that's great dialog! gutierrez not only directs a great movie, but he can write too!and, did i say carla gugino was hot?put this on your list.

"shivering shakespeare" could be considered the first classic of the "our gang" talkie era. by now, hal roach studios began to hit their stride in making talking pictures, and "shakespeare" is the happy result.the gang is appearing in a version of quo vadis produced by kennedy the cop's wife. the kids don't find the play very fun to be in and are distracted by people in the theatre and cannot remember their lines. among the funniest bits are kennedy the cop as the giant, who pulls off his makeup to fight an overzealous man in a bull costume; and the terrible dancing girl (played by director bob mcgowan's daughter.)several filmographies mention that "shakespeare" has the first pie fight in a talkie. this may be true, seeing as they tried different speeds with the film during the fight. buster keaton's brother harry is at the receiving end of one of the pies. very funny and an early gang talkie classic. 9 out of 10.

in the dvd era, you would think you could find pretty much any piece of crap committed to celluloid and for the most part, it's true. so why, why is it so hard to find this great little flick, clearly done by people who love noir as a loving homage (buit never descending into spoof land) of that most cinematic of genres. emma thompson and alan rickman are a hoot in this and superstar-in-the-making carla gugino (karen sisco, sin city) does her now trademark red hot babe/great acting routine. this movie really has it all for fans of film. a b noir on steroids, the clever and steamy judas kiss succeeds on every count.please columbia tristar please release it on dvd soon!!!!!!

emma thompson, alan rickman,carla gugino and gil bellows are a delight in this sexy caper. this film is smart, edge of your seat entertainment for adults, and what a relief that is in these days of big concept predictable cartoons. great music and camera work add to the fun that is this new orleans-set puzzle. highly recommended. ten stars!

came across this film recently after so long hearing about it. it is an excellent not pretentious movie for people who loves film noir literature and films. not "camp" but humorous. great cast! from the magnificent carla gugino and emma thompson to german superstar til schweiger, this movie is a feast for the eyes. alan rickman is very funny as the antagonist of gang. would love to see spin off movie with this character and emma thompson solving cases and arguments between them all the time (much like tracy and hepburn, etc.)intelligent story, nice twists and scope photography (don't watch unless it is scope because compositions are very rich).sexy sexy sexy and very fun time.best use of just like heaven by the cure ever (must see to believe!)********

the efforts of a new group of young talent bolstered by alan rickman and emma thompson, 2 extremely gifted actors, makes for a thrilling and engrossing evening of entertainment. and i might add that hal holbrook shines as the senator. this movie deserves five stars. i give it a ten on your scale. and the ending is perfect. i am constantly amazed at the ability of british actors to master our american accents. i was convinced that all the actors were born in louisiana. and what finer locale for a mystery than new orleans! the big easy, also known as the crescent city, permeates every scene. as writer and director, sebastian gutierrez deserves high praise.

sure, there's stuff here that the coens and elmore leonard have done before, but so what? if you want entertaining, lusty and smart -- "judas kiss" is near perfect. prudes offended by tongue in cheek porn don't get it (talk about getting your sex and violence out of the way straight up -- keeps your investors happy. that's independent filmmaking 101). as for the brits making a bundle, i highly doubt it. this flick is clearly a labor of love and the budget probably not half of mr. tarantino's salary. maybe guys don't like it as much as women. i thought it rocked. go coco!

what's the matter with you people? john dahl? from "rounders" and "unforgettable"? too quirky? knocking emma thompson and alan rickman for having fun playing against type? and somebody liked the gingerbread man?i rented this not knowing anything about it and found it about as nifty a video find as you can get. never insulting, well thought out, funny, scary. i disagree with the naysayers, clearly. i thought the story itself was unremarkable but the great cast, which most likely means the director was paying attention, lifted it to super cool status. good sound design also (much more appreciated in surround, but i'm not bragging). and yes, i'm a girl, so maybe it has a slight female slant (the guys in the gang are pretty worthwhile). all in all, a 9 and a hearty recommend.

loved this movie!! great acting by carla gugino. interesting story about a kidnapping that goes horribly wrong (don't they all?). some surprising twists and turns in the film and the plot was easy to follow without being so convoluted as to be totally incomprehensible. it was a totally unexpected delight. more "quentin-ish" than most films try to be.

i found the movie judas kiss excellent. carla gugino's performance was extraordinaire, probably her best in her career. her facial expressions in many scenes, were unbelievably true to character, and they were exploited to its best by director gutierrez. all actors and actresses were very good in their performances. emma thompsom was, as usual, marvelous. her acting capabilities are way above what would be required for this character, so she actually enhances it in the movie.the story, although sometimes over-intricate, is kept entertaining and pointed towards the end. very, very good. a movie not to be missed. a story well weaved and brilliantly directed. quality of film, excellent.

thirty pieces of silver and a kiss for luck. this one was another totally unexpected gem. usually, i'm not even a suspense/thriller fan. this satisfying 100 minutes has more twists than a boardwalk pretzel. it has titillating erotic romance, reminiscent of "body heat" in more ways than one; it has cops and crime; political intrigue and just a dash of daytime soap. it has just the right touch of gritty violence that any professional "by-the-numbers" crime job must employ. emma thompson, (fbi aic), delivers her role with grace and humor and gets my vote for best fake southern accent by a limey. alan rickman, (local cop), who always seems to steal the show, is excellent but not overbearing. they work well as a pair. lots of plot misdirection that never gets out of control and gets coherently reconnected at film's end. and who is this awesome woman, carla gugino? i want her to bear my children. carla, if you're out there, let's do lunch

and it got it in france ! why not in the rest of the world while the studios keep churning out expensive post-grisham trash (will anyone remember him as a fine writer, and not the most betrayed-by-the-screen author this side of stephen king ?) this one has it all. okay, the situations are not always original, has minor plot holes and it has a tendency to be too clever some (brief) times for its own sake, but it actually delivers and is obviously a work of love. i'd be curious to know what the budget was. and. for once, this is not a cheap tarantino copy ! (well, film noir didn't started with tarantino, you know.) will it once again be saved by europe, like john dahl's movies were, so mr guttierez can make another one like this ? if you ever read this, mr guttierez, thank you and se

i swear if i did ever tried cocaine i'd be able to relate to this film perfectly. its pace, as well as the dialog, churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads.there are great little elements that pop up through out the film, like how rob lowe's character seems to always be loosing a shoe, or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path. the story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless.the movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness. this is one i think most could enjoy. a few laugh-out-loud-even-if-you-are-alone moments ensure that i'll certainly be watching this again.

carla gugino literally melts the screen in this crime caper. her sex appeal, ample assets and sexy southern accent more than make this film rewatchable. but the film has so many "other" things to make it almost a modern classic. simon baker's performance for one thing. truly that of a great actor. til schweiger is so perfectly cast it makes me wonder why he's not a huge "crossover" star. gil bellows rounds out this motely crew and literally steals this show. other gugino's cleavage easily the best performance in the movie. emma thompson and alan rickman are so utterly brilliant...i cannot even describe it. great chemistry.the music is so powerfully eclectic that it was a character in and of itself. wonderous to behold.people may say it's tarantino influenced...i disagree. it's clearly unique and clever in it's own right. sebastian gutierrez does a wonderful job at directing this tightly woven film and underplaying a lot of scenes that left me reeling. the ending is perfectly sinister and you never see it coming. all in all a lovely film that, to me, is the very definition of what a good movie should be.

more of a near miss than a flop, mr. imperium stars ezio pinza as alex, heir apparent to and later king of a small european nation, who falls in love with a willing american actress and entertainer, fredda barlo (lana turner), but due to machinations by the sly prime minister of alex as king, nicely played by cedric hardwicke, the lovers are separated for 12 years before being reunited in palm springs where their love is rekindled. director don hartman, who also scripts, is not able to fully utilize his talent for snappy dialogue because of pinza's tentative english usage, and the requisite rewriting, coupled with less than total rapport in evidence between the two stars, results in a somewhat raggedy tone to the screenplay, exacerbated by the studio's unkind cutting of many scenes, leading to a confusing ending. the overpowering pinza dominates his scenes with turner, but both performers score with good work, while marjorie main is impressive with her patter effects as written, with debbie reynolds placed on track by louis b. mayer for singin' in the rain as a result of her sprightly performance here; only barry sullivan is heavily victimized by the flagrant cutting. prettily filmed largely in pebble beach, california, and other monterey county environs, the film is endowed with pinza's iron strong operatic basso in solamente una vez, as well as with original songs by harold arlen and dorothy fields, with douglas shearer splendidly handling the sound recording, and notice must be made of the fine set decorations by edwin willis, and the effective costume designs by walter plunkett.

ok, anatomie is not a reinvention of the horrormovie-genre, but nevertheless it is well done. good actors (potente and f√ºhrmann at first) and some nice ideas made me happy. maybe i would have been not so positive if this wasn¬¥t a german movie, but who cares. it is good to see familiar faces in a good, thrilling story, with some gore and some good jokes in it. all of you complaining about the dubbing: i didn¬¥t see a dubbed version (of course) but i believe that it is not easy for you to watch dubbed movies. we (germans) are used to watch movies like that, so it¬¥s not a big problem. but try to watch in german with subtitles. the actors are really good!

(spoilers?)i've heard some gripe about the special effects. but that should detract from the movie. the movie is a suspense film. and it's very good at that. so from that stand point, this movie rocks. franke rocks. enjoy to one's plastic hearts content. so no complaints for this movie. unless you watch the english dub, which is a total farce. it creates the illusion it's a b movie. one complaint i do have is the music video on the dvd. it doesn't say who sings it. i'd love to know. 8/10quality: 10/10 entertainment : 10/10 replayable: 5/10

i liked this film a lot. the actors were great, particularly potente, who is different in every role; f√ºrmann, who is also able to play anyone; and loos, who spices things up (she is also a talented singer - she sings the song "my truth", heard when one character cranks up the stereo in the lab).anatomie is a good horror flick, which pays attention to its characters. it is also very gory at times, and the set design is innovative. it is too bad they had to make a sequel, which is nowhere near the original.on a side note, two other things definitely worth mentioning. the dvd is not dubbed, which makes for a better experience of the film. also, make sure to keep watching after the final credits start rolling.

i saw anatomy years ago -- dubbed at a friends house i don't remember it much, and then i saw at the video store there is a second one -- not really related to the first one franka ponte makes a little cameo. and that one was okay not as good as the first one. i'm seeing the first one again tonight -- not dubbed collectors edition. i really like german movies like this one it's very interesting and people and cults like the one in the movie could exist i think, i dunno. but it's very grossly entertaining and scary. anatomy 2 is a little different and the characters are not as good as the first. but if you really thought anatomy was interesting and good you should see the second one.

to me, "anatomie" is certainly one of the better movies i have seen. i don't think "anatomie" was primarily intended to be a horror movie but a movie questioning the ethics of science. if you watch it with that in mind, it turns into a really good film. the only annoying bit was the awful voice dubbing for the english version. how can you expect any non-german person to listen to these unbearable german accents for two hours? let native english speakers do the talking or use subtitles instead!!

with "anatomy" the german film producers have tried to make something totally new. usually there just drama or comedy movies - in the horror genre is(or was) totally new at that time.the story's also new and shocking. franka potente plays her role brilliant and i bet you won't find out who's the murderer. it's possible, but difficult. a really great movie with a lot of talented actors.

this is a great german slasher, that's often quite suspenseful, and creative, with a fun story and solid performances. all the characters are cool, and benno f√ºrmann is great as the psycho killer, plus franka potente gives a fantastic performance as the main lead. it did take a little while to get going, but it was never boring, and it had some good death scenes as well, plus the music is wonderfully creepy. i was lucky enough to get the subtitled version, instead of the dubbed, and i thought all the characters were quite likable, plus it's very well made and written as well. it has some really good plot twists too, and the effects are extremely well done, plus the ending is great. the finale is especially suspenseful, and franka potente was the perfect casting choice in my opinion, plus i wish arndt schwering-sohnrey(david) didn't get killed of so soon, because he was a really cool character. there were actually a couple of moments where i felt uncomfortable but in a good way, and i must say this film deserved all it's praise, plus while it does have plot holes, it's not enough to hamper the film. this is a great german slasher, that's often quite suspenseful, and creative, with a fun story, and solid performances, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is great!. stefan ruzowitzky does a great! job here with excellent camera work, very good angles, great close ups (see the opening sex scene), doing a great job of adding creepy atmosphere, and just keeping the film at a very fast pace.there is quite a bit of blood and gore. we get cadavers cut open,plenty of very gory surgery scenes,lots of bloody stabbings,people are dissected while still being conscious, severed finger, self mutilation, gutting's, bloody slit throat, lots of wicked looking frozen corpses, plenty of blood and more.the acting is very solid!. franka potente is fantastic as the main lead, she was very likable, remained cool under pressure, was vulnerable, easy on the eyes, and we are able to care for her character, the only time she seemed to suffer, was when she had to spurt out some bad dialog here and there, but that wasn't very often, she was wonderful!. benno f√ºrmann is excellent as the psycho killer, he was simply chilling, and wonderfully ott, he really gave me the creeps, and was one effective killer!. anna loos played her role very well, as the smart slut, i dug her. sebastian blomberg was great here as caspar, he was quite likable, and had a mysterious character,his chemistry with potente was also on, and there was a great twists involving him at the end. holger speckhahn was good as the idiot phil and did his job well. traugott buhre is good as prof. grombek. arndt schwering-sohnrey was great as david, he had a really cool character, and i wish he didn't get killed of so soon. rest of the cast do fine.overall i highly recommend this great german slasher!. ***1/2 out of 5

i was going to use 'the german scream' as a summary but that was already taken lol. it sums up anatomy nicely. provided you're not alien to reading subtitles, anatomy fits in snugly with the scream/urban legend pack. it's a teen-horror set in a medical school where the students are going missing then turning up as experiment subjects in the dissection lab. cue one plucky student investigating herself and uncovering a giant conspiracy.provided you're watching the original german language film (i can't comment on the dub, having not seen the english edition) anatomy is sharply written and cleverly plotted so that the tension never really lets up. in comparison to it's american counterparts, the mystery is uncovered much faster, meaning that instead of being a slasher right up until the final reveal, anatomy evolves during it's running time from a slasher-come-body horror movie into a smart and exciting thriller. it's a gripping ride from start to finish.hats off to the actors involved as well. franka potente proves once more that she's an intelligent, smart actress who can make any role come to life. her central performance as paula is a great foundation for the movie to build from. the spooky lecturers and their teachers pets are equally good, a truly foreboding presence at all times.it's also astounding that the movie doesn't drag much. the pace is fast and punchy, very similar to the earlier urban legend, meaning that there's always something going on to keep your attention high. if there's one downside it could be that some will find anatomy too gruesome for them, but if you persevere through the first half's admittedly graphic dissection sequences, the latter half with it's exciting thriller overtones will reward you. i recommend anatomy to anyone who enjoys a good teen-horror but is a bit jaded with the american take on the matter.

this one is a hilarious diamond in the rough. the acting and plot aren't that impressive, but the lines just keep on coming. this catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like, well, a bad movie, but it's so kooky that you can't help but be amused. the spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going... i was especially fond of sharon, the canuck on shrooms eh? however, the one that really stole the show was richard's little brother andrew (ira heiden), his high pitched whining was somehow endearing. the whole movie rocked.

i saw anatomy when it came out and recently bought it and the 2003 sequel and as i watch a lot of foreign films in various genres, you have to watch movies in their original language for sure. not only is it annoying to know the voices don't belong to the actors, but they always seem cheerful, like the whole movie is one big long toothpaste commercial or something. it makes an otherwise awesome movie seem horrible and i have had to convert a lot of my friends who used to think foreign films aren't as good as north american films - that they aren't "hollywood enough". also, they translation is never right, it's too literal, and screws up the vibe of the movie, even if it's basically saying the same thing. i watched anatomy by myself the other week in german then with subtitles with my roommate because he was on his laptop and didn't want to have to miss parts when he couldn't see the subtitles because he was typing. 30 mins in and he begged me to let him finish his work then start the movie over with subtitles. he loved it! both movies are awesome as intellectual horror films! kelly

a horror picture set ultimately to parody but still in it's play out could scare a few of those that are frailed nerved or easily disgusted when they see whats under their skin. i laughed at it though. it was easy to decipher the true killer and his acting didn't help. this only led to potente looking even better. anatomie is not much of a horror picture for those foreign of the genre but those contained should get a few unintentional laughs and an interesting peak at german horror cinema. 6/10

i found the film quite good for what i was expecting. although i weary, because i have a fear of injection needles, i sort of came to expect when they were coming. so if you're not into needles, blood, the human body, and some good medical fun, put this movie back and rent another. as the other user commented, i was also please at the german attempt at a slasher film. i'm an american who just moved to germany to stay with a family and saw this lying on the shelf. i love psychological thrillers, and i'd say this is somewhere along those lines. a character falls into places and feels misconstrued. while trying to dig her way out and find some truth to a situation, things get a little sticky and other aren't so sure she's on the right track. so throughout the film you're kept on edge about who's anatomy you might catch a glimpse of and who's rounding the next corner.

i was shocked at how good this german version of films such as scream was. surpassing all the modern american efforts at slasher films.it as what all those films don't. likable characters, genuine mystery, suspense, graphic murders and a brilliant soundtrack.this stylish horror film is one of the best of its kind to come out in years. german cinema is going from strength to strength just lately. its a shame more people wont go to see such films because they are missing out. it is easily available on dvd so even if you hate subtitles i think you should see it. it will be one of the best horror films you will see all year.

this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. this, in my opinion, is rob lowe at his best. i'm not quite sure why this film has gotten such a low rating. i guess you either love it or hate it, but if nothing else, it is definitely worth a rental.

this seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing. it may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the world war ii era, but i recommend that all others beware. many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. the story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough, but there's no real pacing or tension in the story. i also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying, partially due to some strong english accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording. i give this a 55/100. most folks will want to "steer" clear.

***************************mild spoilers ahead**************************we dive at dawn is an english made movie with john mills in the lead role. the second time i watched the dvd version was on a big screen tv and i must say the movie is better than i thought the first time i saw it on the samll screen. may be it was the big screen viewing that helped?i still say the first few segments of the movie are muddled, but once the submarine leaves the dock and begins its mission, the movie takes off too! the search for the german battleship named the brandenburg and the adventures which went along with it were absorbing and the detail shown in the movie are interesting!i'm increasing my rating to 7/10. if you enjoy ww ii films, i think you'll find this one interesting once the submarine gets underway. some of the men on the sub have quite a sense of humor, too!

i watched this expecting to see the usual british stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humour. it was more like eastenders goes to sea than in which we serve. the scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a fighting ship and the stuff ups and banter among the ship's company (well at least based on my service in the 1970s). some of the throwaway lines are very witty ("i'm not joining the band of hope just to please some greasy fish fryer!). my only complaint is that they didn't show what happened to the irish coxswain and his bride to be, or the tattooed po and his "i love arabella" tattoo!

if you're in the middle of a ferocious war and it's still not clear that you're going to come out on top, among the things you'll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civilians...to demonstrate that our troops have the bravery, the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause. and that's just what director anthony asquith provided the british with 1943's naval war film, we dive at dawn. after more than 60 years, it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated. it doesn't help that the class stereotypes which help define the enlisted men from the officers can be jarring. here, as in so many other british war films, the men invariably have thick regional working class accents while the officers speak with an educated fluency that would place them at home in england's finest ruling-class establishments. in this movie, freddie taylor (john mills), the captain of the submarine sea tiger, is clever, confident, resourceful, aggressive, in control, good with his men, humorous with his peers, quick to make a decision. and it helps that he's lucky. his men are jolly tars, for the most part, competent at their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense. although we spend the first third of the movie getting to know these people while they're on leave, after that things get tense quickly. taylor and his sub are ordered to destroy the brandenburg, a new german battleship. they just miss the ship when it enters the kiel canal and heads into the baltic. taylor assesses the risks and decides the sea tiger will go after it, through mine fields, anti-sub nets and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to home base. after several tense situations, the confrontation takes place. the sea tiger lets loose six torpedoes but has to dive, not knowing if it had done its job. after a clever subterfuge, taylor outfoxes a couple of german destroyers but then realizes there is not enough fuel. he plans to scuttle his sub and surrender when, just at the last moment, james hobson (eric portman), a seaman who had been sullen and a loner and who speaks german, says there is a small danish coastal village that had been a fuel depot. he thinks it might still be for the germans. the last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the sea tiger back to britain. this is a wartime propaganda movie, so don't expect failure. and did the sea tiger actually put the brandenburg down? are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts? did hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and small son that left him smiling for once? did freddie taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in his little black book? you'll have to see the movie. there are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. some, like powell's and pressburger's one of our aircraft is missing and the 49th parallel, still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn't use obvious shorthand clich√©s. others, like we dive at dawn, were made with enough clich√©s that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made. still, asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clich√©s. the sea tiger's forcing its way through a sub net was tense. the stalking of the brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic; john mill's no-nonsense attitude while he prepared to attack was well-handled. the fake-out preparations to make the sea tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic, inside the sub as well as out, as you could hope for, and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. we dive at dawn is not a classic war film, but it's a well-made, well-acted example of its type and time. john mills, it's worth noting, had a long, long career. especially in the fifties he played in a number of serious-minded films looking back at those wwii days. he had the quality of showing grit, cheerfulness and perseverance, but of also being trustworthy, a man england could be proud of as he fought the war. top-billed in this movie was eric portman, a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold you'd want to put on a sweater. everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff-upper-lip mode, but portman manages some complexity for his character. mills and portman did fine jobs working together on this film.

this is an excellent tub-thumper from the war years.john mills leads a fine cast of regular british b-movie stalwarts in a solo submarine attack upon a fictitious enemy battleship.filmed in black and white, it's well paced and also well placed considering that a war was going on at the time. if anything, it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propaganda.the mission-side of the movie takes place in genuine submarines. things are cramped and claustrophobic. the actors look suitably grimy and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palate. other commentators have already drawn attention to the authentic little details like keeping the vessel trim and forgetting to read instruments, as well as the engine-room activities.this probably is the first movie in which debris (and a dead german) is blown from the torpedo tube to fool an enemy destroyer. and it's the only time i have seen part of the vessel exposed in a pretence of sinking - a high risk gamble if ever there was one.i'm a little sceptical as to whether or not a submarine could punch its way through a wire-rope net. submerged speed was barely twice that of human walking speed, and the net would have had a great deal of 'give'. also, the engineer was at the same work-station and operating the same levers both on the surface and submerged. this, too, seems implausible as either diesel or electric engines were used and they were in different sections of the ship - or so i'm told.there was a wee bit too much shore-side drama for my tastes. but then, this was a propaganda effort, and clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to mind their behaviour as it could adversely affect service morale and therefor the war effort.these niggles aside, it's a pretty entertaining little adventure. nowadays movies of such vintage tend to be screened in the afternoon, whilst far more modern and inferior movies enjoy prime-time. but then; it's no longer politically-correct to mention the war in the presence of our european friends (too many of them have guilty consciences), or our own left-wing fascists (non of whom have ever fought for the freedoms they now take for granted).as a submarine movie it is eminently collectible. better than 'the enemy below', i think, though less demonstrative. not so authentic as 'das boot' by any means, but not so gross either.

any film about wwii made during wwii by a british production company has no latter-day peer in my opinion, respectfully. the confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in at dawn we dive: as a descendant of admiral horatio nelson and student of all aspects of world war two and particularly naval warfare, i favor depictions of subs and action in the north atlantic and especially those which include the german side of things. for those unacquainted with target priorities, an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here. the pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the ealing, rank and british-gaumont studios back in the day: frankly i prefer its quieter, more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over-produced hollywood movie ever could. this reminds me of powell and pressburger's the 49th parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive eric portman, a favorite of mine. john mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles, so this is clearly meant to be mr. portman's film but the whole cast shines. as for the title sequence, am i the only one who is utterly charmed by gainsborough production's lovely pre-cgi gainsborough girl?

the submarine used was not varangian! 'it' was in fact two boats, p614 and p615, both built for turkey by vickers armstorng at barrow-in-furness but kept hold of by the royal navy for the duration of the war. p615 was sunk but p614 was eventually delivered in 1945. the confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up p61 (as i did) and found varangian! when in fact, the last digit of both p614 and p615 was in fact just painted out....there are some extremely realistic moments in the film. these turkish boats were very similar to the s-class. as no s-class submarines survive, the shots of them (as p61) and of the depot ship "forth" form part of an interesting record now, as well as an excellent film.

this movie is all about reality, submarine warfare in ww2 was not a clean precise science. there were no computers giving exact enemy details, there was no precise instrumentation to 100% control the sub. not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart, and a smile on their dial.people with expectations of seeing a "pretty war" in this movie will be grossly disappointed, .............. good, they deserve to be disappointed, they deserve to have reality shoved into their face.war is not clean, exact, fought by people about to break into song. it is endured by scared, cold/burnt, hungry, desperate people willing to do anything to survive."we dive at dawn" is a fine example portraying a desperate situation needing desperate actions.

as a teenager, i watched this movie every time it was on tv (and it was on a lot) because of its witty, appealing-to-teenager humor. it may not be what critics consider 4 star viewing, but i love it for what it is--a fun comedy meant to please the audience. the teen actors are of my generation (probably why i love the movie so much) and was like a fantasy cast of everyone's favorite tv shows of the early 90's--full house, family matters, fresh prince--all of the shows were represented and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 90's. though it may not include the high doses of nudity and violence that so many teen movie writers think vital to success among the youth demographic (or perhaps because of its absence), i highly recommend it to pre-teens and teenagers everywhere.

i think this movie is my favorite movie. i am not sure why, but it is. julia duffy has been my favorite actress for awhile, and when i saw this, i went crazy. it's sort of romantic, and i definitely recommend this movie.

this was a excellent back when it came out. it had some the best talent available and a funny story. between candace cameron and tatyana ali, it was hard to choose who is cuter, and add in carlton from fresh prince and all the other big names, and you get a blockbuster. ok, a made for tv blockbuster, but none the less. if you can find this move, don't miss it.

glenn ford is hired by a crooked bank owner and wily stable owner edger buchanan to stage a fake robbery while the banker hides the real loot. with ford a no-show, the two instead go with a trigger happy second choice, leaving ford on the hook for killings he didn't commit.columbia pictures' first color feature, the desperadoes looks fantastic with sets and costumes fabricated to take full advantage of the technicolor process accentuating tons of well staged western spectacle.this has the irresistible teaming of a young glenn ford (third-billed but essentially the star) and a prime randolph scott leading an incredible supporting cast of great character actors in colorful roles, including scene-stealer edger buchanan as a good-natured but mildly villainous yokel who isn't as dumb as he looks and who has quite a few memorable lines.a fairly complex script effectively mixes incredible action sequences, melodrama, and comedy, well directed by charles vidor. this is one of the great westerns of the nineteen-forties and highly recommended.

this is simply a good ole fashioned western..not overly complex or long. it doesn't deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment. still, it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning. it features former partners randolph scott and glenn ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that ford's cheyenne rogers has been part of bank robbing(he even steals scott's sheriff steve upton's horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving). in red valley, upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead. claire trvor portrays countess maletta, a friend of cheyenne's who gives he and buddy "nitro"(guinn 'big boy' williams)a place to stay for the time being. cheyenne desires to go straight, but finds that hard when jack lester(bernard nedell)and his bad bunch want to rob red valley's bank. it is actually jack who is behind the murders, but cheyenne's troubled past is hard to get away from. he and nitro will be charged with the murders they didn't commit(the robbery was one cheyenne didn't commit)and it will be upton who must somehow save the day before lester gets away with murder. there are sub-plots which include cheyenne's falling in love with alison mcleod{evelyn keyes;the irony of the story is that alison's father, uncle willie, is actually in cahoots with banker stanley clanton(porter hall)in a planned united theft with lester to steal the town of red valley's loot}. will upton uncover uncle willie and banker clanton's treacherous scheme? will uncle willie be able to go through it without his conscience always bothering him? this film has a terrific barroom brawl and a dandy of a climactic shootout. columbia couldn't have picked a better genre to begin the coloring process as this film has some fine mountainous shots as men give chase on horseback and such. don't expect to get your socks blown off, but the film is simple and well paced.

i liked this western starring randolph scoot and glenn ford.it's got pretty much everything a western should have.there's gunfights,action,chases on horseback.there's a bit of a romance angle that's hinted at.there's some nice comic relief in the form of edgar buchanan,who plays uncle willie mcleod,a character who pretend to be a doddering old fool,but is actually aware of everything going on.randolph scott plays the town sheriff,and glenn ford plays cheyenne rogers/bill smith,a hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his ways.i liked the different mix of characters in the movie.i didn't find it always fast paced,but i never found it boring either.even though the movie is in 1943,it is in colour. 8/10

randolph scott and glenn ford were once outlaw pals together, but now scott's a sheriff and young ford is still hiring his gun out. he gets hired to pull a bank job, but is delayed getting to town and those that hired him get someone else. that leads to all kinds of complications, a lot for a film that's not even 90 minutes long.randy and glenn both got girls here. claire trevor plays her usual good time gal with a heart of gold. and evelyn keyes is the daughter of edgar buchanan who falls for ford big time without realizing who he is or why he came to the town that scott is the sheriff in.it's b western, but unusual for the time and for columbia pictures it was given the full technicolor treatment. the desperadoes marked glenn ford's first film in technicolor, a process reserved only for some of the more expensive films from bigger studios. harry cohn was certainly not one to shell out for it. and definitely not during war time.the plot gets a bit convoluted as both ford and scott are put to the test of friendship versus expediency/duty. the plot also involves some high class hypocritical skunks in randy's town who are the real outlaws as far as the film is concerned.the four leads do a fine job and the best supporting performance is guinn williams as ford's lovable explosive lunkhead of a sidekick. the climax involves a cattle stampede and a shootout in the town saloon and is one of the best ever done in a western film.fans of the four leads and westerns in general will enjoy this one.

probably because this is columbia's first film in color, the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes. they seem to be stronger, sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic, but very pleasing. randolph scott is the sheriff, a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young glenn ford, who is an outlaw that wants to change. evelyn keyes is the woman that starts falling for ford and claire trevor is the countess that runs the saloon. there is a funny character called nitro that does not think twice before blowing it. i particularly enjoyed two moments of the film, one when there is a tremendous horse stampede and you see thousands of horses, there was no computer to help at that time, so i presume they must have gathered all those horses, no easy task. another moment is the final shootout, technically very good. there is also quite a fistfight. seeing this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes, makes you come to a sad conclusion: they don't make them anymore. would they be able to in case they wanted? i have my doubts.

this timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated. i can't even count how many times i've seen dirty dancing. this is one movie that i could probably watch every few weeks and still love.there is something timeless about this movie. i have loved other "blockbuster love story movies" like pretty woman and when harry met sally. i think their up there but there is something about dirty dancing that just makes it absolutely perfect. the characters, the chemistry between swaze and grey, the movie's direction, the incredible dancing, the warm summery atmosphere, everything about dirty dancing is absolutely perfect. it is an instant classic and i've never really seen a movie like it either before or since.i don't think there is one particular element that makes this movie so loved but many things, a lot of which are mentioned by numerous reviewers. dirty dancing has a nostalgic, languid, summery mood, realistic characters, a relateable honest message coupled with incredible music and dancing, and the one of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us. this movie is always on tv and i will continue to watch it as long as they show it. but i will mention i have no interest in seeing "havanna nights", this one they should have left alone.

i don't really know what it is about dirty dancing.. there is some sort of absolute magic in this movie.. i cannot possibly recount the hundreds (yes, hundreds)of times i've watched it, beginning to end... but every time i do come upon it on tv, i am entranced and mystified and sit myself down and there i am, for two hours, loving the movie as if i'm watching it for the first time. although patrick swayze and jennifer grey absolutely hated each other throughout the making of this film, they possess a beautiful chemistry on the set.. it makes the viewer enjoy it that much more, to see this passion and commitment.. and i can't help tearing up a tiny bit at the end, when patrick comes up to the houseman family and tells her dad, "nobody puts baby in a corner". (classic moment) for all those people who believe this movie is corny and sappy, maybe in a way it is, but it was the penicle of the 80's films, and put patrick swayze right on the map; his performance was immaculate. three cheers for dirty dancing !!ps- the soundtrack is fantastic, an absolute masterpiece

i remember this in a similar vein to the young ones. we'd stumble back from the pub and watch this or tape it and then spend weeks replaying the lines to each other.we called one of our mates "zipmole watkins" after the brilliant episode in which daniel peacock has a bit of 'restyling' on his nose by the back street abortionist.lots of great lines "remember at 5:30 in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man. take it easy guy!" - gandhi as a local shopkeeper.tony woodcock was definitely on there in the episode they were teaching ralph (daniel peacock) to be a barman "it's no good amanda i'll never make it as a bar man" helen lederer teaches him to ask people about the match "see the match last night? i thought woodcock played well" after a string of failed conversations the curly haired arsenal star was sitting at the bar: "see the match last night?" "yeah. i thought i played well"we still do odd stupid lines now - "reg and ralph..... or....... ralph and reg. reg, reg... reg reg reg reg"lots of very surreal silly moments and very surreal songs from the flatlets - the back street abortionist a personal favourite with the great ending line - "and he'll mark your packages 'return to sender"good old danny peacock - you added a lot to some young drinkers' evenings sir.**update - i found a couple of episodes on tape - i'm going to upload the gandhi sketch to youtube **

ahhhh, 1984.... i was young and stupid, and just developing a taste for those exotic cigarettes, whilst living in a squat in manchester's moss side, with the most unbelievable case of cockroach infestation.after a few of those doobies, this show was rotflmao material - i was an avid fan. then i'd look down at the floor (or up at the walls, or just about anywhere) and see my very own collection of "little armadillos" scuttling about.not sure if it was the chemical enhancement, but i remember thinking at the time that the overt surrealism of the show was fantastic - it was my second favourite thing on tv at the time (#1 was the season of luis bunuel movies being shown by channel 4). radical art lives on! also you gotta that theme tune! ....i swear, i'll never drink no more....

i loved this show. i used to actually leave the pub ten minutes before closing and run down the road to catch it. i remember daniel peacock's sketch about gandhi in the newsagents as a masterpiece. the set design and lighting were out of this world, creating an atmosphere that you felt you were actually living in. v unusual for a comedy.unfortunately i have only encountered one other person (apart from the other reviewer here) who ever knew that this programme existed. in fact i have to thank the imdb for coming into existence and proving to me that i hadn't in fact imagined the whole series in a drunken haze, which i was seriously starting to believe!

"the desperadoes" (1943) is a genuine classic, not for its story (which is fairly routine), but for its technical production elements. this was a landmark western, the biggest ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a columbia production-a lightweight studio with a bottom feeding reputation. only fox's "jesse james" (also starring randolph scott) from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this lavish a treatment to the genre. although it would be eclipsed in a few years by "the searchers" and "high noon", "the desperadoes" was a ground breaking effort and a historical treasure. in 1863, the economy in the town of red valley, utah is based on rounding up and selling wild horses to the union army. the script gets a little messed up here with references to the railroad (which was several years away in utah's future) and custer's last stand (custer was busy fighting stuart in pennsylvania at the time) but these are not important plot elements. red valley has an honest sheriff, steve upton (scott), but the banker and several citizens are corrupt; robbing their own bank each time the government pays for a herd of horses. the town is visited by cheyenne rogers (glenn ford), a famous outlaw who is an old friend steve's. he wants to go straight, especially after falling for the pretty livery stable owner alison mcleod (evelyn keyes). cheyenne's partner "nitro" rankin (guinn "big boy" williams) is mainly there for comic relief as are uncle willie mcleod (edgar buchanan) and the town judge (raymond walburn who models his character on frank morgan's "wizard of oz" crystal ball faker). taking no chances with their huge budget columbia packed this thing with tons of action and every western movie element but indians and covered wagons. there is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed, a spectacular barroom brawl, an explosive climax, romance, and three-strip technicolor. all this stuff doesn't necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943. unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy. the cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of its filming. the indoor scenes are solid but it is the naturalistic outdoor photography that is truly impressive; both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera filming of the action sequences. scott and claire trevor were top billed, but the studio clearly wanted to promote ford, who would soon be their biggest star. and director charles vidor utilized the film to showcase his new wife keyes (whose portrayal of scarlett's sister in "gone with the wind" had connected with audiences more than any small part in the history of films). the ford-keyes dynamic is "the desperadoes" most unique and important feature. rather than go for the clich√© "love triangle" with scott and/or trevor (which it first appears will happen), the entire romantic focus is on the two younger actors. this was probably the best role keyes ever got and she makes the most of it. playing a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses, and who rides and fights like kiera knightley's character in "pirates of the caribbean". this was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the 1942 formation of the waac for wwii military service. "the desperadoes" is one film that has been well taken care of and the print looks like it is brand new. unfortunately there are no special features on the dvd. then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

meatballs is a classic comedy with so many laughs that it's impossible to count.in what was merely a precursor of what was to come, murray rules the screen in what can only be described as comic mastery. tripper harrison is one of the greatest comedy characters in the past 50 years. sarcastic all the time, smart when he has to be, stern when he needs to be, and caring when it suits him, murray infuses tripper with that snl glint in the eye.the c.i.t's are merely in awe as they cower beneath the comic genius that is mr. murray.summer isn't summer without a viewing of meatballs. one of the best comedies to ever grace the screen.

i love meatballs! terrific characters and poignant situations make this one dearly loved. bill murray is hysterical and you gotta love that 4-mile trail race at the end! a total classic and one of my favorites now for about 20 years. it brings back fond memories of camp and deals nicely with the experience of being rejected by foolish peers and the empowerment brought one by being rescued by a sympathetic adult. tons of great one-liners and quite an assortment of wacko counselors. this is the kind of movie where you repeat key phrases among friends for years afterward. also nothing overtly crude and what a sweet late '70's soundtrack to bring on just the right amount of nostalgia. i can't say enough about meatballs; it's a classic. be forewarned! all the sequels are putrid stink bombs that simply bought the name rights for marketing. they have no connection to ivan reitman's masterpiece.

when i was younger, this movie always aired on friday night in the summer on channel 40 (this was the years before fox was a network and took over the programming). i always looked forward to it. i'd go grocery shopping with my parents, then sit down with my swanson's tv dinner and a lady lee cola(the only time of the week i was allowed to drink cola, and enjoy. sure, the script is predictably late 70's (like little darlings), but it's a fun movie, and i loved rudy and tripper. bill murray coasts with little effort in the movie, but he is charming. gotta love spaz and those taped glasses (pre revenge of the nerds). chris makepeace is pretty much the same character he played in "my bodyguard" but he does it so well.

"rattlesnake! look out!" "is that a bra you're wearing or are you expecting an assassination attempt?" "spaz, what are you a homo or what?!" "ok way to go you guys! feed fink, he's our hot man" "do you know they use the most sophisticated training methods from the soviet union, east & west germany and the newest olympic power, trinidad-tobago." "oh spaz you old make-out master!" "what, no mustard?!" "oh my god his nose is bleeding." "it's gonna get even bigger now" "our political roundtable...henry kissinger will appear. yassir arafat is gonna come out, spend a weekend with the kids just rap with them."these and many other great lines make meatballs a hall-of-fame comedy. only in caddyshack is bill murray funnier. he probably ad-libbed half the lines. the high school actors seemed to have a blast being in the same movie with him.hilarious movie to watch any time of year, not just the summer.

meatballs works its way into conversations, like no other movie. especially during summer. whether it's the song about the cits (counselors in training) or the cut-downs or the inspirational rudy the rabbit or it just doesn't matter speech...it pops up! poor mickey/morty, who knows where he'd wake up next!?! such a great snapshot of the seventies and a cultural icon for my generation of those who understand that non-pc is really funny, no matter who you are! wheels and spaz are favorites, as is the hot dog eating contest with the famous line "what..? no mustard?" oh, how many times i've reiterated that line and been the only one laughing! thank you to the writers, actors and directors! applause, applause!

the quintessential "let's get ready for summer movie." it's dumb, goofy, and maybe a touch dated, but my kids just saw it and they laughed as hard as i did when i first saw it. in the style of all "little guys versus the establishment" movies, so yes, the plot is very predictable, but it's warm and funny. and no, it's not bill murray at his bill murrayest, but he is starting to stretch out in what was his first starring role. odd, though, to see how few of the "fresh young faces" in this film went on to do much more.

i rarely even bother to watch comedic movies or television these days. they're insipid, vulgar, and, most importantly, not funny. this one could be seen as a refreshing blast from the past. it's worth watching, and i don't believe it would be dated in any significant way. classic humor is classic humor, and good writing is good writing regardless of the era in which created.i would love to see this film again; it came to mind after having seen the somewhat similar "summer school" on television recently. like that slightly newer film, "meatballs" is funny without being cruel, overly sexual or indulging in bathroom humor. the key, of course, is how the adult character makes such a difference in the life of the teen character -- maybe even a virtually life-saving change -- and how they both grow up in the space of a summer.

i first saw this movie in the mid 80's and thought it was a funny movie. as i have gotten older i watch this movie for different reasons. i like to view it when i'm feeling sad/nostalgic for my "lost youth". i was a teenager (14) at the time of the release of this film so i can identify with many of the same problems/dilemmas that the campers/cit's in this movie have. i enjoy seeing the clothes that were worn at this time and hearing the same old urban legends such as was told on the overnight canoe trip. the film is also full of funny one liners. i highly recommend this movie to anyone that was a teenager in the late 70's to early 80's.

if you take the movie for what it is worth, you won't be disappointed. if you think murray is supposed to win an oscar for his performance and that is the type of movie you are expecting, don't bother. it was funny when i saw it in 1979 and hasn't lost its charm. good clean fun for the kids and mindless entertainment for the older folks. the story line is simple and easy to follow. murray has done better, but this is his first film. the movie reminds me of a time when we didn't need blood and guts to be entertained. morty is the head dunce and plays the part perfect. the other counselors are typical revved up teens looking to have fun during the summer. one nice thing about this movie, it has a message.

i know that was a goofy movie, but i enjoyed it immensely. it's one of the experiences that make me smile when someone says "bill murray." i almost always like movies involving the underdog, and this movie has more underdogs than you can count. it's overall a kind movie--some of the adults are not wrapped tightly, but the laughter is accepting rather than brutal like so many teen movies these days. the rich kids across the lake take a beating, but no one i know minded at all. i never went to camp, but i did some things that were somewhat parallel and most of the "bits" and tricks ran true. they were even understated at times, but i'm sure that was an accident.the cast performed well, with bill murray showing hints of what he would become. it's not groundhog day or broken flowers, but, hey, a good goofy laugh should be appreciated these days, but then...it just doesn't matter...............................

this movie was very good. i really enjoyed it. tom mccamus' performance was excellent and very believable as the consumptive son edmund. i also enjoyed the set design (house) and the costumes.

luckily for bill murray this is such a light-weight project since he pretty much has to carry it. meatballs is the story of low-rent camp northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another. then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named camp mohawk which culminates in a two-day olympiad competition. above it all is bill murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut.the film is sprinkled with medium-sized laughs, chuckles, and more than a few guffaws along the way. the biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director. three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he's sleeping. morty, or "micky" as everyone calls him, wakes up along the side of a road, strung up in some trees several feet above the ground, and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake! there are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another, but this is a pg rated film with little in the way of raunchiness.the film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named rudy who is played by chris makepeace. of course it's up to murray to teach the kid how to open up, and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the olympiad. the sentimentality of rudy's situation seems tacked on to a great degree. notice how when murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him, "you must be the short depressed kid we ordered." makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or murray was just ad-libbing while the cameras were rolling. in other words, murray might as well have said to makepeace, "you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn't fit in." but before it's all over, murray's performance makes this plot device more than bearable. he really seems to have some good chemistry with makepeace.the film culminates with the games between the two rival camps. very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable, but "it just doesn't matter". this is a pretty good film on many levels. don't let the absurd 5.6 rating this film is currently getting scare you off. murray will keep you laughing throughout. just be warned..... avoid the sequels!!!! especially the one with corey feldman!! 8 of 10 stars.the hound.

the plot is predictable. it has been done many times in other movies. you have competing summer camps in this one: the rich kids vs. the underachievers competing for "bragging" rights in the typical camp contests, while the kids and consolers pursue pranks, sex, and "a good time!" "are you ready for the summer?" meatballs is the first (and best) summer camp movie for feel-good comedy. as others have posted, it's no citizen kane, but this type of movie isn't meant to be. the film works because of the wonderful comic timing and classic one-liners of bill murray. his scenes with a camper where he tries to raise the kid's self-esteem are very good. bill's one-liners throughout the film are very funny.i also like that this movie isn't dirty or explicit like so many other "teens at camp" movies today. there is some mild sexual innuendo and maybe one or two cuss words in the entire film. but meatballs is the type of teen movie that is actually appropriate for the younger crowd. it's rated pg.this is a movie that you have to see a few times to get all of the jokes! when bill murray is on the screen or making one of his classic "pa announcements" you are drawn to the film. bill seems to carry the movie all by himself. but he does it so well, that when you see meatballs, you will realize that this is the film that made him a star! a side note to this review is to avoid all of the meatball movie sequels. they are horribly bad.

as a young teen when this came out, i completely related to it. as an adult in the present sex- obsessed american culture, it doesn't have enough nudity to be called tame. if you are looking for american pie-type lewdness, vulgarity or fart and feces jokes, meatballs will disappoint with impunity and a guarantee. if you like bill murray, and you like good clean fun, you will probably like and enjoy this film very much. similarly with stripes, ghostbusters, caddy shack, etc. enough said, just go watch it, and stop intellectualizing it. it's meatballs, for crying out loud! why read a review? just enjoy it and have fun. and ignore the trash talk by others. films, like so many other things in life, are subjective. to each his own. always beware the 'expert' who diminishes others' taste.

imagine spending the summer without your family or friends from school, and meeting new people. or yet, it's your first time where you're a nobody and the only person you can count on is somebody from camp. "meatballs" packs lots of comedy in this film. in camp, there's a eccentric counselor(bill murray) who knows how the boys and girls can have a good time. enter a kid named rudy(chris makepeace) who has no one to look up to. he doesn't fit in with anyone, only tripper can make him have fun. the rest of the can are just as crazy as tripper. camp northstar is an average camp with an above average team. one the other hand camp mohawk is an elite camp that has them running for their money. in the basketball game, the mohawks got pantsed! and in the olympiad the northstar teal got the revenge they needed when one of the members take out the saboteur. and morty(harvey atkin), this poor soul can never get himself in gear if he tried. a very, very funny comedy, and it's a big keeper i'll say. this movie shows that camp can be fun, if you wanted to be! 5 stars!

i liked this movie for the most part, but have to say had there been anyone else besides bill murray in the lead role it would not have been as good. he brings an energy to the role that steps this film up a notch than it would have been otherwise. i mainly enjoyed the pranks pulled on the one counselor and there are other humorous things in this movie too such as the hot dog eating contest. this movie would also set the stage for summer camp movies with the competition at the end. nearly every camp movie has either this or the unruly or troubled kids plot, or a combination of both. this series also would take a rather strange shift in tone as this one and two are both family friendly movies while part three and four are more adult oriented, more like the old teen sex comedies of the time. it kind of did the opposite of the police academy movies that went from r to pg-13 to pg movies. this series goes from the opposite to r. still this first one and only good one is worth some chuckles largely due to bill murray.

this is a great movie. the best role peter strauss ever did. the music is good, the message harsh, the actors great and the story is both emotional and raw. only in the seventies did they make them like this one!

i read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature. finally!!!!! it's about time hollywood got their act together. the big studios always frown at edgy material, with oscar written all over it. go figure!!jericho mile was made ahead of it's time. it's a masterpiece.michael mann, a true visionary, found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence. peter strauss' emmy award performance is probably the best character role i've seen in my film-viewing lifetime. any actor who touches this role will never be the same (unless an academy award is already sitting on their mantle).the gritty multi ethnic ensemble, a backdrop for the jericho mile makes one understand the delicate social dynamics of our world. this is about redemption without public validation, and the power of the human spirit overcoming all barriers. imagine a convict imprisoned since he was a teenager for life with no chance of parole, that doesn't know he is possibly the fastest runner in the world. ...what would you do??this movie makes you walk away feeling you haven't been cheated on any level. totally thrilling, engaging, emotional, and a "rolling stones" soundtrack that kick's ass!!!i always thought this would be made for the big screen... can't wait...!!! in the meantime i'll have to continue re-watching my weathered vhs copy i've had for many years.

yes. watch this movie if you like brave films. this is maybe the best mexican picture since midaq alley just because the excellent cast, the outrageous direction and a sublime soundtrack. many people did not like 'cronica¬Ö', they think it's very aggressive but they didn't understand that it was just a representation with hyper realism of the mexican society but so similar to all the third world families. i hope that benjamin cann and bruno bichir (who in this movie gives another example of his greatness as an actor) soon get together again with a new film. just remember how los olvidados (luis bu√±uel) was misunderstood when released, but now we consider one of the best movies of all times. please, prepare yourself and watch this film.

excuse me if i'm wrong, but "cronica para un desayuno" could be one of the most gretatest films in tne mexican movie history for a lot of reasons. we can get a lot of ingredients for a perfect mexican middle-class family breakfast: a cup of bu√±uel's surrealistic motifs with a little drop of ripstenian desolated scenarios; a pound of phallus symbols around the film and a difficult psychological complexity, more than todd solondz's happiness and the dogma movement films. there`s a lot of sordidness, black humor, repressed dreams (teodoro's dream of fly), incestual lack of control (the relation between marcos and luzma), no-sense parallel stories, a discrete violence, anachronisms anda little sign of hope (spotlighted in luzma, the husband's home return and "un poco mas" used for leit-motif). marcos (bruno bichir) is a charming character ( i think in a bukoskian way), the king-without a-crown who don't expects for anything, but broken noses. luzma (maria rojo) , the lovable wife , put out a lot of faces, but the only thing that she worried is that her sons had breakfast; she' s a loser in many ways and sensual in few moments , but you will fall in love of her. the soundtrack's drag (too much woods) feeds the lack of technical merits, intentional , of course: out-of-focus shots, overlighted close-ups (in introspective scenes), dizzy pans and sudden edition cuts. "cr√≥nica" is something difficult to digest, it get stuck in the throat and anything helps for it. it tastes bitter, like a rotten orange juice and sour like expired milk, but you want to enjoy it. so i recommend to get some melox before the show, because you won't get hungry after all.

this film has the guts to suggest that it might be best to simply accept your life as it is, and keep smiling anyway. as one who is more excited by the idea of taking charge of one's life and moving forward, i felt slapped in the face, but that's okay: i don't have to agree with a movie to love it and respect it. great acting by streep and hurt, and everyone else really, and some wonderfully quirky scenes. a serious film. and take a hanky.

i hate to say i enjoyed this movie as the subject matter does not lend itself to enjoyment. however, i was moved by the way the family relationships were portrayed and the sincerity of the performances. it was the kind of film i told all my friends and family to experience as a reminder of how important we all are to each other.

i think one true thing is one of meryl streeps finest movies to date. her depiction of a dying woman is perfect. i have recently lived this movie, and it touched me on more levels than i could have imagined. meryl is truely the greatest actress to have ever walked the earth!!!!!

a great story, although one we are certainly familiar with. meryl streep proves that she is truly the best actress in film today. very entertaining, and just what i expected. don't go see this film unless you are prepared to be used and manipulated emotionally, but if you have that expectation, then you will enjoy the ride.....

after renting one true thing the other night, i have learned to respect my family, and not take their health for granted. i have never seen such a real-life portrayal of a cancer victim on screen like meryl delivered. she deserves the oscar nomination, but she has some tough competitors in the running. all i can say is beautiful film, great acting from streep and zellwegger. meryl streep revealed her one true ability in this excellent film!

i saw this movie in september with my mother. i was expecting a good movie, and i saw an excellent one. this is now my most treasured movie. it did not leave me after i left the theater. the situations in this movie reminded me of my late grandmother. meryl streep and renee zellweger were equally incredible. this movie has made me realize how important family relationships are. rent it. i can't recommend it enough.

meryl streep may be the greatest actor working today. her chameleonic portrayals never fail to astonish; she seems actually to be the characters she brings to the screen. in "one true thing," she gives life to a deceptively straightforward, profoundly complex woman doing her best to play the hand life has dealt to her. surviving with cancer is no easy task, and not just surviving but actually continuing to live one's life is even harder--and this is precisely what kate gulden (streep) means to do. renee zellweger ("jerry maguire") not only holds her own in this exalted company but shines as streep's daughter, who learns to see in a new light her parents' lives as well as her own. streep is a powerhouse and deservedly received an oscar nomination for her work here; her "i'm only going to say this once" dialogue with zellweger will leave you devastated. zellweger, though, is the real revelation--her face conveys every emotion, every conflict as she begins to learn the many truths about her parents' strengths and weaknesses. director carl franklin ("devil in a blue dress") handles the extremely difficult story material with sureness and delicacy.

i loved this movie. to be very fair, the movie starts off very slowly, with none of the characters being terribly sympathetic. it continues in this way for a good half of the film.but, if you're patient, you'll be greatly rewarded. what the first half of the movie lacks in character development and/or sympathy is adequately compensated for in the second half. it's a bit like riding a roller coaster - a slow, uphill climb to strat off with, and then speed, twists and turns, and a few surprises.as usual, meryl streep is wonderful. she is the finest actress of our time. william hurt is good, if a bit wooden in spots. renee zellweger does a very good job, showing that her performance in jerry mcguire wasn't a fluke.

"one true thing" is a very quiet film, that opened in the fall of 1998 to glowing reviews but mild box-office. it tells the crippled story of ellen (renee zellweger), a workaholic who is forced to move back home to take care of her terminally ill mother (meryl streep), so that her aloof father (william hurt) can run his academic department. these terms are only general. the strength of "one true thing" lies in the way the actors elevate their characters above hollywood clich√© territory.streep is kate, the perfect homemaker whose ability to light up a room with her charm is evident in her opening scenes at a costume party celebrating hurt's birthday. but ellen has never been close to her mother, and since she graduated from harvard university, has a certain destain about her- ellen almost thinks her mother is a simplistic air-head. while on the other hand, she admires her father- who shares a special passion: writing. ellen writes for an aggressive new york firm, and is almost heartbroken when her latest piece is torn down by hurt, who seems to be a very lonely figure.to get to the point, as kate gets sicker, ellen's perspectives change and she grows closer to her mother and more distant to her father. hurt keeps making excuses not to be there when the family needs him most, and ellen assumes he's having an affair. meanwhile she's given up her desk at work to spend time doing craft activities with her mother's "cult" group the minnies, and also learning that her mother isn't as weak as she first assumed.without giving too much away, "one true thing" is a masterpiece in character study. streep once again turns in a beautiful performance, this time working on a subtle level that starts slow but ends with a brilliant speech on the vows of marriage. streep earned her eleventh oscar nomination for this performance. hurt is also convincing as the father who carries a secret that isn't revealed until the closing moments. but it is renee zellweger who steals this movie. forget "chicago", "cold mountain", "bridget jones's diary" or whatever else you've seen her do and rent this movie. she is remarkable in it. working within her character's bitter resentment at understanding her parents, zellweger manages a realistic portrayal of a young woman fighting to keep her lip up while she's screaming inside.

this movie started out confusing and grew into one of the best movies i have seen... the acting was utterly superb and when i wasn't drying my tears i enjoyed meryl streep, who's performance was extraordinary. the movie deals with the hardships of a distant family coping with a mother who develops terminal cancer. the movie was very difficult to watch and heartbreaking. the soundtrack fits this movie to a tee. brava bette midler!! out of 5 stars, i give this one 4 1/2.

if you are among the imdb audience that put high fidelity in the all-time top 200, then this movie probably is not for you. this film is as unhip as steve frears is self-consciously hip. renee zellweger is excellent as a hip urbane magazine writer who returns to her suburban bucks county nest in order to care for mother streep (who delivers yet another hall-of-fame performance). william hurt is ideally cast and the feckless, faithless, and egotistical husband. if this movie doesn't move you to cry and laugh, then you are much too hip to enjoy it.

i have loved one true thing since the first time i watched it in the theater, and cried my eyes out. i bought it as soon as it was available, and have lost track of how many times i've watched it.to me one true thing is the ultimate family relationship movie. i love watching the relationships in the family change and evolve into what they end up being. i can relate to many details in the movie. my mother died of bone cancer, so it really hits home with me. maybe this is why i love it so much.i like the relationships between the children and their parents, and the relationship of brother and sister, but especially love the relationship between husband and wife. to me it is truly beautiful.i highly recommend this move to anyone who enjoys this kind of movie.

one true thing proves that it's the characters which make a movie. streep will surely receive an oscar nomination for her role. a beautiful drama, one true thing is a prime example of movie-making in the late 1990's - there are still people out there who care about making and watching movies other than the big blockbusters with million dollar special effects. it's no best picture or anything... don't be silly. but the amount of emotion that was delivered by both the actors and the writer hit me like a shock-wave. i cried twice in this movie, which says a lot for a 24 year old man.

"one true thing" puts zellweger in the midst of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to care for her dying mother (streep). somber and plodding, the film studies the adult child coming to terms with the adult view of her parents as they are slowly revealed to be something less than the ideal she grew up knowing as a child. an excellent character study and a find production with little to fault, "ott" offers three fine performances by a trio of top actors and some plaintive reflections on life and death.

i don't cry easily over movies, but i have to admit, this one brought me to tears. although i am not a ms. streep fan, her performance was excellent. the title defines in a sentence what a mother's love is. for the first hour i didn't like any of the characters, but that changed as the movie went on. the movie also explained why certain marriages last even though there are obstacles. a must see film.

written by someone who has been there, you can tell, but only if you've been there. excellent performances by meryl streep (of course!), renee zellweger and william hurt.many people have said that it is about a dysfunctional family, i think every family is dysfunctional when they are facing this kind of torment. to not be dysfunctional would be dysfunctional! you are losing your family as you know it, can anything be worse? people need to see this movie so when they are faced with this nightmare maybe they will change how they do it. maybe they will see that the father is denying himself valuable time he'll never get a chance at again. maybe they will realize how hard it is to die, or to watch someone you love die. they didn't miss much of the nightmare, it's hard to forget.

the dvd jacket in which this movie came describes it as "uplifting and humorous." those are not the words i would have chosen - not by a long shot. i would choose a word like "sombre," sometimes even "depressing." which isn't to say that it's a bad movie. it's actually a pretty good movie, featuring good performances from the leads, with enough uncertainty throughout about what's going to happen at the end that you keep watching. the uncertainty comes from the structure of the movie - it seems to revolve around ellen's reminiscences of her mother's slow death from cancer, as she is interviewed by the da. so, we know from the start that something suspicious happened at the end - the questions are "what?" and "who?" renee zellweger was very good as ellen - the somewhat resentful daughter who has to give up her life and job in new york to return home to care for her sick mother. ellen evolves through the movie - moreso than any other character - as she learns to deal with both the strengths and weaknesses of her parents. her relationship with her father (william hurt) is quite interesting. my initial impression was that they were quite close, but the warts in the relationship start to show after a while. hurt was effective as the detached husband - detached not in an uncaring way, but in the sense of being unable to cope with what's happening to his wife, and seeking escape from it in various ways. finally, meryl streep as the cancer-stricken kate was very convincing in the role, seeking to live out what remains of her life in the most fulfilling way possible, then dealing with the anger she feels at her increasing debilitation. in a way, watching a family deal with this kind of crisis reminded me a little bit of "ordinary people," although this movie was far less emotionally intense. so, not "uplifting and humorous" (with all due respect to whoever wrote the synopsis on the dvd jacket) but very good in its own way. 7/10

"one true thing" is the kind of movie where the audience is inspired greatly greatly inspired performances. i am not necessarily stating that the film is uplifting, because it isn't. in fact, the movie is down right depressing. i am trying to say that it takes a lot for a movie to generate emotional tears from an attending crowd.i cried in "one true thing," enough to conclude that this is one of the most emotionally powerful movies of 1998. the characters were perfectly casted. the performances are all guaranteed oscar nominees, especially meryl streep, who portraits the dying kate extremely well. her acting alone was enough to make the movie excel to the point of recommendation, and gives you a new point of view at her. i also thought that ren√©e zellweger portrayed a realistic single, free-wheeling woman who has to take care of their own mother. the other cast members including william hurt & tom everett scott, were also superb. the script of this movie was really fantastic. it is kind of funny how the movie's concept has to do with the controversial happenings in my local area. you see, i live near lansing, michigan, and right now a big issue here is assistant suicide doctor jack kavorkian's (excuse my miss-spelling if so) ways have just been outlawed. the public will vote on this according to their beliefs in november after watching "one true thing" it really changed my perspective at this topic, although i have always believed in it. without revealing the ending of the film i will simply say that suicide is a distant theme in this movie and i think it fits in accurately with the gorgeous story. overall, this movie does indeed have more emotional impact than "titanic," "saving private ryan" or any other tearjerker released in the last few years. i think that is because the main idea of this movie is that this kind of thing happened every day, so it relates better to an audience. and indeed, that this could happening to you.

meryl streep as kate, a woman dying of cancer, performs her role admirably. no wonder she was up for an oscar. in the part she proves that caring and nurturing housewives are just as important as their sisters out in the business world. and the lesson she teaches about life's expectations and their lack of fulfillment as the relationship grows, that is the most important thing she teaches her daughter. we can expect too much of our mates. realize that there are many slips and forgiveness or understanding are the main ingredients of a happy life. this is a sombre movie and the ending though sad, shows reconciliation between the father and daughter. i give this one a ten.

i wonder sometimes if maybe meryl streep has become so accepted as the most impressive, versatile actress since, well, maybe just about the beginning of the sound era that maybe her talent is now taken for granted. there are probably about three tics that she relies on consistently throughout her performances (most noticeably a pinched lip), but other than that, her performances are amazingly variable and original and fresh expressions of internal workings. even though "sophie's choice" and "a cry in the dark" and "silkwood" may be showier, her work here and in "bridges in madison county" is remarkable, too - just more subtle. in "one true thing", she is mostly sweet and in love with her domesticated life, and streep makes what could be routine, even boring, seem attractive and charming. i think that she must work out these mini-theses for each character and find what things make this person real and interesting. she works from the inside out with each character, and maybe it's this essential quality that has evoked the main criticism of aloofness or self-consciousness. i don't think she's cold at all, but instead has thought out her character's unique qualities. i think her critics are confusing self-consciousness with intelligence. not too many other actors would be so complexly thoughtful and creative as to make kate muldrun lightweight and carefree within her beloved, homey environment, only to later reveal unprecedented depth because of her genuine attachment to that homey environment. her performances are of an unsurpassed consistency, she rarely does anything wrong. i wonder if it's conceivable for any of streep's pictures to not seem diminished because of her presence... anyway, kate loves her home, and her affection for her "family life" is as endearing as her new conflict within the home is jarring. when all of this comes together, and kate starts to recognize that she can no longer function in the same capacity, and she breaks the pie dish and screams out that she is not handicapped, it is painfully sad to watch because this has not been someone prone to emotion. streep is smart enough and generous enough to recognize how much better everything works because she has felt out the dramatic validity of kate and it's really the only scene when she allows her character to go. but how refreshingly true it is to see a character who can really surprise you by displaying something that you wouldn't have thought possible. once again, streep's character has at least three dimensions... god, this sounds like a thesis itself, but as an actress, streep just has a special kind of intelligence, incredible empathy and great expressive skills. the movie itself is probably somewhat mediocre. i suppose william hurt is meant to be an unlikeable jerk, and he does pompousness very well. i think hurt is really kind of creepy, though. script is quite standard - another tribute to streep that she was as touching and believable as she was.

kate gulden, played by one of the most nominated actresses of the last decade of this century, and also one of the most talented actresses meryl streep(out of africa). she is wonderful is every part that she plays. the yale graduate is the pride and joy of the american cinema.kate's health is deteriorating and her husband, george, role well developed by brilliant actor and also oscar winner, william hurt (smoke, kiss of the spider woman) has a hard time with the deteriorating health of his one true thing, and seeks his daughter's help. the poor daughter, ellen gulden, ren√©e zellweger (jerry maguire) has way too much expected of her. no breaks! the story takes a very realistic view on the illness of a parent. in this movie the only daughter has to put her life on hold to care for the needs of others. there is always one in every family who faces that kind of responsibility. ellen is angry the beginning of the movie, but as time passes she ends up understanding her mothers' life time dedication to her family. she even asks her mom: how do you do his, every day, in and out and nobody notices it? that is what women do, a lot of what i call invisible work. moreover we clean, we fix, we mend, we stretch, we celebrate, we are the best friends, we are confidants, the mistress, outreachers, disciplinarians, sensitive. some of us, like both women in this movie, have the perfect education, are the psychological pillar for the entire family and also do all that invisible work! that is kate ellen, and many women in our society. many of us have already gone through that stage of life when our parents age and died. i have been there. they just went too young. i have given my parents my thanks, but i never understood them as well as when i had to play their roles, and had to walk in their shoes. this movie mirrors the reality of life. perhaps it is sad, but that is how life is, at times. george a professor at harvard is complicated person, who appears to think that his work is more important than everybody else, and has a very "master/servant" mentality toward the women in his life. he is not strong enough to cope. if you want to see good acting and the reality of life do not miss this movie. favorite scenes: the restaurant coming to kate, violins and all. the making of a table out of broken china. that i so symbolic! we are all broken vessels! favorite quotes: george: "it is only by going uphill, that you realize that you are really going downhill." george "you have a harvard education but where is your heart?" 

it's not surprising that the majority of higher-rated votes were submitted by females aged 45+. this is the timeframe in women's lives when they become the caretakers of aged and ill parents. i lost my mother, from complications of cancer, in june, and went through most of the same emotions portrayed by zellweger in this film. yes, it made me cry, but the tears were real, the characters were real, and the plot development extremely accurate. kudos to the entire cast and crew for a wonderful portrayal of life and death, and the promises of tomorrow.

one true thing rises above its potentially schlocky material to give us a view of a family of complex relationships and flawed, real people. it opens with rene zeleweger discussing her mother's death with the district attorney; sparing us the cheap cinematic shots of a "shocking" illness and death. from there it proceeds into a look at a family system, in which everyone plays by a set of unexamined rules, and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. william hurt as the self-important father, and meryl streep as the suzy homemaker mother are both superb; nuanced and not what they appear to be. zeleweger is seething, angry and surprised with herself. tom everett scott doesn't have much to do, but he does it well.the story is predictable, and takes at least one badly soppy turn it needn't have taken, but the performances, and the view of family as a place where anger and love are equally mixed, make it worthwhile.

what impressed me the most about "one true thing" was how up-front it was when the daughter mentions her mother's cancer at the beginning of the movie. as depressing the subject matter was, it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blindsided with the revelation about a character's fatal illness 2/3 into the movie ("love story" "terms of endearment", etc.). meryl streep, renee zellweger and william hurt give very strong performances that don't go over the edge. the characters they play seem human; they're not perfect people. (arguably, one might not say that about the "martha stewart"-type character streep plays but throughout the film, i found her character to be noble in a non-sappy way. she's dealing with her plight the best way she knows how.) "one true thing" is an observant, unsentimental family drama in which the tears at the end were well-earned.

the reason i think this movie is fabulous is that it has so many layers of emotion. from the script and the fabulous acting you can tell that there is a history behind all of the feelings that there are. you understand why the characters take certain actions and why the do not make others. you can feel sympathy and joy and love and sorrow for them all at once. you see humanity at its best and at it's worst. you can relate to the characters because although you may have never been in their exact situations before you see qualities and downfalls in them that you see in yourself. to a certain extent this movie kind of keeps you wondering but then at the end it explains itself and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you but for the characters. i will say that i have have never ever cried so much in my life nor have gotten so much out of something. i implore you to watch this movie and take it's meaning to heart. that there is only one true thing and that is... love.

this movie was a very good universal monster movie. it once again stars lon chaney as the wolfman and glenn strange as frankenstein's monster. oh yeah, that jerk john carradine is back again as dracula. i like every actor in this movie. i especially liked onslow stevens as dr. edelmann. (it's spelled with 2 n's) i thought it was a good idea to have the goodhearted doctor himself doomed like talbot was. one scene that i think is very good is the scene when dr. edelmann is in deep thought as he changes. everything that is troubling him flashes before your eyes. the good doctor is saying no while his evil side is saying yes. that's the only reason why i didn't want the dracula character eliminated completely from this movie. i thought dracula had no business in house of frankenstein. if his character was taken out you wouldn't miss him. in this film the doctor's blood is contaminated with dracula's, giving him his jekyll and hyde curse. i hate john carradine and i don't think he should have ever played dracula. i didn't mind other actors playing the frankenstein monster after the great karloff because they all did good jobs. but when they get another actor to play dracula it stops right there. john carradine thought he was so high and mighty. they offered him the role of the frankenstein monster once and he turned it down because he thought he was too highly trained. i could just picture carradine if he did play the monster arguing with the director on the set, "i don't have to take this from you, i've done shakespeare." john carradine wasn't dracula and he never will be. sorry john, bela lugosi is the one and only dracula. thank god they got bela to come back as dracula for abbott and costello meet frankenstein. don't miss this movie. it doesn't disappoint you and you will enjoy it as you did the other. this is a very good addition to the monster movies. if you're a collector, be sure not to leave this one out.

despite all of the comparisons to house of frankenstein, this movie outshines its predecessor and is one of the funnest monster movies in the universal monsters series, and sadly, the last. o.k. so it doesn't exactly stack up to something like the bride of frankenstein as one a classic to revered by fans of all movies, but with a cast of dracula, the wolf man and frankenstein's monster (what? no mummy?) you can't help but enjoy this schlock fest! and unlike house of frankenstein, the monsters in this movie interact a lot more. but this movie also offers some unique story lines for both dracula and the wolf man who both go to dr. adleman for cures of their afflictions. while the wolf man actually does find a cure, dracula injects his blood into the doctor and that's when the real fun begins! i highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies. but remember, i never said it was good, just fun.

this movie has the look and feel of having been put together in a matter of days-kind of like plan 9 from outer space. in spite of this, it's still a classic-ranking among my favorite creature features. *****possible spoilers ahead******* count dracula and larry talbot; aka wolfman, arrive at the laboratory of dr. edelman seeking a cure for their nocturnal anti-social behavior, such as killing people. in the meantime, kindly dr. edelman discovers the body of the frankenstein monster. becoming obsessed with bringing it back to life( a common character trait among scientists, mad or otherwise), he goes against his better judgement, resulting in monster mayhem and madness. one of the final universal classics of it's time (abbot and costello meet frankenstein followed 3 years later), it rates a 10 with this reviewer. onslow steven steals the show as good doctor gone bad after being infected by the blood of dracula and becoming a half- werewolf/vampire creature, coming to a tragic end. at 1 hour 7 min. it packs quite a punch. a worthy addition to my video collection.rating: ***** out of *****

i liked house of dracula much more than house of frankenstein. carradine is much more passable & his acting isn't as ridiculous & overboard as in hof. the actors deliver solid enough performances. the subplots (eg the monster, the village mobsters, the village idiot, the hunchback nurse etc ) are mixed in well, so that none becomes an odd splinter as in hof. better run than the stitched-together hof. the hunchback nurse is as likable as the hunchback in hof. the doctor is very good. as well, lon chaney adds a classy touch with his wolfman. worth watching twice. a classic universal horror with that typical 1940's, long lost flair. especially good is the doctor's performance before/after his blood had been contaminated with dracula's.

house of dracula was made towards the end of universal's horror cycle of the 1940's and i've seen this a couple of times.a mad doctor, edelman is breeding plants for a serum that cures people. count dracula arrives for a cure for his vampirism and lawrence talbot then comes to see if he can cure him from turning into a werewolf at full moon. frankenstein's monster is then discovered and edelman brings him back to life just as the villagers descend on the castle and set it on fire. talbot, now cured and one of edelman's female assistants are safe though.like a lot of movies of its kind, we have a hunchback assistant and thunderstorm to keep it moving.the cast includes universal horror regulars lon chaney jr (the wolf man), john carradine (house of frankenstein) and glenn strange as frankenstein's monster. also starring onslow stevens (them!), lionel atwill (the vampire bat) and martha o'driscoll .house of dracula is a must see for all old horror fans out there. great fun.rating: 3 stars out of 5.

the "house of dracula" really has nothing new to offer in the way of chills or thrills or new twists on an already tired storyline. this film was made as a hasty sequel to the fairly better made "house of frankenstein" from a year earlier. in "house of dracula" you can see the factory like production values of 1945 taking their toll on an otherwise potentially scary movie. stock footage from previous films in the series and then the ending from "ghost of frankenstein" used as the ending here just makes for an "el cheepo" flick. therein lies the shame of the studio and the producer considering that they had top notch talent and merely wasted everybody's time and effort on a quick money return scheme. but that seems to have been the trend all throughout hollywood at the end of wwii. this is what brought on some of those mindless scifi pics of the 1950's with all their closeups of harmless lizards in order to make them appear as dinosaurs. the days of james whale and val lewton, to mention two, were over as far as creating real mood and atmosphere in this genre. keep in mind also that the makeup genius, jack pierce, who actually did medical research in order to create all of our favorites, was summarily fired right after this particular film was released. a lesser capable makeup man by the name of bud westmore was then hired as the head of this department at universal, soon to be universal-international. not to denigrate mr. westmore's ability but horror films were just not his forte. ok, to watch or not to watch. watch this film but only as part of the chronological order of the frankenstein series and you'll see how this all ended up as comic fodder for abbott & costello.

the last of the sequels,not counting abbott and costello meet frankenstein which was more or less a spoof.this time count dracula (john carridine)takes center stage seeking a cure for his vampirism from a kindly doc(onslow stevens).well good ole larry talbot(lon chaney jr)shows up also seeking a cure.the good doc succeeds in curing larry's werewolfism,but dracula tricks the doc and ends up contaminating his blood and makes the good doc a crazed lunatic.oh and all this time big franky(glenn strange)lies on a table awaiting his electricity fix so he can wreak some havoc.this was kind of a short movie,around 70 minutes and some change,but the action is there,and the great actors are there as well.lionel atwill turns up as a police inspector,heres some trivia,lionel atwill appeared in son of frankenstein,ghost of frankenstein,frankenstein meets the wolf-man,and house of frankenstein. and then this one.if there was another in the series they may have added the creature from the black lagoon to the line up,i'm giving house of dracula 8 out of 10.

dracula (john carradine) visits dr. edelman (onslow stevens) who believes everything can be cured by science. he wants edelamn to cure his vampirism--edelman agrees. then lawrence talbot (lon chaney jr.) pops up looking for a cure for his turning into a werewolf. thr frankenstein monster is discovered too but doesn't really do anything.very ambitious plot for a universal horror film from the 1940s. trying to cure the monsters by science is actually an interesting idea. also this movie has beautiful sets (love the castle to doctor lives in), tons of atmosphere, is very well-directed (great use of shadows) and has pretty good special effects.the acting is all good except for carradine--he tries but i could never accept him as dracula. also lionel atwill pops in playing (as always) the chief of police. this is pretty much forgotten and derided as a stupid film but i think it's very good. it's also to last time the universal monsters were done seriously--the next film was in 1948 in "abbott & costello meet frankenstein". it's a great film but the accent is more on comedy.the only real flaw here is there's a lot of plot for 67 minutes and some gaps in logic: why does dracula try to bite lovely miliza (martha o'driscoll) when he's being cured? and why (and how) does the doctor get frankenstin into his castle? still these are small complaints. recommended.

even a bad julie andrews musical is worth watching and this isn't bad! in fact it's quite entertaining. actually it's a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a star's personae.to break julie's "goody two shoes mold" she plays a german spy/english musical hall actress. she subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie s.o.b. and play a drag queen in victor victoria and other not so goody girls usually under hubby blake edward's direction.the movie is admittedly problematic it is hard to feel for her character because she's a german spy. we want to love julie but she's on the wrong side of the law. probably this is why this movie flopped. julie as a german spy? our mary poppins? our maria van trapp suddenly a german spy?the romance seems to happen overnight and come from nowhere. but never mind, it's a musical and it has jullie. oh and did i mention hunky rock hudson is in it too?julie gives a glowing wonderful performance that any musical comedy buff should not miss. great ww 1 songs and nice tunes by mancini.yes the film has plot holes and at times doesn't seem logical. for example, why is julie and her uncle suddenly pursued by the germans when a minute ago she was spying for them. but on another note, who cares? the musical numbers are fun and exciting. the costumes and scenery extraordinarily lavish. the cinematography quite on the mark.it has the annoying idiot detectives that blake edwards puts in all his movies. (yawn)but it has julie- trying desperately to change her image. (you can imagine dinner with blake and julie - julie: "blake we need to change my image." blake: "i will make you a german spy, then we will take your clothes off in another movie and then play a transvestite in a another movie. they won't recognize you. it will be the death of maria von trapp"fascinating study on changing an image. wonderful julie. a must see for musical comedy buffs. much more entertaining than star!

yes!! they finally got it down to perfection. what a great idea, a refreshing exploitation epic for generation-x, whether they know it or not. after disasters like sgt. kabukiman nypd, and getting screwed by blockbuster, our hero, lloyd kaufman just decided to go for it, stop catering to distributors, and let troma be all the troma it can be. lloyd would make this one the most unapologetic, outlandish and downright hilarious troma movie yet. this time, lloyd takes shakespeare's love story, turns it inside out, tromatizes it, and adds that long, lost, entertainment value it was always lacking. entertainment value, such as lemmy kilmister (the narrator), debbie rochon (the cook), joe fleishaker (the fat guy), and of course, brutal mutilations and toilet humor. tromeo and juliet is the definitive edition of a rather lackluster story, and the crown jewel of the troma universe.years ago, in tromaville, n.j. business partners, monty que and cap capulet start a film company called silky films, which would produce supposedly tasteful, soft core films. monty considers cap his friend, but cap is out to screw the poor sucker out of his share of the company. on paper, and in books, it appears that monty gave away his life's work for free. fast forward to mid-90's manhattan, we have two families who are extremely displeased with one another, it's to the point that they're just looking for a reason to take a limb, or preferably, a life. monty has a son, tromeo, nephew, benny, they, with their friend, murray martini, who's just a little too excited about all the carnage, wage war on the incestuous capulets, except monty, he's too drunk to care. like in the original, there is a confusing situation, leading to tromeo falling for cap's daughter, who he has never met, or never even knew about. unfortunately, cap is a sadistic pervert, who, not unlike tromeo's dad, has a thing for the bottle, and this would of course, lead to daddy's little chenshaw melon being physically, and emotionally abused, and molested, and kept in a plexiglas cage, off and on, depending on how foul of a mood cap is in. cap is also forcing his vegetarian daughter to marry london arbuckle, a billionaire butcher, who, would make just about anyone uneasy, with or without the raisin loaf. with all these inconveniences, the young lovers feel that eloping would be the best decision, but how will this effect the big feud? it might, or might not, go a little something like the original, but figuring out how this one ends up is just simply not going to happen, you'll never see it coming."the one with leo" is downright sleep-inducing compared to tromeo & juliet, but if watered-down, over-directed, big-budget, hollywood, garbage is what you've been programmed to go for, then by all means, go for it, but if you're in the mood for something a little more colorful, something that really packs a punch, and doesn't follow the "normal" movie pattern, and if you happen to have a rather abnormal sense of humor, then you just might not hate this movie. tromeo and juliet gives the finger to all that is mainstream. full-blast exploitation with as much mean-spirited humor as anything from a young john waters. along with some badass acting, tromeo and juliet flaunts a thunderous score which includes the legendary motorhead, and not to mention, much input from james gunn, that really brought this one together. for more awesomeness from james gunn, check out lollilove, and for more excellence from lloyd kaufman, check out his next vision, terror firmer. tromeo and juliet is jaw-droppingly priceless exploitation for the 90's brought to us by the one, and only, king of the b-movies. thank's, lloyd. 10/10

this movie is truly unique. it really captures the spirit of the play, but makes it entertaining to the modern generation. the romance between tromeo and juliet was believable, and erotic, not pulled off by many adaptations. it is also so funny i was almost crying with laughter.like with most troma its in your face, taboo subjects, gore and sex, and yet add in some really good acting and a shakespeare plot. you really have to see this movie to believe it!there are some hillarious jokes in the credits (best credits i've seen since hot shots) loads of troma in jokes as well as general satire and shakespeare refs. and lemmy from the house of motorhead narrates. i lent this movie to a friend and had an almost impossible job of getting it back. troma at its best, this film really is a gem, and goes in my top 5 favourite movies of all time. though its not the sort of film you'd watch with your mum, and might offend some people. for anybody bored with run of the mill cinema, with a wacky sense of humour you must see this film.

a very bizarre bringing to the screen of william shakespeare's tragic love story.the que family and the capulet family have a long running hatred of one another which often results in violence. the hatred has something to do with a film company and the fact that everyone is pretty much crazy. in the middle of all of this insanity are tromeo and juliet, literature's most famous "star crossed" lovers that fall for each other at first sight and problems arise when they realize whose family the other belongs to.the film follows the basic plot of the original play remarkably well and key scenes even use the original, or close to original, lines. but the infamous troma bizarreness pervades the film from beginning to end. that makes for a movie that is definitely not for all tastes, but it is nonetheless pretty inventive. tyrone (tybalt in shakespeare) has a particularly funny death scene. 7/10many differently edited and rated versions exist. each contains violence, profanity, drug use, and sex, all with a big dose of bizarreness.

what often gets overlooked in agatha christie's stories is her progressive, anti-conservative attitude on a number of issues - from the role of women to the effects of tradition to people's belief in the supernatural. in "nemesis", you can spot a lot of those subtexts - but you can also find a good old-fashioned intriguing mystery that keeps you in the dark for most of its length. also lifting "nemesis" above other series entries ("they do it with mirrors", "4:50 from paddington", etc.), is the fact that in the crucial moments before and after the revelation of the killer you can actually feel the suspense. and finally, jane booker is welcome to guard my body any time.

when i unsuspectedly rented a thousand acres, i thought i was in for an entertaining king lear story and of course michelle pfeiffer was in it, so what could go wrong?very quickly, however, i realized that this story was about a thousand other things besides just acres. i started crying and couldn't stop until long after the movie ended. thank you jane, laura and jocelyn, for bringing us such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie! thank you cast, for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and gentleness!i recognized the angry sister; the runaway sister and the sister in denial. i recognized the abusive husband and why he was there and then the father, oh oh the father... all superbly played. i also recognized myself and this movie was an eye-opener, a relief, a chance to face my own truth and finally doing something about it. i truly hope a thousand acres has had the same effect on some others out there.since i didn't understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land -they weren't fighting each other at all- i watched it a second time. then i was able to see that if one hadn't lived a similar story, one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all. that is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors for instance.but yet another reason why this movie is so perfect!i don't give a rat's ass (pardon my french) about to what extend the king lear story is followed. all i know is that i can honestly say: this movie has changed my life.keep up the good work guys, you can and do make a difference.

yes, i am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill! julie andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the "whistling in the dark" production number. the sedate-to-outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that rock hudson has been seeing a dancing/call girl is eye-popping and will certainly make you giggle.i only wish that this film could be found in video or dvd as i would surely purchase it in a heartbeat for my home library!

this movie is excellent in how it portrays the reality of sexual abuse. the daughters perfectly express their conflicting emotions of affection and betrayal. the on-location scenery is absorbingly authentic, and the soundtrack is unobtrusive yet moving. this film is a graduate-level course in a reality that's too little recognized in american society. personally, i'm freaked out by the names of the characters -- lange's character is ginny cook smith -- my name is connie cook smith, and my mom is genny cook. the youngest daughter is caroline cook, which is my sister's name, and the father is larry cook, my cousin's name.but sex abuse was not in our immediate family.

having watched this film years ago, it never faded from my memory. i always thought this was the finest performance by michelle pfeiffer that i've seen. but, i am astounded by the number of negative reviews that this film has received. after seeing it once more today, i still think it is powerful, moving and couldn't care less if it is "based loosely on king lear".i now realize that this is the greatest performance by jessica lange that i've ever seen - and she has had accolades for much shallower efforts.a thousand acres is complex, human, vibrant and immensely moving, but surely doesn't present either of the primary female leads with any touch of glamour or "sexiness". i don't think this is well received in these times.perhaps one reason for this film's underwhelming response lies in the fact that the writer (jane smiley(, screenplay (laura jones), and director (jocelhyn moorehouse) are all women. i know that, in my younger days, i wouldn't have read a book written by a woman. i didn't focus on this fact until years later.if you haven't seen this movie or gave it a chance in the past, try watching it anew. maybe you are ready for it.

i liked this movie a lot, but the feeling that i most came away with was the memory of how much i¬¥d enjoyed the novel. the film features two of the best actresses working today--jessica lange, who is great here, and the divine jennifer jason leigh, who does the best she can with the thinly-drawn character she is given--as well as a surprisingly excellent michelle pfeiffer and a steady jason robards. the adaptation is basically faithful to the book, at least as faithful as it can be in an hour and forty minutes. the film doesn¬¥t really dazzle, except for certain scenes between lange and pfeiffer, but it does a thoroughly competent job of visualizing this wonderfully tragic story. as far as movies adapted from novels go, this was definitely among the better ones. if nothing else, it has sent me back to my bookshelves to rediscover favorite passages from jane smiley¬¥s excellent novel, and back to king lear to brush up on the minor characters in order to see just how deep the parallels go. worth your time as a film, definitely, and hopefully enough to make you remember that reading great literature is a joy as well.

i was very moved by the gentle power of this movie and by the mood it created. i think it should have gotten a great deal more credit than it did. i agree that michelle pfeiffer should have been nominated, but i think all the performances were outstanding, and that michelle pfeiffer and jessica lange portrayed the deep affinity and conflicts of sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity. although i didn't read the book, i found the modern concept of king lear very cool. i certainly will never look at the play quite the same way again!

i think several others have already commented on this film, but i liked it so well i wanted to just say how good a film this is. i gave it a rating of 9 out of 10. it did not get a 10 because it is very slow starting. i almost quit on it, but am glad i didn't. hang in there, it is well worth the wait.this is primarily a film about relationships: deceit, trust, and betrayal.michelle pfeiffer, jessica lange and jason robards all do bang up jobs in this movie.set in midwest farm country, jason robards character is a farmer whose grandfather first settled there. jason's character is getting older and he decides to set up a trust dividing the thousand acres of farmland among his three adult daughters. that's when the plot of this film really beginning cooking.sisters turn against each other due to misunderstandings rather than greed over the land. they also make some discoveries about each other's childhoods, and their present day marriages, including an adulterous affair, while the father becomes increasingly abusive, demanding and paranoid--until the terrible truth about everyone finally comes boiling out.this film really reached me emotionally, i got angry right along with some of the characters, and sad with them. i could feel their pain due to the excellent performances that were given.the ending was a bit of a surprise to me, but in keeping with the growth of the characters.

at the beginning it was almost a shock to see norma shearer without her makeup. then she glamorizes herself and becomes the life of the party.anyway, she divorces her husband, makes herself over and gets on with her life; or so she thinks. somewhat keeps you guessing if they'll get back together.

norma had spent most of the 20s playing beautiful ingenues but her first talkie cast her as a brassy showgirl in "the trial of mary dugan" and she came through with flying colours. from then on her sweet and lovely ingenues were cast aside and she sizzled in parts that cast her as sophisticated women of the world or society girls out for thrills. "let us be gay" was made before but released after "the divorc√©e" and was an unusual twist on the upper crust dramas that shearer made her own.norma first appears without make-up as frumpish kitty brown, who's main purpose in life is to pander to her very unappreciative husband bob (rod la rocque). she is hurrying to get him off to his golf game - but in reality he is going to see his mistress. when helen, the mistress, comes to the house for a showdown, kitty faces the situation with civility but behind closed doors she is a mass of emotions and bob leaves for good.three years later mrs. courtland brown (kitty) comes to stay as a house guest of the eccentric mrs. bouccicoult ("bouccy")(marie dressler). kitty is now a knockout and "bouccy" has a job for her. she wants kitty to romance a house guest, who in his turn is romancing her grand-daughter diane (beautiful sally eilers). shock!! horror!! - the man is none other than bob, her ex husband!!! kitty carries off the meeting with sophistication and witty repartee - "there seems to be something strangely familiar about that man"!!! - and no one is the wiser.the film then settles down into one of those early very "talkie", boring "drawing room" comedies. kitty casts a spell over all the men and bob is desperate to start again. the women have all the strong roles in this film - men are just puppets. raymond hackett seems to be in the film as an extra butler - "pass me a cushion", "get me a drink", "move this chair" instead of diane's harassed fianc√©. norma shearer is of course the whole show, marie dressler adds "bouccy" to her list of eccentric portrayals and sally eilers is a real eyeful as the gorgeous diane.

the film begins with a dowdy housewife (norma shearer) finding out that her husband (rod la rocque) had been cheating on her. three years pass and apparently they'd been divorced during these years due to the infidelity. oddly, during this time, la rocque did not see shearer or his two kids as shearer took them to paris.marie dressler is a rich society lady and she has invited a new and improved norma to come to her house for the weekend--ostensibly to help marie break up a budding romance between her daughter and la rocque! apparently, norma is now a super-vamp and with her magical sex appeal, she can break up the romance--and no one seems to realize that she and la rocque were married. several others are there for the weekend and immediately norma is a hit with her gay, carefree sexy ways--and almost all the men (including la rocque) are captivated by her. neither tells anyone that they were married but it's obvious that her ex- wants the new and improved norma back! this film is a sophisticated comedy of manners among the upper-crust--similar in some ways to jean renoir's the rules of the game. oddly, despite the severity of the depression, such films about pretty rich folks were pretty popular though many today will doubtless find them a bit too droll in spots. however, fortunately, in let us be gay, there are plenty of cute and funny moments (particularly towards the end when marie dressler shows her true colors). while not a great film, it certainly is a good one and more than just another time-passer. my only real regret is that i didn't love the very end. you'll just have to see it for yourself--perhaps you'll agree about the ending, perhaps you won't, but i'm pretty sure you will enjoy this clever film.

dutiful wife norma shearer (as katherine "kitty" brown) waits on husband rod la rocque (as bob brown) hand and foot. while making him breakfast in bed, and helping him dress for a sunday golf outing, ms. shearer suggests joining mr. la rocque for the day, noting how infrequently the two see each other. but, la rocque puts her off, saying her presence adversely affects his game. then, unexpectedly, shearer meets the real reason for her husband's frequent absences¬Ö his pretty blonde mistress!three years later, shearer is a glamorous and flirty divorc√©e. while summering in paris, she has struck up a friendship with wealthy, older socialite marie dressler (as as mrs. "boucci" bouccicault). ms. dressler invites shearer to her long island home, to socialize with some friends, and ask a favor. dressler is worried about her granddaughter's relationship with a suave, worldly man. she wants young sally eilers (as dionne) to marry raymond hackett (as bruce), instead. aware of shearer's flirtatious conquests, dressler asks her to lure the undesirable man away from ms. eilers. shearer is stunned to discover the man is la rocque, her ex-husband.shearer and dressler make this a cute, entertaining play. they are in top form, giving guaranteed-to-be-popular performances, with enthusiasm and professionalism. the story is silly and predictable; yet, in a way which helps the humorous situation. and, the ending is quite clever. in fact, the comic "let us be gay" may have aged better than shearer's larger-produced, and more serious, "the divorc√©e", which was released around the same time. the cast uniformly fine. la rocque is better than his film with lilian gish; but, his role is not at all endearing. gilbert emery (as towney) and tyrell davis (as wallace) are funny supporting suitors.those not familiar with norma shearer may not realize it is she who appears as the dowdy wife in the opening scenes. this is shearer as "kitty" before her make-over. watch the close-ups of shearer with light, natural make-up, for a good look at an intriguingly beautiful woman.******* let us be gay (1930) robert z. leonard ~ norma shearer, marie dressler, rod la rocque

when a dowdy wife (shearer) loses her husband, she decides to completely make herself over to win him back. not "politically correct" by today's standards, but still fun to watch, especially the scenes with marie dressler and hedda hopper.

a rich old lady calls on a flirtatious divorc√©e to woo a lothario away from her silly soon-to-be-married granddaughter.let us be gay is an interesting little domestic comedy which features some tart dialogue (courtesy of celebrated screenwriter frances marion) & good performances. while perhaps a bit mawkish at times, this can probably be blamed on the difficulties with early sound technology which tended to limit action & movement.norma shearer can be credited with appearing in this minor film, rather than using her undoubted clout as irving thalberg's spouse to insist upon only a-grade pictures. she is especially effective in her first few scenes, where dowdy flat makeup makes her almost unrecognizable. her extreme transmogrification from goose to swan could only happen in hollywood, but it's scarcely profitable to spend much time worrying about that.rod larocque doesn't come off too well as shearer's adulterous husband. quite popular during silent days, the talkies were not especially kind to him and his career would suffer. here his role is not in the least sympathetic and one has to wonder what masochistic impulse moves women to desire the cad so much.magnificent marie dressler is on hand as an eccentric long island dowager. as a great friend of frances marion, one can easily imagine that the part was written expressly for her. full of cranks & crotchets, she is very humorous. however, the tremendous warmth & essential goodness which would very shortly make her hollywood's biggest star are largely missing.among the supporting cast, hedda hopper scores as a slinky society serpent, as does wilfred noy playing a comic butler. movie mavens will spot little dickie moore as shearer's young son & elderly mary gordon as her housekeeper, both uncredited.

norma shearer dazzles as she is transformed from a frump, addle-brained house-wife to an alluring potential divorcee. most 1930 films have a creaky edge to them -- the camera work is pretty sluggish at times -- but we must forgive these all-talking pleasures for their thump-a-long "qualities". as a guest of the eccentric globe-trotting marie dressler -- shearer mixes with an odd assortment of lovelorn types, including her long-lost husband. the dialogue is fun, oft-times clever and the performances on cue. shearer and dressler shine the most. shearer even shows off her piano expertise in a musical brevity. her strange, yet appealing posturing and "affair with the camera" are evident throughout -- and she hits every emotional note, genuinely and on target. for its time . . .a good show.

the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved. i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. i love all six of the stooges (curly, shemp, moe, larry, joe, and curly joe)! all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team! one of the most hilarious three stooges shorts is men in black. in this short are bud jamison, jeanie roberts, phyllis crane, dell henderson, 'little billy' rhodes, billy gilbert, and ruth hiatt the acting by these actors are good especially by jamison and roberts. there are many funny scenes here that i think most three stooges fans will love! in my opinion this one of the most different three stooges shorts. i recommend this one to all!

i found this one to be more chaotic than the average stooges short (as strange as that may sound). there were several funny bits, especially the running gags ("calling dr. howard, dr. fine, dr. howard!", the glass door breaking, the stooges running into the supply room and coming back out with... well, you know), but also quite of bit of it was taken up with things that just didn't make any sense to me. i have to assume that these were generally take-offs of scenes from the film "men in white", but since i don't know much about that movie i can't say for sure. maybe if someone could explain these i'd appreciate this short more.

everyone's favorite trio of bumbling imbeciles run amok in a hospital in this incredibly raucous and often hysterically funny romp. these guys are without a doubt the single most incompetent bunch of doctors to ever fumble their way across the screen. comic highlights include the stooges constantly breaking a glass pane in a door, their encounter with a deranged patient who claims that rats used to come out of the buttonhole of his shirt, the stooges riding through the hallways on a giant bicycle, a huge horse, and miniature race cars, and our sublimely stupid threesome accidentally leaving instruments inside a hapless patient's abdomen after they finish operating on the poor fellow. director ray mccarey relates the frantic comic shenanigans at an appropriately nonstop hectic pace and stages the broad slapstick gags with considerable gusto. moe howard, larry fine, and curly howard are all in peak loopy form, with sterling support from dell henderson as long-suffering hospital supervisor dr. graves, squeaky-voiced jeanie roberts as a hiccuping nurse (the scene where the stooges do an absurd impromptu group singalong with this gal is absolutely sidesplitting!), ruth hiatt as a whispering nurse, billy gilbert as the ranting crazy patient, and "little billy" rhodes as a feisty tiny patient. the spirited lunacy never lets up for a minute, thereby making this beautifully berserk baby one of the stooges' best-ever outings.

this is an early one from the boys, but some people may not be satisfied with this one like all the others. i found it to be different somehow than the your average stooge slapstick. it was more funny for it's jokes rather than the poke in the eye or slap. watch for a hilarious part when larry grabs the stethoscope from moe and sings into it. moe gives him a good smack. that part made me crack up for a good ten minutes. another hit for the stooges.

this is one of the stooges best shorts. it was the only one of their shorts to be nominated for an oscar. in this short the stooges play doctors, who cause some trouble as usual. this short has non-stop sight-gags, puns, and jokes. the part at the end, where the stooges are breaking apart the machine. this is definitely a classic. i would highly recommend this three stooges short.

though not a huge fan, i am a three stooges purist. i believe that their best work, by far, was with curly as the third stooge and their earliest films are generally their best. that's because after a while, they began remaking their films and the gags started to get stale. here, in 1934, they were still rather fresh (in more ways than one) and funny.here they boys play very improbably roles--respected doctors in a hospital! the three run amok acting silly, hitting each other and scaring the pants off anyone who expects to get better. the non-stop energy and freshness make this one a must-see for fans.by the way, although i liked this film, i strongly recommend you try to find a much lesser known short from tiny educational pictures. nifty nurses is much like men in black but manages to be funnier and is about the best hospital comedy of the era--better even than laurel & hardy's county hospital.

this is the third three stooges short that the team ever made, and like a lot of their early ones, this is absolutely and totally hysterical! now owning it on dvd as part of the three stooges collection vol. 1, whenever i feel like it, i watch this! in this short film, moe, larry, and curly play these three doctors in a hospital who are trying to help out everyone, but boy, they end up making a mess out of everything!this short is another one of my all time favorite three stooges shorts, i also am a very huge fan of slapstick comedy, and the three stooges are the kings of slapstick! when i heard that it got nominated for the academy award for best short film, i really became curious about this, when i heard that it had lost, i was very disappointed about it! this short is one of the three stooges funniest by far, i extremely recommend that you see this hysterical riot! 10/10

directed by the younger brother of great director leo mccarey this is a pretty good short from the three stooges, nominated for an academy award. here the stooges are doctors named doctor howard, doctor fine and doctor howard. they are not the brightest doctors but they get the benefit of the doubt as long as they handle for duty and humanity.i liked this short. it is not one of their best but some moments are hilarious though. one joke that is repeated more than once works every time. the part where they must operate the hospital's boss is terrific. to say more would spoil some of the jokes, so you must see it for yourself. just another fine short from the three stooges.

this is one particular stooge short that actually uses satire in conjunction with slapstick, a rarity. as mentioned, the title and concept for this short was "borrowed" from a feature film from the same year with clark gable called "men in white". it's basically about the trials and tribulations of interns and their sacred cause for "duty and humanity". i saw this recently and almost treated it like the stooge version because it does take itself a little too seriously. in any case, "men in black" is so well written, directed and not to mention original, it didn't borrow a thing from chaplin or any of the others, that the motion picture academy nominated it for an award as the best short comedy of 1934. some stinky short called "la cucaracha" outdid it though and stole the award. some producer's brother in law must have been on the academy's voting board. "men in black" pokes fun at the whole concept of the medical profession much in the same way that the marx bros. always did at this time. may not be a fair comparison but i can see the marx bros. in this short. in fact in their feature "a day at the races", there is a scene where there's "medical things" going on and they cause anarchy as usual. my guess that this particular short was judged along those lines and hence why it was nominated in the first place. try this in fact: watch this short first and then watch "duck soup" or "day at the races" with the marxes and then see if there isn't the same great quality of comedy.

the columbia pictures short subject unit never had any delusions about producing any 'art' films. they wanted to give the film exhibitors just a little more for their money, when booking a columbia picture into their theatres. this would go double for the 3 stooges films.men in black (1934) came about as close as any of their comedy shorts in that it received an oscar nomination for best short subject, comedy. though it did not win, it well could have. it was good enough and even those who do not number themselves among stooge-files, still seem to be won over by the clarion cry of ".......calling dr. howard, dr. fine, dr. howard!" this was the second entry in the long series of comedy shorts made by the stooges for producer jules white, head of columbia's short subjects department. only woman haters, described in its credits as a 'musical novelty' preceded it at harry cohen's poverty row sweatshop.the film starts off in the office of dr. graves, the head of the hospital. he is receiving new interns and in addressing the group, he relates that three of them are passed along from medical conditionally as they had remained there so long. but, the good doctor states that he will not reveal their identities as long as they pledge their all "......for duty and humanity!" the stooges run up front pledging "...for duty and humanity!", and run out of office, breaking window glass in door. the game was on.the stooges took off and did not stop for the remainder of the 2 reels. every type of gag was in evidence. from broad sennett-like sight gags, to puns, to dialect humor, to 'theatre of the absurd' and a surrealistic running gag involving a public address system, which seemingly takes on a life of its own and having the true culprit, a radio tube get shot to a "........he got me!" (it all plays out quite well, honest!) the sets used were very authentic looking and were no doubt borrowed from columbia features being made around the same time. there are plenty of wheel chairs, surgical cotts, stethascopes, surcical scalpels, etc., in evidence to maintain the illusion of a hospital.a true strength of men in black is the high number of usually nameless players, whom we all recognize by face. along with them, the film boasts of a great number of veteran comedy actors, who always turn in fine performances, often stealing the scene. the people with names like billy gilbert, hank mann and bud jamison shine in even small parts.and lastly we have the maestro, the conductor-director raymond mccarey, kid brother to leo mccarey who showed off his abilities in getting this little film 'in the can'. he skillfully kept it all moving, acting as a traffic cop at times, what with all the actors, extras and behind the scenes crew moving and outside of each other's way. and that doesn't count the giant 3 man tandem bicycle, the sway backed horse and miniature race cars, not to mention the 'giant, green canaries!'

this belongs in their top tier, although there were others, such as micro-phonies and punch drunks, that were more deserving of oscar nominations than this one. but if nothing else, the recurring loudspeaker announcement, "dr. howard, dr. fine, dr. howard," followed by curly's "woo woo woo woo," makes this a classic on two levels. first, it symbolizes all that the stooges represent; my daughter loves to repeat the announcement when she is in the middle of doing something silly. second, the absurdity of these three as physicians in a hospital; i imagine the terror i would feel if i were a real patient in a real hospital and heard this announcement over the loudspeaker. throughout this short, you hear that announcement and you know that something horrible is about to happen, and the loudspeaker voice stays with you for months afterward.

this film is brilliant it has cute little dolphins in it and its a great storyline and it has elijah wood in it which makes it a great film too. his acting skills are very good and if you want a good soft family film. this is the one to watch.

universal studios version of "flipper" (1996) is a great heartwarming film for the entire family with good values and sentimentality. it is the story of sandy ricks, a teenager from chicago who reluctantly spends his vacation with his uncle porter ricks in the bahamas. this ultimately changes the teenagers life and he grows up in the process. he learns to appreciate nature and to have a respect for the environment. i grew up in the 1960's and the nbc television show "flipper" was my favorite childhood show. elijah wood is perfectly cast as a 1990's sandy ricks and gives an excellent performance. as much as i liked the nbc television show and mgm theatrical feature films with luke halpin as sandy in the 1960's i liked this feature the best! i feel elijah wood is the best sandy ricks. with respect to luke halpin i feel elijah wood has more of a range of acting talent and emotes more as an actor which makes his performance excellent and more believable. i think elijah wood is the best young actor working today in films. director alan shapiro also wrote the screenplay and has done an excellent job as both writer and director of this film. paul hogan gives a comical and likable performance as sandy's uncle porter ricks. mr. hogan's performance perfectly offsets elijah's role as sandy. i am a big fan of underwater films. this film was beautifully shot in the bahamas like "thunderball" (1965 ua) was. the director of photography was bill butler a.s.c. who lensed the film "jaws" in 1975. mr. butler is a very talented cinematographer. the underwater director of photography was pete romano. he did a superb job with the underwater cinematography. i enjoyed the film score by joel mcneely. this good film score featured crosby, stills and nash among other talented artists. this motion picture was shot in panavision like "thunderball" in the aspect ratio of 2.35:1 if possible try to see this film in a scope version as originally framed and visioned by alan shapiro and bill butler. another very nice thing is that mr. shapiro gave the "original" sandy ricks (luke halpin) a small part in this remake. he portrayed bounty fisherman #3 in this film. this was a very kind gesture on mr. shapiro's part! as you can tell i am a real true fan of this film. sadly this beautiful film was met with harsh words by the majority of movie critics. i originally saw this movie on my birthday, may 31st of 1996 in a movie theater. it meant a lot to me. i have it on numerous video versions. the vhs versions are in "pan and scan". the laserdisc version is "letterboxed" 2.35:1! i even have a vcd in 2.35:1 from hong kong which is "letterboxed". but my most prized possession is an "original" 16mm theatrical feature print which i will treasure for the rest of my life! thank you mr. shapiro, elijah wood, paul hogan and everyone involved for making this a memorable movie for me to enjoy!p.s. i must add that the quality of the universal dvd is superb! it is the best dvd as far as quality i have ever seen. the color and resolution is spectacular. the soundtrack is great. i think universal must have used the same transfer for the dvd that they did for the laserdisc version. the 35mm scope print is "mint" and alan's film really has a wonderful look to it. a great tribute to a wonderful film! the dvd's resolution is even superior to the laserdisc quality! it's just spectacular! thank you universal home video for the great quality control and transfer. many thank's for doing a superb job on this wonderful family film. also many thank's to you alan for all your extreme kindness to me!!! it's a real honor to know you!!! (review revised/updated june 27, 2005)

yes, it's "flipper". but writer/director alan shapiro has put together a gem of a version. spectacular above and underwater photography from "jaws" veteran bill butler and haunting music by joel mcneely and crosby, stills & nash make this truly memorable family entertainment. shapiro, whose last film was improbably "the crush", shows himself once again to be an extremely talented -- and versatile -- filmmaker. rent it!

low budget, mostly no name actors. . . this is what a campy horror flick is supposed to be all about. these are the types of movies that kept me on the edge of my seat as a kid staying up too late to watch cable. if you liked the 80's horror scene this is the movie for you.

this movie was talked about in fangoria where i heard about this, it was interesting to me mostly becuase it was direct-to-video and i recognized two of the stars on the cover, james marsden of disturbing behavior and christine taylor from the craft. and to my surprise on valentine's day when i was searching through the horror aisle to find it on the shelf! i immediately had to grab it. me and my brother and our girlfriends watched it and to my surprise it was pretty good, the tales were interesting and for once they were actually scary, unlike a lot of other horror movies being made recently. some of the plot i do not understand but once i watch it again i bet i'll get it. and to even more of my surprise there were other stars i recognized including one of the girls from the tv show my so-called life and jacinda from the real world, i'm not sure why this movie was only direct-to-video, with a little advertising this movie could have at least made up for how much money was spent on making it. the only problem i have is that since it wasn't released in theatres i guess i'll never be able to view it in widescreen. you should definitely take a chance and rent this one.

i loved this movie! i'm shocked and disappointed that it never made it to the theaters. every story was better than the last..much better than the much hyped "scream" series and "i know what you did last summer"and way better than the terrible "urban legend". i'd recommend this film to every horror fan.

it may not have had the big budgets, celebrities or endorsements of scream, urban legend or i know what you did last summer, but campfire tales had one thing these three movies lacked: true horror.this film tackled the subject of urban legends a year before the aptly titled and less than enthralling urban legend did. it was intriguing, masterfully scripted and logical in a way i know what you did last summer could only dream of. finally, it held its focus and finished with a flurry while scream fizzled and died.what's most exciting about the film is the variety of horror that the writers and directors achieved. the overarching story of teenagers around a campfire was classic dread at the unknown (but certainly expected) doom that awaited them in the forest, but the tales themselves are where the movie really shined.the opening sequence is pure, fast-paced urban myth. it's based on a popular legend, and the director plays on this with the style and pace of the action, making it more enthralling because we know what's going to happen.the first campfire tale is a straight-forward thriller. based on another popular myth, we don't actually realize this until the end, both because it blends so well into the story and because the action keeps our attention. being the thriller of the trilogy, this one plays off our fear of the unknown and includes several well-done "jump" sequences that don't feel nearly as cheap or contrite as those in movies like scream or urban legend.the second tale is more suspense. this time, though the characters still don't know what's going on, we do, and this provides the horror. no need for cheap thrills here.the final tale contains elements of the supernatural and uses a creepy/trippy atmosphere to scare the viewer. because we can relate so easily to the characters and their situation, our fear comes from their intensity and what they can't explain. this is the true ghost story of the trio.i didn't expect to enjoy campfire tales when i rented it. i figured that if i didn't like its more acclaimed, bigger-budget counterparts, how could i like it?the truth is, though, this film succeeds where the others fell far short of the mark.

this movie is so awesome! i loved it, it was really scary. i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there. it probably helped that i watched it at midnight. if you want a real scare rent this one! 10/10

i switched this on (from cable) on a whim and was treated to quite a surprise...although very predictable this film turned out to be quite enjoyable...no big stars but well-directed and just plain fun. with all the over-hyped crap that is out there it is very nice to get an unexpected surprise now and then... and this little film fits the bill nicely. 9/10

i cannot believe i enjoyed this as much as i did. the anthology stories were better than par, but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me. alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself "where i have i seen them before?" forget the running time listed on new line's tape, this ain't no 103 minutes, according to my vcr timer and imdb. space maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8.

remarkably well done, but under-recognized because of limited distribution. has big-studio feel, understands the horror genre, speeds along with clever plot twists and never stumbles. could have been a college cult classic, if it had ever gotten the opportunity.

this movie is definently a horror movie and if you do not get scared than you must not be watching this movie. it works on the old techniques but throws something new into the mix. this movie grips and runs and hides within your mind. the movie has a point to it unlike other horror movies. watch it for a thrill and shock to your system.

caught this flick as one of a five-for-$5 deal from a local video store, and it was a most pleasant surprise. it's a collection of four interrelated tales built around four kids who've just had a car wreck and are waiting for someone to pick them up. they tell each other these stories to kill time, and are occasionally startled by flashing lights and funny noises which all come together in an o. henry-esque ending that left me gleeful. a real discovery. blood (and plenty of it), breasts and beasts round it all out rather nicely...jacinda barrett is worth the price of admission alone. this one is a keeper--jim bob says check it out.oddly enough, "pumpkinhead" was one of our five choices too, and imdb recommends that for anyone who likes "campfire tales". i'll followup as soon as i get a chance to sit down and watch that one. joyeux samhain!

good (not great) little horror film with a high "creep" factor (not to be confused with a 1991 movie by the same name, or the more recent (2001) campfire stories). central tale of stranded teens telling ghost stories around a campfire in spooky woods nicely leads into, and ties together the different stories that make up the bulk of the movie (watch for ron livingston (office space, band of brothers) and jennifer macdonald in a spirited, sexy segment ("the honeymoon")). solid acting and a few truly "scary" moments make this an above-average chiller. good example of interesting story line, coupled with quality ensemble acting resulting in a whole greater than the sum of its parts. "surprise" ending of the main story adds nice creepy twist, although some may see it coming. movie is not available on dvd, but can be found on vhs.

campfire tales (1997)an excellent peace of work. everything about this film is just perfect.the film has a great cast as you can see from imdb. the reason i brought the film was because of christine taylor and the love for horror films. lets get to the main parts1. there are 4 teenagers in this film , after crashing their car they decide to tell some spooky stories 2. there are 3 stories and the main plot ( the 4 teenagers are the main plot) 3. the best story is " people can lick too"in my opinion. the least scary story is possibly "honeymoon" or the 2nd story (can't remember the name"4. "people can lick too" is about a man pretending to be a 13 year old girl( over the internet). he starts chatting to a girl called amanda and then enters her house . very creepy stuff this story will make you think twice of chatting to someone online. basically a pervert enters her house and things go creepy.5. the main plot is sweet and simple, teenagers crash, tell stories, try to freak each other out. but there's a very cool twist at the end.the only bad part of this movie is, the teenagers crash their car into another couple, but the kids don't bother seeing if the couple are ok. they just talk about the couple who they've crashed into.the men and women who made this film made it to scare people, not to make money. unlike "scream" and "i know what you did last summer", this film is created to scare you. "scream" and "i know what you did last summer" were made to make big time cash.even though this movie wasn't pushed as publicly as scream was , it's still 10 times better than scream and "i know what you did last summer".the characters in this movie are great and have realistic characteristics. the cast who play theses characters are great. christine taylor does a fabulous job with lauren, doesn't go over the top with the acting. the dude who plays eric (laurens younger brother) also does a good job of showing men or teenage boys can also get freaked out. screams is like a spoof movie, the murderer is a joke and the kids are dumb unlike scream and "i know what you did last summer", this movie has realistic people, not a goof of a movie, should of been more noticed.

i recently bought this movie for three bucks at a garage sale, and while i'm glad i didn't have to pay the usual $19.99 for this dvd, i was pleasantly surprised by how good the film was.it's set up like a horror anthology, broken up into 5 tales, including the 'connector' story which involves four teenagers who's car breaks down a dark, lonely road in the middle of the night. apparently, these kiddos like horror stories, because that's what they decide to do until morning - tell spooky stories around a campfire. each character takes their turn telling a story, after which their own story is wrapped up with a nice little twist.the first story, "the hook" is kinda a waste of time, a bit bland and dull. luckily, this is not one of the main stories and only lasts maybe 5 minutes. it's intended merely to introduce the film and it's easy to overlook the unoriginality of this piece.the second story, "the honeymooners" is, eh, okay. it's about - you guessed it - two people on their honeymoon! they're traveling around in an rv headed to las vegas. they decide to stop somewhere for the night, but they're quickly warned by a mysterious stranger to leave the location, or risk being attacked by some dangerous, unknown creatures. this story has a pretty good setup, but just merely an 'ok' delivery. basically, it's fairly entertaining and mysterious till the monsters show up, then it's just kinda iffy.the third story, "people can lick too" is my personal favorite. it involves a young girl who's parents are going out for the night and who's older sis is ditching her for a party. so, she's going to be all alone - a fact she makes known to an internet buddy of hers. trouble is, that internet buddy? is not exactly a thirteen-year-old girl. this story's conclusion is slightly less climatic than i might have liked to have seen, but still pretty dang good.the final story, "the locket" is definitely the one packed with the most atmosphere. set in a creepy mansion on a dark, rainy night, it's the tale of a young man (played by glenn quinn!) traveling around on a motorcycle who stumbles across this house just at the time that he conveniently has a problem with his bike. he meets the mute girl who lives in the house, and falls in love with her at first sight. unfortunately, not everything is all fine and dandy - and it might have something to do with that locket hanging around her pretty neck...after the stories are wrapped up, we're presented with a twist involving the four teens in the car, a twist which, in retrospect, should have been obvious, but which it didn't really see coming, and it's a quite pleasing conclusion to film.so, all in all, a good movie. rent it if you can, because unfortunately, i don't really think it has a lot re-watching value. but next time you're in the mood for a vaguely scary litte flick in the same vein as "tales of the darkside" or something, grab this movie and some popcorn, turn off all the lights, and treat yourself to this surprisingly nifty little flick.

this movie is about a group of four friends who wreck a car while driving. they build a campfire to get though the night and wait for help. to pass the time, they tell each other scary stories. to tell about it would ruin the movie, so rent and enjoy it!!i will say it starts out a little slow, but each tale get better and better. this movie stars some of today's hottest actors christine taylor(the brady bunch movies), james marsden(disturbing behavior) and ron livingston (office space). so you can see there are big name stars just not the really big ones!!go rent or buy it asap !!this movie is awesome!!

this movie dethroned dr. giggles as the best horror movie i've ever seen. the plot was great, the plot twists were even better and the cast was great. it's hard to believe that they compiled the most unknown people 8 years ago and they would be big names today! the plot is simple. 4 teenagers wreck their car in the middle of nowhere. they stumble on this campsite and do what everybody who is in an accident should do. build a fire and tell scary stories.1. "the hook." great opener. anyone who is in high school has heard variations of this story on prom night. but they do it real good in this movie.2. "the honeymoon." ok, this was not the best of the 4. it was pretty good and you get to see some boob. emphisis on the word "some." it's just your basic creature in the woods story.3. "people can lick too." this is a cautionary tale of what happens in internet chat rooms all across the country. this segment alone should be required viewing for parents whose children have access to the internet. 4. "the locket." now this is the best story in the whole movie. a guy on a motorcycle breaks down and goes to this mute girl's house. very good plot twist.the main plot, "the campfire" has the biggest and best twist in the whole movie. i won't tell what it is cause i don't want to ruin it. i was never this shocked during a movie in my life!plot: a+ acting: a+writing: a+ directing: a+ music: a+ overall: a+ i recommend it to anyone over 13 with the exception of "people can lick too." any parent who's child has access to the internet needs to watch this one with their child.

this was on the saturday before halloween this year (today, at the time of this writing) and it has to be the best horror anthology out there. i am normally not a fan of horror movies - largely due to the volume of crap that's been recently released. however, the director of campfire tales has the hitchcock-esquire gift of suspense - unlike other contemporary films, it doesn't take every opportunity to scare you silly, instead using foreshadowing and 'near-misses' - incidents that seem like the instant that the climax will occur in the instant before, but turn out not to be.i didn't catch 'the hook' or the first main segment, but from what i have read here, they were the two you could afford to miss.'people can lick too' was full of suspense - this short keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting for something to happen to the little girl as she wanders about her yard and house looking for her soccer ball and later her dog. she encounters so many near-misses that the suspense reaches heart-stopping proportions before the climax of the short, when the girl gives up and goes to bed, thinking her dog is underneath it. she reaches her hand down to let him lick it, and she feels the touch of a tongue on her hand...before noticing that on her mirror, written in blood, is 'people can lick too'. i'll leave the last few seconds for you to find out, my reader, for at this point the short could have taken any number of turns.'the locket', however, was the unarguable masterpiece of this film. it begins with a man on a motorcycle, simply driving...towards what he does not know, but he can feel himself getting closer. as he's driving along, a storm breaks out, and he's forced to find shelter in the house of a mute girl. the two quickly cozy up to each other, but before they can do anything besides kiss, the girl reveals through writing that ghosts inhabit her house. they quickly begin packing up to leave, but they are caught in the middle of a reenactment of a scene decades past - a father, coming home to his daughter and her boyfriend preparing to elope, murders the both of them and then commits suicide. i'll have to leave you to discover the ending here as well - i couldn't hope to do the story justice in any case, and what i've said so far is just a brief summary of the story - i couldn't hope to convey the nuances and sensory details that add to it.'the campfire', being the connecting thread between all of the stories, is a fairly interesting rehash of the car accident theme, and the girls are very much attractive - in fact, most of the girls in this film are good-looking. anyway, despite the fact that it's chopped up, the story is given justice, and the ending is difficult to predict if you're preoccupied with the other stories. however, if you pay enough attention to the segments of the campfire spread through the film, it's certainly possible to predict the ending, especially if you've seen movies based on the same premise. (mst3k fans, remember soultaker? same premise, but without the god awful writing of vivian schilling, and the bulk of the movie. if you've seen the first 30 minutes of that you should be able to predict the ending.) all in all, the best horror movie i've seen in a long time, and the only horror anthology worthy of a buy.

"campfire tales" is basically made up of three spooky stories that a group of friends tell after they get into a car crash in the woods after a concert. the film begins with the classic "hook" story, and then we're introduced to the group of friends driving home from the concert. they crash their car, put out some flares, and start a fire in a little abandoned chapel, waiting for someone to arrive with help as they warm themselves by the fire. to pass the time, they decide to start telling classic horror stories, about terrorized honeymooners, a girl who falls prey to an internet predator, and a motorist who takes refuge in a haunted house. as they tell the eerie tales, each story becomes increasingly terrifying, but the real shock that awaits them is yet to come...in my opinion, the last story they tell is probably the scariest and had some genuine, frightening effects. the first story was alright, and the motorhome sequence near the end was a little creepy. the second story built a lot of suspense, more than either of the others did, but it's unoriginal plot was it's downfall. i remember watching this movie a long time ago when i was like eight years old on hbo and the third story scared the crap out of me, although it's not scary to me now. you'll probably recognize some of the cast here, particularly amy smart from the opening "hook" interlude story, and christine taylor as one of the main actresses in the film. the twist ending was kinda interesting too, i know i didn't see that coming, i thought it was all cleverly pieced together.to sum things up, if you're looking for a horror movie that is worth the while, rent this, you should be happy. it's a great anthology of some classic urban legends, and the whole film was tied together neatly. it is much better than what one would expect. 7/10.

i decided to watch this on fearnet on demand for free because i figured well, nothing else looks enjoyable. and it turned out to be quite a good little horror surprise! the film serves as an anthology of four urban legends told from the point of view of four teenagers whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. after they decide to build a campfire in the woods, they begin to tell their spooky stories and the movie transitions to the events in the stories.the honeymoon- a newlywed couple traveling cross country in an rv to las vegas is terrorized when they park in a wooded area by evil beings that hunt by the full moon. (i won't spoil that for you!) the hook- amy smart and james marsden, (probably the most famous people in the movie besides beautiful christine taylor) play the young couple who come face to face with the maniac that has a hook for a hand in this most recognizable short.people can lick too- this is probably the scariest and most dark of the stories. a young girl chats with another girl on the internet, but it turns out that it's actually a man who is obsessed with her and he proceeds to break into the house when she's alone. this was really chilling.the locket- this is also a great story with glen quinn and jacinda barrett, who play a motorcyclist and a beautiful mute girl who are terrorized by ghosts from a previous century in a mysterious farm house. this was good but it was the weakest of the entries.the group around the campfire slowly develop their own terrifying experience in their segments between stories, and the end of this movie is surprising and really awesome! overall this is not bone-chillingly scary but it's certainly a great little guilty pleasure that horror fans alike would definitely find worthwhile!

this was an interesting study in societal sexuality, as well as the "dark interests" of man.while i can't say the wife was a strong character - she was the wrong choice for the part, in my opinion - she was a rich kid in search of escaping her drool life. she was a rebel in fact, and never fully matured for her husband, a lawyer (rickman). it's obvious he married her for her money and to cover his sexual desires, which is taboo. rickman played his part to a tee, his flirtations with the young man, and very subtle undertones of gayness. the young man was gay to the hilt! when he did marilyn impersonation that should have told the wife everything. he was perfectly cast as well. he has hustler written all over him.i was not crazy about the ending, as i knew what was coming. overall though, the acting from rickman was great, reedus was good, walker was okay but i had misgivings. for a gay themed movie, it was average, but not blatant at least. it's worth viewing if you don't have "truly madly deeply" lying around for a spin.

dude, i thought this movie rocked. perfect for just sitting around alone and watching at like 3am with just you and a bottle. the whole time you are watching it you are thinking wtf? what's gonna happen next.... dude just get with the chick already. alright..... they are pickin mushrooms... this is odd... but kinda creepy cool. damn this whole movie has an erotic dirty naughty cold evil undertone to it... it's subtle dance just keeps you drawn to it... you're just waiting for someone to get whacked. but damn... wtf!? you get that and then some. for the morally enraged stomach it is great running to the toilet to barf material. any movie that can get that kinda reaction out of you deserves an award.

...this film noire set piece suffers from murky sound (at least, as shown on the inadequate equipment of both the seattle and maine film festivals) and murkier plotting, while rickman suffers from an american accent, old tennis shoes and baggy sweats. nonetheless, he has moments of stellar scenery chewing, and the film offers sinister ambiguity from norman reedus, the pretty polly walker, and a surprise ending (telescoped to frequent filmgoers), while affording a beautiful look at the physiography of both maine and rickman. due out in video release (after a cable airing) in march. not to be missed by any rickman fan. ignore the amanita hooey.

in a time of predictable movies, in which abound violence, cheap romance and melodrama, it is delightfully surprising to find such a strange movie. the plot itself is compelling, and the actors are excellent, especially alan rickman. if you want to watch a movie that does not provide all the answers before asking the questions, a movie that will surprise you (in good or bad), dark harbor's for you. and if you're not convinced, believe me that alan rickman's performance is well worth it... especially at the end, ladies....

this is one of my all time favorite movies, it's great to watch in groups, i find. it's also great for any alan rickman fan, he does such a wonderful job. it's engrossing, entertaining, very surprising... you have to watch it twice, at least. i haven't watched it with anyone who didn't like it or at least find it worthwhile.

darling lili is fantastic! its by far one my favorite films! it certainly didn't deserve the poor reviews it received. julie andrews, playing the title role of lili smith (schmidt) is the best part of the whole movie. she is entrancing and spectacular! as julie andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far, i was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is. this movie is just...great (i'm running out of adjectives!), it's magnificent, marvellous, amazing, funny, terribly romantic, sad, and just an all-out thrill and its all thanks to dame julie andrews!and to her husband, director blake edwards. oh, yeah rock hudson was ok, too :)julie andrews is the beautiful and well-loved singer, lili smith. rock hudson portrays major larabee, who quickly falls for lili, and she with him. but their affair was not coincedental. there meeting was planned by the german government (i'm not sure if that's exactly what you'd call them, but you get the point), because the warm, happy, singing entertainer lili is actually a german spy. lili is told to seduce major larabee in order to get information of the new top secret opertaion (later know as "crepe suzette"). though lili is on a solemn mission, she falls in love with bill (major larabee), for real, making her original quest challenging. but lili pulls through and completes er task, after she finds out something that is not really true about bill. the ending will remain unsaid by me as it is wonderfully layed out. if anything, you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie, i most certainly did!!!!!!!!

this often maligned movie is a must for fans of blake edwards, julie andrews, henry mancini, or hollywood musicals. other writers have commented on the shifts in tone, the confusion of plot, etc., but the film has many things to recommend it. the score is one of henry mancini's best (and he has written many wonderful ones), several songs are sung to perfection by andrews, julie's performance is nuanced and she is decked out in some beautiful clothes, (she is at her absolutely loveliest here), the on-location shots are breath-taking, and there are some funny inspector clouseau-type sight gags to boot. rock hudson basically phoned in his performance, but he is passably good. a real curiosity item in that it was the last major film julie did for about 10 years and, in many ways, is a precursor to victor/victoria. it is lovely to look at and listen to. when will it be available on dvd??? when it is, i for one would like both versions--the longer and shorter, director's cut. since it was lampooned in s.o.b., they would make a great two-pack!

a stunning and thoughtful observation on modern life for youngsters in japan, like grains of sand delves into issues such as rape, homosexuality and pubescent angst in a subtle and significant way. it gives an insight in to the youth culture struggling to define itself outside of the bounds of their parent's generation, with it's strict conformity and facade. typical to japanese cinema, often what isn't said is more important that what is, so to those not versed in japanese film and culture, beware. it can seem dull and minimalistic (pretty much like every film to come out of japan bar mangas) if you don't know what to look for. i saw it for the first time when i was 15 and was what originally sparked my interest in japan, it's culture and language. considering i'm now 22 and learning japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years, needless to say it's a powerful film. enjoy!

horses on mars is an engaging animated short that takes a sometimes comical look at the process of evolution through the eyes of those yet to evolve. the story is personal, and at times sentimental, and is supported by strong digital animation and narration that involves the viewer in this science fiction story. i was fortunate enough to view this short in widescreen format at the 2002 sundance film festival, and must suppose that when transferred to the small screen, it will lose some of its ability to draw the reader into the no less thoughtful story and stunning graphics.

i suppose i like this film as well as any i know; it is not perfect, but under the title "the americanization of lily" this charming and memorable semi-musical satire might i suggest have been appreciated more, and still loved by those who recognized its special blake edwards'-produced spirit of gentleness, clever humor and solid narrative. the improbably but delightful story-line follows lili smith, a fringe-type spy for the germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; lili schmidt passing as smith is helping her uncle who is patriotic too, for germany but neither cruel nor political, merely opportunistic. lili's target is william larrabee, a charismatic u.s. squadron leader who can supply her valuable information. the plot thickens comes when lili falls in love with larrabee, has her eyes opened to the consequences of her playing spy, and sees the effects of combat on wounded men at a hospital and realizes what it might mean to his men whom she has met and likes. she gets jealous of a rival for larrabee's affections, then realizes she can no longer do what she has been doing and gives up the spy business. the logical end of the film comes when after the terrible wwi has ended, as she sings the theme song of the film, "wishing" in a darkened theater, one by one the members of larrabee's squadron appear, including her lover himself, indicating they have forgiven her and their former opponents; and even uncle kurt enthusiastically joins in the singing of "it's a long to tipperraree", to indicate all is well with the world again. this is an audacious and sometime brilliant story idea, written by director blake edwards and william peter blatty of "john goldfarb" fame; and it is a delightful narrative. larrabee's squadron, including an inebriate who keeps crashing and other lovable types populate this lively film; and the feel of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic, both in its scope and realization. credit must go to jack bear and donald brooks for their costume creations, reg allen and jack stevens for sets, fernando carrere for another beautiful production design, henry mancini for his sensitive and appropriate musical score, and to russell harlan for his shining cinematography. in the beautiful footage, the principal actors are julie andrews as lili, rock hudson as larrabee, keremy kemp outstanding as lili's uncle kurt, michael witney, lance percival as the inebriate pilot, gorgeous gloria paul as lili's stripteasing rival, and many other fine actors in smaller parts. it is hard to say enough nice things about the pace, or the cleverness of the just-this-side-of broad comedy; this element is introduced by edwards to leaven the horrors of actual warfare, to example the almost comic-opera approach with which men made war back in a more innocent-minded era of human civilization.. this comedy also helps prepare the way for lili's conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the german state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing. this is a rare "sense-of-life" film about lili's "americanization", her assertion of herself in the real world and then among others before tragedy can happen. it is haunting, i find, and beautiful in many ways. i consider it to be blake edwards'masterpiece of directing; and under the title "the americanization of lili" i believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film it is by every standard i know.

i guess this is the first movie that made me aware of the term "cult flick". it is totally a bad movie, but i can't help it, i like this movie. richard boone has made better and so has joan van arc, but if you are in to staying up late and watching movies that don't make you think to much this one is for you.

this would definitely not have been my kind of movie, but my husband saw it on tv and said it was really good. so, on his recommendation, i bought a copy, since i didn't know if it would ever be on tv again. i had never heard of anybody in it except armand assante. at first i had a hard time getting into the story, because the first part of the movie is a jumble of images-- and it doesn't make much sense. it is only later in the movie that it all comes together. the scene-cutting- if that's what it's called, is a bit jarring-- it sometimes looks as if a few frames have been cut out of each scene, and the scenes are jerky--but i guess that was done to add to the unusualness (if that's a word). the story veers here and there, and just about the time you have it all figured out, everything turns upside down and you have to readjust your thinking as to who is the bad guy and who is not. or bad woman. the acting is very good-- i kept thinking how much norman reedus looks like leo decaprio. the ending was a real twist, totally unexpected, which i liked. a good show.

we stumbled across this show one sunday morning at 6:30 a.m. while flipping through all of the cable channels and this turned out to be best show on! it is absolutely adorable. we need shows like this for children (and adults, as i'm certainly way beyond my childhood years.) as one of the other commentaries pointed out, this show benefits from the simplicity of the characters and story lines. the puppets are fantastically cute, the backgrounds are colorful and even though they are created out of cardboard, foam, paint, and pure imagination, they remind us of our own childhoods, when we could spend the day at our own grandma's house, exploring the world around us. for those who never were lucky to have a grandma as nice as nana, this show is for you, you'll make up for lost time! this show is a true inspiration and filled with cleverness and humor and just outright fun, for children and adults alike. in other words, don't overlook this show, just because you're over the age of three! spend a half hour with mona, nana, mr. wooka, and russell, they'll be friends you look forward to seeing!

my girls 4 and 6 love this show. we stumbled across it on a pbs station and they always ask when its on now. it reminds them of their grandma that takes care of them everyday in the summer. its funny too and sometimes they can't stopped talking about one scene or another. i would definitely recommend this show to all young kids. it is very clean and shows you to slow down and its not about watching tv all day long. when nana reads a story it is slow and she talks about each page with mona. it reminds me to slow down when i read the next book to my girls at bedtime and talk about the book instead of going through it quickly just to get them to sleep.

i ended up liking this movie but it was not the easiest to get through. what makes the movie great is the music and the scenery. the songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented. a great job was done to show different settings for the rom people.however, the viewer was not guided enough. a more in depth history of the rom people would have been nice. only a fraction of the of the spoken words were given english subtitles. in addition, more explanations about the settings and who was their and some of their challenges would have been appreciated too. it would have helped if there were a narrator too explain about customs, dress and music.

this film is a tapestry, a series of portraits of rom communities woven together by music. it's very much a musician's film, because of the paucity of spoken dialogue - and what dialogue there is, is not important to the structure of the narrative. some might expect a national geographic tale of "customs, dress, and music" or a plot-line orbiting a few central characters - don't look for that here.this is because it paints a portrait of a family of peoples, rather than telling a story of individuals. the plot is the story through space (india to andalucia) and/or/ time (we cannot tell) of a people. there is no need of narration. you get a sense of a joyous people, strongly linked in small communities where social interaction is very important. and a great sense of sadness in parts, at their rejection by society at large.so it's a paean to rom culture, very beautifully shot, with a wide spectrum of rom music, and a sting in the tail which is the oppression these people have faced, and still face.

latcho drom, or safe journey, is the second film in tony gatlif's trilogy of the romany people. the film is a visual depiction and historical record of romany life in european and middle eastern countries. even though the scenes are mostly planned, rehearsed, and staged there is not a conventional story line and the dialog does not explain activities from scene to scene. instead, the film allows the viewer to have sometimes a glimpse, sometimes a more in-depth view of these people during different eras and in different countries, ranging from india, egypt, romania, hungary, slovakia, france, and spain.the importance of music in romany culture is clearly expressed throughout the film. it is a vital part of every event and an important means of communication. everything they do is expressed with music. dance is another important activity. like romany music, it is specialized and deeply personal, something they alone know how to do correctly. we are provided glimpses into their everyday activities, but the film is not a detailed study of their lives. rather, it is a testament to their culture, focusing on the music and dance they have created and which have made them unique.mr. gatlif portrays the nomadic groups in a positive way. however, we also witness the rejection, distrust, and alienation they receive from the non-romany population. it seems that the culture they have developed over countless generations, and inspired from diverse countries, will fade into oblivion because conventional society has no place for nomadic ways.the other films in the trilogy are les princes (1983) and gadjo dilo (1998).

what makes this documentary special from a film-making perspective is its passiveness; which engages the audience to bask in the delight of gypsy music. it innovates the form of documentary while showcasing a tapestry of sound and movement that invites us to celebrate the primal similarity found within the traveling music of (historically) traveling peoples.indeed the film itself is a single "take" of sweeping movement that travels the globe and transitions effortlessly from one rhythmic culture to the next.watching this film, one's breath is taken away by the simple beauty in our common connection to music, rhythm and dance. if there is a more deeply spiritual, flowing homage to the sound and movement of gypsy cultures, it has yet to be filmed.

this is not "direct cin√©ma", as a matter of fact it is its opposite. second installment of filmmaker gatlif's gypsy trilogy, this french work produced by mich√®le ray-gavras, is a film masterpiece, not pure documentary, no fiction by any means. instead, gatlif has chosen different locations of the route from india to spain, wherever the rom people have a strong presence, and with the help of art directors he has staged several musical numbers that tell us how the gypsies live, sing, dance, struggle and have survived. the movie may have strong opposition from those who question the hypothesis that the rom tribe is of indian origin, mostly challenged by those who see a direct link with the hebrews (so, in a way, it comes as no surprise that they were also persecuted by the nazis.) but above any anthropological argument, this is a work of great beauty, strong colors and wonderful singing and dancing.

latcho drom is a cinematic survey of gypsy music from several countries. it is touching, sad and joyous. most of the segments appear to be completely unstaged, unrehearsed. the music, ranging from the sensual flamenco music of the spanish gypsies, to the melancholy music of the central european gypsies, is exquisite. if you love gypsy music, you'll find latcho drom absolutely beautiful.

julie andrews plays a german spy who falls in love with an american pilot rock hudson, while on an assignment for germany.the songs are beautiful. the two are well-paired. julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays. a half-german, half-english girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in ww i, julie sings some endearing mancini songs. i loved the film. some will say it's a "chick-flick," but so what. it's wonderful. supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped. it may not be up to rock's performance in pillow talk, magnificent obsession, or giant.blake edwards shot the film in ireland and authentic ww i -type planes were used in the film. scenery for england and france is absolutely gorgeous.

robert mckimson's 'acrobatty bunny' is one of the director's finest shorts. although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of mckimson's dreadful 'big top bunny', 'acrobatty bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty. pitting bugs bunny against a ferocious lion, 'acrobatty bunny' is fresh and funny from the outset, not to mention extremely attractive to look at. there's a classic scene in which bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion. in a brilliant disney parody, he hollers "pinocchio" down the lion's throat! this brilliant opening is a sign of things to come. there are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lion's cage to begin with, followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of 'laugh clown laugh' which, as a child, i used to impersonate regularly! all this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name. i've never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but 'acrobatty bunny' breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst mckimson's best.

a stunning piece of art.you can watch every image of the film and see the beauty in it.first i would like to say that ¬¥when i saw the german¬¥s soldiers helmet¬¥s i understood that it was from here that "star wars" hade been inspired.the scene were they kill the baby is frightening and when i saw it i did not like it.but when the film was end i thought about that scene and i changed my mind and thought that in the world war 2 that was exactly what the german¬¥s did.the ice-battle scene is some of the best war scenes i have seen(if not the best).they way this film combines music and so superbly stunning visual images is really excellent.then the prokofiev score is one of the most famous sound track¬¥s in history and i thought it was some of the best to.what more can you say then a work of art.eisenstein have created a stunning masterpiece,a propaganda film and a beautiful work of art. i am very happy because i have just got the criterion collection eisenstein set.

when i first saw this film around 6 months ago, i considered it interesting, but little more. but it stuck with me. that interest grew and grew, and i wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual vhs quality rather than the film itself. i purchased the criterion dvd box set, and it turns out that i was right the second time. alexander nevsky is a great film. it is rousing, and i'm sure it succeeded in its main aim: propaganda against the germans.that is the most common criticism against this film, and against eisenstein, that it is merely propagandist and nothing else. it's untrue. he is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived. by now, the world is far enough beyond joseph stalin to be able to watch eisenstein's films as art.

alexander nevsky (1938) is a brilliant piece of cinematic propaganda. the people of russia are threatened by two major enemies, the mongols and the teutonic knights of the holy roman empire. in ordered to unite the warring, rival princes in the russian realm, nevsky takes charge and fights the lesser of two evils (the teutonics). this influential film was copied many times over and it still holds up to this day. the soundtrack by composer prokiev and eisentstein's direction are a sight and sound to behold many years later, john milius used many of the movies scenes, set pieces and costumes from this film and incorporated them into conan.one of my favorite lines from conan was taken from this movie. "it's not the strength of the iron in a weapon but the strength of the person that wields it is what matters." the comparisons are unmistakable. the armor that james earl jones and the leader of the teutonic knights wear are virtually identical. a true tribute paid from one director to another.i give alexander nevsky one of my highest recommendations. the movie plays like the final act of richard iii. the presence of prince alexander on the screen is truly amazing.

this movie was over-shadowed by 'the jackal' (bruce willis, richard gere) which was released the same year. having seen both films, i can honestly say this is the superior film.granted, the production value of 'the jackal' was very good, it probably had a substantially bigger budget. however, 'the assignment' is well written and has a fascinating story. aiden quinn is flawless in dual roles. aiden quinn and director christian duguay did a great job of establishing a deep and multi-layered relationship between the title character and his family. i particularly liked the ending.i was reminded of the jack ryan character in the tom clancy movies. both are naval officers thrown into unbelievably dangerous roles as they covertly work on behalf of national security. and yet, both harrison ford and aidan quinn reveal their respective characters as heros who manage to be both virile and gentle. they have a genuine tenderness and vulnerability in their relationships with their families. what i don't understand is how the opinions of all who have posted on this movie (myself included) can be so much more positive than the luke-warm reception the film has received. this is a movie that has enough complexity and subtlety that it remains compelling after multiple viewings. if you are a fan of espionage-genre films, i recommend 'the assignment' enthusiastically.

this movie is about carlos "the jackal" (quinn), an international terrorist who, by cia agent henry fields's (sutherland) description, appears to maim women and children for the heck of it. at least that's what he says to guilt us naval officer annibal ramirez (quinn again) into taking on the assignment of posing as carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the kgb. ramirez is apparently physically identical to carlos but mentally he is his antithesis. he is borne of order and carlos is borne of chaos.the movie isn't all shoot-gun-jump-around action, and that's a good thing. in its first half, ramirez undergoes training to act and think like carlos, and that's actually where the movie achieves its distinction from other run-of-the-mill action flicks. an israeli agent (kingsley), joins fields in training ramirez, and together they appear to take on the roles of parents in the birthing of ramirez's new character. ramirez is taught to dislike the things carlos dislikes, to act on the split second like carlos would, and even to make love like carlos (courtesy of an ex-girlfriend of carlos's). naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of the movie. it's a little contrived but quinn gives a riveting performance as a carlos-wannabe.another thing i liked about this movie was that it didn't utilize the much overdone plot point in evil twin movies - you know, the one in which the evil twin insinuates himself into the good twin's family. ramirez's family does come into the picture, but instead they highlight how his new character wrecks havoc on his family life.good chuckle humor is injected into this movie, often coming the acerbic duo of sutherland and kingsley. an exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving ramirez's first name (annibal, annabelle, get it?). also overdone was the constant harping by the duo about how powerful and cunning and intelligent carlos is. in my opinion, during the final showdown, the payoff wasn't able to match the build-up.on the whole, the movie was enjoyable. i'm not a big action flick fan but this movie was more intelligent and engrossing than the average action movie and it maintained my attention throughout.my rating: 9/10

once i knew that donald sutherland, (jack shaw/henry fields) was appearing in this film it instantly told me this was going to be a good picture to view. most of sutherland's pictures are full of action and suspense and he can play a rather cruel character and can also be quite charming and kind. in this picture, jack shaw did his very best to be a good guy and a bad guy while he was training a naval office to become a spy who had to change his entire identity and become a different person over night. there is plenty of car chase scenes and plenty of stunt men situations which i would not want to perform. this naval officer lived in a quite community with his wife and was a father, but you would never realize that fact until the film reveals his horrible background secrets which he had to keep from his family and friends. good spy film and great acting by all the actors.

i'm a huge fan of the spy genre and this is one of the best of these films. the assignment is based on a true story, which has been somewhat embellished for the big screen, and it really takes you on a fun ride. the film has a great cast, starring aidan quinn, donald sutherland and ben kingsley.naval officer quinn is a reluctantly recruited by sutherland after a chance meeting with kingsley who believes quinn to be the famous terrorist carlos the jackal. because quinn so closely resembles carlos, sutherland stops at nothing to recruit him because sutherland is obsessed with the terrorist's capture or death.the training sequences are awesome. quinn is really put to the test by kingsley and sutherland, having to withstand attacks from remote controlled snowmobiles, from eating the same food each day, to being drugged with a hallucinogen. he even has to learn how to make love to a woman the way carlos would.the film has some great action scenes with quinn eluding allies because they believe he is carlos and in his final mission when he is to kill the jackal. throughout the film, quinn must struggle with the new personality he has attained versus his own. will he remain as ruthless and free as carlos or will he once again return to his life of a good husband and father? if you like the spy genre, this is a must see. the action is used only to propel the story of this thriller forward; no gratuitous explosions or fight scenes. rating 10 of 10 stars.

throughout the world the unmistakable imprint of the american c.i.a. can be found in many a muddled mess they have left behind. in the beginning, their objectives were simple: spy, remove enemy agents, steal classified information and destabilize unfavorable governments. years have elapse and although their mission remains similar, their clandestine black operations now include domestic spying, discrediting u.s. citizens and infiltrating american organizations who criticize the u.s. government. this movie however, centers on the c.i.a.'s world manhunt for the infamous 'carlos, the jackel.' the film is called " the assignment " and tells the story lt. cmdr. annibal ramirez, (aidan quinn) a u.s. naval officer who bears a striking resemblance to the mastermind of so many terrorist bombings. recruited by jack shaw (donald sutherland) of the c.i.a. and amos (ben kingsley), a special agent from the israeli mosad, ramirez is secretly trained to look, pose, infiltrate the elusive organization and to thereafter discredit the real jackel working for the russians. this film is explosively exciting, and packed with wild chases, killings and inter-country mayhem. quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic playing both sides of the war. easily one of his best efforts. ****

2002's the bourne identity is one of my all-time favorite movies. however, many fans of the book have complained that the movie had very little to do with the book's plot.the assignment is the real deal. it's odd that no-one on the "bourne identity" threads has mentioned this movie at all. (well, i jst did.)besides the excellent plot, i personally found this movie to be as good as any espionage movie i've ever seen, with the possible exception of the bourneidentity itself.the action is all completely realistic. i especially liked the protagonists' training regimen, which was very inventive.the feel is dark and gritty. there are a few surprising plot twists. the acting is excellent. if you like this genre, i cannot recommend this movie highly enough.

if you liked the richard chamberlain version of the bourne identity then you will like this too...aiden quinn does this one brilliantly, you can't help but wonder if he is really out there...i reckon he and the other main cast members probably had nightmares for weeks after doing this movie as it's so intense. when i first saw it i was just flicking channels on the remote late one evening..& i got hooked within minutes. look up www.answers.com for ilich ram√≠rez s√°nchez who is the character that "carlos the jackal" is based on for both... i remember reading about ilich ram√≠rez s√°nchez's arrest in the paper in 1997. it was front page for weeks, through the trial after his arrest.

i loved this film. it was so intelligent but it also had some great action sequences, without basing the movie solely around them. quinn, sutherland and kingsley all put in fantastic performances and there are enough twists to keep anyone interested. the ending was great as well.

this is probably one of the best thrillers i have ever seen. it has action, but not this bullet-flying, good guys - bad guys, van damme - stallone action, but quick, realistic and nervous action, it has a plot, cause till the very end of the movie you don't know how this is gonna end, it has characters, aidan quinn, donald sutherland and ben kingsley are just perfect, and it has suspense, this movie just won't let you go away before you've seen the end of it.though there are only a few characters, i didn't find it difficult to keep my attention the the story, and as for the story, it's basic (not too tom clancy-difficult, but simple and raw) and realistic.if you're in for a movie with a good story, some action and great acting, watch this and i promise, you won't go away till you've seen the end of it. the very end of it.

i will not comment on the story as such. i agree with most peoples comments that this is a good all round action movie with a well told story and good acting.this film deserves 100% for cinematography for its opening sequence. the opening shot is stunning and i have not yet figured out how they did it. the movie is worth watching for that shot alone! a pity therefore that the dvd that is currently out is just the movie and no information is given as to the making of the film. let's hope somebody comes up with the special edition.and the even better thing is that the opening sequence also becomes the ending leaving you totally guessing! great stuff. a must have for a collector of classic film moments.

i found this movie to be quite enjoyable and fairly entertaining. good characters,good actors and enough suspense to keep your interest throughout. the plot twists might have been a bit much but overall a decent thriller. if you liked this film i would recommend the spanish prisoner, the house of games and no way out.

this is one of the best thrillers i've seen. it's intelligently made and brilliantly filmed, and is one of the few thrillers that creates complex, interesting characters and makes the movie about them, not the action. i would recommend it to just about anyone, especially people who like movies with both style and substance.

christian duguay directed this tidy little espionage thriller early in his career. it plays on tv pretty regularly, albeit with some terrific scenes of violence and sex unfortunately trimmed. i finally got around to seeing the theatrical version on a $3 tape from the local video store. naval officer aidan quinn is recruited to impersonate the notorious carlos the jackal, and gets a little too caught up in the role. donald sutherland ben kingsley play quinn's superiors, with sutherland a true zealot and kingsley as the more level-headed one. the first half of this fun flick shows quinn being trained and indoctrinated. the second half has him out in the field, making love to the jackal's woman and shooting it out with sundry enemies. the idea is to make the jackal look like a turncoat to the russians, and let them take care of the world's most notorious assassin. things don't exactly play out as planned. at times, i almost expected the cast to break out laughing at some of the corny dialogue, but they all play it very straight. in the end, this is one terrific little thriller that deserves your attention. the jackal's former mistress teaching the highly proper and very married quinn to rough her up, lick blood from her face, and then go down on her, alone is worth the price of admission.

it worked! director christian duguay created a very clever action/spy thriller. the actors donald sutherland and especially aidan quinn gave a top performance. what a pity that we couldn¬¥t see aidan quinn in others movies like this one till now. he was simply the best in the role as ramirez/carlos for what he should have earned the oscar. the picture was very nice. the scenes are fast paced from beginning to the end and the story doesn¬¥t let you a chance to get bored. the movie is too underrated and i recommend it to anyone otherwise you will miss something great. believe me you will not be disappointed. that¬¥s why i give it 9/10.

the stunts sequences (as well as the special effects) are brilliant, in this movie. michael scherer must be one of canadas best stunt co-ordinators of all time. the explosion in the caf√©, is a wonderful combination of stunts, special effects and visual effects. the director had an idea, that the crew managed to create on film.besides that; donald sutherland makes one of his best performances in this film.......

this is certainly a quality movie with a classy cast. as far as movies about carlos the jackal go, this one beats bruce willis' feeble efforts in 'the jackal' to a bloody pulp, then spits on them. i am a bit surprised that this movie hasn't attracted more votes, something of a 'sleeper' obviously. a pity because this film is definitely worth a watch. it is clever and never dull. see it, 7/10

slick, tidy, and well-made old school version of how a great international thriller should be made. determined to nail a feared global terrorist who is known as "carlos the jackal", jack shaw (donald sutherland, "without limits", "space cowboys"), a cia operative and his israeli counterpart, amos (ben kingsley, "gandhi", "sexy beast") get a noble naval officer, annibal ramirez (aidan quinn, "music of the heart"), to become carlos and use him in a daring plot to get the kgb to kill the real carlos, because he took an offer from the cia. sutherland and kingsley are both good here, but the movie really belongs to quinn here, who embodies himself here (in a dual role). director christian duguay and cinematographer david franco provide another great asset of the film here with hitchcockian-like suspense and great sights of the world.

the emperor and the assassin (w/english subtitles) at 161 minutes is long, but the time is packed with a story that barely fits into it. golden hued palace scenes and dusty yellow panoramas of chinese landscapes background a true story of china's unifying king, circa 300 bce. an intricate plot with a myriad twists and turns is played out with excellent portrayals by the cast. king qin's simple wish for a unified empire for his common people is fulfilled, but not without treachery, plots and counter plots and oh yes, bodies. lots of bodies. this epic story of china's beginnings is a great way for westerners to glimpse little known asian history. emperor qin's legacies include the thousands of life-size terra-cotta figures which are still being excavated today. as an historical person, this film makes it clear that emperor qin should be regarded along with george washington, napoleon bonaparte, alexander the great, genghis khan and julius caesar, to name a few of the world's greatest conquerors/statesmen. i highly recommend seeing the emperor and the assassin, especially on the big screen.

for a feature film, the plot closely follows history--or at least historical gossip. but then the chinese, who know the story very well from seeing it portrayed again and again, would never tolerate it otherwise. the attention to detail is wonderful, especially for anyone who has read sima qian's account in the records of the historian. jing ke, according to sima qian, did indeed make an attempt on qin shi huang's life at the request of the crown prince of yan before unification. sima qian explicitly mentions both the head of general fan and the dagger rolled up into the map, as well as the dagger being thrown into the brass column. although jing ke is described as no stranger to swordplay, he's hardly the invincible warrior portrayed by chen kaige. jing ke is indeed this film's weakest link. in reality (again, according to sima qian), he was a heavy drinker and put off his visit to qin for as long as possible, spending a good deal of time with the ladies of yan before the crown prince finally ordered him on his way. he was, in short, a human being and was not looking forward to death although he was willing to accept it. chen kaige's jing ke is afraid of death, but not his own. he is the classic ruthless killer turned disillusioned pacifist. his love (or maybe just affection) for a woman and pity for several hundred children whom zheng had buried alive (not even two thousand years of hostile confucian historians claimed qin shi huang did this, although there is a legend about him burying 460 confucians up to their necks and then beheading them)is enough to make this former assassin kill again. the melodrama is not convincing and the character ends up being just plain boring. the acting here isn't shabby, though not very interesting given the character. as for lady zhou, in all the numerous stories i've heard about qin shi huang, she's never come up. anyway, gong li is famous enough for americans to have heard of her (thanks to zhang yimou) and there needed to be a love interest, so here she is. it's unfortunate that her performance is almost as wooden as jing ke's character. she's done much better (in qiu ju for example) at being subtle; here she just barely manages presence. but all of this is trivial compared to the extraordinary acting of li xuejian as zheng himself. qin shi huang is for the chinese rather what milton's satan is for us: accepted as a villain, but a noble one. qin shi huang's accomplishments radiate an awe all the way across two thousand years into the present and li captures his frightening will without compromising his humanity. li's performance is enough, but the scope of the film is grand although the photography is purposely drab. it does feel ancient. the score is adequate, scarcely moving though very appropriate to the action. though i've only seen it once, i believe that chen kaige should be given more credit for his camera work than other reviewers have allowed him. the opening credits are exhilarating. if five stars its absolutely average, i given three more for li xuejian's acting and chen kaige as an actor, writer, and director.

this is an excellent film. no, it's not mel gibson in "braveheart," but then, it's not trying to be. actually, "the emperor and the assassin" probably has (thankfully) more in common with a shakespearean production than a hollywood blockbuster.in the third century bc, the king of qin is attempting to unite (in other words "conquer") the seven kingdoms of china. he has already overthrown the kingdom of han. now he needs an excuse to invade the kingdom of yan.this is where the lady zhao comes in. she and the king have been friends since childhood. they are obviously very much in love, but cannot marry for political reasons. together they devise a plot. she will pretend to have fallen into disfavor with the king and escape to yan. once there she will convince the prince of yan to send an assassin back to kill the king. when the assassination fails, the king will have his excuse to invade yan.once in yan, however, lady zhao begins to reconsider. hearing and seeing more and more examples of her old childhood friend's ruthlessness, she begins to wonder if the king may need to be assassinated for real.one sure sign that you're not watching a hollywood production is the final encounter between the king and the assassin. unlike a hollywood movie where the hero and villain are clearly defined and the final outcome already predetermined, this is a fight that could truly go either way.this is a well crafted and well acted story of a tumultuous time in chinese history. there is a mixture of both incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. most beautiful of all, however, is gong li as the lady zhao. i grow more and more convinced every time i see her that gong li is the most beautiful woman in the world.i must say, however, that she does have one unintentionally funny line in this film. early on gong li asks one of her servants "do i have a beautiful face?"duh!!!

after watching the movie a few times, i found so many subtle touches and emotions within the dialogue. jing ke, the assassin has become one of favorite movie characters of all time. this fine chinese actor says more with his eyes and his economy of words and movements then any big screen american actor today. qin, the emperor, is brilliant as he leads the audience to believe the kindness in his heart, only to unleash the most cruel acts upon the people around him. the promises he makes with incredible passion and shattered with an evil fist. gong li, as in just about every movie i've ever seen her in, is simply fantastic. her screen dominance is so graceful and emotionally charged.in case you couldn't tell, i loved this movie.

this three-hour chinese epic, set in 220 b.c., may ultimately amount to a familiar theme of an emperor's idealistic dream of peace through unification mutating into corrupted isolation, and there's nothing inherently challenging about the film, but it's a compelling narrative, crammed with intrigue and passion and betrayal and epic events told in vivid strokes. even for those not drawn to such historical spectacles for their own sake, it's an astonishing feast for the eyes: the scene depicting the coup attempt of the marquis is one of the most staggering evocations of physical space and grandeur in memory, and the battle scenes are memorable both in their scope and their immediacy. the title sums up the film's use of compelling contrasts - huge plainland vistas set against intimate horrors; the noblest of motives set against the most degraded; hope turning to dust. if you've never seen a three-hour chinese epic, this wouldn't be a bad place to start.

this is an epic film about the unification of the ancient kingdoms of china in the third century bc. what makes it interesting is the tragic downfall of the king and all the palace intrigue going on around him. it reminded me a bit of "king lear" and some of the other shakespeare plays.the king starts out with noble ambitions, to unify the kingdoms under one ruler and to stop all the quarrelling so that the people can prosper and lead better lives. he and his childhood sweetheart, played beautifully by li gong, concoct a scheme whereby she pretends to go into exile in a rival kingdom in order to recruit an assassin to kill the king, thus giving him a pretext to go to war. but while she's away, the king becomes sadistic in his lust for power and goes on a killing spree.there are numerous side plots that keep the action going. there is the marquis, who pretends to be stupid and foppish but who's really very clever and wants to become king himself. he fathers two children with the king's mother and manages to keep it secret for years. then there is the prime minister, a political rival to the king, who turns out to really be his father. the assassin is a complex character himself. an adept swordsman and killer, he is undergoing a reformation when the king's lover comes to recruit him. he wants nothing more with killing, but is eventually won over by li gong (who wouldn't be?) when he sees how cruel and vicious the king has become.some spectacular cinematography, especially the battle scenes that are carried out on a grand scale - like they used to say, a cast of thousands, literally. the acting is ok, nothing special. it's the story that's interesting, though at over two and a half hours, it pushes the limit.definitely worth viewing.

i will admit my ignorance of this film's existence, until i saw it advertised on a cable outlet. i was very impressed with the novelistic structure of the film. the film, which is in a language i do not understand, shone with intelligence and nuance for me. i think this speaks to the film's quality. it was visually stunning. the acting was visually entrancing. the chinese theater traditions of movement, used to enhance the delivery of dialogue, is so compelling after watching western film, where actors traditionally focus more heavily on the dialogue. the action in this film comes right at you, without a lot of explosions to get your attention. it is human action that is so affective here. the added advantage that the film taught me history about one of the world's greatest tourist attractions, the funereal clay army of china's first qin emporer, was very impressive. it seemed to give the film an international relevance beyond the film's great ethical themes. this is a film i can comfortably recommend to a wide variety of friends and acquaintances.

i've read some grumbles about the court scenes. these people betray their ignorance. this production went to simply amazing lengths to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story occurred. courtly manners are something few people outside the court ever see. while the acting may appear highly stylized, it is, in fact, as close a replication as possible of the behavior of individuals in their particular stations as the director could create. the actor's facial expressions are a marvel, particularly the duplicitous marquis changxin and the king's mother.there are, of course, reflections of both greek and shakespearian tragedy in the relationship between the king, his parents and his love. the juxtaposition of the king transforming from good to bad and the assassin from bad to good provides much food for thought on the evolution of an individual's nature. this movie would provide much to ponder in a college course on the humanities.at the same time, it almost rushes along, even in the slowest scenes heading towards an inexorable denouement. one suspects the involvement of large portions of the troop movements, which were quite awesome. it makes the lord of the rings battle scenes pale by comparison. few directors have the ability to literally field thousands of humans on the field of battle just for art's sake. i recall one scene in which at least 30,000 troops can be seen moving across a huge plain. the logistics for such a shot would have been staggering.i could go on... but simply, i can't recommend this film highly enough.

angela (sandra bullock) is a computer expert but, being shy and somewhat of a recluse, she does all of her work from the confines of her condo. just as she is about to take a vacation in mexico, a co-worker sends her a computer disc with disturbing information on it. angela agrees to meet with her fellow employee but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash. angela heads to mexico but takes the disc with her. while she is sunning on the beach, a terrific looking gentleman named jack (jeremy northam) makes overtures to her. she falls for them and the two end up on a boat to cozumel. however, jack works for the folks who generated the secret information on the disc and he is out to get it. even after angela escapes from his clutches and lands back in the usa, jack makes things difficult. he changes angela's identity on every computer across the nation, making her lose her condo, her bank account, everything. can angela, a computer whiz, beat jack at his own game? this very exciting movie has many assets. first, bullock and northam are two very beautiful, interesting actors and their presence adds immediate captivation. the script is very clever and sure in its knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their relevance in today's world. the costumes, sets, production, and direction of the movie are also quite wonderful. and, despite how it sounds, there is a great deal of exciting action as angela goes on the run to defeat her enemy. if you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, this is a great choice. it delivers twists and turns with great frequency, making it possible for the viewer to "net" a very good evening of entertainment.

it was a movie that made ya think a little. some parts a little cheesy, some parts pretty good. plot did thicken at times and just when you thought angella (sandra) found a friend the friend was fraud or dead. all i got to say is that dennis miller should have been in the whole movie. his character was the best, very refreshing after all the crap angella went through. he would have lifted me and angella through the dumps.

when "the net" was first being advertised, the ads made it look ridiculous. then, when i saw it, it was actually quite good. angela bennett (sandra bullock) spends her days working on the computer and has never gotten to know her neighbors. then, through a series of events, her identity gets erased by a cabal of shadowy people, and she can't prove that she exists.some parts of the movie are a little bit far-fetched; you'd probably know which parts if you saw the movie. still, it's a good look into what the existence of the internet may have wrought on unsuspecting people. i do recommend it.

you could get into the nitty gritty of this film, and say how it couldn't happen, or how could the main character just walk into offices and start using computers etc without someone noticing and really pick the movie to bits...or you could just sit back with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the acting. personally, i prefer the latter, i live real life and watch the news with all it's doom and gloom, and so would much rather be entertained by my movies, and see the bad guys get their just rewards. don't take it too seriously, and you can thoroughly enjoy this film.

this movie is a warning to all people sat surfing the internet on a typical day at the office. my warning is ,do not reveal too much about yourself, 2 be careful who you cross!! ,there are spies on this internet thing. i thought that it was so scary what that man and woman combination did to poor angela bennett, i did not realise that somebody could take ones life away in one click of this mouse angela i thought did a sterling job of outwitting jack delvin and that awful girl my question is, why does that computer make that noise when it works? like a clicking sound mine does not do this or this one. this film also tells you that there is fraud on this internet also why couldn't angela do the virus destroyer programme at a cybercafe? i also thought that like all computers the transfer rate to disk was slow that is correctly portrayed in this film when you save the programme to your floppy disk the bar only moved slowly!!! i quite liked angela's house at the beginning of the film as well why did no one believe angela???

wow! in my opinion, the net is an excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller that will leave you feeling good all over. when i first saw it, i was feeling good all over for days. when angela (sandra bullock) went to mexico, i thought to myself, "that is a really nice place to vacation." from the moment jack (jermey northam) and ruth (wendy gazelle) began chasing her, i thought to myself, "don't let anything bad happen to her! please!" i also took quite a few deep breaths to prevent myself from screaming any more than i already had. on the bright side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. in conclusion, i give this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller four stars.

this is a solid underrated little thriller, that has thrills-a plenty, with a cool story, sandra bullock is terrific!. all the characters are great, and i was surprised by how unpredictable it was as there were only a few predictable moments, plus sandra bullock is simply amazing in this!. jeremy northam played an awesome villain, and i know what bullock's character in this is all about, because i'm kind of the same type of person(i hardly ever go out), plus this is pretty well made and written for the most part. this should be higher then 5.5 in my opinion, plus denis miller was surprisingly better then expected in his small role. the scene where northam terrorizes bullock on his boat was quite suspenseful, and was one of my favorite moments, and i also liked the chase scene in the carnival, plus i liked the ending too, as it was quite well done, even if i did think northam was defeated too quickly. there are lots of other good chase scenes as well, and it's also clever at times too, plus there are quite a few shocking moments as well, this is a solid underrated little thriller, that has thrills a-plenty, with a cool story, sandra bullock is terrific, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is great!. irwin winkler does a great! job here with excellent camera work, adding good atmosphere, good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace. the acting is fantastic!. sandra bullock is amazing as always and is amazing here, she is extremely likable, tough as nails yet quite vulnerable, and i was able to feel for her because as i said i'm sort of like angela,i hardly ever go out, i really enjoyed her work in this movie! (bullock rules!!!!!!!). jeremy northam is excellent as the villain, he was sneaky, unpredictable and very menacing, he was great. dennis miller is surprisingly ok and non annoying in his small role, and managed to bring some comic relief. rest of the cast are fine. overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5

following the advice of a friend, i got myself this movie. i'm very fond of computers in general - hence why a 1995 film about identity theft on the internet could not be left unseen. i had some bad echoes about it, but in the end, i wasn't so disappointed : the story, though classical, is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres. i was gladly surprised when i figured out that contrary to what we usually see, computer-performed actions are somehow realistic, as they use windows 3.x and normal computers. the storytelling is median and not bothering the viewer. the end is typically american. the actors' performance is globally ok, sandra bullock usually annoys me with her "oh my god why me" way to behave, but this time she seems to have controlled herself. i'd recommend that movie.

i loved this movie!movies and plays fulfill their purpose when they expose social, political, and other problems that affect the majority. this movie served that purpose.i identify with the plot and know people to whom this has happened. at the time this movie was made, concepts presented in this flick were advanced for the public, yet had already happened to friends of mine by way of people in powerful positions. and, i know what it is like when people do to you what they did to angela bennett, because they have done it to me.i greatly enjoyed sandra bullock's portrayal of angela bennett/ruth marx. she portrays a pretty, intelligent, and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid giving up to overwhelming odds, fight hard to keep her sanity and restore her life, and try to protect those whom she loves. losing her self-concept and succumbing to that age-old attempt to bolster a sagging self esteem by indulging in sex with a stranger added a poignant touch of reality.the climax of the plot reveals the only real solution to this kind problem.

why all the negative reviews??? you didn't expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece did you??? what we have is a movie that tried to entertain us and it worked for me. not an oscar contender, just entertainment. you can really see how the movie has aged, especially with everything the internet has to offer nowadays. i still remember when this was first released and the net was still so new. crazy and scary thoughts when i saw this for the first time; i was 15 and seriously thought anyone could get a hold of your information on a computer and destroy you. but, who's to say it can't happen??? i'm not the type of person to nitpick a movie to death, analyzing it until i'm blue in the face. that's not my style. average acting, suspensful and once again, very entertaining. sandra bullock as angela bennett is so cute. this is my favorite movie with her in it because she's like the computer genius, which i find very attractive. of all the movies that were released in 1995, this would have to be my favorite, although, i didn't see it until 1996. my rating, 9/10 because it did slow down a little.

all the comments so far about this movie are negative but i have to say i found "the net" engaging. few movies can keep me on the edge of my seat but this one did. another plus for it is that most action/suspense films are full of language but this one had little profanity. i found it an enjoyable movie to watch. i am slightly biased though, being a big sandra bullock fan. *wink*

when this movie firt came out in 1995, i found it amazingly great. especially with sandra bullock.after having watched her brilliant performance in speed , i was ready to enjoy any of her movies.back to the net, it was a movie that keeps you in suspence.all in all, i enjoyed it so i give it a **** out of *****.

at last!! sandra bullock is indeed a beautiful woman, but i've finally found a film that she gets to be an actress! forget the predictable keanu-fodder of speed, forget the predictable kleenex-fodder of while you were sleeping - this tests her!and she is great! a techno-feminist role that really works well on screen, on a subject that is very close to the bone. the issues raised don't seem far-fetched at all and the whole experience, helped along by a fine supporting cast, makes for quite an un-nerving couple of hours.you may never enter another chat-room again, in fact i'm getting quite nervous just writing this review...er...bye!

this is one of the many techno-phobic movies that sprouted like mushrooms in the mid-90s, after the internet went mainstream.hollywood movies have always had their way in "beautifying" the depicted ongoings, to make them look better and more appealing. the same happens when hollywood tries to show us some hi-tech. the outcome of such attempts varies from being very far-fetched and ridiculous (see hackers (1995), johnny mnemonic (1995), etc.) to being quite realistic (see sneakers (1992))."the net" lies somewhere between those extremes. by nitpicking, one can end up with quite a lot of technical inconsistencies, and a lot of cases where the ongoings seem to be much more "sexy" and graphical than the way things are in real life (as usually happens in movies).however, by simply overlooking those, the viewer ends up with a quite solid, entertaining movie. the characters and acting are convincing, and the movie does a good job in keeping you in your seat till the end of it. the plot is okay (a fairly standard one, really -- based on the good ol' paranoiac design, but with a hi-tech edge this time), and quite convincing (again, when disregarding technical issues). the development of the plot is a bit sluggish, though, and occasionally you can anticipate some supposedly surprising turns in the plot.the bonus here is cutie-pie sandra bullock, which besides being cute (something she does quite easily, apparently), also portrays a solid act. you can really feel her character -- her despair, her emotions.in the bottom line, the movie is entertaining and interesting, rates about 7 from 10 in my scale. it's worth renting from the video library, or even watching in the cinema. whether to buy it or not is up to you.

just a short comment! i want to say that i like this movie very much! sandra bullock is my favourite actress. i like the whole story, from the beginning until the end! i have it on tape and i can watch it a 100 times, it doesn't matter!!!

this movie was suspenseful and fun to view. as i am a fan of these type of movies, i did enjoy this. the premise is kind of scary but the fact that i didn't rate this a 10 was because the movie was a little over the top in some areas.spoilers:cmon:nobody could identify this girl? i understand the concept of isolating oneself but i find it hard to believe that somebody-anybody wouldn't have been able to id this girl as angela bennet. that was over the top and so was the scene where she walked over to somebody's desk and started typing. this was overall a really good movie, suspenseful and keeps your interest. dennis miller was great as allen, really believable, bullock was good as the lonely reserved computer worker the bad guys all underestimated.i think the premise of the movie was really different-and scary. in today's times who knows what could happen? but some of the over the top scenes prevented this movie from being a 10. 8 of 10.

the net is an excellent movie! it's about angela bennett(in a great performance of sandra bullock) who is a computer expert who works for the cathedral company, cleaning virus and testing games for the clients. angela is a typical nerd who doesn't have friends outside of the cyberspace,almost doesn't take vacations and go out, and stays almost all the time connected. one day her friend dale hessman(ray mckinnon) asks her to help him,sending angela a disk with a strange program that has many confidential informations. at the same night, when dale was going to meet her, he is suddenly killed in a plane crash.going to mexico in her vacation,angela meets a beautiful guy called jack devlin (jeremy northam)who shows to be a cold blood killer bastard and one of the guys behind all the secret of the diskette.her life then turns into a nightmare: all her records are erased and she is given the new identity of ruth marx, a woman with serious problems with the police.this movie is great because it shows how we, humans,depend a lot of the computers and machines(sometimes more that we should) and how vulnerable we are if someday ,someone decides to control and change our personal records,without letting us the chance to prove the error.

if you're actually reading this review, i give you a lot of credit. you care enough to actually look up this movie, which most people have forgotten about and then cared to read beyond the first review! so for your reading pleasure...i'm assuming you know the plot line already so i won't waste time typing that out. i will mention that sandra bullock did an amazing job with this movie. she really brought a lot of sympathy to the role of a computer programmer, often difficult to do. i can say this because i happen to be a computer programmer.anyway, i thought the basic plot was a very good one. you can easily build sub-plots upon its mainframe and turn it into a very enjoyable movie. the premise is also scarily realistic in that this can all really happen if the right precauctions aren't taken.to make a long review short...oops! too late! if you enjoy sandra bullock bringing a role to life and want to see a very well made movie for the time, take a look at this little gem. you won't be disappointed. :-)

this is a typical sandra bullock movie in which she plays a mousy (but profane) woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero. sound familiar? there are plenty of holes in this story. things just don't add up and some of the suspense is a little corny. but - that suspense is very good. there is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it. the story starts off slow but kicks in pretty soon and stays that way, making it an involving movie for the viewer. that's why i give it a pretty good rating - the movie gets you involved in it. bullock is more cute than annoying, which she normally is to me, so this is my highest-rated movie with her in it.

i saw this stage show when it was broadcast on pbs in 1983. i was involved in local theatre at the time and had seen some pretty incredible stuff out of the dell arte players, but bill irwin floored me.i was most impressed at how a man of his size (he's quite tall and beefy) could fold himself up into a small box without so much as a pause for adjustment and move across the stage at a dead run without even a whisper of sound from his feet if he chose not to make any noise.most amazing for me, though, in this performance, was the way he rose to his feet during the jack-in-the-box / marionette piece. those who saw this show will recall that when he climbed from the box and collapsed to the floor with his body limp and limbs akimbo, he "pulled" himself up by the top of his head as if by a string, and rose not just to his feet, but to a full ballet point¬óand did it in one fluid, seemingly effortless motion. just consider the strength, grace, balance and focus such a series of movements must take in order to accomplish them the way he did! add to his physical prowess his strong and believable characterization skills, and there lies a consummate actor / performer. my jaw dropped at the movement and my heart broke at the portrayal of a puppet who is determined to be more than just a lifeless thing in a box.as to the unfortunate (yes¬ó"tragic" would be a better word) unavailability of this piece in home media form, i have noticed that much of pbs' works are not available on tape or dvd. sometimes, pbs shows will be available for direct purchase from them for a limited time immediately following a broadcast, but they seldom stay on the market for long. there are exceptions, of course, but these are mainly the science and history documentaries; rarely does an arts piece remain in print for long¬óassuming it ever made it into vhs / dvd to begin with. i don't know why this should be so; certainly, pbs could use the income from home media marketing of their shows, but they don't take advantage of it much. this is a shame. there are many things i've watched on pbs that i wish to own, but pieces such as "the regard of flight" are, i'm afraid, a one-shot, once in a lifetime treat, never to be repeated on pbs again and never to be available for home media purchase. that really sucks. i'm lucky to have caught it when i did.oh, yeah¬óour local library did get a copy of "the regard of flight." and yes¬óit was stolen.

i saw this performance on tv and taped it. my daughter played it over and over again. i loaned out at work and everyone just loved it. it is just brilliant physical comedy. bill made an appearance here in california, (he was working and living in new york) and performed the regard of flight on stage. i was able to take my daughter and her girlfriend to see this brilliant performance.bill was awarded a federal endowment, and my daughter wrote him a letter of congratulations, and bill was so kind to write her a note back and enclose a photograph.people ask me, and i can't decide if he is a comedian, and actor, or a clown. actually he is all three. i really wish this was on dvd, my tape is lost.

this adaptation for tv was a wonderful vehicle for bill irwin to show his ability to perform physical humor. with the backdrop of a struggle between an actor and his writer/director, bill uses his clowning antics to showcase a variety of skills including hat tricks, pantomime, dance and various physical devices.although it takes a big swipe at the entertainment industry and his craft, it is engrossing for people of all walks and ages.this work was televised as a pbs special. bill performed a piece of it on the tonight show, but out of context it did not go over well.

this film directed by george fitzmaurice, who made so many excellent films, is well up to his excellent standard. it is crisp, witty, with some wonderful lines, and has the inimitable ronald colman in the romantic lead. colman plays the irresistibly charming younger son of a wealthy english peer. he is financially irresponsible (spending, for instance, ¬£15 of his last ¬£20 in the world on a cute little terrier whom he names george), but open, wildly generous, contemptuous of lucre, irreverent in the politest possible way, and hopelessly sentimental. he is so dashing that all the women fall in love with him. his girlfriend is a star of the music halls, and hence in 1930 a denizen of the demi-monde, played with her typical svelte, narrow-eyed silkiness by the youthful myrna loy. fitzmaurice was not a great user of closeups, and gals of that day had their faces half-hidden with those awful clinging hats anyway, so we do not get as good glimpses of the faces of the two heroines as we would like. the director seems more interested in the charming colman, anyway. the romantic female lead is the youthful and fresh-faced loretta young, who had not yet become the proto-julie andrews we generally know her as, but was still a blushing girl exuding all the sweetness of a rose garden and laughing merrily and heartily the whole time. it is obvious that a character with her terrific sense of humour was needed to appreciate the snob-busting social anarchism of the refreshing aristocratic character played by colman. the plot barely matters, as is so often the case with these light and amusing films. this is just such fun.

ronald colman plays a prodigal son. while he is not a bad guy, he is a bit flighty and hasn't done a lot with his life other than travel the world and have a jolly good time. now that his latest venture in africa has failed, he's on his way home to england. his rich upper class father plans on tossing him out on his ear, though thanks to ronald's winning style, he is reluctantly welcomed back with open arms.at this point, there are two women in his life--showgirl myrna loy and rich girl loretta young (who is already engaged). how will all this work out and will ronald wise up and act like a responsible adult--these are the main themes of this pleasant little film.this isn't a great movie and certainly won't change your life, but it certainly is very entertaining and fun. most of this is due to the always genial acting of ronald colman. heck, in the heyday of his career in the 1930s, he could have played in reefer madness or some other dreck and still made it entertaining and likable due to his charming persona. his seemingly effortless style in this movie make it very easy to like him and it's easy to see why both loretta young and myrna loy are in love with him in the film! plus, the writing is very witty and make this a nice romantic-comedy.

do a title search on randolph scott and trail street is the one film missing from the list you've seen. one of 4 films scott made at rko during his prime (1947) the others are always easy to get. liberal, kansas is just southwest of dodge city and is a powder-keg about to explode between the trail-riders who drive the longhorns into trail street, the town's main street, and the sod-busters who feed our bellies. it'll take a strong man like bat masterson to step between the two groups and bring the town to order. more i won't say, except that scott movies usually have just one pretty girl and this one has three. randolph scott always played men you could look up to for their sense of honor, courage, level-headedness and willingness to do the right thing. fifty years ago parents could send their kids to a scott movie with confidence they'd learn positive values. robert ryan co-stars in this film, playing a good guy for a change. in real life, ryan was one of the many world war ii heros who starred in america's movies. how sad what we get these days. george clooney teaches our young that we ought sympathize with suicide bombers, while steven spielberg teaches there is no moral difference between the olympic athletes murdered in 1972 in munich and the palestinian terrorists who killed them. hollywood 2005 derives their moral compass from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the wacky left. i wonder how all this plays out in liberal, kansas. liberal, after all, was not a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named.

i read ashew's comment and thought they must have been watching an entirely different picture! i just watched the film this morning and was quite surprised.to address ashew's comments:trail street is a very well done western.and randolph scott was in it quite a bit! gabby hayes was funnier than i've ever seen him! the bad guys had very good comeuppances as far as i was concerned.plus:it was interesting to see robert ryan as a straight-laced good guy - he's usually so slimy.in all, a good western, very well acted and written.i liked the background story of kansas and the "winter wheat" that supposedly helped it become a state, too.i thought the girl who played susan was lovely - can't think why she didn't become a bigger star!

i'm so happy i recorded this on vhs tape when it was featured on master piece theatre. this is a movie i can watch again and again. like living in the early 1800's in england isn't hard enough, prue is born with a "hare lip" and is outcast from birth. the people in her village accept her somewhat but always fear that she is "from the devil's smithy" and are quick to turn on her. especially when a lot of bad luck befalls her family. she is strong and courageous but shies away from kester woodseaves, a traveling weaver who catches her eye. partly because she fears rejection and also because she thinks he is so virile that he should have a wife who is as lovely as a lily. kester is a modern man who does not believe in the superstitions of the time and he speaks his mind and follows his heart. the movie stays true to the original story by mary webb and is riveting from beginning to end.

when this was first aired on masterpiece theatre, it had a profound effect on me. it's beautifully filmed and acted. i immediately read the book by mary webb, and it remains one of my all time favorites. janet mcteer is wonderful as prue, and i fully expected her to become a regular on the british drama scene. i guess she chose to focus on the british stage instead. i was hoping that with the american success of janet mcteer years later(with tumbleweeds) this film would again become available to us. alas, it has not yet been released on dvd. if anyone out there is listening, please make this available again!

this is a charming movie starring everyone's favorite cartoon chipmunks. in this feature we follow the band of rodents on an unforgettable balloon race around the world. although there are lows, including an orphan penguin, all in all it's a great family film.

plot in a nutshell: dave seville, father figure & manager of the chipmunk brothers alvin, simon & theodore, has gone off to europe on a business trip, leaving the boys at home with miss miller as their watcher, much to the chagrin of alvin, who wanted to go to europe. while playing against his female counterpart, brittany, the leader of the chipettes, comprised of her younger sisters jeanette (the female counterpart of simon) and eleanor (the female counterpart of theodore) in a fierce arcade game of around the world in 30 days, they catch the attention of two evil foreign siblings who need to smuggle money & diamonds around the world, but need a way to do it that won't draw the attention of their arch enemy, jamal. the 2 evil siblings, claudia & klaus, overhear the banter between alvin & brittany and decide to use them as the delivery boys & girls for their loot (more claudia's idea than klaus's, the latter initially objects feeling that it's too dangerous for children). the 2 siblings make an offer to the boys & girls - travel via air balloons to 12 drop off points to leave dolls (which resemble the kids) that contain diamonds and/or money to indicate their arrival, with the promise that whoever wins the race will get an obscene amount of money. but as the two different set of talking animal siblings make their rounds, they are stalked by the henchmen of jamal - but who is jamal? is he friend or foe? overall: enjoyable, lighthearted farce based on the 1980s tv series version of alvin & the chipmunks. beautiful animation is a highlight, lacks the crude humor that keeps creeping into today's family films and engaging songs (boys & girls of rock & roll being a stand out). eagle eyed fans will probably notice that brittany's character design has been tweaked from the animated series, giving her a less round face while adding a seemingly permanent blush to cheeks (which jeanette & eleanor also display).keep an ear out for nancy cartwright, the voice of bart simpson.

i was -unlike most of the reviewers- not born in the 80's. i was born on may 14th 1994. despite this, my life was very much in the style of the 80's. when other kids had playstations, i was playing zelda on my nes etc. now, this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review. i, because of my 80's style early childhood, watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didn't see, and this movie was one of those, and one of the greatest too.it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville, simon seville, theodore seville and david seville. david, the chipmunk's adoptive father, is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe. his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack. while they are talking, alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world (even though, technically dave is only going to europe, so to alvin, apparently only america and europe qualify as ''the world''). david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller, much to the displeasure of the boys. soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller. later, at a local caf√© the chipmunks are playing a game of ''around the world in 30 days'' against the chipettes(brittany, jeanette and eleanore). after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile, alvin get's in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world. two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and, needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world, decide to fool the children into delivering them for them. they set up a race around the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness (secretely filled with diamonds) at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team's likeness (secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds) to ''varify that they were there''. the winning team would then receive a 100.000 dollar reward. they do this because they believe that jamal (an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (however, this seems to be redundant, because on their travels, the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls, i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally.) and so begins a great adventure. this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it. it features great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention the kick-ass music (pardon my french :p). my favorite song is without a shred of doubt ''the girls and boys of rock and roll'' an amazing rock song that cannot be topped. it's also my favorite moment in the film. other notable songs include ''getting lucky''(kind of suggestive for a kid's film eh?) and ''my mother'' as well as ''wooly bully'' and ''off to see the world'' not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra. the scene with ''my mother'' still brings a tear to my eye. in relation to the song ''getting lucky'' i first didn't think anything of it, but when i grew older and learned about life, it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive. that song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties. this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian prince's men, when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film, it's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. anyway, a bit after that scene, the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home. the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband, ross bagdasarian jr. know the characters better than anyone. they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes. ross doing the voices for alvin and simon (as well as dave) and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore. speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses, nancy cartwright (the voice of bart simpson) makes an appearance in this movie. she plays the part of the arabian prince, a very small, but important role. the ending is of course, a happy one. the crooks have been caught, the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children, dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset, alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100.000 dollar reward for winning the race, which annoys dave until he finally yells ''alvin!'' and the screen fades to blackclassic ending, by the way. i hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven't seen this flick, give it a watch, it's worth the money. this nostalgic classic from the 80's gets a solid 10 out of 10. ''headin' for the top, don't you know! we never stop believing now''

the feature length cgi movie has just been released this year, but whilst it will provide kids a lot of entertainment, for die-hard alvin fanatics and followers who grew up with the 60s and 80s versions of the cartoon shows, the chipmunk adventure is probably the best alvin and the chipmunks based animated movie, ever.for starters, the animation is as ever terrific, the character designs are as they should be in the cartoons- unlike the motion picture film itself, it is just sheer fun to watch. there are no celeb voices, no cgi generated effects, just pure quality 2-d, hand drawn animation and the colours are fantastic- bright, bold and beautiful. the jokes and humour is typical chipmunk standard and the narrative is spot-on. in truth, the chipmunk adventure is everything the live action movie ought to have been, but isn't. alvin, simon and theodore compete with the chipettes, elenor, jeanette and britney in a hot air balloon contest and along the way, the kids encounter all manner of problems and dilemmas that they have to resolve in their own way. and no chipmunk movie is complete without the odd renditions of classic rock and pop anthems.the chipmunk adventure is for kids and adults alike-, which is another advantage over the cgi movie- as whereas, the 2007 version will gain a few new admirers, the 1987 movie will appeal to both young and older chipmunk fans. bagdarasian and karman provide the helium-like voices of the film's trio.overall, this film is a must for fans of the cartoon shows themselves- you will not be left disappointed. if you have seen the live action version, then you'll feel that this movie is a much better effort in contrast. if you haven't then you should go and see it still, or even still forget the jason lee movie and as an alternative, stick with this

if your a child of the 80's and have not seen this movie you have failed to be a true child of the 80's. how can you not love those great chipmunks (don't forget about the chippettes), lines, and songs. years later i can still sing every word to every song. the story line is great and much better then the films for kids today. it's just pure fun and worth the rent, even if your all grown up.

i have been an avid chipmunk fan since the late 70's - early 80's. when this movie came out, it was a must to see it. and after seeing it, i went right over and bought it! the movie is great, i love the animated action it brings, and the music is great (yes, i bought the soundtrack on cd...) a recommended video for everyone to watch and enjoy!

this movie is a classic. kids now will love it, and people like me, who were kids when it first came out, still watch it for its nostalgic value as well as for its humor and great story. it introduces kids to different cultures and inspires them to adventure. it's not just a cartoon, it's a masterpiece. i love it.

i think it is great one of my favourite films as a kid and who said there songs were unforgettable they were mint i can still remember them now word for word the film remains a favourite with my family and my younger cousins are now addicted to it too they even know the songs this film is great and a enjoyable film for kids it has a moral lesson so don't say its not good because it shows how lying gets you nowhere ill leave with a parting comment: this film is amazing love me xxx p.s i would like the soundtrack but i cant and yes the animation is good the jokes are humorous and the action never stops.this film will go down in children's film history and in my opinion one of the only remaining safe films to show children.

i loved this movie and i never knew it was this old it came out the day n year i was born in and now i am 19 now i still love this movie especially the songs like "my mother" and "boys and girls of rock n roll" and i remember as a kid i believe i was 5 n my sister was 6 and my cousin (boy) was 6 as well we used to pretend to be the characters in the movie i was eloner and janette and my sister was britany and my cousin was alvin simon and theodore those were good times and i miss it and having this movie reminds me of the good times since my cousin is old for this stuff and so am i and my sis we are not going to forget about the chipmunk and the chipmunk movie i still even remember the songs and the words off by heart even though i haven't seen this movie for 12 years but now starting to love it again alvin and the chipmunks and chipettes <3<3<3<3

this was one of the best movies you could find as a child. i lived with the chipmunk adventure from 4 years old to 8 years old. the story of this film was: dave's going on a business trip to europe and sticks the boys with miss miller. while playing an around the world in 80 days video game, two villains, klaus and claudia (brother and sister), round the chipmunks and chipettes into an adventure in which the kids must hot-air-balloon their way across the globe. what they're unaware of is that the "game" is really a diamond-smuggling ring. and when found at the airport by the villains, a chase ensues! and which ends in klaus and claudia off to jail and alvin, simon, theodore, brittany, jeanette, and eleanor safe with dave and miss miller. but i am warning you now, this is a musical and quite a damn good one at that. most people hate musicals, but i am not one of those people, i frigging love musicals like rocky horror, grease, sound of music, cats don't dance, and just about anything (except for my fair lady). if you see this, share with your kids (if you got any)!

when i first saw this movie i was only a little kid and i fell in love with it, they really don't make movies like this anymore,i just watch this again now slightly older and still love it. the humour is perfect and fits into the movie really well, all the gags are kind of childish but will make adults laugh as well,and in a kids movie is really very rare. the animation is amazing and to watch hand-drawn animation is a real breath of fresh air to all the computer animation we see today. the backgrounds are stunning and the coloring is amazing.the characters are just the kind of characters that you fall in love with the moment you start watching girls will think the chipmunks are adorable and guys will think the chipettes are really kinda sexy.the songs are fun to listen too and some just really make you wanna cry or get up and dance, its also fun to watch visual humor to go along with them. the voice acting is great no doubt even if most of the voice acting is high pitch, but an interesting thing popped up and it one of the songs from this movie but the slowed down to show the real voices behind them and its really kinda fun to watch. if you see this movie in a store or somewhere to rent i say check it out it's really worth seeing and is a perfect family movie its absolutely amazing, words can not express this movie.

awwww, i just love this movie to bits. me and my cousins enjoy this movie a lot and i am just such a huge fan!!! i hope they bring the tv series out on dvd soon. come to mention it, i have not see the tv show in a long time. such geart times! where i come from australia the chipmunk adventure is only known by people in their late teens and adult years which is kinda sad because the young kids don't know what there missing.the songs in this film are ace the ones i love the most boys/girls of rock n'roll, diamond dolls and the song that ls sure to make you want to cry my mother.this film is sure to excite both young and old get the chipmunk adventure today!!! 10 out of 10, such an excellent movie.

"the chipmunk adventure" is one of the greatest animated movies of the 1980's. alvin and the chipmunks have always been of some interest to me, since they were what really got me into rock and roll. neither one of the chipmunks has any bad traits. alvin's really the star and has all the cool looks. theodore is the lovable sensitive one. then there's simon (my personal favorite), the smart one who is often a party pooper. i also like the chipettes a lot. there's brittany, who, like alvin, is one who is always trying to be so popular. then there's eleanor, who, like theodore, is sweet, sensitive, and loves food. janette is the only chipette who is not much like her counterpart; she's very naive and really clumsy.in the chipmunks' very first full-length movie, david seville is going on a business trip to europe, and he's leaving the boys with miss miller while he's gone. while playing an arcade game, alvin loses against brittany and then says that if he had the money, he'd race brittany around the world for real. unbeknownest to the kids, a man named klaus furschtien and his sister, claudia, who have been trying to come up with a sneaky way to deliver diamonds around the world in exchange for cash, overheard this conversation and said that they'd let them race around the world for $100,000. alvin and brittany accept it and go on the race.this adventurous movie has a lot of great songs. "off to see the world" made for an appropriate theme song for the movie. then there is "getting lucky", one of my favorite songs in the movie. "my mother" is most likely the sappiest song in the movie, but it always makes me cry. "wooly bully" is the only cover song used in the movie (the rest were completely original). then, of course, there's "the boys and girls of rock and roll", which, in my opinion, has to be one of the greatest musical numbers in movie history.i used to watch this movie very often, until my recorded tape of it died. i still watch the movie, though. this is actually a fun movie for people who are about to go on a vacation to a foreign country for the first time. it'll give you an idea of what kind of stuff you'd expect out of world travel. definitely one of my childhood movies, and one that i'd recommend to 80's fans and alvin & the chipmunks fans.

although it is more of a kids movie, it still holds its own, especially when compared to the more recent assembly line animated films being made. the music is fantastic!! i don't care how old you are, you will still find yourself rockin to "girls of rock and roll" and diamond dolls." definatly a must for animation lovers.

i loved this movie when i was a kid. i saw it theatrically. randy edelman did a good composition of the soundtrack. david seville is the chipmunks' father and recording manager. the chipmunks consist of alvin, who is best known for playing the harmonica, simon, who is a bright and studious chipmunk & theodore, who is the youngest and is always hungry. there is a lady known as miss miller, who looks after the chipmunks and has 3 daughters known as brittany, jeanette & eleanor, who all have the same character as the chipmunks. my favourite songs from this soundtrack include "diamond dolls", the girls of rock & roll", & the touching "my mother". alvin really wanted to see europe when dave had to go there for business. the chipmunks meet the chipettes playing the around the world in 30 days video game which led them to race each other doing the real thing.

to this day, there isn't a movie i've seen more times than the chipmunk adventure, nor has any movie brought me more happiness. this is by no means the greatest film or even the greatest animated film, but to an 8 year old girl in 1988 it was the coolest, funniest, most exciting film ever! i'm still equally as impressed today with the musical numbers, each one a standout song with wonderfully dramatic lyrics in the epic tradition of 80's pop (think pat benetar on helium, only catchier). controversy has stirred over the blatantly suggestive tone of the chipette's song "gettin' lucky with you", which to me seemed much more innocent at the time. however, looking at it as a rational adult, i can totally understand the concern; you've got three young girls in skimpy harem outfits passionately proclaiming "getting lucky is what it's all about". the chipettes' were definitely sexualized tenfold for this movie.but this controversial issue doesn't even come close to overshadowing the chipmunks' otherwise fabulous feature length animated adventure, i encourage parents and childless adults alike to check out this movie. especially if you were a child of the eighties/early nineties like me. :-)

the chipmunk adventure there are some movies that i could watch all my life and never grow tired of them, and this nostalgic favorite is one of them. the chipmunk adventure was a 1987 attempt to bring the old favorites back to the forefront of animation, this time on the big screen. in an age when disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation quality and box office, the chipmunk adventure stands as one of the best animated films that disney didn't produce in the 80's.the story is simple and elementary, having alvin, simon & theodore compete in an around-the-world race with the chipettes (janette, eleanor, & brittany). however, as the chipmunks encounter exotic dangers, they are unaware that they are the pawns in a major diamond heist.the chipmunk adventure never was and never will be a film that soars thanks to an engrossing plot. and to people who didn't love it as a child, the film will probably never be more then an enjoyable, yet forgettable, animated movie. but for me, it will always be a little known masterpiece. something about the film just clicks for me in a way few films do.every song is fun, upbeat, and harmless. highlights include the chipettes in a slightly risqu√© arabian dance to calm snakes. there's also a very sweet song in which the chipmunks sing about traveling the world and we get to see them at major landmarks throughout the globe. one thing about the chipmunk characters is that, despite the potentially annoying vocals, the songwriters always managed to write songs that were catchy without ever being grating. this film is no exception... it actually boasts one of the best animated movie soundtracks of the 80's if you ask me.every joke is cute, sincere and amusing. the bits between the bad guys and a pampered puppy are very amusing. and the shock of seeing the chipettes nearly forced into marriage by a child emperor is as well. the comedy manages to constantly play to the kids so that they don't miss anything, but everything remains charming for the adults with enough nostalgia to keep them entertained.it's really just a fun trip that is completely humble in it's ambitions. the chipmunk adventure never aims to be anything more then it is, harmless fun. i'll be the first to admit this is a biased review because i have such a nostalgic fondness for the chipmunk adventure that i would never be able to give it a bad review... but nonetheless, it fills me with such a childish contentment while watching it. everyone has their random favorite from childhood that no one knows, and for me it's this movie. and any film that i can watch over and over whether i am 5, 12, 23 or older is a great film in my eyes.... a- ...

one of my absolute favorite childhood films. the chipmunk adventure packs incredible fun geared for young and old alike. the animation is lively and colorful and the film itself boasts some of the best songs ever put in an animated feature. who could forget the dynamic "boys/girls of rock n' roll", the exciting "diamond dolls", and the heartrending "my mother"? this should be considered a nostalgic classic animated gem from the eighties. it's too bad they don't make them like this anymore. most animated films today resort to violence, crude humor, or sentimental mush... except of course the folks from pixar.bottom line: an amazing and unforgettable adventure for all ages.

i've loved this movie for a long time. i hadn't seen it in a while, so i again checked it out and actually found it even more enjoyable now. i loved the chipmunks cartoon when i was young, so naturally i adored 'the chipmunk adventure.'i honestly can't think of a better plot to this movie. it's not wildly creative, but i've always wanted to travel all over the world, and so i just have so much fun watching it as my longing to travel grows even more. the part with elenore singing to the little penguin always makes me cry...'the chipmunk adventure' will remain a favorite of mine forever, i'm sure. i guess it's because i saw it when i was so young. i don't think it would make quite an impact on someone older seeing it for the first time. (unless, of course, they have a young heart)

i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other. i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago. this movie contained an all-star cast, and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before. this movie was kind of long in length, but i enjoyed every minute of it. it is a movie that you can sit down with your family and watch, though we would have to cover the kids eyes a few times due to the discretionary love scenes. overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale. lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.

the family happiness is crumbling when, the from the beginning rich father ward (michael ontkean), gets poor and cannot support the family any longer. then the mother faye (jaclyn smith) has to take the role as the breadwinner in the family and starts to work in order to support the family and at the same time, periodically alone, has to manage the family life. not always that good, but as good as she can. the family life hardly gets easier when the father learns that the son lionel (joe flanigan "stargate atlantis") is gay and is living together with his lover john (joel gretsch "the 4400") also an old family friend, resulting in that the father makes clear to lionel that he is no longer welcome in the family. lionel is the one who meant the most to his sister anne (leslie horan) during her up-bringing, since the family neglected her. anne cannot stand the fact that their father have cut the cords with lionel and therefore she run away from home. as this wasn't enough, the son greg (brian krause "charmed") enlists in the marines and is sent to war. the storyline in this film can on some occasions feel a bit thin, in spite of that it still has a lot of realism in it, which makes it well worth seeing. since this film illustrates many sensitive relations and situations, i would believe that it is best appreciated by a mature audience even though it wouldn't hurt for teenagers to see it and get something to think about before adulthood.

once a year in america, saturday morning would give way to new cartoons, usually sometime in america. just about the time school started.i guess this was to make not having school on saturdays that more bearable.one friday night before the premiere of the new saturday morning cartoons, a movie came on."at the earth's core" i had not a clue who cushing nor mcclure were. clearly they were not from the same country, so i couldn't grasp why they were traveling together.i do recall seeing the mechanism in the fire-breathing monster's mouth.what connects this movie for me is the opening with the molten metal and then suddenly we get the band playing as we see the factory.how do you end a movie like this? the music again, and two bewlidered cops as the drill appears behind them.whatever reason, i remember watching this movie more that friday night than i do any new cartoon that came on the following morning.that was definitely the late seventies.it would be during jurassic park mania, cicra '93, i believe, before i would see this movie again.yes, people in costumes. there was the fire-breather again.still loved the ending with the two cops.finally, it would be nearly another decade before i would send off for the movie on dvd.now i would just watch the beginning and intro.oh, i do love much of the movie. of all these sci fi jules verne, hg wells, erb movies, this one stands as my fave.what i note now is that one of the cops begins turning around a wee bit too soon, then turns back, then he and the other cop are synchronized as they turn inward once again to look behind themselves at the drill.perhaps for me, this movie stands as the best of the saturday morning shows, which is why i enjoy it so much.

i'm serious as well, i mean don't get me wrong, if you haven't got a bent for this type of z grade, creaky creature feature {why would you be watching is my first thought?} then it's a rating of about 3 to 4 out of 10 tops, but to me it's a special kind of nonsense that takes me back to a nice time in my childhood. you know the kind, the memories that never leave you. eagerly taking it all in with youthful wonderment as doug mcclure and peter cushing tunnel beneath the mantle to do battle with a host of creatures and sub-human species'. and guys,! now we are all grown up we can admire most seriously at the wonder of caroline munro and her heaving cleavage. no wonder my older brother was keen to take me to the cinema to see this one!.yes the effects are bad, men in suits, strings pinging parrot monsters around and exploding rubber frog like thingies amuse us greatly. and yes, cushing and a surprisingly pudgy mcclure act as if they have truly been mesmerised by the evil meyhas at the "core" of our film. but it matters not, zany and clunky and awash in glorious colour, at the earth's core is a throwback to a special pre-ilm time when kids like me queued around the block to see such joyous nonsense. 8/10

rugged david innes (solid doug mcclure) and doddery dr. abner perry (a delightfully dotty peter cushing) drill their way into the earth's core in their spiffy mole machine. the duo discover an ancient prehistoric world populated by dangerous gigantic beasts and human beings who are used as both food and slaves by evil telepathic pterodactyl men. director kevin conner, working from a blithely silly script by milton subotsky, maintains a constant brisk pace throughout and treats the exceptionally foolish premise with astonishing seriousness, thereby giving this picture a certain clunkily earnest quality that's amusing and endearing in equal measure. the lovably hokey (not so) special effects are quite (unintentionally) funny. the cheesy array of cut-price creatures in particular are positively sidesplitting: cruddy guys-in-obvious-shoddy-rubber-suits pterodactyl men, equally rinky-dink savage ape-man brutes, and a hilariously ludicrous fire-belching frog thing who blows up real good. one gut-busting highlight occurs when mcclure mixes it up with a fat and clumsy giant reptile. another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur clutching a doll in its slavering jaws. moreover, we also get some rousing rough'n'ready fisticuffs and an exciting climactic slave revolt. it's a total treat to see cushing gleefully ham it up in a rare broad comedic part and become an unlikely, but enthusiastic arrow-slinging action hero in the last third of the flick. the ever-luscious caroline munro looks positively yummy as the fetching princess dia, plus there are nice supporting turns by cy grant as gallant warrior ra and sean lynch as treacherous coward hoojah. mike vickers' neatly varied score alternates between jaunty orchestral music and wonky droning synthesizer stuff. alan hume's crisp cinematography adds a glossy sheen to the infectiously inane proceedings. a complete campy riot.

time travel into the past is tenuous at best as a topic. in this episode a man who has been thinking about the possibility, finds himself at the date and location of the assassination of abraham lincoln. he tries everything he can think of in the short time available to him with predictable results. of course, he is thought to be quite mad. he is arrested and eventually remanded to the very man he is attempting to stop. serling was bright enough to let him return to the present, but is the present the same? this is kind of a precursor to "the time tunnel" where time travelers on a weekly basis were given the same task, overcoming what had already happened. unfortunately, the implications of the distortion of time and the future always negate the result. unless you have something like ray bradbury's "the sound of thunder."

the kid power hour featured two segments: hero high and shazam. let's start with hero high.hero high was intended to be a new archies cartoon, featuring their superhero identities: pureheart the powerful (archie), captain hero (jughead), superteen (betty), and evilheart (reggie). however, filmation couldn't get the rights to do it so they tweaked it a bit and came up with this. here's the breakdown of characters: captain california (archie), glorious gal (betty), weatherman (jughead), dirty trixie (veronica), rex ruthless (reggie), principal samson (mr weatherbee) and miss grimm (miss grundy). the show featured live action sketches, as well as cartoon adventures. the humor was the typical lame filmation jokes, but at least it had a sense of fun about it. it was entertaining enough for kids, though not quite up to previous standards.the other segment was shazam!, which was very faithful to the comics, unlike the previous live action show. all of the major villains made appearances, as well as the entire marvel family (including freckles marvel, in at least one episode). uncle dudley had the correct wc fields voice and shady character, as well as his perpetually acting up "shazambago". burr middleton, a veteran of 70's tv shows, like fish, voiced the big red cheese, while alan oppenheimer (rudy wells in the early 6 million dollar man episodes and voice of skeletor in he-man) handled dr. sivana.the marvels had always had a sense of whimsy to them, so little alteration was required for their adventures, to meet the broadcast standards and practices requirements (the censors). as such, the stories were very imaginative and inventive. amongst the villains who appeared were: dr. sivana, black adam, mr. atom, mr. mind, aunt minerva, ibac, and the crocodile creatures. mr. tawky tawny also made his on screen debut.hero high is due to be released from bci, but shazam! is still in limbo, as well as the live-action show. hopefully, the proposed movie will help shake them loose on dvd. it is well worth watching and deserving of dvd treatment.

the fact that this film was shown at london's barbican suggests to me that the print must have been acceptable enough for such a showing. now the question is, why isn't this long lost and important film available in dvd (or even vhs)? a large number of persons in europe and the usa have for many years hoped to see this film, if for no other reason than the wonderful music written for it by sergei prokofiev. what does one have to do to get such a wonderful production as this available for a wider public, not just patrons to the barbican at london? having been a devoted listener to prokofiev's music for many years and aware of this film, please, someone 'out there' do the right thing and bring it out as a dvd.

there have been several books that have cited this as the earliest gay cinema. i don't really see this as all that gay in the homosexual sense but then seeing two men dancing in what has to be the worlds first movie musical does have its attraction. there have been several earlier comments about this film dismissing any homosexual overtones. as to those that are quick to dismiss this film as just being silly and an experiment done late at night after too many drinks... well i've heard that story before. this film is of interest as an oddity and if folks want to consider it the first gay film so be it. better this than the depressing 1919 anders als die andern.

this film is an eery, but interesting film. i will tell you why it is eery later in this review.the film is interesting because it was the first film to ever contain sound. no, it may not be a one hour and forty two minute film, no it may not contain great action scenes, but it is still a wonderful film to me. it sparked a whole knew revolution if you will, of sound movies. this can be a little eery to watch, knowing that everyone in that film are now dead, i can hear the voice of a man in the beginning who no longer walks the earth visible, and that the sound is cracky and broken.i recommend this video for everyone to watch. this created movies as we know it today!

this is a pretty interesting experiment to watch. it's the first ever, still existing attempt, to unite sight with sound. it features two men dancing to a violin player (possibly william k.l. dickson himself), who is standing next to an edison recording cylinder, that is capturing the sound.the sound and images were not linked together as one yet. and it wasn't until recently that the sound and image have been added technically together. it's probably the reason why people hesitate to call this movie the first ever sound picture.the movie is made by william k.l. dickson, a assistant to thomas edison himself who ordered him to come up with a way to unite pictures and sound. the answer he provided was the kinetophone, a kinetoscope (basicly a large wooden box with a peephole in it, so people could watch the moving images) with a cylinder phonograph inside of it, for the sound. this is the first, that we know off, surviving movie-experiments that feature this technique. all of the later movies using this same technique were shot as silent movies and sound effects were recorded later and separately. so the kinephone was not an attempt to synchronize sound and images but more an attempt to have images accompanied by sound. in some cases, people could even choose from three sound cylinders, featuring 3 different orchestral performances to accompany the images. only 45 kinetophones were ever made so you could hardly call the kinephone a success. also after this experiment, focus went off to other cinema techniques, mainly regarding movie-projectors.so the experiment itself obviously did not become a success, also since it took over 30 more years before the first movies with sound were made and commercially released. they just couldn't yet technically synchronize and put the sound and the images together yet at the time and even if they could and techniques would had been available, it would had been a very expensive job to do so. it therefor really isn't the most influential or historically important movies out of cinematic history but it's very interesting to watch, how people constantly tried to improve the quality and techniques of early cinema and movie-making.8/10

you got to love this movie! i mean, what other swedish splatter movie could be so evil, bizarre and totally cruel...the whole movie is stuffed with some kind of weird humor, like: the old cencoreguy just blows his head off and the boss just wipes the blood off his glasses and says with a mean voice: - your fired!!! wouppie!!!

h.o.t.s. is one of those sexy 70's drive in movies that features many of playboys famous playmates from the 70's like sexy tall blonde susan kiger,pamela jean bryant,lisa london,kc winkler and the late sexy angela ames.and would you believe a post partridge family danny bonaduce?its the snobby girls verses the good girls(the hots girls)led by susan kiger.there's a couple of comedy relief gangsters,a runaway bear,a trained seal,misplaced bras,etc;etc;think animal house meets hooters.h.o.t.s. is an enjoyable little comedy with t& a no complaints here.i actually think that susan kiger was one of playboys sexiest playmates from the 70's.she did do a few more movies including deathscreams.if you like fun drive in movies you will no doubt enjoy h.o.t.s. 7 out of 10

h.o.t.s. is not for those that want hardcore porn. instead, this film is a precursor to many 80s era cult-classic college/frat films like revenge of the nerds and porky's and a post-cursor to the world-renown animal house. a good time if you dig a lot of big-titted 70s/80s playboy type chicks and cheezy slap-dick comedy - but nothing too notable if you wanna use it as whack-material...h.o.t.s. is an "unauthorized" sorority of sexy outcasts doing battle against the popular and trendy pi girls. this one has pranks, an aunt jemima-ish house keeper, and even an over-heated robot that makes it relatively fun viewing if boobies are your "thing"...well...i like tits as much (or probably more...) as the next guy - but with all the sleazy sh!t that i've seen, i couldn't help but wish for a few hardcore scenes to make this one truly worthwhile. i knew it wouldn't happen, but i still wish that h.o.t.s. had a bit more sex and a bit less cheeze. not quite as notable as nerds, porky's, or animal house, but worth a look for fans of those types of films...7/10p.s... and i forgot - this one has consummate douche-rag danny bonaduce in probably the best role of his career outside of his "reality show"...

of course, going into it, one would expect it to be a typical, stupid t&a flick, and it is. but it really does have some fairly well thought out humorous moments. given the era in which it was made, and the obvious exploitation aspect, it is still one of the better b comedies of the time.while watching this movie, you will see quite obviously the inspiration for many of the scenes in "revenge of the nerds", and numerous other films of the same genre. most of the acting is horrible, and way over the top, but that's exactly what i expect in a movie like this. what it lacks in the way of acting ability, it more than makes up for with its camp value and complete disregard for anything of merit.the amazing thing about this movie, is that there was obviously some money that went into it. films like this made today just don't have the same style. if you can turn your brain off, and turn your sense of humor up for an hour and a half, you will enjoy this flick. i dare anyone to not find at least something in this movie that they think is funny, if not hilarious.

i agree that this film achieved its goals perfectly. i saw it on showtime late at night as a teenager, and again in college. i thought it was funny. and there are boobs everywhere! it seems like in the late 70s and 80s there were loads of this type of film made, from r-rated films like "porkys" to soft-core "au pair girls"; it's a shame they seem to have fallen by the wayside in terms of popularity. the thing that made hots great was that, like the previous two films, it's a hell of a lot of fun. hots is like a girl-power version of "animal house", with the girls forming a sorority of sorts and engaging in campus bedlam. on a side note, whoever designed the "hooters" girls outfits must certainly have seen this film.

i watched this film with my family over a long thanksgiving holiday weekend. i am thankful that someone insisted that we watch it, though i didn't pay much attention until the end of the film when a head shearing seems promised, but, alas, doesn't happen.on the other hand, i watched this movie some years later and loved its liveliness, absurdity, sparkle, and just plain fun. i think that the film has a female tone. women are not exploited in it even though i am sure that someone might think that the movie is pure exploitation. i think the movie plays with tropes of the period.i keep thinking someone ought to remake it. and flesh out some of the implications in the original.

it is always great to see a movie that teaches us about history in africa as they are definitely too few. however, the movie depicts lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist one..., i felt it hard to sympathise with this kind of leadership, yet the movie is somewhat like a homage to the man. there was too little content, explaining how the man got to rise in the first place, and the whole context of belgium "letting them go". so it is certainly worth going to see as the acting and photography are excellent, especially mobutu himself. i would just have liked a better political analysis.

in the film, lumumba, we see the faces behind the monumental shift in the congo's history after it is reclaimed from the belgians, and we see the motives behind those men into whose hands the raped and starving country fell. lumumba is not a movie for the hyper masses; it demands the attention of its viewers with raw, truthful acting and intricate, packed dialogue. little of the main plot is shown through action, it relies almost solely on words, but there is a recurring strand that is only action, and it is the stroke of genius that makes the film an enlightening and powerful panorama of the tense political struggle that the congo's independence gave birth to. this film is real. it is raw inits depiction of those in power, and those on the streets. it is eye-opening in its content. and it is moving in the passions and emotions of its superbly portrayed characters. whether you are a history fan, a film buff, or simply like good stories, lumumba is a must-see.

first of all, it is interesting to note that one of the users here who commented on this film (from belgium) had to add that lumumba was "communist." if this user indeed watched the film, the message was that he was not communist but pigeonholed (by none other than belgium, the u.s., the un, etc.) as a "communist" leader for other individuals', corporations', and country's political and economic gains. even if one decides to accept that the film partakes in "revisionist history" it would be naive to assume that lumumba was communist, especially coming from the country which "granted" the congo independence, and since lumumba was elected democratically to his seat as prime minister.onto the film...this is one of the most important and powerful films i have seen in quite some time. depicting the struggles of the african freedom fighter, and elected prime minister's struggles as its first leader, mr. peck, does a quite commendable job of putting together all of the pieces into one work. and this must have been quite some task. due to the fact that most people outside of the congo and belgium likely do not know the history of lumumba and the congo, outside of some light coverage of african imperialism (hopefully) in one of their high school/secondary school (or maybe university/college level) history classes, he had his work cut out for him.and to to think that oliver stone's "jfk" took over 3 hours, "lumumba" runs under 2 hours. and a most engaging 115 minutes it was, as we find that his desire to not compromise with western powers (whom he holds responsible for the atrocities to his people, particularly belgium), while trying to deal with power struggles within his own borders, apparently even with some of his friends, it is amazing that the man lived as long as he did.this is a must see for anyone interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics, and true freedom. you will not be disappointed.

good movie, acting was terrific especially from eriq ebouaney(lumumba)and very well directed.it also shows how lumumba was cornered by the belgians, u s a and united nations and how they labelled him a `communist' to scare people as they did to all the honest true african leaders like nkrumah, kenyatta, nyerere and many others. it shows how western countries preach democracy while they have something else on the back of their minds. it is a story of injustice, struggle and brutality.it shows how lumumba couldn't control his people, yes they were his people, but before we put the blame on him, was he getting enough if any from the people he appointed in his government like mobutu? or his colleague had other things in their minds, to find out go and see the movie! certainly mobutu did, went on to loot the country for the next 35 yrs, before he was overthrown and fled the country. died a billionaire.some flaws: there was too little explanation how the man (lumumba) got to rise in the first place. also there should have been more explanation about the country, congo kinshasa (after independence), now known as democratic republic of congo formerly known as zaire when it was under mobutu. there should have been an explanation why he (lumumba) couldn't keep the second largest country in africa in one piece. and also what was going on with tshombe and katanga . just heads up if you gonna watch the movie tshombe was controlling the katanga region which (if i am not mistaken) is the number one copper producer in the world.in all it is a good movie to see. you will learn something new about africa, it's leaders and it's people and probably will open your eyes why this continent is ridden with wars.

the story of how the (communist) leader who freed the congo from belgium imperialism was eliminated by the western powers through the hand of mobutu. a story of struggle and injustice, of hope and the search of freedom. the story could be the one of any african country. a very moving film with images full of symbolism and beauty. if you have to see only one foreign film this year, see this one.

an excellent, thoughtfully produced historical drama--well played, artfully written, shot in ways that convey accurate visual images of the congo, and with more than a few moving moments, especially for those who care about the history of africa and imperialism. however, a fair amount of worthwhile content gets lost in translation, and because names, acronyms, and so forth are hard to follow. so i would strongly recommend checking a neutral source such as wikipedia to get a basic sense of the story being depicted (and the subsequent history) before enjoying the film. if you have the dvd version, there is also some useful historical background. there is a point towards the end of the film where the name of a character who then speaks with an american accent is actually beeped out--a simple google search of "lumumba film censor" or something similar will reveal a truly fascinating (and perhaps disturbing) twist regarding the production of this important film. this film, if coupled with a little outside research, helps contextualize dozens of other films relating to central/east africa and/or imperialism, e.g. hotel rwanda, shake hands with the devil, various adaptations of conrad's heart of darkness, and even "ali" when mohammed ali visits kinshasa.

when it comes to political movies i usually come out feeling empty. they generally take up some moralistic stance and you have a clear good vs bad story line as if it is some sort of batman movie.but with lumumba it is the first movie i've seen that showed politics for what it is, and the real issues of trying to rule a country of broken people who have known no other rule but violence. there were no good or bad there were just interests and conflicts of interest. this is the only political movie in my opinion that one can come out of it truly learning something. especially for anyone with their eye on politics as a career this movie shows you, you cannot rule on what you want for a country, but what the country wants from you.that's why i disagree with a lot of reviews that say everyone comes of bad, i think they come of too idealistic, (the belgians want the perfect colony, lumumba wants a perfect unity congo, tshombe wants wealth and riches, america wants the perfect ally against communism, russia wants the perfect aide for communism). and the congolese? they come off used and abused, ( best example in the movie when g√©n√©ral janssens tells his black troops your government lied to you and it leaves them all in an uproar) they are always being pulled and pushed into supporting this person or another.this movie shows in politics a mistake can cost you dearly and this movie everyone makes mistake after mistake until it escalates and ends up destroying the country. their intentions might be good (or at least in the characters opinion), but it's everyone's mistakes that lead to the downfall of congo. i don't think anyone is bad in this film, i just think they want too much from people sick of giving and want to start taking.overall, it's not just the best political film, it is a great film in general. acting is fabulous (eriq ebouaney as lumumba was perfect casting i really believe him) script flawless, editing perfect pace, and production value higher than i expected for a central african film. a must watch.

to answer the question of a previous reviewer who asked the name of the u.s. official mentioned in "lumumba", the name of the character is "mr. carlucci." frank carlucci is reported as having been at that time second secretary at the u.s. embassy in the congo. subsequently, among other assignments, he was appointed u.s. ambassador to portugal, deputy director of the central intelligence agency, secretary of defense, and is now the chairman of the carlyle group. it's hardly surprising that carlucci's biographical sketch on his www.carlylegroup.com web site fails to credit his service in the belgian congo. if his name was deliberately censored from the hbo version of "lumumba" it may have been to avoid the possibility of hbo's being sued in u.s. courts. carlucci's name, however, is clearly mentioned in the theatre version of "lumumba" that i saw recently. in the event, i expect that he would deny any involvement in lumumba's murder.others have commented on the evenhandedness with which the film "lumumba" treats the parties concerned: lumumba-supporters, other congolese, even belgians. a somewhat more sinister view emerges, i think, from the bbc documentary entitled "who killed lumumba?", based on the book "the murder of lumumba" by belgian historian ludo de witte. when examined closely, these films demonstrate that the fate of lumumba and the history of the congo is not just a matter of black and white. only lumumba's murderers believe that.

i feel very fortunate to have the chance to not only watch this film, but also learn more about this fascinating person and time. lumumba is an outstanding portrayal, giving a full sense of the story without falling into the usual hollywood trappings - yes, he is shown with his wife and children, but the essence of the story is his politics and those of the still-emerging independent congo. the film is brilliantly made, moving along at a pace that is consistently engaging. i look forward to seeing other raoul peck films, as well as more from eric ebouaney!

this movie is the best movie i have seen in a long time. it is also the best movie seen that uses a drama to tell history, without going to speculation such as with jfk,nixon or hoffa. it deftly depicts the clutches that belgium had on the congo. it also teases out easily for us the european and american forces that were behind the power the inflict the congo today. the film was sure to specifically implicate the u.s., rightly so, in the murder of lumumba. this film could never be made in the u.s. for u.s. film rarely criticizes itself in acts of imperialism and murder. (save stone's jfk) it also lets us in on the problems that were present with the inner conflict of the congo, between lumumba, mobutu and katanga. we can see how precarious countries sit in establishing new governments when their history is one of colonization and those who were the colonizers continue to pull the strings of power and force. the film is excellently shot with eriq ebouaney an excellent lumumba. the cast is great and they really draw you into the feeling of the climate in the congo during that time.again, this is a must see for those who love drama with a correct historical background. see my notes on quilombo.

i have never read a jacqueline susann novel, but i have also seen valley of the dolls, based on another of her books. on both occasions i thought the movie is probably better than the book and will further improve with age (certainly contrary to the books). the reason being that a movie focuses more on a specific style in fashion, design and behavior patterns. and in this aspect the love machine offers quite a lot. the set design fits the story perfectly. and all the characters fit in, too. they're perfect in the way that they complete a well balanced general picture. they are superficial and do not develop, it is true, but in this movie i wouldn't want it any different.david hemmings reprises the role he played in antonioni's blow up. and it's more than a rip-off. he's a fashion photographer, looks visibly aged and seems to start going slightly to seed. robert ryan reprises the role he played in max oph√ºl's caught, he is smith ohlrig all over again, greedy, bored and boring, uninspired and uninspiring. it's possible ryan did not want to be in this picture and acted accordingly, on the other hand he might have thought a lot about his part and then given a carefully studied performance. whatever happened, it fits the picture. dyan cannon is great (fantastic wardrobe!), she dominates every scene she's in and is involved in the two highlights of the movie: the burning of a luxurious bed and the knocking down of the hemmings character with a academy award statuette.the title, the love machine, is, of course, meant ironically. robin stone is a kind of a barry lyndon of the pop era (incidentally, the movie is slightly kubrickysh). that he chooses a tv station to work his way up to the top seems to be a mere coincidence. he sees love (meaning sexual favors) merely as a means for personal advancement. there are rather scary hints of a troubled sexuality which are not explored in the movie. homosexuality is treated very casually, probably not the standard for mayor movies of the period. the open cynicism of the tv executives need not fear comparison with other good movies about the subject like a face in the crowd or network or truman show. they are producing crap, they agree among themselves it's crap and they know they will make a lot of dough with it.i did not regret spending the odd 108 minutes with this movie and would not be surprised if it picked up a cult following, provided it's given the chance (meaning a dvd release).

why is there so much angst among the imdb reviewers who hate this film? it isn't a masterpiece, but having viewed it twice it does come across as compelling drama set in the world of network tv. robin stone is the epitome of every dan rather, phillip stone, and brian what's-his-name on nbc. a mannequin of a man incapable of love who succeeds professionally, but fails miserably in his personal life. i worked for eight (8) years in network news and robin stone's do exist!the supporting cast works for me from cannon (who can be annoying, but isn't in this film) to greene (who plays pathos just right) to wexler (who scores as the young model in love w/ the image of prince charming and can't reconcile that image w/ the true ugliness inside). also of note is the ending which some imdb reviewers claim is a cop-out. it's not! listen to the song "he's moving on" for clues as to the arc the robin stone character travels that brings him to finally face his issues. he realizes the answers don't lay w/ the life he's lived and the symbolic walk away from those he's associated himself with, at the end is perfect.

well, where to start? i stumbled across this one in 1993 and just hit "record" on the vcr out of habit, more than anything else. "citizen kane" it sure isn't...but if you've had a bad day and are in the mood for crashing out in front of something not too intellectually stimulating, then i tentatively suggest this might just be your "thing".we have the lot here - great title track, more stereotypes than you could shake a stick at, unconscious comedy, the bitchiest fight scene of all time and more, more, more! david hemmings plays the diametric opposite of his role in the 60s classic "blow up" - still a photographer, still hormonally stimulated but not "quite" the same.john philip law is easy to slam as an actor who makes a log appear unwooden but that wouldn;t be fair seeing as how he had about 5 minutes notice before accepting the role.wexler as "amanda"? suffice to say it was her one and only film role! the real star of this movie, though, is ethel evans who plays a, shall we say secretary (?), with the morals of an alley cat and an ambition to match. the way she manages to reconcile her present life with that of a future with her comedian husband-to-be is actually quite touching in an earthy, gritty, what-is-to-be-will-be way.i actually love this movie when i'm in the mood for it.......and wouldn't touch it with the proverbial bargepole when i'm not.kudos to the cast for keeping a (relatively) straight face when filming.a "classic" in the edward d wood school of cinematic endeavours!

nothing is worse than the genocides of our world's history. this film attempts to describe the horror faced by one particular family - a common narrative device - in the atomic bomb world of hiroshima. the most memorable parts are the graphic and saddening images that the people of hiroshima face in the aftermath of war. the story, however, becomes more concerned with the effect on a specific group of people and how they cope with getting on with their lives; in other words, if you don't really care about them, the film grows boring. it's hard not to care, though, when a family's homeland is wrecked. i'm not sure if i would recommend this film, because it says very little politically and, honestly, did not keep my interest in the family's troubles.

in the light of the recent typhoon that hit the country hard (that is, typhoon ondoy), i thought it upon myself to re-watch "black rain" (1988, japan), shohei imamura's haunting black-and-white masterpiece on the destruction and after-effects of the atomic bomb that hit hiroshima in the closing period of the second world war. the destruction and impact of both catastrophes (war and typhoon) may differ in degree and quality, but the trauma and scar (physically and psychologically) nevertheless are still there. it is a testament to a film's power that its images remain as potent and as indelible as when they were first seen. it is only that the difference now, in my case, is that watching those images has assumed a greater sense of poignancy and potency due to a first-hand experience of a near-monumental weather calamity. there is a sense of kinship, so to speak. imamura has always been one of my favorite japanese filmmakers. his films are always a pleasure to watch because of their anarchy, sensuality and earthiness:"the pornographers:introduction to anthropology" (1966), "eijanaika" (1981), "warm water under a red bridge" (2001), his two palme d'or-winners "ballad of narayama" (1983) and "the eel" (1997), to name some. given the mood of his films, who would have thought that he once served as an assistant director to yasujiro ozu, japanese cinema's most austere and minimalist filmmaker? but then, it is ozu's rigorous formality and domesticity that imamura was rebelling against. but then again, with "black rain" one can unmistakably sense ozu's imprints. the father (or the father-figure) being intent on seeing his daughter get married before time runs out on both of them, and the stillness and calmness of the scenes showing all members of the family together (notably, the dinner scenes or in ozu's film lexicon, the tatami) are something that the revered master filmmaker would perennially explore in his works ("tokyo story", "late spring"). essentially, the over-all subdued and deliberate quality of "black rain" is a remarkable contrast to the bacchanalian chaos and instinctual drive of imamura's entire filmography.still, this is not to say that watching the film would not be an altogether unsettling experience. "black rain", as aptly described by american film reviewer leonard maltin, is "filled with haunting black-and-white images." in the film's first 15 minutes, imamura pulls no punches in showing the immediate and graphic horrors of the nuclear bombing, one after another (stiffly-burnt bodies, hanging flesh, walking dead, fires and debris everywhere, madness all over). an assault to the viewers' senses, definitely it is, coupled with takashi kawamata's somber b/w photography (he did the lensing in yoshitaru nomura's crime drama "the incident") and toru takemitsu's chilling score (he did the music in such classics as akira kurosawa's "ran" and masahiro shinoda's "double suicide"). even during the film's supposed "tranquil" phase (that is, five years after the atomic bombing), one can still never have a sense of contentment and order, with the uneasiness and pain still being strongly felt by the survivors, not only in terms of failing physical health, but more so in terms of psychological trauma and social stigma. the human race, it now indisputably appears, has been destined to bear the legacy of the bomb, for as long as it lives. i already wrote a piece about "black rain" some years earlier (posted in imdb.com), but only in comparison to volker schlondorff's magnificent "tin drum", another film dealing with monumental human folly and global catastrophe. moreover, it has never been my practice to write twice about a film that i already wrote something about before. it is in the light of the recent weather calamity that devastated our country that i was prompted to re-visit and write something again about this remarkable imamura film, as there is a wealth of lessons to be learned from both the film and the recent event in regards the imperfections and dangers of scientific knowledge and action, and the long-term scars and wounds inflicted by a wide- scale destruction (whether human- or nature-induced).there have been a number of films dealing with nuclear holocaust and destruction ("testament", "threads", "the war game", each situated within their own respective countries);and "black rain" stands among them, if not more so, for both its unapologetic and somber portrayal of individual and communal disintegration brought about by atomic devastation and the fact that it has a historical event as its basis.few weeks from now, another disaster film from hollywood, roland emmerich's "2012", will finally hit (no pun intended) the big screen. as we all know, this american director's bunch of "disaster/apocalypse" films--"independence day", "godzilla", "the day after tomorrow"-- serves no other purpose than to be of mere entertainment value, with no real insight into the nature and wisdom of apocalyptic disaster and the human condition being affected. i wonder how this "gigantic" movie would exploit the trauma, disorientation and apprehensions still being experienced by our people because of the recent weather calamity. to say that this flick is a precautionary tale would probably be no more than an overstatement. but yes, i will still watch "2012".

i've loved this movie since i was a little kid. i remember the night my mother brought this movie home for me. i loved it and i still do. i think it's very funny and original. there are also some very catchy tunes in this movie. lou is also a surprisingly good singer. the actors that portray prince arthur and princess eloise are okay too, but abbott and costello are the best. former heavyweight boxing sensation buddy baer, also brother of former heavyweight champion max baer is good in this movie as the cop and the giant. he's a better actor than boxer. he had a natural talent. the beginning of this movie is hilarious how lou costello keeps crashing the car and how he gets into trouble with buddy baer. the slapstick in the house is good too. i especially like the comedy in the giant's castle. my favorite parts are; the part were lou is climbing the beanstalk and they're all singing as a farewell. jack is singing back to them that he'll return. lou costello is a very good at singing. my other favorite part is the part when jack is fighting with the giant. i like when jack makes exploding eggs and when he tries to make the giant an omelet they keep exploding. abbott and costello are hilarious and the greatest comedians of all time. this is only one of their great movies that i will love and cherish. the reviews for this movie aren't very good and i can't understand why. this is a very good abbott and costello movie. i also love how lou costello comes back to reality in the end and thinks he's back in the dream when bud hits him. he starts singing his song and leaves with an attitude like no one is going to push me around. very good movie.

there is a bunch of movies that we say must be seen twice. in most cases this is mainly a recommendation: you understand the movie anyway after the first viewing, and watching it for the second time helps you catch the plot twists you just did not notice. however, for mulholland dr. this is different. the sequence that worked for me was: see it first time - spend a day in internet trying to figure out what this was all about - and then see it second time. otherwise most likely you will not be able to enjoy this film to the full extent. then you start to understand that this piece is ingenious, camera work is stunning, and the aftertaste follows you for weeks.9/10

mullholland drive proves once again that david lynch is the master of cinematic expression. at the screening last night i witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema. the performances are astounding, the score entrancing, and the photography mesmerizing. david's ability to weave the many elements of film making into a unique and stunning cinematic experience is unequalled. as i watched mullholland drive i couldn't help but realize that with david lynch in this world we are truly blessed. the cinema is blessed as well for, in the films of david lynch, we are shown that one man's vision can be realized with stunning results. we realize that blockbusters are not the only path. we realize that a true cinematic artist has a chance in this world and in that we are blessed indeed.

with an opening segment that imitates the music and cinematography of todd haynes's safe (1995), david lynch uses dream, myth and warped notions of reality to tell the fractured story of a failed bit-part hollywood actress/waitress, diane selwyn, let down by fame and her own demons and obsessed with camilla rhodes, who is engaged to hotshot director adam kesher.the film effectively takes place in diane's drug-fueled head; we are witness to her crazy distortions, her wish-fulfillments, regrets, obsessions and fears. using the dream narrative as a way of presenting two notions of reality in conflict, lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy but actively entangles them. the last 45 minutes are as dream-like as what came before; and the troublesome air of detached, otherworldly ambiguity still pervades, fracturing the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream we expect to see in films about nightmares and dreams.lynch's film borrows from many films, old and new, but ultimately is a film unlike any other with the exception of the director's own lost highway and blue velvet. it constantly challenges the viewer to interpret what is seen, not only intuitively but intellectually. yet it is not as pretentious as one would have imagined because lynch makes us sympathize with the protagonist despite her murderous deeds - an element that was missing in all of his other films except the straight story. he does this by presenting diane's dream alter-ego, betty, as a wholesome canadian farm girl destined for fame. lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that affirms and negates in equal measure. are camilla and diane really lovers or just friends? who is the blue-lady? what does she signify? who is the bum behind winkies? what is the significance of the rotting corpse at sierra bonita? does aunt ruth really exist? is silencio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self-referential take on the film's status as fiction? lynch isn't prepared to answer any question he poses, choosing instead to present his "love story in the city of dreams" as a set of interconnected abstractions and motifs.the acting is top rate, especially naomi watts as diane selwyn/betty, who is yet to eclipse this performance. laura harring has the requisite hayworthesque allure as camilla/rita, while adam theroux as adam brings an freewheeling arrogance and sublimated paranoid aggression to his role. it was staggering and a grave injustice that not one of them was even nominated for an academy award.this is a film that demands to be seen and analyzed closely. the mystery at the heart of the film remains in lynch's hands but half the fun is finding consistent ideas from the maze of seeming incongruities that he presents. upon closer inspection there is a definite sense of a puzzle, perhaps an incomplete jigsaw that teases us with closure but denies the imaginary plenitude of narrative coherence. ultimately, this is lynch's key film.

wow, what a strange film. it's a david lynch movie so it's no surprise that it is weird. i defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film. i can't be done. after some research following my second viewing of this film, i pretty much know most of the story but on a first look, and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help, it is hard to figure things out. so, if you're in that boat and was confused, don't feel bad; that's normal. let me just say the key to the film is naomi watts' character.at any rate, i find the film fascinating. i love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch. the camera-work is excellent and the music is creepy, a la lynch's "blue velvet." there also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes. in all, it's very well scored.like lynch's "twin peaks" television series, this was a film in which the end was pieced together afterward since lynch thought this film was going to be a long, drawn-out tv series. when that didn't happen, he pieced at the last minute this ending. that may account for some of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations concerning characters we see earlier in the film but who mysteriously disappear.the theme of the story, supposedly, is a negative comment about hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed.both watts and the other leading lady, laura eleana harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their celebrated lesbian sex scene. looks- wise, both women were chameleons, looking average at times, stunning at other times.i enjoyed this movie more on the second viewing than the first. it's not just a curiosity piece; it's a very intriguing movie.....just don't feel stupid if you can't make sense of a few things.

david lynch's ninth full length feature film, mulholland drive is a deeply touching story about betrayal and jealousy. if anything, it brutally contrasts our ambitions and hopes to the often bitter truth. every frame of this movie has importance and links to other parts and to themselves at the same time. nothing is what it first appears to be and you're left with a real puzzle as you end up trying to put the pieces together. it is a movie that does not compromise, nor does it fail to fully handle the challenging form and camera language, as might have been the case earlier with lost highway.although one clearly recognizes classic lynchian motifs and devices, the movie remains highly original, even in the light of it being a lynch movie. lost highway marked a new way of telling a story; bred an unconventional mean of setting emotions on to the screen. with mulholland drive, lynch not only managed to control this technique, but takes it to new levels in making it much more complex and multi dimensional. in doing this, he creates a framework of different layers in time and of the human mind. in a press conference on the cannes film festival 2001, david lynch said that striving for perfection at best could give a result where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. talking about synergies like this becomes highly relevant to mulholland dr. where the different sequences and many details contribute to the total; dreamscapes and parallels intertwine to create the story. in some art, the beauty of it lies in its simpleness. this is not the case with mulholland drive, and has never been with lynch. it is the complexity that colors and builds the worlds lynch creates, the same complexity that characterizes the real world.it never gets forced like, in my opinion, for example memento does, using an original way of communicating with the viewers. further comparing mulholland drive to other movies, i think it proves david lynch as a master of what he does and bridges art and film making in a way that no one has ever done. compared to for example alejandro jodorowsky or contemporary matthew barney, i do believe that lynch more clearly manages not letting the artist dominate the film maker or, more likely, david lynch better understands and executes film making as an art form.understanding the plot is no small feat, but lynch's way of working with sound, perspective, chronology and form paints a work of art so dark and frightening that it sometimes feels more realistic than real life. the lynchian cinema is often, and most definitely in mulholland drive, a surge of human emotions. working with emotions is a delicate craft that demands understanding and depth. as lynch puts it: "a little bit too much, and the emotion goes away. a little bit too little, and it doesn't happen." in mulholland drive, david lynch has no problem making this balance. lynch's portraits span all kinds of dimensions and take different directions, creating incredibly realistic characters and situations. watching mulholland drive is a journey through the subconscious. it is a truthful and naked movie with indisputable artistic value. that is why i love mulholland drive and what's taken it to the pinnacle of cinema history. the ultimate movie.

spoiler alert - although this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to completely explain.'mulholland drive' is by far the most successful expression of david lynch's cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his 'twin peaks' tv series. as lynch enthusiasts know, his is a style and vision uniquely blended from film noir, horror movies, surrealism, and parapsychology ¬ñ with a healthy dose of postmodern self-consciousness and black humor thrown in for good measure. all these elements are richly at work in 'mulholland drive,' making for a riveting, hair-raising, and highly satisfying film experience ¬ñ especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to make all the plot pieces fit into a logical, mystery-unraveling whole.the film features wonderful performances by naomi watts and laura harring in the lead roles of young women whose lives intersect in various ways amid a hollywood setting that is itself an hallucinated blend of contemporary reality, retro '50s nostalgia, and satirical self-aggrandizement. their seemingly random initial meeting occurs after the film's opening scene, in which harring's character escapes an attempt on her life thanks to a fortuitous, not to mention horrific, automobile accident. staggering down the hillside from mulholland drive to sunset boulevard (the two most archetypal of hollywood thoroughfares), she finds her way to the very apartment that betty (naomi watts) is about to sublet from her 'aunt ruth,' a purportedly successful actress who is off to canada to begin a new movie. as we later learn, betty had herself arrived from deep river, ontario, shortly after winning a jitterbug contest.a highly energetic and stylized flashback to the contest forms one of two pre-credit prologue sequences that frame betty's descent from the clich√©d would-be-starlet's bright-eyed innocence to the debauched madness of spurned lover and going nowhere bit-part actress. unable to remember her own name, the harring character adopts the name 'rita' from a movie poster for the film noir classic 'gilda' that adorns aunt ruth's apartment. (actually, it turns out aunt ruth has long since deceased and whose apartment we're really in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings.) anyway, betty determines to help rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in rita's purse. the two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to rita's true identity. they also, by the way, become lovers, at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that i cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of lesbian lover affairs (if a lynch movie can ever be designated 'mainstream').at the local winkies restaurant (a recurring location fraught with dream-like significance behind its grubby realistic facade), rita's attention is caught by a waitress's name-tag reading 'diane.' this leads her to a recollection of someone named 'diane selwyn,' whose apartment the two women soon visit and, at betty's insistence, break into. i won't reveal what they find within, but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage lynchian creepiness. subsequently, rita wakes in night sweats speaking spanish and hurrying betty to an all-night magic show/theater called 'silencio,' where the arts of illusion and lip/instrumental- syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the blue- haired lady, as she is noted in the end credits, reigns as the presiding muse. framed by the blue-lit, red-curtained silencio theatre, the blue-haired lady occupies the last shot in the film, perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination ¬ñ rather like steven's "man with the blue guitar" as filtered through bad- drug surrealism.during the silencio sequence, and as rebekah del rio cameo lip-syncs her own powerful spanish rendition of roy orbison's 'crying'), a shattering epiphany occurs when betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in rita's purse. even if we do not delve too deeply into the freudian sexual symbolism of purses, the moment is a singularly hitchcockian one in that the matching of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings. not the least of these reversals is the discovery that betty is the sought-for diane selwyn and the spurned lover of camilla rhodes (i.e. rita). camilla in turn is a latin femme fatale movie star to whom diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and, more significantly, to whom she is emotionally subjugated.after these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in 'vertigo.' while bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of diane herself, other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from 'twin peaks,' including michael j. anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a bob- variant who hangs out behind winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id-like associations.however one fits the pieces together, though, the whole of 'mulholland drive' is much greater ¬ñ and more mysterious ¬ñ than the sum of its parts. lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, provocative, and pleasurably disturbing mind trip. what's more, the film's cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics, the acting superb, and the directing /editing masterful. this may well have been the unacknowledged best picture of 2001 among major american releases.

the case history of 'mulholland dr.' is known: what should had been another excursion (after 'twin peaks') into the rivaled field of tv-series ended up abruptly after completing the pilot. it was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to finish a completely new feature film. the result: one of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade which can be ranked among the best works of david lynch. his earlier movies 'eraserhead', 'blue velvet' or 'wild at heart' kept aloof in an irritating way which hustled the viewer into the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the plot happening such as here.'mulholland dr.' is a puzzle where pieces are missing, others obviously were taken from 'eraserhead' and 'lost highway', but it never seemed to be unfinished work. in the internet i came across with a lot of instructions and essays to explain this film. i am aware now that it loses its magic when you try to decipher it completely. all those detailed solution explanations are not only waste but also the questionable attempt to offer an answer where no such thing is completely required. imagine this scenario: a little child is dissecting his teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific of that bear lies. is it because it wants to destroy his toy? does the secret lie in the teddy bear or actually in the heart of the child? transferring this to 'mulholland dr.' it means innocence is one of the most important conditions to watch and appreciate it.david lynch succeeds not only to picture the surface of human behavior life but also to grapple with everything beneath that. human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - all that what remains unspoken; emotions that are often repressed. 'mulholland dr.' has the intensity calling for a cast that completely takes issue with the substance. actresses and actors who are ready to follow the visions of the director selflessly.laura elena harring, naomi watts, justin theroux solve their task in such an impressing way that you wouldn't want or couldn't imagine another cast. while their acting at the beginning seems to be a little superimposed you soon will realize that this stereo typing is set in with a purpose to manipulate the viewer and to baffle him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible.when you claim the criterion of a well made film in being able to lose yourself and dive into what you see on screen than lynch succeeded in making a masterpiece. a modern masterpiece that manifest david lynch's status as one of the most important, creative and courageous directors of the present. like every film maker who go beyond the limits he is confronted with criticism and ignorance. this will fade as soon as you find the individual key to lynch's world of films. 'mulholland dr.' is more than just a sleeper ¬ñ it is a must see for everyone who loves ambitious cinema. and besides, the film is a pay-off with hollywood, in form and content, which in that distinctness was hardly dared before.

originally filmed in 1999 as a tv pilot, "mulholland dr." was rejected. the next year, david lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie suitable to be shown in theaters. he did so - and created one of the greatest, most bizarre and nightmarish films ever made.the film really doesn't have main characters, but if there were main characters, they would be betty (naomi watts) and rita (laura elena harring). betty is a perky blonde who's staying in her aunt's apartment while she auditions for parts in movies. she finds rita in her aunt's apartment and decides to help her. you see, rita's lost her memory. she has no clue who she is. she takes her name, rita, from a "gilda" poster in the bathroom. so the two set out to discover who rita really is.david lynch has been known for making some weird movies, but this film is the definition of weird. it's bizarre, nightmarish, and absolute indescribable. it's like a dream captured on film. by the 100-minute point, the film has become extremely confusing - but if you've been watching closely, it will make perfect sense. having watched the movie and then read an article on the internet pointing out things in the film, i now understand the movie completely.the acting is very good. watts is terrific. justin theroux is very good as a hollywood director facing problems with the local mob. the music is excellent. angelo badalamenti delivers one of his finest scores. and the directing - hah! david lynch is as masterful a filmmaker as ever there was.is this your type of film? well, that depends. you should probably view more of lynch's work before watching this movie. you'll need to be patient with the film, and probably watch it a second time to pick up the many clues lynch has left throughout the movie. for lynch fans, this is a dream come true."mulholland dr." is a masterpiece. it's brilliant, enigmatic, and masterfully filmed. i love it.

hitchcock would be proud of this movie. even when nothing happens, it is suspenseful. director david lynch overuses a few cheap thrill tricks here and there, but he intersperses them with other cinematographic techniques to keep it from becoming obtuse.altogether surreal, this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible. i am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch things i missed and which may help me understand it better. it is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together, so you must be patient and pay attention. get your bathroom trip out of the way before it starts. and yet, the plot is overshadowed by the theme, the mood, the character development, and the filming techniques.the dual roles of the main actress, naomi watts, showcase her enormous talent. that is, when i could get my eyes off of her co-star. what an acting pair.lynch surprises throughout the movie with unusual camera angles, the length/timing of editing cuts, jumping back and forth between scenes. combined with smart use of music and sounds, it all helps to build suspense in our minds, doubtless a major objective of the director. well, he kept me on the edge of my seat, even had me talking to the actors to be careful here, and not be so naive there. you know, the kind of stuff you want to smack your kids for doing at the movies.

"twin peaks" and "blue velvet" have always been two of my favourite pieces of film-making, and even though past films by lynch have been slightly disappointing for me they have always been worth watching a number of times. to be pretentious, lynch can be like a good wine - he must be savoured and mulled over. but in the end you must make up your own mind about what you have seen, for lynch never gives you the full answers.many people will walk out of "mulholland drive" possibly wanting to throttle themselves over the mind-bending visual jigsaw puzzle that has just unfolded before them. but there is a twisted logic to this film, you just have to look for the clues. betty (naomi watts) arrives in hollywood, doe-eyed and in search of stardom. she then finds an amnesiac in her bathroom who has escaped from an attempted murder on mulholland drive. together they try to uncover the secrets behind the amnesiac's life. this all leads to a club called silencio, where a blue box will reveal all. and that is when the film throws everything out the window. people we thought we knew are entirely different people altogether... is it a dream? a reminiscence about life's previous escapades? you will either love this film or hate it. david lynch always draws such extreme reactions from his viewers. but as his universe itself is always about extremes, it is fitting that his films provoke such reactions.it is best to look at this film thematically, rather than as a straight-forward narrative. and appreciate the fact that lynch is a film-maker who will still let you draw your own conclusions. he has had many imitators as of late, particularly in "vanilla sky", where a mind-bending film decides to give you all the answers in the last rushed five minutes, and you will probably forget about that film as soon as you walk out of the cinema. mulholland drive will haunt you.

after two brief scenes that at first seem unrelated to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired, obviously rich beauty in the back of a limousine. her driver stops at an odd location on mulholland drive, which is a twisting, thickly wooded two-lane road full of mansions overlooking los angeles. just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her, two drag racing cars from the opposite direction come crashing into the limo. only the dark-haired woman survives. she works her way down the ridge to sunset boulevard and hides in a vacationing woman's apartment. shortly after, betty (naomi watts), the vacationing woman's niece, shows up at the apartment and runs into the dark haired woman, who now has amnesia. the bulk of the first part of the film is betty and the dark haired woman trying to figure out who she is, why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse. this is interspersed with oddly surreal threads about hollywood producers and directors, with occasional forays into a land of hoodlums and prostitutes.the above may sound a bit complicated and disjointed, but that's not the half of it. the film is constructed so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation. it's basically guaranteed that you will not understand this film and you will not have very much confidence arriving at your own interpretation the first time around. even if you have a lot of experience with like-minded films--such as memento (2000), donnie darko (2001), the i inside (2003) and the butterfly effect (2004)--you may not understand it on a second viewing, either. the studio was aware of this to the extent that they had director david lynch write "10 clues to unlocking this thriller" and they put it on the back of the chapter listing insert in the dvd. lynch being of a particular disposition, these clues are almost as cryptic as the film itself. it doesn't help when trying to figure it out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex. it takes a very long time to figure out what parts are supposed to be "real" and there is a complex nesting of flashbacks in some sections, with only contextual clues that they're flashbacks.but is the film worth watching, or worth trying to figure out? that depends on your tastes, obviously. on a surface level, the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of surrealism, although it will tend to seem a bit slow and overly disjointed to some viewers. but those qualities, and many other surrealist aspects of the film, are typical of lynch. a prime lynchian moment is the old couple in the beginning bizarrely smiling almost as if they're alien pod people trying to put on a front. if you're familiar with that style and like it, you'll find much to love here, although in many ways, mulholland drive is fairly understated for lynch. it's also worth noting, for viewers who'll primarily be interested in it or who enjoy it just as much as other aspects, that mulholland drive has a quite steamy lesbian scene. it's not gratuitous, although i have no problems with gratuitousness, but is instead an important hinge in the film.like all of lynch's films, it's easy to become enraptured in his unique approach to every aspect of filmic art and his attention to detail. any serious student of film (including "armchair students"/"cinephiles") should study mulholland drive; many will love it. lynch doesn't let anything pass unmanipulated. he includes brilliant color schemes (such as the plethora of reds and pinks) with important symbolism. he makes unusual use of sound, such as the ringing telephone carrying over into the section of score that follows it (when betty first arrives at the airport). he directs his actors to deliver their lines in a plethora of bizarre ways, such as his characteristic odd pauses. he lets his odd and surprising sense of humor poke through, such as the name "winkie's", and the "hot dogs--made for pinks" sign that provides a clue to some of the color symbolism.lynch's attention to detail in production design provides important, subtle clues throughout the film to help one unlock the meaning. it's interesting to note that lynch even apparently demands that the dvd programming be unusual--there are no chapters on the disc; you must either watch the film in real time or fast forward or rewind to get back to particular points.if the surrealism and veiled meaning of the film are attractive to you, or if you're just fond of "puzzles", then mulholland drive is well worth watching for that aspect. there is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad, generalized level. i won't recount the standard interpretation here--it is worth researching, but only after you've seen the film a couple times and have reached your own conclusions. many articles and monographs have been written on the film and interpretations; there are even websites dedicated to it.for my money, however, although i generally love lynch and find many things about mulholland drive attractive, it is not quite a 10 for me, at least not yet (i have a feeling that my score could still rise on subsequent viewings). to me, though, the "twist" aspect of the film is done much better in other works such as the i inside and the butterfly effect. mulholland drive is more attractive to me for its surface surrealistic touches, but the plot doesn't carry them as well as some of lynch's other films.still, mulholland drive is certainly recommended for the right crowd. if you're serious about film and do not mind having to think about what you watch (as if those two would not necessarily coincide), you shouldn't miss this one.

there's a sign on the lost highway that says:*major spoilers ahead*(but you already knew that, didn't you?)since there's a great deal of people that apparently did not get the point of this movie, i'd like to contribute my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense. as others have pointed out, one single viewing of this movie is not sufficient. if you have the dvd of md, you can "cheat" by looking at david lynch's "top 10 hints to unlocking md" (but only upon second or third viewing, please.) ;)first of all, mulholland drive is downright brilliant. a masterpiece. this is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head. not often are the comments on the dvds very accurate, but vogue's "it gets inside your head and stays there" really hit the mark.david lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it - cinematography-wise, has great acting (esp. naomi watts), a haunting soundtrack by badalamenti, and a very dream-like quality to it -- but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before. (after all, when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldn't leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about, regardless of whether they liked it or hated it?)allright, enough about all that, it's time to justify those statements.most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion/a dream sequence.of course, that's too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting "traditional" methods in which the story is laid out in a timely, logic and linear manner for the viewer. but for those expecting that, i urge you to check the name of the director and come back again. ;)md is the story of the sad demise of diane selwyn, a wannabe-actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor, camilla rowles. due to diane's lack of talent, she is constantly struggling to advance her career, and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents' expectations. upon realizing that camilla will never be hers (c. becomes engaged with adam kesher, the director), she hires a hitman to get rid of her, and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces.the movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller; which is some 50s dance/jitterbug contest, in which we can see the main character betty giving a great performance. we also see an elderly couple (which we will see twice more throughout the movie) together with her, and applauding her.no, wait. this is what most people see the first time they view it. there's actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits - the camera moving into an object (although blurry) and the scene quickly fading out. if you look closely, the object is actually a pillow, revealing that what follows is a dream.the main characters seen in the first half of the movie:betty: diane selwyn's imaginary self, used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the "dream-sequence" - a positive portrayal of a successful, aspiring young actor (the complete opposite of diane). 'betty' was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at winkies. notice that in the dream version, the waitresses' name is 'diane'.rita: the fantasy version of camilla rhodes that, through diane's dream, and with the help of an imaginary car-accident, is turned into an amnesiac. this makes her vulnerable and dependent on diane's love. she is then conveniently placed in betty/diane's aunt's luxurious home which betty has been allowed to stay in.coco: in real life, adam's mother. in the dream part, the woman in charge of the apartment complex that betty stays in. she's mainly a strong authority figure, as can be witnessed in both parts of the film.adam: the director. we know from the second half that he gets engaged with camilla. his sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for betty/diane, since she develops such hatred towards him.aunt ruth: diane's real aunt, but instead of being out of town, she is actually dead. diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for camilla's murder.mr. roach: a typical lynchian character. not real; appears only in diane's dream sequence. he's a mysterious, influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair. he serves much of the same function as the backwards-talking dwarf (which he also plays) in twin peaks.the hitman: the person that murders camilla. this character is basically the same in both parts of the movie, although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence (more on that below).now, having established the various versions of the characters in the movie, we can begin to delve into the plot. of course i will not go into every little detail (neither will i lay it out chronologically), but i will try to explain some of the important scenes, in relation to lynch' "hint-sheet".as i mentioned above, camilla was re-produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car-accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie, which left her completely vulnerable. what i found very intriguing with md, is that lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn't. i've already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow, but notice how there's two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo.only one of the cars actually hit the limo; what about the other? even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves, wouldn't they try to help the others, or at least call for help? my theory is that, since this is a dream, the presence of the other car is just set aside, and forgotten about. since, as rogert ebert so eloquently puts it "like real dreams, it does not explain, does not complete its sequences, lingers over what it finds fascinating, dismisses unpromising plotlines."shortly after rita crawls down from the crash site at mulholland dr., and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into aunt ruth's apartment, betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away, staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera. this is the first indication that what we're seeing is a nightmare.although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to betty, i think they're actually her parents (since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest). perhaps she didn't know them all that well, and didn't really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted, so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream. they also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder, and diane's sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life.a rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman. diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept camilla's part in the movie (from adam's party in the second half of the movie), and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream. because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of camilla, a part of her wants him to miss, so she turns him into a dumb criminal.this scene, i think, is also lynch's attempt at totally screwing his audience over, since they're given a false pretence in which to view the movie.gotta love that 'something just bit me bad' line, though. :)the next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at twinkies, who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they're sitting in. after a little talk, they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence, accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene.when reaching the corner, a bum-like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner, scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare. this nightmare exists only in diane's mind; she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder. so, in short, her obessions translate into that poor guy's nightmares. the bum also signifies diane's evil side, as can be witnessed later in the movie.the cowboy constitutes (along with the dwarf) one of the strange characters that are always present in the lynchian landscape -- diane only saw him for a short while at adam's party, but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams, so can he be awarded an important part in her dream. we are also given further clues during his scenes that what we're seeing is not real (his sudden disappearance, etc.)the cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the director, when he meets up with him at the odd location (the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream). also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he (adam) does good, or two more times if he does bad. throughout the movie he appears two more times, indicating to diane that she did bad. he is also the one to wake her up to reality (that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice), and shortly thereafter she commits suicide.the espresso-scene with the castigliane brothers (where we can see badalamenti, the composer, as luigi) is probably a result of the fact that diane was having an espresso just before camilla and adam made their announcement at adam's party in the second half. it could at the same time also be a statement from lynch.during the scene in which they enter diane's apartment, the body lying in the bed is camilla, but notice how she's assumed diane's sleeping position; diane is seeing herself in her own dream, but the face is not hers, although it had the same wounds on the face as diane would have after shooting herself. this scene is also filled with some genuine lynchian creepiness. since diane did not know where (or when) the hitman would get to camilla and finish her off, she just put her into her own home.in real life, diane's audition for the movie part was bad. in her dream, she delivers a perfect audition - leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance.also interesting is the fact that the money that in real-life was used to pay for camilla's murder now appears in rita/camilla's purse. this is part of diane's undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back, as the murder now hasn't taken place.when her neighbor arrives to get her piano-shaped ashtray, another hint is given; she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves, yet later when camilla and betty have their encounter on the couch, we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table, suggesting that betty's encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy.the catch phrase of the movie adam is auditioning actresses for is "she is the girl"; which are the exact same words that diane uses when giving the hitman camilla's photo resume.the blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie, and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed. there's much symbolism going on here; the box may represent diane's future (it's empty), or it may be a sort of a pandora's box (the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open). either way, it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key (which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place). the box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum.club silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s/he is viewing is not real. it also signifies that diane is about to wake up to her reality (her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from, even in her dreams).during the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear, diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears.anyway, that is my $0.02. hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it 'the worst movie ever' or something to that effect, without realizing the plot.as usual, lynch is all about creating irrational fears, and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well.10 out of 10.

10/10plot discussionthis is one of the best movies ever made and i am not saying that because i am being fooled by the seemingly nonsensical presentation. those who dislike the film because they don't understand the story often criticize those who are praising the film by saying that they are assuming its genius because they don't understand it. i don't view this movie as very allegorical. to me, it is a story with a beginning, middle and end. people become confused by the film because they expect it to have a deep, philosophical meaning that they are to interpret from the allegedly meaningless scenes. i feel they fail to realize that the crypticness comes from a chopped-up and rearranged plot combined with a very long and rather explanatory fantasy sequence and not from a chaos of visual allegory. because of the limitation of length, i will try to keep this short and to the point and touch on the major concepts.the general plot: diane moves to l.a. after jitterbug contest to get into acting. at an audition, she meets camilla with whom she falls in love. diane becomes enraged with jealousy since camilla sleeps with other men and women. diane discovers the other man (the director) at a film shoot and discovers the other woman (a random blond) at the engagement party for camilla and the director. motivated by her rage and possessiveness, diane hires a hit man to kill camilla. after that is done, she is overcome by loneliness and slips into an unconscious fantasy world where she lives the life she wants to. diane is then awakened. in her conscious state she is haunted by what she has done.the significance of the fantasy: the film starts out, after the credits, with a 1st person p.o.v. shot depicting somebody collapsing onto a bed and slipping into unconsciousness. this is where diane's fantasy starts. the accident is there as an excuse for her to "bring back" her dead girlfriend and justify the fantasy life. she depicts her girlfriend as meek and innocent because that is what she wished she was. in the meantime, she acts like everything is "like in the movies" because she has an escapist personality. she also, in a sense, kills herself off and assumes the identity of a waitress named betty at a diner. the story revolving around the director is a direct result of her feeling that he was in someway victimized in reality just as she was and "convinces" herself that he was forced to choose camilla. it was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party. camilla rhoades in the fantasy is actually the random blond from the engagement party. she hated her so much that she turned her into camilla and made the ultimate antagonist. she then took the real camilla and turned her into a perfect, submissive out-of-the-movies girlfriend and used rita hayworth as an inspiration. she also paints the hit man as a very clumsy and incapable person to further justify the survival of camilla. her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was a search for diane which ended up being herself and made the dreamworld die by taking her through a series of reminders of reality. the first reminder was club silencio which chanted that "there is no band" and the "instruments" you hear are not really there; this is a metaphor for the fantasy. she begins to shake violently because it shakes her perception of her surroundings. the other reminder is the blue box... actually, the blue box is not the reminder itself (more of a pandora's box, really), but the blue key that opens the box. the blue key reminds her of the actual death of camilla because it is what the hit man said would show up when it was done. along with having love, this entire creation of hers is an escape from reality by living in the idealized hollywood that she expected to be part of when she arrived. this is a story showing the psychology of a very troubled woman who lost a dream. it is not series of random things specifically designed to disturb and it is not a cryptic philosophical message. it is an unfortunate chunk of the human condition that is presented beautifully.however, ultimately this is all my opinion. i may be way off. or it may not be intended to mean any one thing. there are many who disagree with me. great! afterall, why does it have to mean anything? why can't it just be a statement in itself? what if coherent, sensible narratives are shackles for artistic expression? peter greenaway, for example, has spent many words eloquently supporting that idea by such statements as "i would argue that if you want to write narratives, be an author, be a novelist, don't be a film maker. because i believe film making is so much more exciting in areas which aren't primarily to do with narrative." and where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation? there is no such rule because the clarity of the movie is unrelated to the art of it. "i didn't understand it!" so...? "mulholland dr.," story or not, affects the viewers, harasses them, drags them, awes them, lulls them. the way it lends itself to interpretation is amazing. it never gets old. it never loses its luster. its visuals are always effective and beautiful. it is cinematic perfection no matter what. enjoy.

in the beginning, with the careful, remote location and sweeking metal sound, i thought of the opening scene in "once upon a time in the west". when it gets to the city, then it begins to feels like "kitchen stories", or "drifting clouds", even possibly "grimm".then it turns out that this is more similar to "joe versus the volcano" in theme (not style). and the movie executes from beginning to end the same, understated style. letting you observe, take in the steel, blue-grayish tone of the suites, dresses, wall color, furniture, bedsheets, mirrors, cars, music, background sounds and even people's expression. then near the end, there is one shot of a completely different tone - warm orangeish-yellow with soft music and ocean splashing, children and laughter.but maybe the observation is too long for me, i would much rather to see the alternative side or what happens to the character after the ending shot. still beautifully done.

the whole movie made me think of the first circle of dante's inferno, where the souls who 'fool' themselves in believing that they are happy go to. they never realize they are actually in an inferno, but nothing is enjoyable, they just move on without any emotion. in that sense dante thought that they the were in the worse part, as they would never actively try to change their situation. nobody can die in that place, but trying to certainly does hurt. i am not sure if the writer based his story on this medieval manuscript or not, but the resemblance is absolutely striking.i didn't enjoy the movie when i was watching it, as i was expecting a climax which never came. nevertheless, it made me think afterwards and now i actually think it's a good film - it surely does stick.

a man arrives in a strange, beautiful, sterile city where no-one feels any emotion and obsesses instead about interior design. the essential sameness of his days is reminiscent of 'groundhog day'; the strange passages in and out of this world more remind one of 'being john malkovich'. but truly, this is a scandanavian movie, a piece of self-satire that is also scandanavian in style: the tone is austere, and even the most fantastic scenes are played straight, daring you to laugh at the absurdity. to my mind, the combination isn't wholly successful: there aren't enough genuine laughs to compensate for the difficulties of taking the piece as pure drama. it certainly is original; perhaps my problem is that the world that it satirises is not one that i recognise. perhaps i should move to scandanavia!

a very interesting addition to the scandavian surrealistic collection. recommended viewing for those who like their movies complicated. my interpretation of the 'strange' ending would be that andreas' journey ends in hell. he dislikes the bland consumer-led emptiness of purgatory; a sort of 'living' but not progressing, i.e. not getting anywhere - even the city's metro trains don't stop at the stations. it has a metro system, like you should be able to travel, freedom, escape, but you can never actually board those trains. he is unable to reach fragrant, sensory heaven and winds up continuing his bus journey to its final destination. the old norse version of hell (hades, not hell the terrestrial city) isn't burning hot like the british version, its cold, freezing, the land of niflheim (land of cold and mists). this appears to be where andreas end up, having just failed to access heaven through that tunnel.

the film is a great watch very thoughtful.i believe it is a film about how your like would be if you lived in a world created by catalogues. the scenes are all perfect recreations of an ikea catalogue they even watch furniture on their tv. when they break into the kitchen they break into another perfect picture of how a kitchen would look like in a catalogue. when he is reborn or whatever you would like to call it he returns to the harsh reality of life. i love the bit when he tells his new love he has left his partner. it pokes fun at commercial bliss by saying you can have it all and whilst it it is nice to have the same things, but some things you do not want to share. a film without children also per say makes for a perfect ten.

scandinavians are pretty good at making me laugh at the drab nothingness of my soulless life, huh.the film-making here was incredibly meticulous, every piece of framing, every deadpan stare, every element of the colour palette, every snippet of muzak or whooosh of those street cleaners was there to hammer home this world's calm emptiness.in fact, i think i might have found the general sense of emptiness overbearing had its absurdity not been genuinely funny and relatable. like when andreas is telling his boss that he misses children and looks up and the guy is smiling and halfway out the door, it's a sort of sad but true reflection of working with people, spending 7/8 hours a day with them, seeing more of them than the folk you love, but ultimately knowing deep down they don't give a damn about your troubles and you the same.this might have been a film the coens had made had they been born in oslo and not minnesota. i think their humour is more aggressive and more wrapped up in cinema's past but they have the same mastery of technique and their films have the same underlying sense that life is pretty inconsequential.i'll stop before i talk myself into taking a bus into the wintry wilderness.

grabbed my attention on netflix instant play because it was only an hour and a half long (it's nearing 4 am here), and because it's norwegian, which i wanted to follow up with dead snow and see what else the country is offering in international cinema right now. a droll and deliciously wry romp, this movie features a man, andreas, who gets shipped out to some purgatory of a brave new world city, where everyone is happy and bland and food has no taste, nothing smells, and even sex loses its appeal. driven to the edge by his lack of common senses, he feels nearly ready to kill himself.after an hilarious botched attempt at latter, andreas tracks down a man with similar complaints and the two discover a tiny, vagina-shaped hole in a concrete wall from which music emanates. the two attempt to break through to see what is on the other side, tracking a tiny bit of light they can barely see. but of course, in fantasy allegory land, desire and nonconformity are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to end andreas' attempt at freedom and sensuality.jens lien and crew create a simple, straight-forward movement to the story, one that flows well with its themes and moves along at just enough of a pace to keep from lagging. the similarities in other similar science fiction aren't worth enumerating, but still the movie has a unique feel and balances some very funny scenes with some pretty horrifying ones. i like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie, some disembowelment and flagellation that will get your heart stammering harder than the passion of the christ simply because it is so perfectly out of place from the gray-toned mise-en-scene. trond fausa aurvaag is a dependably squirrelly actor who physically feels out of place from his surroundings, which works very well. despite the fact that the concept itself isn't anything to write home about, everyone involved makes it work and the movie fully realizes its own world.--polarisdib

enjoyed 'den brysomme mannen' http://ow.ly/pttp (my wife didn't, so i watched it in bits over a few days.)reviewers mainly confused - most agree it's allegorical, but not of what; 'heaven', 'hell', 'socialism', 'capitalism'? that most people don't wish to escape, and it's, essentially, forbidden goes with most of those options.so, presumably you're supposed to project your favourite preoccupation/prejudice/fear onto it. so i'd say it's about an a-epicurean life. a live desaturated of colour, literally in the film, figuratively in the interpretation.

the bothersome man is a smart, surreal movie that makes you reevaluate what you're doing with your life and what makes you tick. when you see these people in zombie like trances doing everyday events and realize that's what we do and what we want in real life it really hits close to home. this is a surprisingly effective movie that at the end leaves you asking questions about your direction and not so much the movie. andreas is the main character whose life we get a 3rd person view of as he tries to adapt to a new life after being relocated. in the beginning he seems to be the most popular guy in town as everyone at work caters to him and he's invited to dinners etc. a good example of this is in the scene with his new boss who offers him an envelope of an unspecified amount of cash saying "here's a little something to get you started". andreas even gets a girlfriend 20 minutes into the movie, which he eventually moves in with. this seems like an ideal living situation as his girlfriend is an established interior designer, attractive, and doesn't ever nag about anything he does. but andreas is unfulfilled with their relationship as with everything else in this world. he then begins an affair with a coworker named ingeborg who he eventually leaves anne for and claims he is in love with. after telling ingeborg how he feels she tells him that she is also seeing other coworkers and says all of the relationships are "nice". soon after we see andreas at a train station where he tries to end his misery and to the audience's disappointment doesn't come about. still looking for salvation andreas meets hugo who has found a hole which music can be heard coming out of. so they embark on a mission to get to the other side, will it be better or will it be worse? "the bothersome man" shows us society's obsession with appearances and its materialistic mindset. it does a great job making fun of us by filling homes with ikea products that the characters spend each lunch picking out. i think he is mostly poking fun at the dull scandinavian society and its high suicide rates. for example there is a scene in the movie where andreas comes across a man who jumped out of a building and onto a spiked fence. also, andreas fed up with this world cuts his finger off and then later jumps in front of a train; this is one of the most weirdest/outrageous scenes i've seen. this world created by lien is equivalent to purgatory where there is no punishment or reward. in this world drink after drink andreas never got drunk, sex was unfulfilling, and no matter how many times he tried he couldn't kill himself. this movie reminded me of "fight club" and how both main characters were kind of out of sync with the world around them. in "fight club" tyler durden creates a second persona that does everything he wouldn't and in this movie the awakened andreas is the equivalent to tyler durden. after a while he wakes up and tries to escape the bland life he is now apart of by escaping through a hole in a wall. lien does a great job with continuity in this movie meaning when a character has a half full cup in his hand and they cut away then come back they have the glass in the same hand and its not full or empty showing that the shot was done another day. nowadays directors are more worried about the sound effects and overlook the little things like is that character wearing the bracelet on the same hand as yesterdays filming? since i took tv production for three years in high school it's hard for me not to look for continuity or voice overs which drive me nuts. lien does the little things well he's got great lighting in each shot, never leaves you wondering why something is in a shot and brings about an interesting topic. this film really worked for me because it not only mocks scandinavians' but the western society and what's wrong with it. the only real issue i had was with the man who commits suicide by jumping on a spiked fence. because you eventually find out this world has no death but he laid motionless forcing you to assume he was dead and this never gets answered in my opinion. andreas is the only main character as others come and go and never do more than support his him. his first girlfriend anne britt is an interior designer who at the surface seems perfect for him but eventually turns out to be dull. this leads him to ingeborg who he starts an affair with and falls in love with. he soon finds out that she was with a handful of other men and that what he felt was not real. andreas eventually meets hugo in the bathroom of a bar complaining about how nothing tastes good anymore and how he can't even get drunk anymore. he follows hugo home to find the hole in the wall with that is filled with children's laughter and birds chirping. lien doesn't have a lot on the resume but "the bothersome man" is more than a jump start to a great career but a preview of an up and coming director. if this is any indication of his talent and potential as a story teller, lien has a bright future and we can only hope that his future movies don't take so long to make it overseas for our viewing pleasure. so take a seat and enjoy the ride as director jens lien takes you from the comfort of your home to the dreamlike world that is "the bothersome man".

synopsis: andreas (trond fausa aurvaag) finds himself alone on a coach, getting dropped off on a desert land, at what seems the last stop of his journey. he doesn't know how he arrived there, but a welcome sign has been erected for him. after momentarily pondering his whereabouts, he is greeted by a man who takes him to his new life. he then enters a world different to the one he came from. as andreas is quickly introduced to his new job as an accountant, he senses that his surroundings are a bit too uniformed for his liking. as he takes his first lunch break, he instantly notices that everyone in the city walks around in grey suits. on this same day, he sees a fellow businessman dead on some fencing spikes, of what looks like an act of suicide. the strange thing is, the city folk pay no attention to this horrific act and walk on by as if it never happened. it is quick to see that these people are genetically desensitised, and their ability to distinguish between anything humane or inhumane is absent. to help andreas settle in, he is invited to go out with his co-workers to a local nightclub. the club appears to be one step away from becoming as exciting as a bingo night..and as andreas drinks his sorrows aways, he realises that no matter how much he drinks, the alcohol has no effect on him. as he tells these observances to a stranger in the men's room, a man in a toilet cubicle starts to utter words which have been on andreas' mind all along. realising that this man is thinking what he is, he follows him to his house, and notes where he lives for future reference. the plot predictably evolves with andreas wanting an escape. he seeks out the man he once followed...hoping that he could lead him to becoming human again...but is it too late?my thoughts: this norwegian film is something which everyone should see, as it holds the answer to the big question! what is the meaning of life? (well, close enough). the film sketches out the dark realities of what has become of today's working man (or woman). it's sole purpose is making people realise that life is too short to be materialistic. it tries to show that small clich√© things, such as the sound of children playing, should not be taken for granted, because the moment you stop hearing that sound, is the moment you're one step away from becoming a robot. the ending of the film reiterates what happens when its too late to escape the mundane routine you've now become used to. you start to adopt the saying of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', and become too comfortable to take a risk of change.even though this film is not to be taken as a piece of realism...its message is more than real. the lack of empathy conveyed in the film, and that of which andreas sees, is a bold statement of what life can become. the director, jens lien has put together a film, which in any other director's hands would have failed. this is a fine piece of cinematic genius, and i eagerly await to see what he does next.the lead role, played by trond fausa aurvaag is perfectly cast. representing the average joe, trond provides a good catalyst in making this picture darkly humorous. the supporting actors also do an apt job, and for some reason, i feel that keanu reeves would have been perfect in this film, as most of the supporting cast required their acting to be emotionless.the score for this film was beautifully composed. the recurring theme was always a delight to listen to, and it provided a very sombre but welcomed feel to the movie.set for a release date in the uk for 25th may 2007, i will definitely be going to re-live this experience on the big screen. this film has gained its way in my top 10...now quickly becoming my top 20! it has some shocking scenes, and is darkly humorous throughout...a must -see!!

this is one of my all time favorite cheap, corny, vampire b movies. calvin klein underwear model...oh, i mean, stefan the good vampire, returns to transylvania to ascend the throne of vampiric royalty, but manicure-impaired and eternally drooling half brother radu has other plans. having killed their father the vampire king, radu now sets his sights on stefan, stefan's new mortal girlfriend michelle and her two pretty friends, and the all-powerful bloodstone.okay, the scenery is beautiful, and it should be as it was shot on location in transyl-fricken-vania for gosh sakes. the actresses are no great shakes and stefan the heroic vampire is about as charming as a refrigerated fireplace poker, but who cares? there's only one reason to watch this movie, and his name is radu! he's a physical homage to nosferatu and he has the best lines in the movie, all spoken in the raspy voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day. the cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film, as radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his grinning, slobbering face for the world to see. i found myself cheering him on as he collected victims and taunted his perfect brother. but maybe i'm just a sicko. questionable taste in men aside, i highly recommend this film to vampire enthusiasts. it's original, it's fun, and radu is one of the best vampires i've seen in a long time...much more fun than the stiff, tragic, whining undead brats that endlessly grace the horror screens these days. radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes. he's what a vampire should be.

this is one of the best and moodiest vampire tales ever! i love this movie really. the character are great, even the locations and the story. indeed the picture isn't a big budget production, but it is absolutely worth seeing.ok there are some faults (especially the names of the castle and the locations) in this movie, but such mistakes are typically and are almost in every horror movie.the scenery fits perfect to the story and is close to reality,i can say that honest, because i visit them once when i was in romania in my vacations.in my opinion this is the best part of the subspecies series.

words fail me whenever i want to describe my feelings about this movie (and the sequels)... does it have flaws? sure it does... starting with the "subspecies" themselves,which were not executed well enough for a special effect.so why do i glorify these movies??? for the herd of movie mass-consumers out there,who care more about quantity than quality,about cheap fun more than about depth, crap like "blade" (it doesn't even deserve a capital letter),"underworld","dracula 2000","dracula 3000" and so on are good movies to munch popcorn to and drink a couple of cokes... what makes subspecies a superior effort for anyone claiming to be a vampire fanatic,on the other hand,is obvious: the vampire himself is romanian,the story is set in transylvania (the scenes filmed on location are more than convincing),and the atmosphere is not based on any "action-packed" chases or expensive orchestral music.radu himself is the source of the atmosphere... this is what a vampire should look like and this is how he should behave! add a breathtakingly gloomy castle with dark passageways situated in romania,include some typical vampiric elements ( such as the movement of the shadows on the walls when the vampires take to flight) and you have a work of art! in short,if ,like me,you 're fascinated with vampires and feel that their appearance as well as the setting should be sinister and dark,there's no better place to look in than in a subspecies movie... or in vampire journals,the brilliant spin off of the former...

a sparkling movie. bb is a marvel. she's sultry. she is a feminist. she is still very much in love.the movie features paris in the 50's. it is wonderful to look at the sites, the cars (ds!) and orly.a simple but very enjoyable romantic comedy. the music is horrendous. it almost dissonates. on the other hand it is hilarious. but it is probably the only thing amiss, at least looking at it with 21st century eyes.the movie comments on the french manner of treating infidelity. it is that sense modern. a movie like un elephant se trompe enormenent did it in an 80's way. but the basic premise stays the the same.thanks to makers for providing bb with this opportunity.

traffik is an excellent miniseries dealing with drug trafficking in europe. this is the european produced pbs series on which the oscar-nominated movie traffic is based on. if you loved traffic then traffik is a must see.overall i would highly recommend this miniseries to anyone that is interested in seeing drugs from a social point of view. the screenplay is exciting and unexpected as it weaves through the lives of drug dealers, traffickers, farmers, policians, and police officers. unlike other movies that sensationalize the issue of drugs, traffik presents it as is.

i remember watching this when it was made and thinking it was brilliant at the time. watching it for the second time nearly 20 years later, i still think traffik is brilliant and much better than the us film that was based on this drama.it should also be watched by all our come today gone tomorrow politicians who think they can win the war on drugs, as the issues raised in this film are as pertinent today as they were back then at the end of the 80s, and unless they change their policies, will be so in another 20 years.well written, well made, beautifully acted and superbly filmed. a thought provoking drama that entertains as well as brings to light some of the hard realities of the criminal drug trade.

i've read innumerable reviews talking about the superiority of the mini-series. i certainly can't agree on such a blanket statement. if you analyze all of the aspects of a video/film production, there are numerable areas where the film is arguably vastly superior.certainly, many of the comments are valid with regard to particular areas of the mini-series. specifically regarding more threads (customs officers) and more developed threads (such as the pakistani farmer and family). that said, i found catherine zeta-jones' character much more compelling as the desperate women, from poverty to riches who "won't go back." that's a much more likable character than this cold women who didn't seem to have as much reason for her quick turn to evil. (and yes, i understand...her children. she was desperate; i just didn't see her as being as desperate.)further, while i appreciated some of the more fleshed out story threads in the mini-series, benicio del toro's character was very compelling. an anchor for the film. that thread was changed (as an alternative to the pakistani family) in nothing but good ways. a fantastic adaptation. (of course, i'm skeptical that someone so pure can exist within such a system, but i don't know enough about the politics of the nation to argue).after watching the first episode of the mini-series, i actually rewatched the film. why? i kept reading about the fantastic acting. i found the performances in the first episode of the mini-series to be borderline laughable. certainly, this improved as the mini-series progressed. now having just finished both versions in a few days, i can't agree that the performances in the mini-series reached the same level as, say, benicio del toro, who was brilliant in the film, though ormand, paterson, shah, and lindsay duncan were very good. i also feel the police in the film far outclassed the mini-series. i was not impressed with the germans throughout.finally, the dialogue, as delivered in the film, is much more nuanced. especially in the scenes which are almost verbatim. "careful, you're beginning to sound like your husband." as opposed to "hahahaha! you sound like karl." again, i found some of the acting in the mini- series very unconvincing. this was a prime example.other superior aspects of the film, in my opinion: score, cinematography, editing.should i complain that the film wasn't longer? no. i think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format. the changes made stood on their own. i mean, would you sit in a theater for 5/ 7/10 hours. of course not.mini-series: 8 out of 10film: 9 out of 10

this is a wonderfully gritty drama, detailing the various sides of the international heroin drug-trade--from the hills of northern pakistan, where the tacitly allowed cultivation of opium-poppies occurs on a vast scale; to the jetsetting "euro-trash" in germany and england who arrange the importation of processed heroin in multi-kilo smuggled shipments; to the end-users caught up in the web of addiction and the crime needed to support their growing habit; and finally all the levels of international government corruption and hypocrisy surrounding police efforts at controlling "the drug problem"---this drama is sketched out with a wide array of in-depth well-rounded characters, fully evolved plot, and excellent character acting and location shooting.this puts hollywood epics like "the french connection" in their place!traffik is a deeply thought-provoking and suspenseful tale of modern drug-related espionage, and the international efforts of many people to try to eliminate it.unlike many "crime dramas" revolving around drugs, traffik focusses strongly on uncovering the societal *reasons* that people slide into drug addiction... as one of the characters puts it "...until we, as a society, construct a world that people want to participate in, instead of wanting to escape from, we will not be able to stop people from taking drugs..."this is a fascinating and fully engrossing drama. i highly recommend it!

i was disappointed with the recent (2000) american remake of this english mini-series. though it followed the plot line very closely, it seemed to leave the heart and soul of the original out. not to mention adding shallow preachy heavy-handed 'messages'... so my advice is to skip the modern remake and stick with the original. it's much longer, but gripping and totally well done. interesting, complex and textured, without the preachy self-righteousness... and it's beautifully shot, as well.i find it galling that these heartless remakes of great overseas films get so much hollywood fanfare at the oscars. (though i did like benicio del torro getting some deserved praise...)

i haven't seen the more recent 'traffic' which is based on this, but i'd bet on this one as the better creation. i know of no other movie that has so well portrayed the intricate tragedies of the drug trade and the 'war on drugs." i've watched this one at least four times and am enjoying it again as part of masterpiece theatre's 30th anniversary presentations.

compared to the acclaimed hollywood remake, this film is less flashy but much stronger at providing an overall picture of the drug problem. the remake loses the most interesting of the three plot threads, that of a farmer whose meager livelihood depends on drugs as a paying cash crop and whose increased involvement with the drug trade in an effort to better himself destroys himself and his family. additionally, the story of the daughter's addiction goes into the problems not only of withdrawal but the high likelihood of relapse. this original miniseries makes good use of the additional time to go into the issues more thoroughly and remains stronger meat on this controversial subject.

what an awesome mini-series. the original traffik completely stole me away from anything else that was on. far more engaging than the american remake, the original traffik boasts an amazing cast formed of lesser known actors to north american audiences. juliette binoche being the mainly recognizable actress who plays a drug addicted teenaged daughter of a government official. but it's not star power that carries this film (though i enjoyed the american version, i felt it was dimmed by the famous americans in the picture). unfortunately, i saw the american version before i found the original bbc mini-series. of course there were no picture filters, lush locales, and the big name stars/director. however, the grit and grime of europe (through the drugworld) perfectly compliments the impending sense of danger, which permeates throughout this film. the problems, such as getting addicts off of drugs by giving them more, poor anti-drug campaigning, and the resistance of foreign governments to assist with destroying their drug cultivators from within, all make traffik bold, immersive, and horrific all at the same time!the truly incredible portions of the movie all come from pakistan. my god, i never knew how bad the problem really was over in europe...even all over! for a real education on the problems of drugs, beyond how they affect the human body you must watch both this and the american version. each show one very clear and undeniable fact. those countries, which are leaders in the eyes of the world, have a culture that has led to the death and suffering for many. drugs are worse than war. they work in the shadows, the dark secrets of any "successful" society.

contains spoilers i had it recorded a while ago when it was on pbs but never got a chance to watch it (probably due to prejudice about having to sit through 5-6 hrs of masterpiece theater, with its bbc made for tv production style (no music, settings all in one room, no outdoor scenes flat tv look...)) but after watching the movie traffic (which i thought was pretty good at that time,) i couldn't help digging up the traffik tape to see what else could they have dwelled into with the extra 2 1/2 hr.boy, was my preconceptions wrong about this tv series. it is so much more involving than traffic. the characters are fleshed out better so that their actions are more believable. and the whole subplot involving pakistan completes the whole point of view of everyone in the whole supply chain, from the farmer to the end user. in traffic, the pakistan story was rewritten and reduced down to a good cop vs bad cop plot.there was alot more meaningful discussion and debate about alcohol and other forms of drug, whereas in traffic they mostly became passing references of no significance. same with social issues, which in traffik, were conveyed realistically w/o sounding preachy. whereas in traffic, the characters jus t blurted it out as a statement like the way they do it in those made for tv "issue of the week" movies.there was no bad guy vs good guy in traffik, even the dealer is portrayed as a junkie that sells to support his habit instead of the "nobody messes with me" type of person in traffic.the only down part is that since i watched traffic not much before watching this, it was hard not to compare scene by scene, and even though the scenes were not the same, i knew what the outcome was going to be already. thank god for the pakistan story, which is different enough that it allowed me to enjoy it completely w/o thinking which scene it compares to. although i was thrown off thinking the drugs were fused into the ceramic of the statues in which helen brought back to germany (as in the storyline of traffic.) thank god traffik was not that hokey and far-fetched.

i enjoyed this programme immensely. it is exceptionally well written, with finely judged performances and clever visuals.it is also very frank and honest, refreshing compared to the sanitised representation of drug use in films and television.unmissable - one of the finest television shows of recent years, and triumph on all scales for channel 4.9/10

brilliant. ranks along with citizen kane, the matrix and godfathers. must see, at least for basset in her early days. watch it.

the best thing one can say about the film "traffic" is that it brought attention to the superior british mini-series "traffik". as many people have noted, the current film suffers from truncating the story to accommodate the short attention span of cinemagoers and the turn-around time of the theater owners, who measure a film's success by the overpriced food sales.i first recorded this mini series in 1990 when it was shown on public tv and have watched it many times. the whole documentary-style series has a strong element of tragedy and doom about it, as the characters are all moving toward their eventual fate. the strongest of the three tales is that of the pakistani family forced into the city to find a way to keep body and soul together after the poppy crop is burned by the army in a staged show of force put on for the benefit of western politicians. the hardships of the family are similar to that of the rickshaw pullers family in "city of joy". eventually the farmer finds work, but he compromises his pride and honesty.the pakistani segment of the film has a particular relevance to today, with the fight against the supporters of al quaeda, and gives some understanding of the support for such movements among the disadvantaged poor of pakistan and afghanistan who rarely receive any of the money going into those countries. the film makes a point that the farmers see barely 25% of the aid which is supposed to encourage them to grow other crops.with the american inability to see anything other than in terms of black and white - good guys v. bad guys - it is interesting to see another view where there is no black and white, only shades of grey. possible spoiler ahead. the only problem i had with the story was that rather than things continuing as they did before, as they would in real life, being a work of fiction they had to wrap it up with the "bad guys" getting what was coming to them. other than that, this was a fine piece of work of the kind we see all too rarely. the cast was outstanding and the german and pakistani locations helped give the film a "different" feel (what a change it made seeing germans as something other than the villains in a wwii film).

i remember seeing this in the early 90's on uk tv and was hooked. the international scope of the production is breathtaking and watching how the characters develop through the five hours it runs for is magnificent. the scenes set in pakistan and afghanistan are of particular interest, and as a viewer you get a real sense of a grounds-eye view of the culture and vibe of these countries during the closing stages of the cold war. the characters of fazal and helen develop really well throughout the series and rivals modern shows like the sopranos and six feet under in this area. in the uk, the vhs goes for about ¬£6 and the dvd about ¬£10 - a quality bargain. i thought soderbergh's version was great too - but clearly owes this masterpiece a huge debt.

traffik is a really well done 6 hour drama about drugs (circa 1987). it tells three stories, in parallel, about how opium is grown in north-east pakistan, how drugs are smuggled from pakistan into europe, and finally, how people addicted to drugs spiral out of control. all three stories are told realistically and with empathy. you see enough of the characters lives to understand how ordinary people can get sucked into a life that is really immoral.these aren't card-board cutouts, the opium grower is trying to feed his family in a dry area filled with guns and other opium growers. the drug smuggler is a rich german with no heart but his wife (one of the three main characters) is just an ordinary woman who has to choose between leading her life "the old way" or giving up. finally the main character, the government minister has the toughest role as he must deal with the emotional devastation caused by his own daughter. she slips into the world of drug addiction and starts stealing, suffering from ill-health, attacking her parents emotionally, all so she can continue to satisfy her craving for the drug (heroin) that is destroying her life.traffik is one of the best dramas i have ever seen on tv. the scenes in this show will remain with you for a long, long time. highly recommended. -- colin glassey

i had been very curious to see the original six-hour miniseries that steven soderbergh's latest movie was based on, and now that i have, i am happy to say that one is not better than the other. they are both intelligent, involving and extremely entertaining. the only real advantage that the miniseries has over the movie is that it is three and a half hours longer, so we get to know the characters more in depth.there isn't a false note to be had in this production, one that you should definitely make time for when pbs re-broadcasts this miniseries sometime in 2001. you won't regret it.

four stories about the drug trade in europe become intertwined over the course of this 6 part miniseries. in germany a businessman is arrested on drug smuggling charges, and his wife attempts to save her family by continuing her husband's illegal trade. meanwhile the british home secretary travels to pakistan to negotiate an aid package that he hopes will stop the drug flow from that country. even as he does this however his own daughter succumbs to heroin addiction, tearing their family apart. this is the miniseries on which the american film and miniseries were based. the original is far superior to its two decendants. the poverty and desperation of the third world are portrayed very well. it is stark, uncompromising and brutal.

i can only agree with many observers that traffik is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television. i saw traffik when it was on tv, and i have just watched it again. i am particularly moved by the haunting original music of tim souster, and especially by the dolorous strains of dmitri shostakovich's chamber symphony in c minor ( the music over the credits and in parts of the film). the music intensifies the desperation of the characters as they pursue their sad fate. the music is powerfully emotional. this arrangement combines two of the movements from the symphony, but i recommend listening to the symphony per se.

if you've not seen this then look out for it. it is available on dvd. it is a channel 4 (uk) production, possibly, in conjunction with german and danish tv. if you've seen the film it is basically the same plot. several interleaved stories are connected through the drugs trade. the story jumps between the housewife (played by the excellent lyndsay duncan) trying to complete a deal on behalf of her husband, who to her surprise is an international drugs dealer (and generally dangerous man).a minister, who is embedded in his job to the detriment of his family, is investigating the whole state of affairs with international drugs trafficking. he gets a few eye openers to the reality of heroin when his daughter turns out to have a 'problem'. he then visit pakistan, officially, where he seems to be taught that the abuse (not simply the drug or its casual use) is the problem and also gets to sample some produce (an excellent scene where he simultaneously realises what the attraction is and why it is and why it is such a problem). in pakistan we get to see the other side. the desperation of farmers who can barely survive turning to opium production and crime lords. the pointless attempts at subsidy resulting in the system getting rich. and a country so drenched in drugs yet only a relative fraction of the abuse we have in the west. around all this a customs official/interpol agent tries to catch the 'dutch' connection in heroin smuggling. seeking justice for his murdered partner. this really is a masterpiece. super, understated performances from all the main actors in a way only european cinema can really do.a must see. especially if you have seen the film, they compliment each other abd present some subtly different opinions/attitudes from both sides of the pond.

"traffik 1989" is an emmy award winning six part miniseries out of the uk which was the inspiration for the oscar winning "traffic 2000". the five hour film breaks down the opium/heroine trade for the viewer from the handcasting of poppy seeds in an afghanistan field to the "head rush" of a mainlining junkie in a flat in england. not only does "traffik" offer entertainment value through interleaved dramatic stories it also provides an overview of the international drug trade at all levels answering the who, where, how, and why questions of the age old and unstoppable narcotic supply/demand machine. synergistically entertaining and educational, "traffik" will prove to be time well spent for teens and up. (a)

beautifully constructed, "traffik" tells the story of narcotics usage and commerce from multiple points of view. from a policeman view, from a politician view, from an addict view, from a smuggler's view, and from a farmer's view. in a carefully contructed storyline, one gets the impression on how everything is inter-related. from beautiful on-location shots in the poppy fields in pakistan, to downtown karachi, to the entry points airports of frankfurt and london, to the delapidated buildings where the smuggling takes place, one sees the massive dimension of narcotics consumption.

it is hard to put the devastating beauty of traffik to words, partly because i am still grasping to comprehend it myself, several hours after my second viewing. first, it must be said that traffik contains some of the most incomparably and unforgettably haunting scenes i have seen in a film or television production. the acting is excellent, particularly that of bill paterson as a british minister grappling with his heroin-addicted daughter and an aid deal to pakistan that hinges on drug issues. another plot line describes these drug issues at a ground level in pakistan, and revolves around a struggling opium poppy farmer and his interaction with a successful heroin smuggler. the third main storyline involves the prosecution of a hamburg drug importer, and the conflicting efforts of his wife and two german detectives while he is under trial. it is a profound accomplishment that the interaction between these stories feels natural, transcending the forced plot entanglement often found in hollywood movies. it is an even greater accomplishment that a work spread over three countries and half a dozen main characters can be so focused and enthralling, without having to oversimplify. it is devastating--bleak and brutal but never apathetic. in short, traffik is a rare work of film that handles challenging subjects with unmatched compassion and clarity.

'traffik', despite its title, is not really about drugs. in the best tradition of crusading british tv drama, 'traffik' analyses and moralises about its ostensible subject, which is not some mythical scourge, but a matrix or process with identifiable social, economic and historical roots, causes and effects. there is something almost scientific in the way the film takes four sets of characters from spectacularly separate global and class backgrounds - a poppy grower forced into the pakistani underworld by poverty and a cynical government; the english, ex-olympic swimmer wife of a drugs baron on trial for trafficking; two shambling german policemen whose determination to convict the latter arises as much from class anger as any faith in the law; and a tory junior minister whose cambridge-student daughter has become an addict.'traffik' is unapologetically didactic - from the early scenes of jack lithgow in pakistan, investigating the government's success in eliminating drugs before sanctioning more british aid, we are bombarded with facts about the problem. but these 'facts' come from a variety of sources - dissembling government representatives; left-wing lawyers with vested (ideological and domestic) interest in the corruption; poor farmers who need to grow poppies to survive. facts, normally reassuring markers on a map, are clearly not enough - the more facts we get, the less controllable the situation seems. it is not until jack, the film's moral centre, the man who connects all the narrative threads, actually journeys into the heart of the drugs darkness, learns to shed his tory hypocrisy (deploring the use of drugs, but refusing to put any serious money into tackling the problem, and creating the conditions, through various free market initiatives, where drug-traffiking flourishes. just as the anti-heroes of the old warners' gangster films were actually model american capitalists, so the traffikers are the ideal being espoused by thatcher and reagan) that at least the reality of the problem can be acknowledges. like i say, 'traffik' isn't really about drugs. as jack finally recognises, after being sacked as a tory minister, drugs isn't really the problem. it's a society dismantled by a woman who said there was no longer any such thing (as proved by jack's non-existent family life), systematically depriving the vast majority of people of hope and happiness, increasing numbers of whom turn to drugs. what is most frightening about 'traffik' is not the graphic, numbing depictions of drug abuse (the technical detail of which ironically reflects the presentation of more 'legitimate', verbal factual information), but the dystopian vision of a britain stripped of any joy, beauty or community, a bleak wasteland of derelict tenements and soulless modernity, a society of defeatists ready for the thatcherite smugglers and barons to ply their trade. this isn't just a contemporary british story - it records the decline of an empire built on trade reduced to lawless drug traffiking. it is surely significant that the other sites in the programme are germany and pakistan, crucial agents in the empire's decline. here the old imperial amorality comes home to roost, the formerly enslaved victims, their bodies abused by their masters' power, returning to the imperial centre, london, the seeds of its decline literally carried in their bodies, embodying the fears of all those late 19th century gothic novels.'traffik' is one of the great achievements of british tv, and is in many ways superior to the recent hollywood remake. the political focus is obviously sharper - jack's decline is much more effective than wakefield's because he, as agent of government policy, as well as a bad father, is very much part of the problem, whereas the american's only real political flaw is complacency. in almost every case, characterisation is tighter and much more plausible (compare lindsay duncan's steely helen, already bitten by experience and failure, and her risibly superficial counterpart). unlike the dubious racial undercurrent of 'traffic' (making mexico dark and other; the ultimate wasp horror being sex with a black man), the portrait of pakistan is richly, tragically drawn, with disconcerting arguments about drug protection punctuated by scenes of gruesome violence. throughout, the inextricable linking of public and private is expert. visually, the film is remarkably inventive, without ever being flashy or 'cinematic' - especially in the last episode, where the buildings and decor seem to move as the system closes in. if 'traffik', like its remake, feels the need to shore fragments, then the prevailing sense of waste and loss is much more damning, jack's speech bitterly despairing.

saboteur is a 1942 film, partly aimed at getting american support for the war against nazi germany. propaganda or not, it's great entertainment. the leading actors are robert cummings and priscilla lane, although director alfred hitchcock wanted gary cooper, and barbara stanwyck in the roles, which would have given the movie more stature. this is a good movie anyway with robert cummings and priscilla lane bringing their own style to the characters. as in other hitchcock movies, we see the director's disregard for the socially suave and the well-heeled. he often portrayed spies and foreign agents as nice upper-class folk who at the same time sneered at democratic values and concepts such as guilty until proved innocent. these upper crust traitors are the last the police pursue or even suspect. hitchcock had a lifelong distrust of the police. he wanted to elevate the regular guy, the bungler and the fellow who doesn't take himself too seriously. one can see him wanting gary cooper as an icon in the frank capra mold. nevertheless, bob cummings puts his own stamp on the boy-next-door and works well in the role. priscilla lane, as the spunky female lead, comes off as the all-american girl who can handle herself quite nicely when put to the test. robert cummings, as defence plant worker barry kane, is framed for a bombing that kills his best friend. this leads to a cross-country chase scene reminiscent of other hitchcock heroes on the run. hitchcock repeats some of the well-established formulas from previous films - the reluctant female who is drawn into the action, e.g. madeleine carroll in the 39 steps, and risking his life to evade the authorities who are on his heels. we view scenes of america as kane tries to find the real culprit in the bombing he stands accused of. we see rivers, bridges, backwoods cabins, truckers, the hoover dam and finally, new york city. new york is a fitting backdrop for the climax as we go from rockefeller center to the ocean liners (with a cut to the ship normandy) and the grand finale on the statue of liberty. great movie with uninterrupted action. don't miss it.

barry kane is an aircraft factory worker.suddenly sabotage takes place at the factory and starts a fire.his best friend is killed.they accuse him of the deed but kane knows it was a man named fry who was there.he becomes a fugitive and goes to find this man named fry.he's helped by a kind blind man.he lets his niece, the billboard model patricia martin take the man to a local blacksmith to have his handcuffs removed.they don't end up there for the woman doesn't believe barry and wants to take him to the police.but soon he changes her mind about barry and they find out about another sabotage attempt that's going to take place soon.there's a group of anti-american fascists.and frank fry is a member of that group.saboteur (1942) is another example of the fact alfred hitchcock could not make a bad movie.robert cummings plays barry kane and he's really good at that.priscilla lane with her good looks plays pat martin.also really good.otto kruger makes a great main villain as the leader of the fascist group, charles tobin.norman lloyd, still alive at 94, plays fry and makes a very believable crook.vaughan glaser is the most sympathetic character as the blind man philip martin.the dance hall sequence is fantastic.and also the moments on the circus train.in the end we're at the statue of liberty.

the subject is banal, even in 1942. it is war propaganda. the fascists are among us and they are doing all they can to sabotage the war effort and to prepare their victory and their seizure of power then and their establishing an effective totalitarian state. but hitchcock has to make it a real thriller. so he invents a first sabotage that succeeds but one of the victims, the friend of the one who dies in it, becomes the prime suspect and run-away for the sabotage. that enables him to so-to-say visit the country and discover the tricky organization of the local nazis who have acquaintances and support in the top benevolent society and use the small little dissatisfied whites to do the dirty work. the chase after the real saboteur takes our young false suspect from los angeles to new york and to the top of the organization. he meets a blind pianist who believes his senses to know the chap is not guilty, his niece who is a star of the advertising billboard but also a frenetic and fanatic patriot who only thinks of going to the police. then the rich rancher and his nest of plotters. then, on the road some sympathetic and friendly truck driver, and the long caravan of a circus going around and their dwarf, bearded woman, siamese sisters, and a few other grotesques of that type. and he discovers the target in a soda city, an electric dam that provides los angeles and its war industry with the energy they need. he takes part as a gravel in the organization in the sabotage of a uss alaska military ship when it is launched. and finally with some inventiveness, creativity and elbow grease he and the pianist's niece manage to get the whole lot cleaned up, most of them arrested and the first saboteur, a certain fry, falls down from the torch of the statue of liberty. that one won't fry on the old electric sparking chair. but hitchcock is not yet in his habit of having a personal cameo appearance in his own films, so don't look for him. it's well built and well performed, but it is only a propaganda film with an extra style.dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines

excellent hitchcock thriller with robert cummings proving once again that he could really act up a storm.this time he is a defense plant worker caught up in a horrible plot when his best friend is killed at the plant.priscilla lane is the girl who suddenly becomes interested in cummings as the plot thickens and he is pursued from california to n.y.there is a diabolical plot by a group of wealthy 5th columnists to destroy from from within. hitchcock was known to play up the upper echelons of society involved in mayhem in his long career as a director.ironically, the film implodes at the very end. while we see what happens to the guy who killed cummings' friend, we don't see what happens to the rest of the gang, again, many of whom represent the upper crust of society.

ironically, what makes john carpenter's "the thing" such an entertaining sci-fi film are its genre-defying elements of mystery, suspense, and tight plot structure. it puts to shame such films as "aliens" or "armageddon" that are content to inundate the viewer with special effects while their plots revolve around stunts that butcher the laws of physics, testosterone-laden one-liners, heroes equipped with enough artillery to conquer iraq, and pathetic attempts to inject "meaning" into the barrage on screen with "emotional sequences" that only serve to further insult the intelligence of the audience. the supreme tragedy, of course, is that these kind of lobotomized movies are also the most popular. i think that there is a cause for this, although it isn't very comforting. there is an increasing trend in our culture to passively "surrender" to the media -- to immerse oneself in the images we see without dedicating a single brain cell to comprehending the statement the work is trying to make. this mindset is becoming increasingly dominant in all arenas; even the once-hallowed print medium is being diluted, thanks to the abominable "reader response" theory that pervades our schools and the "tabloid brigade" that lines our magazine racks whose mentality appears to be infiltrating the once-venerable mainstream press. nowadays, we just flip the switch and put our minds on "pause." is "the thing" a "good" movie? for the rare individual who still values his faculty of reason, a more appropriate term would be "entertaining." its plot keeps one guessing, its ending is uncompromising, and it has some redeeming statements to make about human paranoia. upon subsequent viewings, one begins to note a conspicuous lack of depth in the acting, but the taut storyline remains compelling. of course, "citizen kane" it's not, but then again sci-fi never was a thinking-man's genre...

when john carpenter's masterly version of "the thing" was released in summer 1982, it was panned by critics and bombed at the box office. the audiences couldn't handle another 'bad' alien, they wanted et. their loss in the long run.i would kill to be able to see this great movie on the big screen. this is a movie that was way ahead of it's time; now it has influenced a new generation of filmmakers, showing it's trail on things like "se7en", "alien 3", and even "the x files", which unceremoniously ripped it off page by page. and the structure, which eschews character development in favour of incredible sfx, is commonplace in today's blockbuster flicks.carpenter shows the same skills he honed in "halloween", using the camera to create an unsettling and claustrophobic atmosphere. the performances are all fine, and the ending is terrific - still unique today.a paranoid masterpiece.

it couldn't.from the cutting dialogue to the super special effects this film was a joy to behold throughout. the immediate feel for the bitterness of the antarctic, the affinity for the characters that is built up at the base level before the real action heats up and the cunning finale combine to make this one of the most memorable and enjoyable films around.up against a long list of films that have attempted to exploit the theme of visitors from another planet, the thing comes out on top and laughing. who can forget the perfectly timed dialogue and the chilling special effects? special effects that are a lot more impressive than the computer generated images that we get to see today. i for one found some of the most enjoyable aspects of the film to be the way that we were introduced slowly to each member of the crew, and the way that they all had some distinctive character traits. this wasn't just a senseless bloodbath-come-slasher-horror flick. this film had feeling. emotion.i truly can't recommend this film highly enough. i have yet to see anything in it's class that comes anywhere near to matching, let alone bettering, the near perfect acting and timing utilised in this cunning polymesmeric feat of cinema.

i first saw this film accidentally when they showed it on tv and i was up far too late... i really lucked out there though. it's truly incredible; from the location (as isolated as it's possible to be on this planet; it made "the abyss" look like et in the council swimming pool), through the interesting characters (keith david is especially good as the reactionary childs -"what if we're wrong about him?" - "then we're wrong.") and the effects (more yucky than alien).moreover, however, the real tension and fear in the film has nothing to do with the effects. it's the people you start being scared of; knowing that one of them may - or may not be - "all they appear to be". it's certainly got the feel of "who goes there?".the soundtrack is great; it really plays up the isolation, fear, and gravity of the situation.finally, the epilogue scene really, really cuts. even more than the "but then again who does ?" punchline of bladerunner. enough said.

"the thing" is john carpenter's best movie. merging his talents for tension building and shocks with decent production values he turned out a perfectly crafted sci fi / horror movie.by filming in truly difficult conditions he creates a very believable isolated research base which sets the tension before anything has even happened. the ensemble cast work well together with kurt russell proving a charismatic leading man even under all that beard.by building the tension slowly with moments of gory horror (courtesy of effects meister rob bottin - currently directing freddy vs jason) carpenter creates a movie that has rarely been matched. considering this came out the same year as et it could not be more different!worth a watch / rewatch. 9 out of 10.p.s. the dvd is excellent. lots of extras plus the best dvd commentary going (with carpenter & russell). plus remixed in dolby digital for even scarier sound effects.

this is one of the most outstanding horror movies i've ever seen in my life time. forget the exorcist and all the other hype horror movies out there.john carpenter as made a tour-de-force horror epic with outstanding special-effects great performances from kurt russell and co and a great soundtrack that will haunt you for ever! the greatest thing about this movie after 17 years is it has'nt dated it looks fresh and new and you don't get many movies like this.back in 1982 this was up against e.t. and of course it failded and was a box-office bomb. over the years the thing as made a cult following from video and t.v sales and as many new fans. in the end this movie kicks ass and to me it as never loss it's edge to scare the pants off of you and to me that a horror movie. long live john carpenter!!

i cannot believe i never added my two cents about this film as yet!this is one of the best films of all time. many critics and movie-goers alike talk of john carpenter's "halloween" for setting trends and being "his best work". those folks have not seen this version of "the thing" because it is right up there with "halloween".john carpenter's work shines in this film. he took a film that was already made and instead of "re-making" the film, he made the book the first film was based on! brilliant.the casting of each man was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, made me scared, made me guess, made me laugh, made me question, even up to today "who goes there?" in that film. this film had no hollywood sweetie pie or funny-type ending, and what a bold move not to have one in 1982. another brilliant move.i was at the screening for this film when i was on vacation in southern california. the audience at the screening went wild! i carry those memories for years, it was so much fun! we all thought that there was no way on god's green earth this film was not going to be a hit. but by box office receipts, it was a dud because of "et, the extra terrestrial" and "poltergeist" two very good family oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came out.this film was what i, as a horror film adult buff was looking for, a horror/thriller with an adult script, and real adult actors. not kids playing adults. not little miss "big-breasted" scream-queen of the day running around screaming for titilation but real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear. heck, being a feminist, i didn't even miss women in this film! and good for mr. carpenter by not putting one in there, it really wouldn't have made sense! (unless, "the thing" was actually feminine! something to think about!)i saw special effects of that time i had never seen before, i saw makeup that made me sit up a few nights. this is what horror/thrillers of today are missing. today, the directors wimp out. today, the studios wimp out. too much cgi and not enough belief, too much cgi and not enough story, not enough imagination. you leave the theater and in a week -- or less -- you forget about the film and move onto the next grand film opening. this one stays with ya. that's one of the marks of an excellent film.on many reviews i've written how now paying $10 for a film is horrid. for films like this one, you'd pay it and not feel slighted. this film is not for everyone.i find it horrific that they lable this film a "cult" film. i find that the audience is broader than many would lead you to belive and although not a commercial success in 1982, this is an example of how releasing a darn good film on the wrong date can make a darn good film look bad. after john carpenter's film, many people copied many techniques, make-up, special effects and story lines from this version of "the thing".i am now excitd to go on record and state that this film is one of the best films of all time, very much under rated. please see it uncut, please see it in letterbox and please hear it digitally. you'll talk about it for years as well.

this being my first john carpenter film, i must say i was very impressed by the thing. right from the beginning, the film draws you in, and never lets up on the tension. the film's special effects and models hold up well even today. other than kurt russell, i wasn't familiar with any of the cast members but they were all exceptional in imparting fear, paranoia, and the desperation to survive. the universal dvd has a wealth of very interesting behind the scenes extras. strongly recommended, 9/10.

aaah...the thing.to see a horror film in which not only is every character over the age of thirty, but distinctly unattractive, makes a refreshing change, and reminds me of those distant times when actors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters, rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover. and carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over-styled parodies. and there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending, or cameo celebrity appearance, or lame pseudo-romantic subplot.and i really miss on-set physical effects; with all those 20 year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics. in the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw alien, the elephant man, poltergeist, the howling, an american werewolf in london, the thing, the company of wolves, a nightmare on elm street...what an era for horror effects! and don't get me started on the death of matte painting. the matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless.what do we have now? third rate cgi, former music video directors and professional stylists, that makes even 'gritty' horror movies look like glossy mtv videos.now i'm going to go netflix 'the howling'.

for me, a ten-star film is one that never dies in my memory, and yet can be watched over and over again with the same pleasure as the first time. this could be a technically flawed movie; the pleasure has nothing to do with spit-and-polish (my personal top-ten is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). john carpenter's "the thing" is one of very few films to fit this criterion.i've been a science fiction fan since i was a child in the sixties, and i read the john w campbell short story on which the film is based ("who goes there") before i saw the original, black-and-white howard hawks film (as with a lot of people, that viewing was illicit, on the tv, when i should have been in bed!). that movie, as with so many that you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed near perfection: the suspense, the inexplicable nature of the alien, the photography; it all just seemed to work. i watched it many times in the years after (and still do, when it is shown on tv). because of this, i avoided the carpenter version for years - seeing remakes of one's favourite film is, i thought, always a mistake. when i did eventually watch it sometime in 1988/9, again on tv because there was nothing else on, i realised that i need to change "always a mistake" to "usually a mistake"! carpenter had produced something different from the original film, closer to the original story, and truly wonderful. from the opening scene of the helicopter and husky, through the viscerally disturbing scene in the dog-pound, to that ending (sorry, no spoilers here!), i was hooked. the sound track alone lives with me - all i have to hear is a close similarity to that bass-over-snare drum beat, and i'm *in* the final scene again ...until seeing "the thing", i had carpenter down as just another gore-monkey, based only on comments and reviews in mainstream press. since seeing "the thing", i think i have seen most of his movies - i haven't gone out of my to do so, but if one comes up, just seeing his name as director is enough to make up my mind to watch it. he is thoughtful, and knows how to build a film up so that it reaches a point at which something will stick in the memory.if you haven't seen "the thing", and you enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favour - sit down in a dark room, wrap up warm, and prepare to have your memory enhanced!

in an era where nearly every great horror film of the 60s and 70s is being remade for audiences weaned on horror flicks of today that are not too terribly good, it is instructive to look back at john carpenter's 1982 opus the thing, which itself is a remake--of a childhood favorite of the director's, howard hawks' 1951 sci-fi/horror classic the thing from outer space. although carpenter's film was not initially that big a box office hit when released in mid-1982, it has since garnered a very large following.in fact, carpenter's film is less of a remake of hawks' film than it is a reworking, as he goes back to the original idea posited by the source material, namely the john w. campbell story "who goes there?", in which a us scientific crew in antarctica is menaced by a shape-changing alien thawed out from the ice after 100,000 years. kurt russell, who had starred for carpenter in the director's 1979 tv movie elvis and the 1981 film escape from new york, heads a cast of stalwart character actors, including keith david, donald moffat, richard dysart, and richard masur, in this tension-filled exploration of paranoia, as the shape-changing "thing", which first comes to their camp in the form of a guide dog a norwegian team is trying to kill, takes over each of them one by one. it isn't long before everybody in the camp begins to mistrust his fellow man. the ending of the film, in which russell and david are the only ones left, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity akin to the similar codas to both the birds and straw dogs.almost universally, when the subject of the thing is bought up, the emphasis is on the extremely gory special effects make-up and alien designs created by rob bottin, who had worked with carpenter on the 1980 horror classic the fog, and on joe dante's 1981 werewolf film the howling. these effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic, and even today, they can also be quite stomach-turning. but all of this would make carpenter's film nothing more than a high-end splatter epic if the direction, the story, and the acting weren't up to snuff; and thankfully, each of them are. when he's not concentrating on the enormously gruesome transformation sequences, carpenter builds suspense in the same hitchcock-influenced way that informed his previous films halloween and the fog, with cinematographer dean cundey's prowling camera-work, particularly through the corridors of the station, a significant help. the acting enhances an already-fine screenplay adaptation by bill lancaster; and we are also given a taut score by ennio morricone, whose work on director sergio leone's classic 1960s italian spaghetti westerns is well known to all, including of course carpenter himself. the thing also features additional fine visual effects from albert whitlock (who worked on many hitchcock films, including the birds), and roy arbogast, who worked on close encounters of the third kind and jaws 2.carpenter's film was not the success it could have been because universal chose to release this graphic shocker a mere two weeks after it had released steven spielberg's far more family-friendly e.t.: the extra-terrestrial (not surprisingly, critics and audiences at the time favored spielberg's excellent film over carpenter's equally excellent but exceedingly different one). also, most of the horror film box office business in 1982 was going to another spielberg-produced film, poltergeist. as a result, at a cost of $15 million, the thing suffered from lack of attention in its time.over time, however, many have come to see carpenter's film for what it is--an extremely gory but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, done with a great deal of flair and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia at the heart of its story. though it is still quite gruesome, the thing should be as much remembered for the skill by which the story is put together as it is for the gory alien designs and make-up effects; for it is the storytelling skill and the suspense that make it so memorable in the final analysis.

a brilliant horror film. utterly gruesome and very scary too. the thing is a remake from john carpenter, but please, do not let that put you off this film. it is simply brilliant. the start of the film has the alien's spacecraft hurtling towards the earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film's title in amazing shining white and blue stating 'the thing'. one of the best opening credits for a horror film ever.the cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their station in antartica is visually impressive on dvd widescreen. it must have been great in the cinema. i regret not seeing this on the big screen.kurt russell is excellent as macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base. all the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected. my favourite scene in the whole film has to be when macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection, it is tense, scary and finally spectacular. i love it because its funny as well.special mention must go to rob bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself. if he didn't get an oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have. this is also debatable as to whether this is john carpenter's greatest film...its certainly a gruesome masterpiece.wait for a cold winter night. get some budweiser from the fridge. sit down and watch the thing, a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and slime.utterly brilliant.ten out of ten.

john carpenter's "the thing" is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made. sadly as with most carpenter movies go it is also one of the most underrated movies being panned by critics shortly after it's release for a reason that is almost pathetic. it seems that at the time people were overwhelmed by the idea of the "good" alien. an idea spawned after the success of "i.t.". and the very thought that a movie dealing with aliens could deviate from that idea was regarded as heresy. human ignorance is truly a frightening thing, people need to judge films for what they are not for what they want them to be."the thing" itself is an interesting study on human paranoia as members of a u.s. antarctic base discover the presence of an alien being (refered throughout the movie only as a "thing") able to imitate any form of life. not knowing who might or might not be the creature, we see how every character reacts to the situation. there is no mass hysteria or panic just a slow and gradual descent in to chaos as more and more people turn up to be... not quite human.carpenter succeeds into elevating this movie into something far more than your average sci-fi/horror. there are no "whats behind you?" jumping moments here. instead relying on an intense atmosphere of mistrust and pre-apocalyptic despair along with some nicely balanced moments of visual terror with no small thanks to rob bottin's impressive creature effects, he gives us an experience not matched by many other horror films.instead of just throwing facts and plot elements at our face carpenter offers us a much a more gradual and delicate approach. by implying a sense of mystery he gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret-ate what has transpired in certain scenes, while giving enough plot to those who are not so fond of interpretation in movies.ennio morricone's score works all the way. it's minimalistic and depressing sound perfectly fits the movie's overall tone. although i've always wondered how would it have sounded if carpenter (he has been known to compose all of his movies's osts except this one) did it? characters while not as deeply developed are still memorable thanks to the good performances of the actors especially kurt russel who plays the "down-out" apathetic helicopter pilot r.j. macready. its worth noting how his character transforms through the movie. from his disregardful "don't give a ...." attitude in the beginning, to that of a unifier and leader of the group of men who try to fight "the thing". but even with that said, there are no false heroics here, there are no "laughing at the face of death" moments and there certainly isn't any sort of comic relief, the movie keeps its atmosphere from the very first scene to the last. speaking of which, here once again carpenter keeps his tradition of creating a powerful ending.quarter of a century after its release "the thing" doesn't feel dated. and with the disturbingly growing use of computer-generated effects it feels even stronger then before because it shows the life's work and dedication of human beings not computers. combined with its openness for analyzing it gives the viewer a lot more reasons to watch it for a second or third or fourth or ... time. a masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten.

people with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but the thing is far from being simply a horror classic. the fact that the extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day cgi is only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as a masterpiece. technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing, superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film justice. absolutely essential viewing.

john carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of sci-fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it to the extreme. a remake of the howard hawks produced 1951 original, carpenter keeps the cold-war themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the antarctic setting. carpenter's direction as always is excellent as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body takeover. but here and much like the work of david cronenberg, carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident, as through some fantastic special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore. however, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.9/10

when in 1982, "the thing" came out to theaters everywhere, it had a cold reception and very poor box-office results, becoming almost a failure in john carpenter's career as a horror director; however, time has proved that "the thing" was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the film's fault. nowadays, john carpenter's "the thing" has gained the appreciation it rightfully deserves and is considered by many horror fans as a horror classic, and not without a reason, as this new version of john w. campbell, jr.'s story "who goes there?" (previously adapted as "the thing from another world") is closer to the original tale and keeps a pessimistic feeling of dread and high doses of suspense in a masterfully crafted study about paranoia.the plot of "the thing", begins in the winter of 1982 in a u.s. research station located in the remote territories of antarctica, when the members of the crew notice a norwegian helicopter coming their way. the two apparently insane pilots of the helicopter are trying to kill a husky dog who makes its way into the american base. after the norwegians are killed accidentally, the americans try to figure out what made them to be insane. soon they'll discover that the husky dog the norwegians were hunting was not a normal dog, but a creature able to mimic every living creature, and not only that, it has a tremendous hunger.director john carpenter earned a place in history when in 1978 he directed the seminal slasher "halloween", where suspense and atmosphere were above gore and shock. "the thing" could be seen as an evolution of that style, as even when carpenter makes great use of rob bottin's special effects (which were labeled by critics as "repulsive" on its day), the film still focuses more on atmosphere and suspense rather than in the violent (and very well-done) displays of gore. the feeling of loneliness, as well as the "bad karma" between the members of the crew increase the feeling of paranoia as anyone could be the thing, even our main character, r. j. macready (kurt russell), ending in a situation where nobody can be trusted.this plot element was more faithful to the concept of the source novel, and was blatantly ignored by the previous version (not completely a bad thing, just a big difference), making this version feel less like a remake and more as a new conception of the source novel. bill lancaster's script handles the characters with brilliant domain, giving us enough to distinguish them, but not too much to completely trust them, making them an essential factor in the film's haunting feeling of dread that keeps running through the movie. the mystery and the suspense are at the max, as never one can tell who is the thing and who is normal, enhancing the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent results.the cast is very effective, and their performances as a whole so effective that one can almost feel the bad feelings between their characters as real. carpenter's regular collaborator kurt russell as macready carries the film, and through his eyes we witness the madness and the horror the research station becomes as the situations goes worse. definitely one of his best performances. wilford brimley is also terrific as dr. blair, a scientist that goes insane after discovering the thing's purposes."the thing" is a film so wonderfully crafted that its flaws tend to go unnoticed, although they exist. the most notorious being the very low-key and at times unappropriated score by ennio morricone. it's not exactly bad, but it just feels out of place at some scenes and it's not one of the best works by the legendary composer. also, due to some misshapes with the special effects, some scenes were left out that actually fill some small plot holes, although nothing of big importance or actually annoying.when talking about john carpenter's films, most people will almost instantly name "halloween" as his favorite film, but personally, i would go with "the thing", as i consider it carpenter's greatest achievement so far, and one of the most interesting and actually scary horror films ever made. i would go as far as to call it one of the finest films ever made. 10/10

the thing is a milestone in movie-making and remains one of my favourite films of all-time. despite the film's roots in science-fiction it is ultimately a horror film that brilliantly balances splatter with psychological trauma. today, over twenty five years after its release, the special effects stand up as an example of sheer brilliance and effects man rob bottin suffered a complete physical breakdown for his art. it would be impossible to make the same movie today as the studio would most certainly insist on casting a female character or a paul-walker type.an all-male american science team in antarctica are thrown into turmoil when an alien lifeform able to perfectly absorb and imitate other lifeforms infiltrates their camp. their trust in each other steadily crumbles as they become increasingly unsure who is real and who is an imitation, and this 'body-snatchers' scenario sees their numbers steadily dwindle as one-by-one, they fall victim to the thing. when cornered, it manifests itself as a different nightmarish creature, the metamorphosis always horrific and compelling.the helplessness, isolation and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men with no way out of their situation and no way of help reaching them is expertly sustained. the long hours of darkness and the mounting snowfall provide a bleak backdrop to the terror that unfolds. director john carpenter selected with great care a team of brilliant character-actors and each member of the team fits perfectly into the part they play, whether it be the young and street-wise chef, the elderly and wise doctor or the bitter and cynical helicopter pilot. the point is that no-one here comes close to being an all-american badass superhero with blonde locks and a six-pack and the film's real strength is thanks in no small part to this stark realism. the people suffering on-screen are recognisable in our daily lives.the thing remains consistently enjoyable and affecting even after repeated viewings. i have now seen the film on more than twenty separate occasions and my amazement at the quality of the direction, the acting and the special effects is unwavering. my girlfriend prefers the high-school spin-off of the film -the faculty- which is good and solid entertainment but far more light-hearted and whistful. she still loves and acknowledges the brilliance of the thing however, and thank goodness for that... because i could not remain in the company of someone who didn't love this movie.a classic and then some.

in 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens. steven spielberg's et, and john carpenter's the thing. of the two of them, et was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though the thing debuted first. because people were so entranced with spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from the thing in droves.its not hard to see why. the two are diametrically opposed. one is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart. the other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us. i guess audiences felt et was a much cuter prospect than the thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!it's taken some time, but the thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience. as it should. because the thing is that rare example of a superior remake. it takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways. indeed carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, alien. and that's even rarer!carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than the thing from another world did. it keeps the frigid wastes of antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation. but although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.frequent carpenter collaborator kurt russell returns, hot off the success of escape from new york, cast once again as one of carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes. he plays macready, the helicopter pilot at an antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess). the trouble begins when a norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over macready's, trying to gun down a siberian husky from the air.they end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the husky and add it to their own. except that this husky, is not a husky at all. but a shape-changing alien. the norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail. soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.the thing is one of john carpenter's finest films. in fact i'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made. even surpassing classics like halloween and dark star. the reason why i place the thing at the top of carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic. all the others thereafter have felt like carpenter was slumming it. films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.but the thing had john carpenter at the peak of his powers. never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. not even in the ferocious assault on precinct 13. from the second the alien makes its presence known, carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly. and when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.the film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. an approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. bringing in rob bottin of the howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. amorphous shapes. half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, the thing came under fire for being too realistic!that type of thinking misses the point entirely. it only shortchanges the film's values. and there are many. carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to. its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story. the thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications. characterisation has never been one of john carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in the thing. because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing. we're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who. and because of this, the thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.a special mention should go to the excellent film score from ennio morricone. a pulsing thud thud every two seconds. it creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. the scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.the thing is a pure unadulterated classic. even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. an underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received. and so much better than et!

in following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material, the thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. john carpenter fashions out of what must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched, brilliant puppetry and animatronics by rob bartin (with stan winston also on the team). these effects help set the tone against the harsh, detached environment carpenter sets up with his characters. the film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the shapes of others. it's given a full life by carpenter's choice of tones, and surprises. for someone following in the footsteps of howard hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old film.with the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely follow backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors pull along as a fine ensemble. unlike the squad in predator, these are mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of kurt russell's maccreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in fact). juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of wilford brimley and keith david. and it is refreshing to see how the sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone. i loved the long silences at times, with ennio morricone's spooky, curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in itself).it ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for for its genre/cult audience. it remains one of carpenter's best; a rare breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes. that's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in fact a couple of times it's almost funny. but given that it goes back to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was done completely without cgi. it's disgusting, but it's real, and atmospheric to a t.

the silly saying, "you can't touch this" surely applies here. with all the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time. that's why i always rely on the classics that scared the weewee out of me when i was a pre-teen.the thing is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest, ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that john carpenter, or any other director (sorry, even you mr. spielberg) ever made. what really gives it power, though, is not the gore (it ooooozes of slime and blood and god knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread, isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.you can't get more remote than antarctica, and in this howling, freezing white setting is where the story takes place. several americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. one day, they witness a siberian husky dog running for dear life from gun-wielding norwegians. before they know it, the american outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants. it may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished, but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't tell it among humans or other normal earth animals.kurt russell, keith david, wilford brimley, richard masur, donald moffatt, tk carter, thomas waites and charles hallahan are just a few of the fine cast. this film is the reason why horror can be a great genre. it actually still scares me. the alien blood "jumping" out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes me jump!!!still the scariest of them all.

the thing has to be one of the all time great movies. of course it was ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, i'd never seen anything like that! however, although the effects themselves made the movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the claustrophobic atmosphere of the anarctic as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station that makes it a classic. movies don't get any better than this! in the opening scene with the the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored scientists from some station letting of some steam. yet when you see them continue their chase at the us base you then think that the norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain of cabin fever. yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score that sets the tempo! you just know that something is not right! at this point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. however, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of agatha christie "who dunnit" ( i.e. ten little indians movie) sci-fi style as the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien. suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. the mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses until the final showdown.after 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making production the special effects in "the thing" don't carry the same weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all round with some great performances by the cast.

john carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of john w campbell jr's short story. the secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold. carpenter manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery needed to keep the film heading in the right direction. be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film to me is a perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. the dialogue is spot on for a group of men trying to keep it together under duress, and carpenter's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming thru the film. the cast are superb, a solid assembly of actors led by carpenter fave kurt russell, whilst the effects used give the right amount of impact needed. but most of all it's the ending that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it, lets wait and see what happens indeed, 10/10.

remake of the classic 1951 "the thing from another world". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in antartica. they are invaded by a thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to. it starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. what are they going to do?the 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. that movie was scary. this one is too--but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material--the novelette "who goes there?") and it's scary in a different way. the movie starts right off with ennio morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and--when the thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding. there's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off, heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first by the thing. the gore effects are strong and real nightmare material. i don't scare easy but i had to sleep with the lights on when i saw this originally back in 1982. rob bottin's effects are just incredible--how this picture got by with an r rating is beyond me!it also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful. you're not sure who is what and carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension. one complaint--no one is given any distinctive personality traits. they actors just remain straight-faced and say their lines. that's annoying...but the movie still works.this was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with "e.t." and many critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie. it's now considered one of john carpenter's best. a must-see...for strong stomaches. not a date film!an amusing note: when this was released universal sent a note along with all prints of the film. they suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. they were afraid that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be close to a facility to throw up!

many people has got a film they think of as their favourite movie. my movie will always be john carpenter's the thing! the main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the splatter-effects created mainly by genius rob bottin and that this is the movie that made kurt russell what he is today (along with escape from n.y.) in my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to do with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting. i have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day the last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even the great "das boot".here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror movies: place yourself in the good chair of your home. be sure you're not interupted by anyone. if you aint got a projector, sit close to your tv and watch this miracle of a film. let it absorbe you, and you'll see it my way!best view time: late february between 5 and 9 in the evening.

antarctica, winter 1982. the team on an american research base get surprised by a couple of mad norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill it. all the norwegians are killed and the americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. that's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film i've ever seen.from the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. helpless and alone out in no-mans land. ennio morricone was nominated for a razzie award for his score. why i don't know 'cause as far as i can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. it really gets you in the right mood.the acting is great! the best performance is probably given by the dog who's just amazing. as for russell and the others on two legs i can say nothing less.you may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? well, think again! you haven't seen it all until you've seen this. bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... rob bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup.the movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known. in fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. nobody i've asked have heard of it. however the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and dvd. twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date. this movie is to be considered a classic.the movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. i've seen it several times, but it's just as good as the first time i saw it. as a norwegian the only thing i don't like about this movie is that macready keeps calling the norwegians swedes!

john carpenter's the thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. what makes the movie so great? it's hard to put my finger on it. everything just seems to work in the thing, it's one of the rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place. the film is even superior to alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell. the fact that it's not only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films. a truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in films.

this is another one of those films that i remember staying up late to watch on tv, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession. this is a great movie, and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before cgi.set on an isolated base in antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (the thing from another world) left off. the american scientists discover a decimated norwegian base some miles distant. everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. the thing is brought back to the american base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. the thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses its path, but also absorbing them, making itself into whoever and whatever it wants. the film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. everyone is suspect, anyone can be the thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. the group splinters and fear rules supreme. who is the thing?the gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. i could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien. the power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although i liked the original version, i prefer this one; the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected. when it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath is huge and the results are horrific.this is one of carpenters best films, right up there with the fog and halloween. all of the actors give strong, realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character. this film has something for any lover of the horror genre. don't miss it.

i am ashamed to say it, but i have to admit, the first time i saw this film was only about a year ago. after seeing it, i immediately rushed out and bought the dvd collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.the film is terrific on many levels. it works as your straight monster or action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look into the human psyche. the incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear, lent not only by carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general. kurt russell (obviously) is spectacularly understated in the lead role of macready, and, as a direct result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all american hero". the other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic film.

this film is a good start for novices that have never watched a 'silent film' and for those who believe that quality cinema started with their generations efforts. they are doing a disservice to themselves by not expanding their horizons. the 'silent film' is a art-form of acting in pantomime that is different from the sound film and the stage, it can stands on it's own merits.the beloved rogue (1927) united artists is a fictionalized history of the relationship of french poet 'francois villon' and 'king louis xi'. through 'villons' prodding 'king louis' will defeat his nemesis 'duke of burgandy' minimize the feudal system and establish the king as head of the state and the beginnings of modern france.the cast is exceptional, lead by john barrymore (yes, drew's grandfather). for those who only remember him for the decaying actor 'larry renault' in dinner at eight (1933) or the ham in the invisable women (1940) this will be a revelation. fit, trim with the 'great profile' still in evidence he commands the screen. co-starring in his first american film is conrad veidt with his 'cadaverous spider' interpretation of 'louis xi'. this is a duel of acting titans, each not giving the other a inch. on a trivia note is character actor and dwarf angelo rossitto in his first film, his last, mad max beyond thunderdome (1985). there are other character actors who would continue in sound that are easily picked up on. united artists spared no expense in this handsome production supervised by william cameron menzies. costumes, props and sets are well done and not exaggerated like in a douglas fairbanks productions. there is a touch of reality here. the copy on dvd that we watched from 'delta entertainment' came from a good master. though not 'restored' its musical soundtrack was clear and the print only suffered from nuisance black-spots (dirt) and drop-outs. the only major damage at the end of the last reel from water. 'kino' also has a edition which may be of a better quality since they do major restorations on their prints. best check with them. in our opinion this is a 'must have' particularly if you have no 'silents' in your collection. this is a good place to start.

fran√ßois villon was a real-life poet and rogue who lived in paris in the 15th century. however, most of what is portrayed in this historical film is actually fiction--from a play created at the beginning of the 20th century. whereas in the film he met and became friends with louis xi, in reality he died in his 30s and was never involved in all the intrigues like he was in this film. in reality, he wrote some lovely verse and was frequently on the wrong side of the law--not the combination of a patriot and robin hood-like character like he is in the film. provided you know that the film is nearly 100% fiction, then it's well worth seeing--just don't assume it's a good history lesson.in the beloved rogue, villon is played with wild abandon by john barrymore. i was also pretty excited to see that his three friends were all played by very familiar faces. angelo rossitto, who was the plucky dwarf, played in tons of films over the years and had a very long career. slim summerville was a character actor known for adding a touch of comedy to films. mack swain is best known as the silent film foil in many of chaplin's short films and played his partner in the gold rush. all four of these men did a nice job and have no complaints---even with barrymore's rather over-the-top treatment that was rather reminiscent of a douglas fairbanks performance. however, the performance i had a serious problem with was conrad veidt as king louis xi. to call this "unsubtle" would be a gross understatement. he played the role like a high schooler who thought he was supposed to be the stereotypical richard iii--skulking about and acting like a demoniacal caricature. while veidt was wonderful in many, many films (both silent and sound) but here he is just ridiculous.as for the story, it's full of lusty adventure and action--like a swashbuckling film minus the sailing ships. the sets worked out well for all this, as they'd been used the previous year for the hunchback of notre dame. both films were set around the same time period.overall, it's one of the last great silent films. there's a lot to like and the film is a lovely combination of romance, comedy and action. well worth seeing, though it loses a couple of points for veidt's overacting as well as the way the film plays fast and loose with history.by the way, this film was also made twice as if i were king (1920 and 1938) and apparently these two films are closest to the original play. however, in total, six films have been about villon and tell, more or less, variations on the same tale!

most of the silent films i've seen have been serious in nature, so it was fun to see one with a comic touch. the setting and some of the scenes for "the beloved rogue" were reminiscent of 1923's "the hunchback of notre dame" relative to the paris street scenes and the celebration of the 'king of fools'. john barrymore portrays france's greatest poet francois villon in a characterization that ranges quite broadly from virtual slapstick to romantically tender; that 'water into wine' bit early in the picture was rather amusing.it seems that times never change, and it's interesting to see the movie make a cogent observation nearly a century ago - paris has it's fool to reign for one night, while everywhere else has one all the time. how true.the appearance of conrad veidt in the film was a little surprising for this viewer, i've only seen him as major strasser in "casablanca", oddly one of his very last movies. as king louis xi, he's a monarch obsessed with astrology, crafty but suspicious, and it was a bit unnerving to see how closely he resembled brad dourif's wormtounge character from the final chapter of the 'lord of the rings' trilogy. not exactly exuding the confidence a king of france might be expected to bear. which is why the ascendancy of burgundy's duke (lawson butt) seemed all the more plausible, until villon rises to the occasion to put one over on both rulers.i found it interesting that the use of inter-title cards was exceedingly spare, used only when absolutely necessary to advance the story. without them though, one would have missed a curious nugget. it seems villon carried out his exile from paris at the hostel of the lame flea! the print i viewed was of exceptional quality, the very first film presented in a one hundred action and suspense movie dvd set from mill creek entertainment, that's saying something for a film that's now eighty years old. it's great that movies from the silent era are now finding a wider distribution in this type of commercial format, making them accessible to an entirely new generation of movie lovers.one question - did it seem like conrad veidt's king louis picked his nose on purpose, or as an inadvertent gesture that simply remained safe from the cutting room?

the beloved rogue is a wonderful period piece. it portrays 145th century paris in grand hollywood fashion, yet offering a bleaker side to existence there as it would be experienced by the poor. and the snow. it's constantly swirling about, adding to the severity of the setting -- brilliant! the setting is enhanced by the odd cast of characters, including beggars, cripples and dwarfs.a brilliant performance is turned in by john barrymore, outdone only by the magnificent conrad veidt, who portrays a degenerate, dissolute louis xi to perfection. and yes, veidt picks his nose on purpose, pushing his portrayal to wonderfully wry limits.

and nothing wrong in that! heartily endorse the comments of boblipton and snow leopard.i'm thrilled to find this movie is available on us dvd - i've only ever seen it through once - i persuaded the goethe institute here in london to show it in their conrad veidt season some years ago - and long to see it again.barrymore is resplendent when engaged, as in this movie, possibly because of the prick of having a renowned german actor as a foil. and veidt is such a wonderful scene stealer (doesn't he pick his nose at one point?) this is one of the seminal films to connect 'dr jekyll' with '20th century', 'grand hotel' or 'midnight'; and 'the cabinet of dr caligari' or 'the student of prague' with 'the spy in bladk', 'contraband' and 'casablanca'.see it!

superb silent version of the story of francois villon. although remade in the thirties as if i were king, with frank lloyd directing, preston sturges scripting and ronald colman starring, this version is even better. barrymore, with a cohort of comedians, plays the comic fool and the wine-depressed villon with a verve that colman could not match. the photography is startling in its beauty and innovation and the supporting cast, particularly conrad veidt in his american premiere, the incredibly beautiful marceline day, and the supporting comics, slim summerville and hank mann, steal every scene they are in.it is a shame that barrymore did so few first-rate comedies. among his sound films, only his lead in twentieth century and his supporting role in midnight can compare to this, and those stand up only because of his superb voice. in this silent movie, barrymore must tell his tale without benefit of words, and he does so, alternately hilariously unrecognizable as the king of the fools and tenderly as villon in love. he even gets to leap around in the swashbuckling style of fairbanks, most convincingly. he also lets his supporting cast have their share of glory, capering in this ensemble work like any talented comic of the era.finally, a brief word about alan crosland, a director known today only for directing the first talking feature, the jazz singer in the same year this was released. crosland was a careful, innovative, delightfully original director, and it is a shame that more of his works are not known. perhaps this movie, far more interesting as a movie than his best-known work, will be your introduction to his other talents. if so, you could do far worse.

crossfire remains one of the best hollywood message movies because, unlike the admirably intentioned gentleman's agreement, which it beat to theatres by a few months, it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying "it's because i'm jewish, isn't it?" it's much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical. somewhat shamefully, the brief featurette on the warners' dvd doesn't mention that novelist richard brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti-semitic one, but it's interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is jewish, there's little doubt in sam levene's performance that the character is in fact also gay ¬ñ not a mincing caricature, but there's definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with george cooper's confused soldier. there's not much of a mystery to who the murderer is: even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows, the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable, but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point: the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy.there's an element of ealing films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix (you could almost see that aspect as a blueprint for hue and cry), but the atmosphere is pure rko noir. set over one long sweltering night, the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style (it cut back on lighting time and allowed director edward dmytryk more time to work with the actors) and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script: a laid-back but quietly charismatic robert mitchum, robert young's maigret-like detective, gloria grahame's tramp and the perpetually creepy paul kelly as her compulsive liar admirer, a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties. but the lasting impression is of robert ryan's excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row. a big surprise hit in 1946, as a reward, dmytryk and producer adrian scott found themselves investigated by the huac, which itself had a notable tendency to target jews. so much for crusading¬Ö

"crossfire" feels like an underdeveloped masterpiece -- it's well acted and beautifully filmed, but thinly written and way too short. as is, it's just a decent police procedural with hints of film noir (at its zenith in 1947) and social commentary (also trendy at the time) thrown in for good measure. it's remembered today as one of the first two hollywood films to deal with anti-semitism, and as being much better than the similarly-themed "gentleman's agreement" (no mean feat). but its real subject is the difficulty that wwii soldiers, as trained killers, were having as they made the transition to civilian life. (for a more genteel take on this topic, try "the best years of our lives.") a man is beaten to death in the first few frames of the film. we do not see his attacker. the movie is about the investigation of this murder, which is actually pretty straightforward, but it takes some unnecessary detours, like when the main suspect, a depressed soldier, winds up in the apartment of gloria grahame, a dance-hall hooker with a really weird pimp played by paul kelly. there's also a civics lecture halfway through the movie that slows the proceedings to a crawl, and the ending is tidy enough for a cop show. but otherwise it's a pretty decent mystery. still, what a great noir it could have been. director edward dmytryk drops a few hints at the subject of the original novel -- homosexuality, not anti-semitism -- like when sadistic creep monty seethes at the image of his friend mitch talking with a strange man at a bar. and the cast is excellent. robert ryan makes for a very credible cretin, and even becomes a little sympathetic in his final scenes, not unlike peter lorre as the child murderer in "m." he deserved an oscar but lost to edmund gwenn that year (you can't beat santa claus). robert mitchum is onhand as a soldier friend of the accused killer. was mitchum a great actor or a great star? someone else can figure that out, but his sleepy eyes and bemused half-smile work very well here since they imply that his character knows something everyone else doesn't. (and he does.) and robert young, as the detective assigned to the murder, is surprisingly gritty, discarding his usual avuncular affability even when he has to deliver the civil-rights sermon midway through the picture. there's no question that bogart or tracy would have been brilliant in the role, but neither of them were at rko in 1947 so you'll just have to deal with dr. welby. still, young is good enough to make you wish someone had cast him in a detective drama instead of "father knows best," which he hated and which drove him to alcoholism and suicide attempts. the man deserved better than smarm and sanka.

**** spoilers throughout **** this is a very strange film - particularly for its time - in every respect. for six years, american movies had shown american soldiers as everybody's son, brother, father.in movies like the best years of our lives and til the end of time, our hearts are tugged by the difficulty that the sweet returning soldiers have in adjusting to peace and their families. yet in this same year, this film shows soldiers as a mix of people rather worse than the viewer - one message of this film is - "lock up your daughters." even the good soldiers - with plenty of time on their hands - are gambling all the time, getting stupefyingly drunk, and are wholly indifferent to whether they even have wives any more. and their reaction to the police investigating a murder is -- to conspire against them.mitchum, the most sympathetic soldier says things like "i don't know if my wife wants to make a go of it now after the war. haven't seen her in two years. do i care? not really. maybe we'll make a go of it, maybe not." another soldier is shown as unusually sensitive because after years away, he would like to see his wife again.later, when this soldier states at the police station that he spent the evening at a whore's home - without knowing his wife is sitting just behind him, there seems to be no question whatever that his wife will be fine. indeed, she is - i guess it's "hey, soldiers will be soldiers".the police detective played by robert young who is trying to crack a murder case, states convincingly and with infinite weariness about someone's account of their actions on the night in question, "do i care? no. i don't really care about anything any more. i've done this too long, i guess." a man shows up at the whore's apartment. he says "i'm just a man like you, interested in" the whore. then he says, "no that's a lie, i'm her husband. i'd like to be in the military, i was turned down before." then he says, "no, that's a lie, why would i want to be a soldier?" he goes through another series of lies when the police ask him who he is. to the end of the movie, we haven't a clue who he is or why he is there!he's one of the strangest characters in the history of movies! a man stands with his girlfriend at a bar talking to four soldiers, when a clumsy soldier knocks a drink onto his girlfriend. she leaves to change her dress - and is right back wearing another, no problem. yet the man doesn't leave with his girlfriend - who simply disappears - but instead follows one of the soldiers when he leaves to go to another area of the bar! the man then extrapolates from the minimal information he's learned about the soldier -- to philosophize grandly about the problems of returning soldiers -- and immediately invites the soldier home because he is drunk and feels sick. this is strange stuff.similarly, a dance hall girl is irritated by the sentimental soldier who would like to take her out "for a real dance - and dinner maybe". yet she does dance with him - and immediately gives him the key to her home! were people in the late 1940s always urging soldiers to come to their homes after they just met them? robert ryan kills his host, a stranger, when he's enraged that the jewish host tries to get the steadily drunker ryan out of his home. the reason for the murder? "no jew tells me how to drink". "how to drink?" huh? what does that mean? this movie is always off-kilter, quite deliberately so - the soldiers act consistently with total complete defiance of the law, and all the characters are as cold and tough as any movie i've ever seen.and yet the movie is utterly gripping! you simply have no idea how these people are going to act - or what new bizarre character is going to pop up - without anyone thinking the person's actions are strange in the least - e.g., the wife's behavior.the acting is about the finest i'e ever seen - from robert young, robert ryan, gloria grahame (who earned an oscar nomination), paul kelly and other actors i'd never heard of.i'd never heard of this movie - and it's a complete delight that i've discovered one that i shall want to see again and again and again. it's really strange but impossible to look away from because you've no idea what these creatures will do next.

"crossfire" is remembered not so much for the fact that its three stars all had the first name "robert" but as being one of the first hollywood films to deal with anti-semitism.the story opens with the murder in silhouette of a man whom we later learn is a jewish man named joseph samuels (sam levene). pipe smoking police captain finlay (robert young) is assigned to the case. an ex-soldier, montgomery (robert ryan) comes upon the murder scene and we learn through flashback that he had met samuels in a bar along with other soldiers who were in the process of being mustered out of the service following wwii.according to montgomery, he and pal floyd bowers (steve brodie) had followed samuels and cpl. arthur mitchell (george cooper) to samuels' apartment for drinks. montgomery tells finlay that mitchell left the apartment first and that he and floyd followed soon after with samuels still alive and well.unable to locate mitchell, finlay suspects him of the murder. he enlists sgt. peter keeley (robert mitchum) to help him locate mitchell. mitchell meanwhile has been wondering the streets in a dazed state. he meets prostitute ginny (gloria grahame) in a bar and strikes up a friendship. she gives him a key to her apartment and he goes there to rest. unexpectedly a man (paul kelly) turns up looking for ginny. mitchell, still in a daze, leaves and goes back to meet keeley and his pals. keeley manages to keep him from the police and hides him in an all night movie house.from mitchell's perspective we learn that montgomery hates jews and is probably the killer. finlay begins to focus his investigation on montgomery trying to prove his guilt. he arrangers to have one of the soldiers, a kid named leroy (william phipps) set a trap for mongomery."crossfire" is considered to be one of the best of the "film noire" genre. in fact it garnered several academy award nominations including ryan and grahame for best supporting actors. it was made on a modest budget in about three weeks.it has all of the elements of classic "film noire", the shadows, low key lighting and the story playing out mostly at night. the requisite "femme fatale" of the piece is grahame's ginny who plays a minor role but is nonetheless your classic "femme fatale". the unnamed character played by paul kelly (in an excellent bit) has been chewed up and spit out by ginny and was she about to do the same to mitchell?robert ryan steals the picture as the brutal montgomery although it would type cast him in similar roles for years to come. robert young makes a good low key detective but robert mitchum has little to do other than befriend the mitchell character. others in the cast are jacqueline white as mitchell's wife, lex barker (who would go on the following year to play "tarzan") as one of mitchum's soldier pals and richard powers (who was previously known as tom keene) as finlay's assistant.director edward dmytryk would shortly run afoul of the house un-american committee as having communist affiliations and spend a couple of years in jail.

crossfire (1947)great message, great symbolism, very good movieit's hard to go totally wrong with robert mitchum, robert young, and robert ryan all together as the three male leads, and with director edward dmytryk pulling together a complicated murder and detective yarn. that's reason enough to watch it once and even twice.you might need a second look to fully catch the plot as it is explained (too much) or shown in flashback (also too much) because it's a little complicated without good reason. but it makes sense overall, and we see early on (too early probably) who the culprit is, and even why.besides the drama, well done in typical noir lighting and filled with those short quips that make post-war films dramatic, there is the social message, the anti-anti-semitic point of it all. it only borders on preachy once or twice, and it's such an obviously good point to make we watch it being made approvingly and wait for the plot and the dramatic acting to take front row. which they do, especially young, who is a brilliantly laconic and patient detective, and ryan, who is mean in a believably crude and angry way (ryan is good at that, his typecasting reasonable). mitchum mostly plays a watered down version of what he is famous for, and the fourth known acting force, gloria grahame, is a great, brief, presence even if slightly dispensable.though the movie is dominated by the sequence of events and by the message, both of which grow in force as we go, it is really easy to watch just for the lighting, camera-work, and acting, including the classic fight scene that opens the first few seconds of the film, all done with shadows. the archetypes of soldiers presented is very deliberate, and this might be something people at the time were very familiar with and could relate to as much as the anti-semitism thread. the shell-shocked soldier rendered helpless (but still intrinsically capable), the modest youngster without confidence (but capable, too), and the weary but outwardly able veteran are all there. and of course, the angry, violent soldier who is a product of the war, too. this last is also a responsibility of society--even the army goes all out to make good on the injustices here, not just because they are criminal, but because they stem from the wear and tear of a long awful war.the audience then, more than now, could really get, but it's there to appreciate still.

i haven't read the source, richard brooks' novel "the brick foxhole," which i hope is not as infelicitous as its title, but i understand the original villain was a homophobe not an anti semite. (and to be honest, sam levene is written as a gay guy who picks up a drunken soldier.) but, okay, you have to go with the flow. consider 1947. not even anti-semitism has been treated on screen yet. many of the people responsible for contemporary movies were themselves jews but anti-semitism had been verboten for years because it was considered unpleasant. so we can hardly blame the makers of this film for not leaving the victim a homosexual. now that's really unpleasant -- and besides there might have been many among the audience rooting for robert ryan to get away with it. we are by no means free of prejudice but we've still come a long way since 1947.watching this again for the first time in years i was impressed with the rather slow pace of the first half of the movie, the many shots of two people talking, the shadows, the time that passes between the question and the answer, the uninspired editing. but i could live with that because of the film's subject matter and because of a few other things.one of the things that keep me glued to events as they unfold so deliberately is robert ryan's performance. the guy does a splendid job. at times he can seem thoughtful, cheerfully subordinate and helpful to the police -- "any way i can help, yes sir." then, alone or with another soldier, the simmering hatred rises to the top, not so much through what he says but the way he looks. that scowl, that penetrating stare, those dark eyes glittering. wow.the film has taken a lot of heat because of robert young's preachy speech about his grandfather's murder. that doesn't bother me at all, although i guess dmytryk didn't have to have young shove his face into the camera while talking about "micks and papists". still, taking the context into account, it's one of the more shocking moments of the film. part of its impact is due to young's almost casual delivery of the message, and part of it is due to the message's not having been heard on screen before.another feature of the film that transforms it almost into the surreal is the paul kelly character and his relationship to the whore gloria grahame. holy guacamole, what elliptical conversation kelly is given to. "you know what i told you? all those things i just told you? they're all lies." his character neatly crosses pathos with creepiness. it's impossible to know what to make of him. he adds virtually nothing to the plot but the movie would be a lot less without his presence.it's a moody, murky film. its people live in the dark. and there is murder afoot. practically no one screams or shouts. the horror that these men have experienced and that some of them still carry with them like malaria seems just beneath the surface.see it if you have a chance.

a bigoted soldier kills a man for being jewish and tries to pin it on a fellow soldier. not as good as the novel it was based on ("the brick foxhole") in which it was a gay man who was killed...but hollywood wouldn't touch that in 1947. that said, it's still a very good film. the anti-semitism is handled very well, but it's hammered into the audience that bigotry is bad...well duh! but this was 1947. the picture is well-acted by the entire cast (especially robert young and robert ryan) and the tone is very dark...as it should be. very atmospheric too. a deserved big hit in its day...well worth seeing.

definitely a "must see" for all fans of film noir.thanks to a fine script and crisp, razor sharp direction a top cast comes together and works like a well oiled clock to produce a crackerjack psychological thriller.wonderful characterizations articulate the movie's powerful message of racial and religious tolerance. it's difficult and almost unjust to single out any one particular performance because there isn't a weak link in the entire company but robert ryan as the hateful and violent white supremacist is truly spine chilling.making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage. now,all these years later, at a time when contemporary movies are dominated by a ridiculous over abundance of foul language, bare breasts, crummy acting and deafening soundtracks it's refreshing to get back to the basics of quality film making with a viewing treat like "crossfire".another low budget gem from the hollywood archives .

as a rule, there are few things more dispiriting than hollywood's attempts to be courageous. mixing caution with heavy-handedness, "message movies" pat themselves loudly on the back for daring to tackle major problems. crossfire is not entirely free from this taint; it includes a sermon on the nature of senseless hatred that is embarrassingly obvious, assuming a level of naivity in its audience that's depressing to contemplate. as late as 1947, it was a big deal for a movie to announce that anti-semitism existed, and that it was bad. (it was unthinkable, of course, for hollywood to address the real subject of the book on which the movie was based¬óits victim was a homosexual.) nevertheless, thanks to good writing and excellent acting, crossfire remains a persuasive examination of what we would now call a hate crime.postwar malaise was one of the major components of film noir, and crossfire addresses it directly. the film is set in washington, d.c. among soldiers still in uniform but idle, spending their days playing poker and bar-crawling. joseph samuels (sam levene), an intelligent and kindly jew, explains that the end of the war has created a void: all the energy that went into hating and fighting the enemy is now unfocused and bottled up. samuels meets three soldiers in a bar: the sensitive mitchell, who is close to a nervous breakdown, the weak-willed floyd bowers, and montgomery, a tall, overbearing bully who nastily belittles a young soldier from tennessee as a stupid hillbilly. the three soldiers wind up at samuels' apartment, where the drunken monty becomes increasingly abusive, calling his host "jew-boy." samuels is beaten to death, and mitchell disappears, making himself the prime suspect for the killing.unraveling the crime are detective finlay (robert young), dry and by-the-book, and sergeant keeley (robert mitchum), a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows mitchell is incapable of murder. among the pieces of the puzzle are ginny (gloria grahame), a nightclub hostess who met mitchell and gave him her apartment key, and floyd (steve brodie), who as a witness to the crime holes up terrified in a seedy rooming house. while there is no real "whodunit" suspense, the story remains gripping, and the trap laid for the killer is extremely clever.the strong noir atmosphere saves the movie from feeling didactic or sanctimonious. the cinematography is a striking shadow-play, with inky darks and harsh lights, rooms often lit by a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke. world-weariness is as pervasive as noir lighting. "nothing interests me," finlay says quietly; "to nothing," is ginny's toast in the nightclub. gloria grahame, the paragon of noir femininity, nearly steals the movie with her two scenes. platinum-blonde, jaded and caustic, she's the quintessential b-girl, poisoned by the "stinking gin mill" where she works ("for laughs," she says bitterly), her sweet face curdling when mitchell tells her that she reminds him of his wife. now and then a wistful kindness peeks through her defensive shell, as when she dances with mitchell in a deserted courtyard, then offers to cook him spaghetti at her apartment. when he goes there, he meets a weasely, crumple-faced man (paul kelly) who seems to sponge off ginny, and whose conversation is a dense layering of lies and false confessions. gloria blows mitchell's good-girl wife off the screen in a scene where she's asked to give mitchell an alibi. slim and frail in her bathrobe, with her girlish lisp, she lets us see just how often ginny has been insulted and dismissed as a tramp.robert young is a nondescript actor, and he stands no chance against mitchum's charisma, but he does a good job of keeping his pipe-smoking character, saddled with delivering the movie's earnest message, this side of pompousness. mitchum, meanwhile, gets some cool dialogue, but not nearly enough to do; still, even when he's doing nothing but lounging in a corner you can't take your eyes off him. the third robert, ryan, creates a fully shaded and frighteningly convincing portrait of an ignorant, unstable bigot; we see his phony geniality, his bullying, his resentment of anyone with advantages, his "am i right or am i right?" smugness; how easily he slaps labels on people and what satisfaction he gets from despising them.crossfire's message seems cautious and dated now, though not nearly so much as the same year's a gentleman's agreement. finlay's speech about bigotry cops out by reaching back a hundred years for an instance of white victimhood, reminding us that irish catholics were once persecuted; next it could be people from tennessee, he says, or men who wear striped neckties. or maybe blacks, or japanese, or homosexuals, or communists? the script seems afraid to mention any real contemporary problems. it sweetens its message by making the jewish victim saintly, as though his innocence were not sufficient; and it takes care to exonerate the military, having a superior officer declare that the army is ashamed of men like montgomery, and stressing that samuels served honorably in the war. still, it did take some guts to depict, immediately after world war ii, an american who might have been happier in the nazi army, and the movie's basic premise is still valid. if monty were alive today, he would have gone out on september 12, 2001, and beat up a sikh.

edward dmytryk directed this shadowy movie about a murder investigation involving demobilized military personnel. robert young gets to lecture us about hatred, robert mitchum walks through most of this picture, and gloria grahame revisits the feistiness she exhibited in "it's a wonderful life." it's robert ryan who gets at the heart of the matter: anti-semiticism. he goes so deep into his role as monty montgomery (imagine parents named lawrence calling their son larry!), that the drama sits squarely on his shoulders, and he is more than up to the challenge. without him, the movie would be commonplace. ryan has played a number of memorable villains in his day ("bad day at black rock;" "billy budd"), but this performance put him on the map. with sam levene as the murder victim.

taut and organically gripping, edward dmytryk's crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely "message" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle.bivouacked in washington, dc, a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where robert ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host (sam levene) to death because he happens to be jewish. police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum, who's assigned to ryan's outfit. suspicion falls on the second of the three (george cooper), who has vanished. ryan slays the third buddy (steve brodie) to insure his silence before young closes in.abetted by a superior script by john paxton, dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs. ryan, naturally, does his prototypical angry white male (and to the hilt), while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role, however, is not central); young may never have been better. gloria grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who's leeched into her life, paul kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable.the politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it's pretty much confined to young's reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit). at least there's no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why ryan hates jews (and hillbillies and...).curiously, crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it's based on (richard brooks' the brick foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale. news of the holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of europe, so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer).but while the change from homophobia to anti-semitism works in general, the specifics don't fit so smoothly. the victim's chatting up a lonesome, drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd, even though (or especially since) there's a girlfriend in tow. it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating ryan's murderous rage.

never has the words "hidden gem" been so accurate. bad movie lovers might search all over for the next hidden obscurity, sometimes coming up short with stuff like weasels rip my flesh, but other times, luck will prevail and you might end up with something like death bed, then hopefully realizing it's not a bad movie at all, it just has a bad title, and not even a bad title, but a humorous one that might throw you off, but somehow death bed still fits into the "bad" category. with a vibe that's somber and empty, death bed is a true masterpiece of low-budget horror, reserved only for those fortunate enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of a vision.death bed involves an incoherent, yet intriguing relationship between a demon in the bed and the sympathetic ghost trapped in the portrait, who only wishes he could spare someone from the awful fate of being devoured by the yellow suds. although not all that scary, considering it's about a killer bed, death bed possesses the qualities that make for successful horror. a dark, desolate vibe, confusion, an eerie, subtle score and that dream quality that this masterpiece almost flaunts. such a quality, or vibe usually seems unintentional. not only is it intentional, but from what i've read, death bed is based on an actual dream, george barry, the director, successfully transferred dream to film, only a genius could accomplish such a task.old mansions make for good quality horror, as do portraits, not sure what to make of the killer bed with its killer yellow liquid, quite a bizarre dream, indeed. also, this isn't quite the brand of b-horror i was expecting, considering the title and all. before viewing this gothic gem i expected something more like class reunion massacre, now thats a bad movie, if you've seen it, you know what i'm saying. after considering all of the above, i feel like death bed deserves only eight stars, but since it stayed so obscure for so long we'll say the bed that eats deserves nine.

george barry's "death bed: the bed that eats" is, at root, a dark fairy tale told via a horror-movie framework. it is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 1970s, and it's downright criminal that the picture was basically stolen and distributed without barry's knowledge (those responsible for this theft should be fed to the bed, asap). if you're looking for overt gore or rabid action, "death bed: the bed that eats" isn't the flick for you. "death bed" is a gentler, weirder drive-in picture; it plays like an utterly strange dream, half-remembered. i'd recommend reading stephen thrower's summation of "death bed" in thrower's fab press book, "nightmare usa" (he describes the movie's vibe perfectly). whether intentional or not, i've noticed shades of "death bed" in everything from the "phantasm" films to michele soavi's "cemetery man" to the magic-realism/slipstream fiction of authors such as kelly link. barry is an original and in a fair world i'm sure he would've followed "death bed" with a number of fantastically bizarre films.

watching "death bed: the bed that eats" is like waking up in the hospital, two days into a suicidewatch, disorienting but oddly stimulating. there are few cinematic equivalents to this disturbing yet often humorous lesson in mythology, morality and surrealist ideology.cocteau's "blood of a poet" and maya deren'sexperimental works evoke a taste of the strange atmosphere found in death bed. a close comparison are the dark adult fairy-tales by literary genius- author angela carter, the short disturbing stories of unicazurn or e.t.a. hoffman. death bed has many recognizable elements of thepast, but displays a wholly unique and original storyline.as a story, death bed is an amazingly simple yet originalvision, something which only one-in-a-thousand independent releases will manage to accomplish. this unassuming film has its technical flaws but overcomes them all with a cast of beautiful non-actorsand lost creepy locations- a true 1970s independent classic. death bed also displays a unique, subversive, 3-dimensional personality-- a deep and continuous layering of dream images and ideas that lend it a "fun-house" type of construct. the passage of time told in flashbacks and historic time travelogues, the bed with its sinister black humor, the rich yet understated symbolism used within its imagery. most pleasing is the image of aubrey beardsly, the suffering artist, forever trapped inside the frame of his own painting as he comments on and fondles with the murdered victim "offerings" gifted to him as love offerings by the demented bed's spirit. -- a sick refrain and wonderful element /metaphor for the "trapped artist" -- nothing but the weirdest in poe or mallarme can equal that. anyone who values the spirit of independent cinema and craves the multi-layered symbolist experience, or craves the surrealist concept of "convulsivebeauty" and the gothic-horror leanings of low budget exploitation film-making will dig this totally unique vision. a simple and fun film with deliciously deep psychic undercurrents. highly recommended. *****

i can honestly say that "death bed: the bed that eats" was a much better movie than i expected. allow me to clarify the plot in case the title of the film is a little too vague - there is a bed that eats. an evil bed. it eats people. several unsuspecting women on an "outing" of some kind, stumble across the sinister "sack" and ultimately fall prey to it's hunger. the bed's devouring process consists of a yellow foam soaking people into it's inner... stomach acid; all complete with chewing sounds. this is a very strange cult flick and the only film from george barry who had forgotten he made it until word-of-mouth of it's newfound cult status got back to him and he decided to release it on dvd. not a bad movie at all, if you can look past the lousy acting and enjoy the hokey effects - the most laughable being the guy whose hands are eaten off and he is left with only plastic looking skeletal fingers... pretty dreamlike tone to it, too, coming across as very surreal and aberrant - mainly the whole thing involving the artist behind the painting and the demonic back story of the bed. if you like bizarre no-budget, oddball flicks than definitely seek out "death bed".

a large bed possessed by a demon eats people, among other things. i'm not making this up.completed in 1977 and not officially released until it came to dvd in 2003, "death bed: the bed that eats" is a movie whose plot is impossible to describe. you most likely know of it thanks to patton oswalt's excellent bit about it, as well as stephen throwers essential book "nightmare usa." while watching it, you wonder the following-who is george berry, and what drugs did he smoke/inject/snort before writing and directing this movie?-is this a horror comedy? a combination of a horror flick and an art movie? a weird prank being pulled on the audience?-what the hell am i watching?"death bed" really defies any explanation. i know, that term is overused, but it couldn't be truer than it is here. this truly beggars description. it is a horror comedy, as well as art film/horror hybrid. but the whole thing is so surreal, it must be seen. the score sounds like the electronic bits from an old candlemass album, the acting is terrible and disconnected from everything, the direction is surprisingly competent, and the movie at times feels like a jesus franco movie-that is, if his movies were intentionally funny.in the end, there really is no proper way to describe this movie. lord knows i've tried, but really, few movies are as odd, unique, or mind boggling as this is. see it...but you've been warned. this is also the only movie george berry has ever done. he definitely left his mark on the exploitation genre with this, i'll tell you that much.

this is seriously one of the best low budget, b movies that i have ever seen. i am not one to stand up and cheer during a movie, but this one was definitely worth it. obviously the premise is that there is a bed that eats people, well...eats is a subjective term i guess, it really secretes acid bubbles to suck the victims into itself and dissolves them in it's acidy goodness. the best part of this movie is that william russ is one of the main characters. the typical family man actually started his career with this movie...and an afro. there is plenty of nudity in this flick, so obviously not for the children, but that should not deter anyone from seeing this movie. it is my belief that everyone needs a little death bed in their lives at some point or other, it's best to get it sooner than later.

as roger corman has said in an interview, low-budget film-making enables film-makers to take chances on offbeat ideas. well, you'd be hard pressed to find a film that thrives on the offbeat as mightily as george barry's "death bed: the bed that eats".the film does have a back story to it, and it's an interesting one at that. i'll forgo relaying any sort of details so you can hear them for yourself if you take a chance on watching it. suffice it to say, the title item of furniture has an insatiable hunger, consuming the unwary with a bubbling yellow foam that dissolves its victims like acid."death bed" is an eerie, haunting little flick that plays out its absurd premise in such a way that it transcends the usual assortment of schlock fare. it occupies its particular dream world in such a way that it was possible for me to take it seriously. it's a truly strange and unconventional horror flick. it dabbles in exploitative ingredients - there's some tasty dollops of female nudity - and yet is also art, albeit art with a completely skewed sensibility.the special effects are not too bad for a film with a microscopic budget, and barry gives the film a good and atmospheric "midnight movie" quality. the acting from the cast is as uninspired as one could imagine, although patrick spence-thomas lends a reasonable amount of gravitas as the artist / narrator, and one definite point of interest is seeing one familiar face on hand: future 'boy meets world' father william russ!this film might not have even found the small cult following that it does have were it not for pirated copies making the rounds; this certainly has to rank as one of the instances where such a practice ultimately ended up helping the film - even if the exposure took years to take hold.if you have a taste for truly bizarre obscure items, "death bed" may be just what you've got in mind.7/10

death bed: the bed that eats.judging from the title, you can guess what this movie is about. and yet there is a lot more (background) story to this film then one might suspect.okay, so the main plot is about a bed eating people and food, but there are also a few subplots. i won't spoil them for you, but they're a nice touch.sadly, the acting in this movie is very mediocre. the fact that most dialog is not even spoken by the actors doesn't really help to improve the quality of the movie as a whole.because there is a lot of voice-over work. the thoughts of characters are also revealed to the watchers. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.the effects are fine. sure, it could be a lot better if you compare it with today's movies. but you really shouldn't; just judge the movie as it is and don't take it too seriously. you have to admit that a killer bed is quite creative. if you are easily spooked, don't watch this movie. you might never want to sleep again...death bed: the bed that eats is a strange horror gem with a low budget, but i'd still recommend it to fans of horror movies.in conclusion, i give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars for it's creative story and unexpected twists here and there.

i watch a lot of movies. a lot of movies. getting a graduate degree in film forces one to watch 2-3 flicks a day for years. it all gets very exhausting. mostly because i feel i have seen it all. so rare is it when i get surprised by something, mostly i hope to see something as good as i expect it to be.death bed is so unlike anything i have ever experienced i actually had to stop the dvd in order to rant about its genius.the rhythm of the piece is psychotic. it's structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay outside of the frame. it's not like something like halloween with all its snappy editing and pov shots; death bed actually comes across as kind of dreamy. the most pretentious way i can phrase it is: this is samuel beckett making a haunted house movie. i mean it's a manic depressive bed that eats people! and fried chicken! out in the middle of nowhere! and there's bone hands! i can barely articulate my feelings about this film. and yeah, copping to liking this will open you up to ridicule. but things get real same-y after awhile. its hard to be a cinephile and consistently stay engaged. i can honestly say this is a fully unique film up and down. from what it is to how its put together. we need films like that, movies that shake us out of our complacency. consider it like existential camp. it's fun and it's stupid, but also brilliant in its weird little way. the worst horror villain of all time? maybe, but at least it isn't a guy in a mask.

i do love b- horror films. i however, am generally not a huge fan of "so stupid it's funny" films. i had to rate this so highly simply because death bed: the bed that eats, is so one of a kind, and so original. there are plenty of question marks, plenty of plot holes, and the wtf factor is cranked up to 11, but i was really not bored for a second. i really couldn't call it creepy at any point, every minute i was saying to myself "what the hell is this bed/film going to do next!" i watched this with a friend that is in no way a fan of horror or b- movies, and even she was pretty into it. the effects were actually very inventive and the colors, and atmosphere were quite good. it keeps a very consistent and even tone throughout most of the film, (albeit an incredibly ludicrous consistency) and the acting wasn't terrible. i can see from the point that there are certain inconsistencies in the actions of the bed that make the suspension of belief damn near impossible, but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept, that that fact didn't really bother me. seriously, for me, this film hit that realm of one i will not only never forget, but i guarantee i will find myself thinking back on certain scenes in the future. does anyone else know of any other films in the inanimate objects that eat people genre? totally fantastic.

this film plunges headlong into the realm of the surreal √† la lynch and jodorowsky--with an atmosphere that is strangely compelling, lulling the viewer with the dream-like intensity of its images.the narration is to be savoured--the narrator being trapped behind a painting (adjacent to the bed), who often speaks for it, vocalizing its desires and reasoning. yes, beardsley would sound like that.there are some flaws, but its strengths overwhelm its weaknesses. the sequence with the woman wrenching herself out of the bed and crawling across the floor, trying to escape, will leave you breathless. the film possesses a fin-de-siecle air about it; and should be read as a disarming cry from the bowels of the 20th century.find this film and bathe in it.

"death bed:the bed that eats" is a supremely bizarre horror film that truly has to be seen to be believed.there is an ancient four-poster bed that just loves to eat humans and it does so anytime it can lure anyone to lie upon it.there is also a long-dead artist,imprisoned behind one of his paintings,who provides a voice-over narration.george barry's the first and only one film offers some truly surreal moments such as the bed absorbing its victims in a mysterious sea of yellow foam and liquid.the atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a little bit of gore,unfortunately the premise is rather silly and the acting is amateurish.still as fan of unusual cinema i enjoyed this low-budget oddity.give it a chance.8 out of 10.

george barry is a genius. "death bed: the bed that eats" is a prototype for much of the 'slipstream' fiction and camp surrealism that is so chic now. truly innovative, maverick, and just effing brilliant. hyper-strange acting, subtly nightmarish atmosphere. i recommend reading stephen thrower's book "nightmare usa" (there is a chapter devoted to barry and "death bed: the bed that eats"). available from fab press. on a related note, "death bed: the bed that eats" and "beyond dream's door" make a perfect double-bill. furthermore, it's trite and tired - and ultimately stupidly ironic - to criticize a low-budget cult film for being 'poorly made' or 'technically inept.' the b-movie aesthetic is part of these films' charm. no amount of cgi could duplicate the cumulative effect "death bed: the bed that eats" has on the viewer with an advanced palate.

a demon, from a tree, removes itself in the form of a human man to make love to a young fair maiden only for her to die. the demon's eyes freeze, two drops of blood fall onto a bed he had specially created for his object of desire. the bed consumes the blood and it's hunger remains..anything that comes in contact with the bed is consumed! this is explained to us by one of the bed's victims, a painter whose soul is trapped "inside" one of his last works, the artistic rendering of the his final resting place(..he was dying of consumption, coughing up blood, deciding to die on the death bed). you see the painter, who we are able to see as if he were trapped in a small room looking through his painting, unfortunately a spectator to the bed's meals. the bed has a dark sense of humor, and we see this through it's allowing the painter to live, even giving him jewelry and other possessions once owned by eaten victims. one victim's skull grows bright red flowers not far from the basement housing the bed. the film features three young women who come across the mansion which holds the basement containing the death bed. the painter(dave marsh)might just have a method to destroying the death bed but it will include a human sacrifice in order to resurrect the body of the one whose death caused it's hunger in the first place. patrick spence-thomas provides the soft, depressing voice of the trapped painter, narrating the film, lamenting about his current situation, telling us about past victims, and often scolding the bed of it's predatory nature.a definitive, genuine cult film..i expect it's status to soar now that death bed:the bed that eats has found it's way to an audience(..such as myself)who appreciates the bizarre and grotesque. the bed itself contains a liquid type of acid with an apple-cider hue where we see the objects and humans(..struggling for naught) consumed. many might recognize a young william russ(boy meets world, the unholy)in curls, seeking after his runaway sister, finding her in the basement, zombie-like and traumatized(..of course, julie ritter pretty much was this way the whole film, in a trance, barely uttering a word)with them both trapped. in one of the film's most demented scenes, russ attempts to stab the bed only for his hands to get caught in it's grip, the flesh acidified with only skeletal bones remaining, the cartilage deteriorating. there's one lengthly attempted escape by a victim whose legs were caught in the bed, almost out of the basement when it's sheets snatched her back into it's belly where she belonged. the film feels almost completely surreal as if we were watching a macabre nightmare unfold. director george barry often features gags regarding the victims who find themselves in the most unfortunate position choosing the death bed as their place of refuge..the painter gives us a recollection of all the various people who were eaten. there's really nothing like this movie anywhere, it's definitely one of a kind.

hmmmm. i'm kinda at a loss here. i mean, i know i liked death bed, i know i'll be spreading the gospel of death bed to all my friends and acquaintances, and if you're reading this, i urge you to see death bed, but i can't really say why. perhaps that's the secret of its charm.plot? well, sort of. there's this bed that eats people (and fried chicken, apples, flowers, suitcases, and any other darn thing that gets near it) by sucking them inside its digestive-fluid filled mattress. amongst its near-limitless powers, bed has the ability to keep the spirit of aubrey beardsley trapped behind a picture to observe and narrate the events of the film. various people then wind up at bed's abandoned mansion (bed's habit of eating anything that moves gave the place an unsavory reputation), and lay down to have sex, or take a nap, or because they don't feel well, and get eaten, sometimes having trippy dreams first. and in the end we have the explosive final confrontation between beardsley, bed's mom (you had to be there), and bed.seems rather straightforward, when i put it like that, doesn't it - well, except for the aubrey beardsley part. but something feels constantly off-kilter, and the story seems to glide sleepily from one scene to the next, even when indulging in cheap laughs or strange gore effects. imagine bunel crossed with bergman, then left to soak in a big vat of herschell gordon lewis. the tone of the story shifts from horror, to fairy tale, to comedy, to existential meditation, without breaking stride - an incredible achievement for a no-budget student film shot in the detroit area.all in all, an astounding little film that, quite probably, no review can ever completely do justice. see it for yourself.

ok, it's easy not to confuse this with the lame stuart gordon movie called "death bed" that came out a few years back, because this one is "the bed that eats". and how do i even begin to describe this? well, for starters, obviously there is a bed that eats. this is as a result of demon teardrops, which of course affect most things, i guess, in a negative way. the bed is in some old servant's quarters or something, and has been responsible for the disappearances of quite a few people in its time. we have a narrator, who is a ghost that sits in the wall behind a painting, and collects all the non-edible goodies (jewelry, etc) that the bed passes on. he died of consumption, one of the few people to lay in the bed that didn't get eaten, probably because he was sick, he theorizes, as we see him hacking blood into hankies.....bleah. the thing about this movie is that is has a very odd sense of humor to it but it's all played pretty deadpan. the movie is divided into several "acts", i guess, "breakfast, lunch, dinner, & just desserts". for fans of the unfathomably weird and bizarre, well, this may just be right up your alley. all i can say is you have to see this one to believe it, it pretty well defies description. 8 out of 10 stars.

i'm not sure what i can add that hasn't already been said in some of these other fine, and quite hilarious, comments, but ill try.so you know the plot: there is a bed possessed by a demon that "absorbs" and selectively disintegrates the bodies of whoever (or whatever) lays on it with its orange soda-filled body. we have the man, in some scenes looking uncannily like robert smith of the cure, hanging out inside the wall commenting on the goings-on, and we have our various victims that just cant resist the comfort of this mystical bed.this is no ordinary bed. no sirree bob! not only does it eat people, but it cleans up after itself, draws the covers back, and it even makes itself. who wouldn't want a bed like that? it can even use its sheets as a rudimentary "lasso" to wrangle escaped victims back in (especially if they're taking up half the length of the film to try and escape).our "main" story (if you can call it that), is about these three girls who go out to this remote area to house-sit(??). i don't recall exactly, but it doesn't really matter though as there are plenty of things that defy convention that you just have to give in and accept. the dialogue in the film is like no other; the characters talk to each other seemingly by telepathy as their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo. one of our girls believes she isn't liked by the rest of "the gang" and makes sure to tell us all her feelings on this matter through an echoey voice-over, but we don't care; character development was thrown out the window a long time before in this film so why start now? there are scenes when the bed laughs, snores, crunches, and makes various other noises that we assume judging by our cast's non-reaction to said noises, cant be heard. this and the telepathy makes the issue of diegesis very difficult to ascertain...but thats ok....this is death bed: the bed that eats and it defies all logic so its ok. it makes for a lush dreamy quality to this most bizarre film if you buy (hehe buy...did i say "buy"?) this dvd, make sure to check out the introduction by the director. he explains that the filming of this "flick" started in 1972, didn't wrap up until 1977, he shopped it for a few years with no luck, and then fast forward 26 years to 2003 it gets released on dvd. supposedly someone somewhere had a print of this in some other country and made bootleg after bootleg of it and it was quite by chance, on a message board no less, that our director found evidence that people knew, and gasp! cared, about his little-known film. its from there that he decided to give it a shot and release it. i'm glad he did. once you've even so much as heard the title to this film, you must see it. i for one am going to buy this and i'm going to preach its gospel around the world...starting with this comment

it's really rather simple. the name of the movie is death bed, the bed that eats. if you are anything like me, you already know if you are going to like this movie. i stumbled across this gem at best buy the other day and picked it up for ten bucks. i got ten bucks worth of enjoyment out of the title, and the box alone.i'm a huge fan of b movies. this is in my opinion one of the greatest b movies i've ever seen. now, it's not for every one.granted, it's not even for most people. as a matter of fact, i suspect their are only going to be a handful of us who truly enjoy this movie.for those of you who like b movies though, this film is a diamond in the rough. it has a great premise, a bed... that eat's people. it doesn't walk, it doesn't move, it doesn't have a siren call to attract people. it pretty much relies on people wandering by and sitting on it.i loved every inch of this movie and have already seen it three times in the scant weeks i've owned it.like i said, after reading the title of the film, you already know if you'll like it. if you laughed or smiled, then give it a go. it's worth it.

sherlock holmes (basil rathbone) and professor moriarty (lionel atwill) engage in a battle of wits for control of a switz inventor's newest bomb-sight creation. holmes wants to safeguard it for the british while moriarty isn't above selling out to the nazis. while no doubt many fans will be disappointed to see holmes updated to the 1940s war-time setting, this particular film proves light-hearted fun which doesn't wallow in wartime propaganda as it might well have done. dennis hoey's inspector lestrade and nigel bruce's dr. watson do tend to steal the show as their characters bumbling methods consistently provide delightful comic relief. the sparring between holmes and moriraty is colorful and well thought out to boot. atwill does well enough as moriarty even if he's not as memorable as some others who played the role. while this provides nothing especially new or thrilling for fans of the series, it is a wonderful escape from reality, somewhat appropriate for 1942 in my opinion, that mirrors many movie serial adventures of the 1930s and 1940s but boasts a more compact, less repetitive plot. and all this is done while still remaining true to the basic spirit of sherlock holmes.

for the sake of propaganda during world war ii, sherlock holmes was moved into the then-present. one of the results is "sherlock holmes and the secret weapon," starring a top holmes, basil rathbone, along with nigel bruce, lionel atwill, dennis hoey and kaaren verne. it is holmes' assignment to deliver a scientist, dr. franz tobel (william post jr.) and his weapon design to the british government before the germans can get him. once the man reaches england, however, his troubles are just beginning. can holmes decode the message dr. tobel left before falling into the hands of the vicious moriarity, save the weapon and possibly the scientist too? this is an effective holmes story, set in the atmosphere of switzerland and blackout england. the series worked just fine in the present day. it was not without its problems, but those problems had nothing to do with the time period. whose idea was it to make watson an idiot? nigel bruce's characterization - aided and abetted by the scripts - has always been the false note. i much prefer the characterization of edward hardwicke in the jeremy brett sherlock holmes series - there, he's attractive, intelligent and a believable companion for holmes. in the rathbone series, holmes is often condescending and treats watson like the bumbling fool that he is. however, in this particular film, watson has a chance to be quite helpful in several parts.i admit to being a complete sap for rathbone's recitation from richard ii - "...this blessed plot, this earth, this england" - i can't imagine how much it meant to the brits watching the film in 1942. sherlock holmes really served his purpose.

in the universal series of modern sherlock holmes stories with basil rathbone and nigel bruce, sherlock holmes and the secret weopon is not one of the top films - although it is entertaining. i think the problem with it is that much of the film's "dueling" between holmes and his nemesis moriarty (here played by lionel atwill) seems to delay the actual point of the professor's work.moriarty appears in three of the holmes films with rathbone. in the adventures of sherlock holmes he was played by george zucco, who gave real relish to the love of villainy for its own sake to the role. for my money zucco's performance as the professor was the best of the three (there is even a brief moment of comedy in his performance, when he's disguised as the "sergeant of police" towards the end - like he's preparing to sing "a policeman's lot" from gilbert & sullivan). next comes mr. atwill's performance here - more of that later. finally there is henry daniell's intellectual moriarty in sherlock holmes and the lady in green. it's a typically cool, classy performance by mr. daniell, but his confrontations with holmes seem to be a tedious bore to him. they keep him from completing the main plan. in the stories that the professor pops up in, he really senses holmes is a nemesis who will remain a danger as long as he is alive. yet, because of the intellectual tennis match between him and rathbone, rathbone (in his autobiography) actually felt daniell was the best of the film moriartys.if zucco captured the love of evil in the professor, and daniell seemed to demonstrate the tired oxford don (in the stories the professor is a well regarded mathematician, whose volume on the binomial theorem had a "european vogue", and who wrote an intriguing book, the dynamics of the asteroid), atwill demonstrates the professor as pragmatic businessman. first of all, he's sold his services (apparently) to nazi germany. this is never gone into, but one presumes (as this is before the nazis began to really collapse) he figures they will win the war. secondly, he is not a fool. when dr. tobel (william post jr.) has shown he is a state of near physical collapse due to the torturing of moriarty's gang, the professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists who are assisting tobel, because he's as good a scientist as tobel and would be able to put together the bomb site. i somehow can't quite see zucco making such a sensible decision on the spot, and if daniell had to make it, he would seem annoyed that there is yet another delay to his plans.by the way, one trick used in all the holmes series regarding the professor is how to rid the film of him. if you read the holmes stories, moriarty appears as the villain three times: in the memoirs of sherlock holmes' last story ("the adventure of the final problem"), in the return of sherlock holmes' first story ("the adventure of the empty house") and the last of the four novels/novellas (the valley of fear). it's amazing how much mileage the professor got out of so few appearances (he is mentioned in two or three other stories as well - in passing). but because of his fate at the reichenbach falls in "the final problem" and "the empty house", we always see him fall to his death. zucco falls off the white tower on tower hill. daniell (with more imagination) tries to flee gregson and the police, but is shot as he jumps, and wounded fails to hold on to the wall of an adjacent building. atwill (here it is not seen, but heard) seems to fall down a trap door he's planted in an escape tunnel). it is really tedious after awhile to see the professor always fall in these films. one turns to the gene wilder comedy (admittedly a comedy) sherlock holmes' smarter brother, wherein leo mckern is a wonderfully wacky and villainous moriarty (complete, finally, with an irish accent), who is not killed at the end, but just left mulling - in a rowboat - over how his careful schemes did not work out. i rather liked that better.the use of the "dancing men" code here, like the use of the "devil's foot root" in dressed to kill, snags a part of a mystery from a short story. "the adventure of the dancing men" appeared in the return of sherlock holmes, and deals with a client of holmes whose wife has been getting weird, blood-curdling messages in this code. charles higham, in his biography the adventures of conan doyle suggests sir arthur may have picked up the code from a magazine game in the 1870s, but we really don't know. the code is basically one of letter substitutions for the figures of the dancing men. the story in the short story is dramatic, but deals with a triangle. the only innovation in the film is that tobel makes a slight change that confuses both holmes and moriarty. the film will entertain, but i still think the house of fear, the scarlet claw, and sherlock holmes faces death are better films.

dr. franz tobel, a swiss scientist, is smuggled out of his home country by sherlock holmes in order that the nazi agents spying him do not get his invention of a new bomb sight. arriving in london, he takes residence with holmes and watson, but goes out for a visit with his girlfriend, charlotte eberli, where he leaves a clue for holmes as to the locations of his bomb sight, which he has divided into four pieces, but holmes' eternal nemesis, professor moriarity, is also seeking the bomb sight to sell to the nazis, and abducts dr. tobel and the clue left at charlotte's, a code series of dancing men, which both holmes and moriarity are both unable to decipher completely. holmes eventually discovers the clue to the code and get the location of the fourth piece of the bomb sight, but moriarity has the other three and a showdown is inevitable. very good entry in the holmes series with plenty of mystery and guesswork to go about. atwill's portrayal of moriarity is more sadistic than the cunning sort described in the doyle stories (or george zucco's performance in the adventures of sherlock holmes), but atwill's skills as an actor makes his moriarity quite the benevolent fellow. the script and direction both make this entry more of a cat and mouse game between the two characters and that is one of the reasons this entry succeeds so well. great job on the cinematography as well. rating, 8.

not too bad entry in the series, heavily ladled with war propaganda, but rathbone & bruce's sincerity keep me happy.it's a rather fantastic story from start to finish, just how many mcguffin's are there? holmes (and moriarty independently) reeling out the dancing men code uncoded so fast was amazing watson - so why weren't you amazed! the post explaining the bomb-sight/enlarger tickled me, it was just the kind of cheap trick universal would play - once again reminding me that they didn't expect people to be critically watching this over 60 years later. this (and i think every other potboiler from universal at this period) were meant to be viewed the once or twice and forgotten. they perhaps should have realised that basically people don't change, that what was entertaining to ordinary people in 1942 would still entertain a select group now (2005) and tightened up on the script and sets!lionel atwill was going through his hollywood rape court case at about this time, i wonder if it was that or particularly effective make-up that made him look so haggard as moriarty?the important thing about sw though is that this was the first holmes film roy william neill directed, i think he directed all of the rest and produced all but one, thus establishing a marvellous ambient continuity.

this jingoist outing concerns the usual battle holmes vs. moriaty,but this time in an effort to save the british war against the nazis.sherlock holmes(rathbone) and watson(bruce),the detecting duo living in 223 baker street,again are up against their old enemy dr. moriarty(lionel atwill).the film starts in switzerland where holmes saves from the nazis to an inventor of a bomb-sight,named dr. tobel(post).back in london,tobel hand over four parts of the device to diverse scientist.but doctor tobel is kidnapped by moriarty.sherlock must to solve his disappearance and some vitally important.holmes only holds a clue left his girlfriend(kareen verne),the detective with an extraordinary mechanism get decode it.but dead body scientific are accumulating but have appeared murdered and moriarty knows the keys ,as well.holmes disguised as sailor goes out to investigate ,finding the moriarty's shelter .the picture is based on¬® the dancing men¬®by arthur conan doyle.this is a rathbone-bruce effort for the wwii along with ¬®the voice of terror¬® in which we are asked to believe the magnificent detective could have lived in this century. both stories are completely patriotic and flag-waging movies.in fact,on the end there's an advertising buying of war bonds with evident propaganda.the movie is an excellent holmes thriller with gripping wartime setting and unanswered mysteries and unstopped suspense.in the film appear the habituals from holmes series.his nemesis moriarty,,mistress hudson,inspector lestrade( a funny dennis hoey) and of course the bumbling dr. watson.basil rathbone performance is splendid ,he's the best cinema's holmes similar to television's peter cushing and jeremy brett.rathbone as whimsical sleuth is top notch,he's in cracking form,intelligent,broody and impetuous.he's finely matched in battle of wits with moriarty,his arch-enemy,a first range villain: lionel atwill.nigel bruce plays watson with humor,jinx,goofy and mirth.he's the perfect counterpoint of holmes.besides appear briefly distinguished secondaries as paul fix and whit bissell.this classic gets an atmospheric black and white cinematography but available colorized in a horrible version.adequate music score fitting to suspense by frank skinner.the motion picture is professionally r. william o'neal,the usual saga director and habitual in the monsters movies universal.

sir arthur conan doyle wrote a fair number of sherlock holmes accounts but the popularity of the famous detective insured that sequels in both print and on film would extend far beyond the author's works.in "sherlock holmes and the secret weapon," holmes, basil rathbone, patriotically serves british intelligence in order to secure a swiss scientist's desperately needed bombsight. the film is from 1942 and i wonder if the producers and writers realized how vital bombsight secrets were (the american norden bombsight was guarded almost as zealously as the new radar sets that would change the course of world war ii).holmes and his faithful but expectedly bumbling companion, dr. watson, nigel bruce, battle dr. moriarty, lionel atwill. as evil as moriarty has always been it's a bit of a shock to see he's signed up with hitler. has the man no vestige of decency? i guess not. but atwill is deliciously evil.the story is reasonably fast-paced as holmes and watson seek to recover stolen bombsight components before they can be delivered to a u-boat. rathbone is his usual suave self and several holmsian disguises are well carried out.this and other 1940s holmes stories are now available on dvd and oldies.com has put out a very nice four-disc set in a wooden box: this film is included along with a bonus cd of an interview with the aged doyle. the set retails for about $26 in major dvd and cd stores but i found this and other sets from oldies.com at a warehouse club for $14.98. the transfers are very good.very nice and relaxing late night viewing.7/10.

the evil professor moriarty plots to gain control of both sherlock holmes and the secret weapon which could win the war for the nazis.basil rathbone & nigel bruce return to the screen as sir arthur conan doyle's beloved detective and sidekick, sherlock holmes & dr. watson, in this entertaining little mystery. universal studios wasted no money on either fancy production values or a sensible script, knowing that its two stars would be all the attraction an audience would need. indeed rathbone, as the cerebral ego, and bruce, as the bumbling id, seem to actually become the characters they are creating, gleefully keeping their faces straight while engaged in the most utter nonsense.dennis hoey makes his first appearance as the dogged inspector lestrade of scotland yard; teamed with bruce, these two good-hearted but pedantic fellows actually get to save the intellectually superior holmes' life twice. lionel atwill, a master of the sinister who deserves more recognition for his talent, does a fine job as moriarty, making the wicked rascal a foe worthy of holmes' steel, relishing the scenes in which he gets to inflict torture & pain.william post jr. and kaaren verne play the swiss scientist and his girlfriend who are at the heart of the mystery, but they're not given much to do. sweet mary gordon makes a token appearance as holmes' landlady mrs. hudson.rathbone spices up his already classic interpretation of holmes by getting to appear in disguise three times during the story, thereby revealing to the viewer that the great sleuth was a bit of a ham actor at heart.this film--which is based very loosely on elements in sir arthur's short stories 'the dancing men' and 'the empty house'--followed sherlock holmes and the voice of terror (1942) and preceded sherlock holmes in washington (1943).

sherlock holmes (basil rathbone) and dr. watson (nigel bruce) have been hired by the british government to protect a swiss scientist dr. franz tobel (william post jr.). he has a bomb that the british want to win the war. unfortunately the evil dr. moriarty (lionel atwill) is working with the nazis and will stop at nothing to get the doctor--and his invention.moving sherlock holmes to the 1940s sounded like a stupid idea but it does work for one reason--basil rathbone. arguably he is the best sherlock holmes ever put on the screen. he plays the character so well (and accurately) that it doesn't matter what era he's solving crimes. as for nigel bruce as watson...everybody has problems with it. he plays watson as a bumbling old fool...that is not the watson of the books. you seriously wonder why holmes puts up with him. still, he does grow on you (in a way). then there's atwill having a whale of a time playing moriarty--the discussions and battle of wits between him and holmes are just great! i've never liked dennis hoey as inspector lestrade--he's such an idiot. makes watson look like a genius. and post jr. is pretty good as tobel (even though his accent amusingly keeps changing!).this movie is done elaborately and runs only a little over an hour. still, it does have it's slow spots and i never understood the secret code section.still, worth catching if just for rathbone and atwill.

sherlock holmes (basil rathbone) begins this story in disguise, helping to smuggle famous physicist "dr. franz tobel" (william post) out of switzeralnad and under the watchful eye of the nazis, who want his bomb sight plans. the allies obviously want it, too, and sherlock is there to help. dr. tobel has invented an instrument which greatly aids in the accuracy of aerial bombardment. holmes and dr. tobel arrive safely back at baker street but the scientist would rather be alone, for some mysterious reason, although he had promised the english to help them, not the germans. he stays true to that promise but there are some desperate moments for holmes and the english along the way.it's an entertaining film and one in which our famous detective uses not one but three different disguises. he needs all the help he can get when he goes up against his arch-rival, "professor moriarity." one complaint: if moriarity was that evil, he would have dispensed with holmes without batting an eyelash, instead of giving him openings to escape. it's pretty sad, too, when the usual dim-witted dr. watson (nigel bruce) has to rescue his boss from certain death a couple of times!yes, there are some credibility issues in this story but if you can put your brain on hold a few times, it's a fun film to watch....and it looks beautiful, thanks to the great restoration job done on this dvd. it makes the old print come alive with some wonderful visuals, particularly the night-time shots.one other note: whoever did the english subtitles in here misspelled or misinterpreted at least a half dozen words. it's very sloppy work, and not the first time i've encountered this watching the entire series on the restored dvd set.

do you like explosions? how about fighting? well, this movie has both of those. you know the other thing you can't have a movie without: a kick ass motorcycle, the type that bounces off someone's head and knocks them out at the same time. you bet the stabilizer has one. there's even a classic cliff scene.all in all, i'm quite proud that i have even seen this movie...and even prouder to have my review be the first one...yes!

i would like to start by saying i can only hope that the makers of this movie and it's sister film the intruder (directed by the great unheralded stylist auteur that is jopi burnama) know in their hearts just how much pleasure they have brought to me and my friends in the sleepy north eastern town of jarrow.from the opening pre credit sequence which manages to drag ever so slightly despite containing a man crashing through a window on a motorbike, the pitiless destruction of a silence lab, the introduction of one of the most simultaneously annoying and anaemic bad guys in movie history and costume design that jean paul gautier would find ott and garish. make no mistake; this is a truly unique experience. early highlight - an explosion (get used to it, plenty more where that came from!) followed by a close up of our chubby heroine and the most hilarious line reading of the word "dad" in living memory. and then... the theme song...yeah, this deserves its own paragraph. sung by aj, written by people who really should wish to remain anonymous, it makes the songs written for the rocky films sound like schubert. this is crap 80's hero motivation narcissism at an all time high, with choice lyrics such as "its only me and you, its come down to the wire" and much talk of having to "cross the line" (it'll make sense in time - our hero cares little for the boundaries of bona fida police work) abounding. not to mention the indonesian supremes cooing the film's title seductively. at this point anyone wishing to switch off officially has no pulse.our hero is semitic cop peter goldson (essayed brilliantly by intruder star peter o'brien), the "stabilizer" of the title. the man's bull in a china shop approach to crime fighting and particularly his less than inconspicuous undercover work truly leaves much to be desired, but he is without question an entertaining guide through the mean streets of downtown jakarta, with local sleaze ball connection captain johnny in tow, as well as peter's own waste of space partner in fashion crime sylvia nash, who does little. so many highlights, so little time - the "slide please" arrogance of peter's not all too convincingly argued case against chief baddie greg rainmaker (intruder fans will know hirsute slimy bastard craig gavin as the monstrous john white - helluva name eh? no! oh well...), the x marks the spot location map stupidity, our hero taking horrible advantage of heroine tina probost during a moment of weakness on her behalf, the latter turning up at a sting operation dressed like a member of a particularly flamboyant dancing troop. and believe me that barely covers it.there wasn't even time to go into the plot revolving around the hunt for a drug detection system and a kidnapped professor with an alarming but commendable amount of national pride. or our hero turning up at a funeral dressed as if an extra on boogie nights. or the absolutely hysterical craic between captain johnny and goldson - two guys have never made more heavy weather of buddy buddy shtick than these clowns. the trowel was possibly too subtle me thinks.ah it tails off people, and you never thought scenes of wanton destruction and general mayhem could be so unbelievably boring, but the character interaction is stupendous, the dialogue truly priceless and the incompetence on show somehow endearing. oh and the shoes people - watch out for the shoes!

what's the most violent movie of all time? rambo iii? commando? robocop? add these three very violent together, and you still won't equal the carnage in the stabilizer, the wildest, silliest, craziest action movie i have ever seen. for one hundred minutes things blow up and people die in dozens of strange ways. it will make you laugh and cheer, and when it's all over you'll be more than a little exhausted. this movie is a buried gem, a cult classic sadly lacking a cult.the stabilizer is the nickname of our hero peter goldson (peter o'brian), a large oily man with a curly mullet. he arrives in indonesia on the trail of the villainous and mean greg rainmaker. we know he is evil because he is only referred to by his full name ("i hate scum like greg rainmaker!") and utilizes a method of killing that is so horrible i can't even utter it here. wait, yes i can. he steps on people in spiky shoes. greg rainmaker: cleat killer.when greg rainmaker isn't pouring alcohol on women for their sexual pleasure, he's kidnapping important professors and heading a huge underworld empire. it's up to goldson (a jewish action hero? gevalt!) and his motley crew of sidekicks to stabilize the situation by killing everyone and blowing lots of stuff up. maybe "stabilize" has a different meaning in indonesia.and the violence, oh the violence. this is a film unwilling, nay, uncapable, of letting five minutes of screen time go by without some sort of explosion, knifing, car crash, or squib interrupting the dialogue. the violence is extreme; not graphic and bloody, just really weird. for example, the stabilizer & company invade one of rainmaker's warehouses (by driving through a solid concrete wall on a motorcycle, of course). when perched on the balcony, with heavy fire coming from below, the stabilizer does the one thing he can do. he drives off the balcony into the guy's head, his front tire bouncing off it like a basketball. astounding.from the overly-gratuitous love scenes (both major female characters hop in the sack with the hero of their choice not two minutes after they speak to them alone for the first time) to the poorly dubbed dialogue ("victor, you talented bastard!") the stabilizer has it all. this is a film for the ages, right up there with citizen kane and gymkata. it is not widely available in release. if you find it anywhere for any price, buy it and relish the insanity.

rose and the good doctor find themselves in a space station that is on a planet that's quite impossibly hovering in orbit right below a black hole. the crew of the station is just as perplexed at that as the two new inhabitants are. suitably spooky in it's atmosphere and gets better as the doctor and rose find themselves stranded due to circumstances out of their control and speaking through the submissive alien race of the ood, something quite dark is coming from below the crust of the planet. not haven seen the second part of this two-parter i can't vouch that the end is as strong yet. but it does make for one hell of a beginning.my grade: a

oooooh man was i pleased i didn't miss this. i wanted to post this review as this episode in particular does what a certain recent movie did not. it pays true homage to the game doom. its plot is different yes, and the characters are obviously set in an entirely different universe (obviously the doctor who universe) however the feel, the pace, the references and the location are perfect. and for all original doom fans listen out for the door opening and closing sound effect, it was the icing on the cake for me.please all doctor who and doom fans alike, check this one out. its a gem!

if you want to really terrify people, choose the devil as your subject. after all, a good deal of the population believe that he is real. therefore you are plugging into a whole meaty swathe of pre-existing religious and mythological imagery. and bound to cause quite a few nightmares in your young audience.this episode had all the appearance of a hollywood blockbuster. in fact, having finished watching it i flicked over to another channel which was playing a recent bond film and quite frankly couldn't split a hair between the differences in sfx. with a minimal cast, restricted by its situation on a space station; complete with overwhelming panoramic views of an imploding universe, it was as claustrophobic and intense as alien or event horison. the black hole outside made it feel as if the black hole's weight of dark matter was pressing the station onto the planet and to whatever was sealed inside. and as the horror is intensified by the knowledge that the dr and rose are stranded, the sinister ood start channelling a disembodied voice and then the characters start being picked off one by one...this has all the best qualities of the cream of this new dr who endeavour; girl in the fireplace and the empty child. emotionally engaging, frightening and humorous all without seeming cheesy. this is far scarier than any amount of flying daleks. but it has to be asked, is this really suitable viewing for children? this is not a family friendly episode. pity the poor parent who has to put their kids to bed after this one. i'm not sure i even want to see what happens next!

even an old cynical doctor who fan like myself can be left breathless by watching an episode of my favourite show . it happened previously during eccleston's finale and it happened watching this episode . it doesn't happen often though but the impossible planet is an example of both the show and of television at its very , very best . this is stunning television the doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see strange writing on the wall and the audience ( many of who will be moving behind the sofa ) are instantly transfixed . a door opens and horrible monsters start stalking the time travellers . this might have taken up an entire 25 minute episode in the original show but all this takes place in he pre title sequence . you may miss the longer drawn out format of the original show but at least this new series is tightly plotted and if we're treated to a disappointing story then at least it's usually only for one week there is nothing to disappointment a viewer here . it is doctor who at its most traditional best . writer matt jones and director james strong have gone out of their way to make a story that will be regarded for years to come . they do this by constructing a doom laden narrative . the doctor and rose lose the tardis and they're stuck with the protagonists in the far flung future . it's interesting how many stories never feature this type of plot point where the doctor and his companions no longer have access to the tardis which makes for a more intriguing type of story . without doubt the highlight is the scene where scooti goes to look for toby only to find him standing on the surface of the planet where he turns and beckons her outside . everything from acting , make up and murray gold's music makes this a scene that genuinely shocks its audience i can imagine immediately after this episode the bbc switchboards received a tsunami of complaints for distressed parents saying how traumatised their children were . that it took them several hours to get them from behind the family sofa and that they're now refusing to sleep with the lights out . to do this complaining would be to deny the magic of doctor who . yes it can terrify and yes such images will burn themselves in to the mind of a child , something they will never forget even if hey live to be a hundred . but i will bet my life that these same " traumatised " children would have spent the week begging that no matter what they'll be allowed to watch the next episode

this has got to be one of the best episodes of doctor who that i've seen since it came back last year. there is a brilliant mix of amusement, fear and tenderness all mixed up which equals one amazing episode. the ood were brilliantly designed and i'm pretty sure there' going to be a lot of ood jokes in the next few weeks. i myself am guilty of that already.i particularly liked the way that we saw a different perspective of rose's and the doctor's relationship and the ending;well, it's the first time i have ever hidden behind a cushion! i cannot wait until next weeks episode to find how they get out of this mess.

i loved this movie so much. i'm a big fan of amanda bynes's recently ended show. i admire her(besides her body) for her acting capability. she is a good actress.the movie was great. its about a girl named viola who wants to play soccer, but when her school cuts the girls soccer team she gets upset. her brother is set to go to a prestigious school and he decides to leave to england. so viola wants to make an impression by playing on the soccer team at the boarding school. she goes to the school and tries out for the soccer team. she gets in. meanwhile she meets duke who is a sensitive guy who plays on the soccer team. he really likes olivia (laura ramsey) who likes sebastian-who is really viola. sebastian is dating monique and suspects that sebastian isn't being himself.this is certainly not a chick flick and i enjoyed it a lot. its so funny and lovable. i don't think i have seen amanda act better.

okay, so i don't understand why people are getting so aggravated over this movie. so i thought it was going to be the usual amanda bynes movie, but it wasn't. it was great.okay, okay, so the acting wasn't the best, but i thought the performances were still overall great. also, you could tell that the actors were having fun while doing this movie. in other movies, that have surprisingly won awards, where the actors didn't like working on the film, you could tell. all of the actors had chemistry, and that also showed.a ton of people are ripping on the soccer skills that the actors have. yah, so they're not perfect...get over it! they are actors, not soccer players. i have been playing soccer for my whole life, and trust me, it is hard to learn, so stop ripping on the level of skills they have.i thought this movie was going to be stupid, but it was really funny. the way amanda bynes and channing tatum can make a situation funny without even saying anything is funny. i found myself laughing a lot in this movie.overall..i love it!

she's the man was the funniest movie i have ever seen. i laughed so hard that i was crying. it was also very romantic. channing tatum is absolutely gorgeous and can really act. it sure doesn't hurt that he has quite a few shirtless scenes either. channing and amanda have amazing chemistry and were absolutely wonderful together. i love this movie. when you watch make sure to watch the last deleted scene. it was a huge mistake to cut that scene because it is one of the best scenes in the movie. i highly recommend this movie. amanda has never been funnier. and channing is going to be a huge star. this is just the first of many for this bright new star.

i think this movie is amazing but there is one problem. there is one song that i want to find but cannot find it. it starts on about 18 minutes just after the coach has said "what are u the runt of the family", and then looks at the fat kid takes his hat off then he says go, the song that starts there, i would like to know what it is? does any 1 no email me please or add a comment.it starts zaga zow, ziga zow something along those lines. i just think it is an amazing dance track i would love to have that song so that i could use it in my break dancing lessons. it starts when they are jumping and running over the orange fast stepper things which are used in football training to help you run faster

this is a classic american movie in combination with comedy, romance & dream. you may say:' there have been lots of these kind of films already. but just believe me, you'll find this a good one because it's well directed, scripted and played. amanda bynes's just crazily amazing! she's humor, cute & charming both inside & outside the screen. she's the man indeed!!! the message i get from it is to pursue your own fairy tale. what i mean by'fairy tale' is not the one with prince & princess, but indicates 'faith'. namely, it tells us to hold your faith, dream & things that make you regret for your whole life if you don't do that. one of those movies you can't miss out in your life.

well,i'm not a movie critic or something like that.but i have my opinion for this movie.i think that the best in this movie was amanda bynes,she played her roll for my look very well,i have watched many her movies,this i liked most!when you are watching this movie,you just can relax,come down,and watch it.you don't have to try to look for subtext or something like that.you just watch it. movie is really great. maybe i liked it for actress,maybe for all the scenery,but i liked it.the whole atmosphere that was created.in one moment i just felt like i was in that university,in that room.it is not another drama movie that is made to win oscar,it is just nice movie to watch in your free time.

this was a fantastically written screenplay when it comes to perceiving things from another perspective. the comedy was timely and not overdone, the acting was generally terrific, and the plot line served a greater purpose of generating misconception when we think about people solely based on their external appearance. the plot twists as the brother/sister character of amanda bynes tries to play soccer on the boys team finding instead a new love interest along the way. tatum channing is where the real misperception lies and he does a fine job of acting disinterested at first, later coming to realize the most important thing in life is friendship, not attitude.

i just rented this movie from the video store last night. it being new and not released long ago here, the rent was only overnight. me, my little sis, and my older brother who usually hates watching these kind of movies sat down and watched. once the movie started and after sitting there watching it for a while we were all laughing historically. even my brother. this movie is hilarious, i actually laughed. no matter how funny some movies are... even if i think its funny i sometimes can't seem to laugh. but this movie... i laughed. my brother ended up thinking it was the best "that type of movie" he had seen. i ended up watching the movie again about 2 or 3 hours later.

the movie was great and everything but, there were a lot of mistakes in the "soccer" scenes, i wonder if any of the guys who were working on the movie have ever seen a soccer match before..? first of all, i don't understand how she wanted to try for the boys team? in soccer boys and girls cant play in the same team and these are the fifa rules. and don't get me started on who when they found out that she was actually a girl they let her continue to play...!! second of all, players cant paint their faces with colours and play like that, again fifa rules not mine.and don't get me started on the way they scored goals its was ridiculous completely unrealistic. and all the players seemed like they didn't know jack about soccer.and when duke was training viola why did they only concentrate on shooting what happened to passing and dribbling. or was shooting her only problem?! and why the hell were all the posters on the wall in their room were for players from chelse ?! don't they like any other players from any other teams.? it was like this was the only team they know...! but other than that the movie was good and i enjoyed the rest of it, just the training and the game scenes were unrealistic for me. they really should have consulted some one a bout them...!

i thought that this movie was going to be totally lame based on the advertisements that i saw in theaters. when my sister borrowed from a friend i decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. . .needless to say ten minutes in the movie and i loved it. amanda was a great actor in the movie, her comedic timing was perfect. the guy who played duke was hot, plain and simple. my favorite scene was definitely when amanda walks by the gardener and a fellow student who is suspicious of her and she is talking to her mom about dresses--as she is pretending to be a guy! i re-watched this part over and over... to make a long story short, the movie i thought was going to be lame--i now own it.

if you haven't seen this movie than you need to. it rocks and you have to watch it. it is so funny and will make you laugh your guts out!! so you have to watch it and i saw it about a billion and a half times and still think it is funny. so you have to. yes i have memorized the whole movie and could quote it to you from start to finish. you must see this move. it is also cute because it is half a chick flick. if you don't watch it then you are really missing out.this movie even has cute guys in it and that is always a bonus. so in summary watch the movie now and trust me you will not be making a mistake. did i mention the music is good too. so you should like it if you enjoy music. this is a movie that they rated correctly and it will work for anyone.

when i saw the first preview for this, i nearly passed out from excitement. i have long been a fan of twelfth night- it turned me on to shakespeare, so to have a modern adaption is a dream come true. my anticipation was not disappointed.the plot basically follows the original storyline and that means: complicated! i don't want to even try to relate it, the plot summery will probably cover the basics. just imagine having a girl pretend to be a guy at a boarding school and think of all the possible situations that would create. i will not even pause to question the plausibility of such a plot; reality is not the point of the film.what it is, though, is absolutely hilarious. nearly every scene nails the comedic set-up. kudos to the writers, director and actors on that count.amanda bynes is the star of this film and she carries it wonderfully. she's super-cute, not a vixen and can do faultless comedy. i admire her so much for not going full-on tramp in her films or public life like so many starlets today do. i'm glad there is at least one decent young actress left in hollywood. ok, i'm off my soap-box...channing tatum, yeah he's hot and built like a flippin gorilla, but he really makes me laugh! my favourite scenes in the whole movie are when he's trying to converse with olivia first by talking about cheese and then later about his workout regimen.the rest of the cast did not fail to perform either, with marvelous additions to the characters in the forms of the inane d√©butante mother and monique, the classic evil girlfriend.overall, lots of fun, loooots of laughs, and a highly attractive cast. maybe not on par with the original, but it beats out modern versions of other plays, including the much-touted 10 things i hate about you.

some people don't like led zeppelin, but luckily the number of people who versus the number of people who don't is way unbalanced. i am the proud converter of 2 or 3 led zeppelin fans and the only reason i was able to do this is because of this dvd.for one, how someone can listen to "stairway to heaven" or "immigrant song" without falling in love with zeppelin is beyond me, but to play the guitar and not like page... that is like being christian and not liking jesus. my friend was like "led zeppelin sucks!" and i was like, "oh yeah, watch this!" after about 2 mins of watching page pick through "white summer/black mountain side" he was glued to the screen and has never said a bad thing about zeppelin since.incase you haven't been following the running metaphor i am calling this dvd the bible of led zeppelin. held high by the followers and used as a converter for the unwashed heathens.course there are some things missing like "over the hills and far away," a good version of "immigrant song" and i really didn't need 2 version of "whole lotta love," but what the hell, i'll take 'em.because there is nothing besides "the song remains the same" to compare this too i gave it a 10 and even if there were more to compare it too i still would have given it a 10.

i just re-watched a few episodes of this series on very poor vhs tapes that i recorded the series on. i'm glad i did, though.ramona is based on the children's books by beverly cleary and follows the adventures of the title eight-year-old (sarah polley). she has fun with friends and family and gets into trouble much like many eight-year-olds. all ten episodes are pretty good. "mystery meal" kind of grosses me out as a vegan, but it's funny seeing the parents trying to get their kids to eat cow's tongue! and any episode that mentions godzilla versus the smog monster twice can't be all bad. i like "ramona's bad day" even more. although it's disheartening to see ramona going through a rough day, she does imagine herself getting revenge on her friend howie's uncle (a pre-psi factor barclay hope), who always teases her. "the perfect day" is also good.lori chodos plays beezus, ramona's sister. i swear i've seen her on something else, but imdb doesn't list anything besides this show. unfortunately, this series is not on dvd. why is every crappy show made these days on dvd except something i'd actually like to buy? an injustice if there ever was one!

"don't change your husband" is another soap opera comedy from producer/director cecil b. de mille. it is notable as the first of several films he made starring gloria swanson. i guess you could also call it a sequel of sorts to his "old wives for new" (1918).james (elliot dexter) and leila (swanson) porter are a forty-ish couple where james has gone to seed and become slovenly and lazy. he has a penchant for smelly cigars and eating raw onions. he takes his wife for granted. leila tries to get him to straighten out to no avail.one night at a dinner party at the porters, leila meets the dashing schyler van sutphen (now there's a moniker), the playboy nephew of socialite mrs. huckney (sylvia ashton). she invites leila to her home for the weekend to make james "miss her". once there schyler begins to put the moves on her, promising her pleasure, wealth and love, if she will leave her husband and go with him. the sequences involving leila's imagining this promised new life are lavishly staged and forecast de mille's epic costume drams later in his career.leila, bored with her marriage and her disinterested husband, divorces james and marries the playboy. james ultimately realizes that he has lost the only thing that mattered to him and begins to mend his ways. he shaves off his mustache, works out, shuns onions and re-acquires some manners.meanwhile, all is not rosy with leila's new marriage. schyler it seems likes to gamble and has taken up with the gold digging nanette (aka tootsie, or some such name) (julia faye). schyler loses all of his money and steals leila's diamond ring to cover his losses.one fateful day, leila meets the "new" james and is taken by the changes in him. james drives her home and becomes aware of her situation and.................................................this film marked the beginning of gloria swanson's rise to super stardom in a career that would rival that of mary pickford. barely 20 years of age, she had begun her career in mack sennett two reel comedies as a teen ager. elliot dexter was almost 50 at this time but he and swanson make a good team, although it's hard to imagine anyone tiring of the lovely miss swanson as is the case in this film.dexter and sylvia ashton had appeared in the similar "old wives for new" where the wife had gone to seed and the husband was wronged.also in the cast are de mille regulars theodore roberts as a bishop and raymond hatton as a gambler.

i loved this film. it manages to make the characters sympathetic (well, most of them) concerning the problems they have with their relationship.gloria swanson, as leila, is in a dusty marriage with a husband who barely notices her presence (though he does notice her absence). the film shows very well why she is tired of married life, and why she is susceptible to a sweet-talking con man, without making her selfish or demanding. the reaction shots of leila at the dinner table on her anniversary, while her workaholic husband (late to dinner again) eats salted scallions with gusto and pushes bride-and-groom dolls out of the way of his plate, are perfect.the show is stolen - and stolen effortlessly - by elliott dexter as jim, leila's neglectful husband. after losing leila to another man, jim literally cleans up his act, shaving off his mustache, working out to lose the middle-aged spread, and dressing neatly. there are several shots of jim at home, lonely and thinking of leila, including a powerful scene when he finds one of her old dresses in the closet. the film gives the audience the advantage of watching jim's transformation along with leila. it isn't just the exterior that's more attractive; we come to know much more about the kind of person jim really is, and we see how completely different he is from leila's second husband, schuyler (lew cody). dexter shines as the before-and-after jim, who is determined, after discovering schuyler's true character, to win leila back, if he can. the film's most touching moment comes when jim and leila discover that they are standing under the mistletoe, and jim talks of what he has lost.definitely worth watching.

i thought this movie was really good. it ends up showing the viewers in the end that leila should of kept what she had. leila was sick of her husband jim, who was more worried about work then her. he was so into his work that he forgot their anniversary. he was also very sloppy. she couldn't take it anymore so she left to see if he would miss her. the movie shows that he misses her, he even tries to make up for the night he messed up. he goes to her and tries to bring her home. she ends up finding another man named schuyler. he seemed like the man she always wanted neat and notices her. in the end she sorta foreshadows by when she look at schuylers shoes and the way he let his cigar ashes fall on the floor the way jim did the same kinda thing. jim ends off making lots of money and cleaning himself up. leila thinks in the end that she should of kept her husband because thats all she really wanted and he did changing.

i found this movie to be filled with irony. but watching the movie you can almost for see what will happen. leila is a confused, bored house wife, who is constantly looking for happiness. when she thinks she finds true happiness, she clings onto it, leaving behind all that she knew. but she finds her self almost comparing notes between her ex and her current husband. she learned that if she only had communicated more about what had bothered her in her previous marriage, that it could have been salvaged a lot easier that she intended it to be. she realizes that words are nothing with out action, but she learns that too far into her second marriage and finds herself looking back and hoping for change once again. the main conflict in this movie, is leila vs herself. you can not have true happiness with out yourself being truly happy. i liked this movie, but i would only recommend this movie to women, i can't see a man truly finding enjoyment in this movie.

i have seen films come and go in my years,and when i see a disaster film i keep hoping i wont be disappointed.and with this one i was not in the least.the story of a whole country sinking into the ocean was a great concept written by sakyo komatsu,a novelist with intense theories on where this earth is going.the characters were top notch,and even though i am not japanese,i didn't need a translator to give the idea of how people in their most desperate needs can come together for the common good.the special effects blew me away,i was literally on the edge of my seat watching the tidal waves lava flows and land explosions that must have taken months of work to perfect.as for the acting i thought yes,this is acting at its best,emotions run rampant throughout the film and i cried at the most severe scenes.for movie goers alike,you don't need to speak or understand japanese to watch this film,you can get the idea and feeling from each person and character to understand it well and to follow it along like you are there.my hats off to shinji higuchi for directing it,i hope he can outdo his work with another mind blowing experience.as i said,....fantastic film.

it's the best movie i've watched this year! excellent detail and storyline (for a remake).it presents to you a "what if" situation wherein the island of japan could totally be wiped out of this earth. a thought-provoking, life and death situation and not to mention all life on earth (well in this particular japan). it also presents a great and genius solution to this massive tragedy.horror, action, suspense, sci fi, documentary, love story and all the human interest story you can get you'll find everything here! but i also warn you that it is a real tearjerker! the casts, actors and all are all excellent, better than any hollywood movie! the thing is...this could really happen to anywhere on earth! now let me ask you this after you've seen it..."what would you do if you are faced in this life and death situation"?

i've never watched a file in a language i don't understand just because i wanted to see the movie and i couldn't find it with english subs. i don't know how much i missed but it wasn't much. probably just specific details which sounds silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact together. i want to mention to the diceman from germany there's no reason to feel that he 'sucks' when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. like i said, i don't understand japanese -or at least only the very small amount i came away with from reading the very lengthy novel -pro- bably my favorite all time book which i could not put down & took the next day off from work just to finish reading! i don't know if there's an english dubbed or subbed version but if the film but if there is i'd love to see it. the film was incredible in japanese anything better is icing of the cake!! slainte', maegi

i don't know what dick steel was talking about, but i found this film to be one of japan's most thrilling epics to date. as for armageddon or deep impact, or for that matter the day after tomorrow is pale in comparison. for what i know of films, most of the catastrophes in films are basically run of the mill asteroid flicks or one of which of global warming. this how ever ran a different course. a course of natural means where the earth's crust is beginning to erode to such a degree, that it will take another piece of land with it for the ride. what the scientific teams had to do was create a way to stop the erosion from going to far and sinking japan altogether. in most cases this would simply be called tectonic shifting on steroids. i found the characters rather appealing in every way, from the child who lost her mother only to face her own demise among unfamiliar friends. or the rescue girl who does all the she can to save lives in the face of disaster. or a man who thought he could change her mind not to be such a dare devil and go with him to safety, only to become the hero himself and save his homeland. and let's not forget, how the rest of the world just shucked them all back only to be forgotten, by having the world turning their backs on the japanese citizens who cried for help. this was a great movie in all aspects. what dick is trying to say is that this movie was not hollywood made, that it was made in japan, that it had characters which rival other actors around the world, that the effects are very gorgeous as he mentioned but it's all he was waiting for, and nothing else. he lacks the vision of what's important to everyone, and why this film had every element of feeling, of grandeur, and of humanity. i thought this film was top rate, and i have seen many disaster films to know that japan sinks was possibly one of the most original and well thought out projects i have witnessed. i really hope shinji higuchi will make another of such films. oh and by the way, i am not japanese, though in many ways i wish i was. i am canadian, born and raised. and an avid movie buff in all aspects. predjudicial visions are bitter and not worth the effort to be recognized as an opinion. dick you should watch it with a more open heart and mind, don't just look for the eye candy which makes a films content, look for what's more important, and understand it. they may not be american, but the japanese have cornered the market lately for some of the most breath taking and down right gritty film making to date. which is why spending 25,000,000 is just what the doctor ordered. you heard right, 25,000,000 to make this film. now you tell me, was it worth it? or was it worth it because american actors weren't in it?

as spectacle, it's hard to fault nihon chinbotsu. the japanese people have benefited from their intimate relationship with the sea, and the concept of the film implies that an entire world and way of life at risk - thanks to its volcanic heritage. from the standpoint of reality it's rather silly to have a drama wherein the entirety of japan vanishes under the waves; why just japan? so, presume instead that we have movie reality, fueled by spectacle (and popcorn), and some may find this quite affecting. compared to adventures with japanese radioactive monsters, this comes off as more mature and better paced. the emotional element is underplayed, and it really works. (it loses a bit with the overblown theme song at the climax, however.)is nihon chinbotsu credible? probably not, but the thrilling eruptions, and the relaxed pacing make for a more pleasing entertainment that one night expect.

i actually caught an ad for japan sinks in a japanese magazine last year, and wondered what the heck it was until i saw the trailer for the film. it was then i remembered that i had seen the english translation of sakyo komatsu's novel some years back. i got it, and it was quite good, as well as chillingly realistic. it's enough to make the reader dread hearing any news about earthquakes in japan.now, i've read the book, and seen this 2006 movie version (the first movie came out in 1973). and you know what? i thought the movie was quite good, even if there are major changes from novel to film (but that's understandable). the story is simple--a major tectonic shift will cause japan to sink within a year. massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis rock the country as frantic efforts are made to evacuate as many people as possible. one scientist has a plan that could stop the sinking of the country and save what's left of the landmass, but can it be implemented in time? i saw japan sinks at otakon 2007, and while there were a couple of problems i had with it--it does run a bit too long, and a couple of the character moments were a little too sappy--i was nonetheless blown away. the sheer concept of an entire nation sinking into the sea was made terrifyingly real, and the effects were some of the best i've ever seen, rivaling anything that hollywood has done. the film also plays no favorites with the main characters, with some not making it to the closing credits.frankly, i've been surprised by some of the negative comments made about this film. difference of opinions, i guess. personally, i enjoyed it. and i've read the original book.

another "end of the world" film that begs comparison to the abysmal "day after tomorrow". following the same sort of structure as dat but with a distinctly japanese style. how does it fare? that depends on your taste for japanese melodrama. i found that the small human touches to be what makes this film compelling for most of it's 2 + hours. also the frequent title cards explaining some of the science. the effects are probably the best i've seen in a japanese film and they compare very well to anything out of hollywood. many of the disaster scenes are truly horrifying even though the human carnage is usually off screen. and that is one of the drawbacks. while the terror of thousands of on- screen deaths like in the recent "war of the worlds might have too overwhelming, we also don't really get a sense of the chaos of an entire nation crumbling into the ocean. a few scenes touch on the chaos but for the most part this part of the story is barely touched on. regardless, this film works on a lot of levels and is way more realistic then dat, that is until the end.unfortunately the story hinges itself on one clich√©d plot device and another plot device that would be at home in the 1960's japanese earth in peril film "gorath". after the reasonably good science and mostly realistic take on the disaster, this makes for a bit of disappointment. the sudden stopping of the film for a pop love song doesn't help either (unless you like the song). this made the "exciting" ending a bit of a drag for me.the overall direction is good and the art design is excellent. acting is all good as well. recommended.

though not a greek i have had a lifelong interest in the eastern empire. its fall in 1453 was the greatest loss to christianity in its entire history. yet while the easter empire is not a topic much discussed in american intellectual circles, the us did not merely mimic golden byzantiums public architecture, the us is much absorbed in the fated byzantine historical cycle and now has faced many of the crises involving certain people of a middle eastern extraction about whom it is said that there is a slight tendency for excessive exuberance on religious matters which humbled great byzantium. i wonder if the loss of the ability to speak plainly was the first sign post on the road to disaster.john romer is to be credited not only for his excellent production but also for his joyful enthusiasm for the subject which is most refreshing.not recommended for americans who like political correctness.

if you want an excellent survey of byzantine history done in colorful fashion, this is for you. this documentary would also be excellent for educators, who are teaching about roman, or medieval history. this documentary is divided into three portions, first dealing with the fall of the western roman empire, the rise of christianity and the beginning of the byzantine empire. the second video deals with byzantine diplomacy and the iconoclastic controversy. the third and final video explains the decline and fall of byzantium. the series is shot in several countries, and beautifully integrates byzantine history into the realities of the modern world, showing the place of this civilization as part of human civilization in general. do, take the time to watch.

this is yet another gem from the pen of daniele thompson - in fact that same year (1999) she wrote and directed la buche, the first of three writer/director credits so far. belle maman is first of all 'french' whatever that means which is, of course, different things to different folks. the premise is simple: at the altar where he is marrying mathilde seigner, the groom, vincent lindon, gets his first glimpse of her mother, catherine deneuve, and suffers what the french call a coup de foudre which we know as love at first sight. in theory the story is either 1) over right then and there assuming he called the wedding off or else 2)just the beginning as he goes through with the wedding and thus lives a lie until it is resolved one way or the other. thompson veers towards #2 but not without hitting us with the odd subplot along the way like, for example, deneuve's cigar-smoking lesbian mother line renaud (in real life, if anyone cares, renaud is in a long-term relationship with stephane audran, who co-stars here) and throws in a brilliant set-piece in a luxuriously appointed men's room at the wedding reception, which takes the form of a hilarious song-and-dance. consummate writer that she is thompson also leavens the comedy with drama like the brilliant climactic scene where vincent finally spews out his feelings for deneuve at a family gathering whilst simultaneously wrecking the joint. this is one to savour. again and again.

wow....it's been a long time since i've last seen such a hilarious movie like this one!!!!! i've never been a great fanatic about french movies, but ever since i fell in love with the beauty and the acting skills of catherine deneuve i decided to see all of her movies... however i didn't think this one would be so fantastic as it turned out to be. lucky me, that i bought it even though i had some doubts! this is really "feel-good-time" film with class and quality. there are some great social topics and moral drama's involved that are very close to today's modern way of living, which are shown very beautiful and realistic. i also liked the dancing scene in the men's room a lot! but my favourite is the rather timid attempt of catherine deneuve to sing.....she brings it the way she is, with lots of grace and modesty at the same time...very tempting! further on i would also like to express my respect and admiration for line renaud, who played a fantastic role (i didn't even know she acted....i've only known her for her music). so, don't wait any longer and go see the movie...you'll be surprised in many ways.

or at least you feel pretty high after this movie. it's the kind of film that the word "rollicking" really can be applied to, though it's rollicking in that entirely casual, intelligent, and open-minded way that belongs to the french.no, catherine deneuve does not spend the entire movie high (sorry to disappoint any puritans with an agenda).. but the one scene to which i refer involves all the members of a wedding party - and it's a musical number! anyway, everything fits pretty seamlessly together, and the unusual, bright, colorful family ( deneuve's mother is a lesbian, deneuve her bon vivant daughter) alternately entertain and annoy us as real families do..but since it's a movie they mostly entertain.don't want to say too much about the ending, but deneuve ends up marrying a man about twenty years younger. this is entirely believable as we see the relationship develop over time, and as the two are naturally drawn closer and closer together. the ending is a happy one; and like the rest of the movie, satisfyingly quirky as well as pitch-perfect.

starting with a "my name is joe" like scene in alcoholics anonymous tbm careers into a mad spiral of infidelity, double standards and clandestine affairs. but what do you expect from a family of lawyers?a genuinely funny film, with some of the most outrageous characters since the birdcage, plot and subplot are intertwined with surreal scenes of decadent parisian life (ever been to a wedding reception in the gents toilet where the brides grandmother and her deranged girlfriend are smoking dope and cracking blue jokes? no, me either!) leading to a final scene of almost arcadian symbolism.excellent.

i always loved french movies because i think they are filled with much more emotion and sense than the americans. this film is a gem.starting with the wedding which is so funny that you just want to join them and in the end where the little family kids tell us who is with who which is extremly funny. catherine deneuve is simply hot and so good that it is absolutely possible that a young man can fall in love with her, and vincen lindon is perfect for that role. the best scene (except the wedding party) is in the family reunion where antoine has got mad and yells his feelings to lea in front of the family. it is such a shame that i could buy this film only from the french and not from the english (so i have to learn in french to enjoy watching it)!!

for all of us american deneuve fans, this little gem is a little tough to get ahold of. fortunately, i found myself so wrapped up in the short bits that i saw previewed on youtube.com that i was willing to go to any lengths. i found it on ebay.com, ordered it directly from france, and changed my laptop so it would play region 2 dvds. let me tell you that it was well worth it. be warned - there are no subtitles (unforunately, pathe shouldn't have released this on dvd, koch lorber should've - they're good about the subtitles). i don't speak a word of french. i can utter a syllable here and there, order a drink and whatnot. that having been said, this film was a treat anyway. i couldn't fully appreciate the supposed "bawdy" humor or the witty dialogue. watching deneuve and her cohorts was enough for me. i understood what was going on without need of the dialogue. it really says something about a film when those who can't speak the language enjoy it. the cinematography is wonderful. london is adorable as the smitten son-on-law. loved the lesbian mom. and, of course, what can i possibly say about our dear mademoiselle deneuve. she is one of a kind. those eyes, that smile. i could watch her films all day. she really goes beyond beauty. people always say she's gorgeous. well, yes, she is. but she is also very talented. i believed her every second of the way. her conversation about chocolate and vanilla with london is too sweet. her character even gets arrested for smoking dope with some 15 year old in the street. not to be missed! fly to france and buy this if you have to. great. 10

i will admit i possibly missed tiny moments when i wasn't paying proper attention, but i got enough of the story to agree that it is a great family film, from director lionel jefferies, who played grandpa potts in chitty chitty bang bang. basically it starts with a happy upper-middle class family living in victorian london. one night the father (iain cuthbertson) is visited by two strangers, and he leaves with them, and does not return. they move to a cottage in the country, and here the children; bobbie (jenny agutter, who i first saw in child's play 2), phyllis (sally thomsett) and peter (gary warren) keep their spirits up, with their fascination for the nearby railroad. everyday they wave faithfully to the passengers in the passing trains, and with courage and vigilance they also avoid an accident and are made heroes. their kindness makes them friends, including important people who can help find the mystery of their missing father. also starring dinah sheridan as mother/mrs. waterbury, bernard cribbins as albert perks, william mervyn as old gentleman, peter bromilow as doctor forrest, ann lancaster as ruth and gordon whiting as russian. it was number 29 on the 100 greatest family films, and it was number 24 on the 50 greatest british films. very good!

the railway children, at least this 1970 movie version written and directed by that long-time british character actor, lionel jeffries, is an unmitigated...classic. it tells a childhood story with great simplicity and charm; the sentimentality is muted; the evocation of childhood adventures is involving; and jeffries brings cleverness and style to his production. the waterbury family is leading an idyllic life in edwardian london. the father is prosperous, the mother is beautiful and loving, the children are well-mannered and affectionate, their home is warm and cozy. then one night during the christmas holidays two men appear at the doorstep, talk quietly to the father, and then take him away. in a moment the lives of mrs waterbury (dinah sheridan) and bobbie, 14 (jenny agutter), phyllis, 12 (sally thomsett) and young peter (gary warren), have been changed. only their fortitude and good spirits are going to see them through. now teetering into poverty, mrs. waterbury takes her children to live in a musty old brick house in the countryside near a rail-line, not too far from a small village with a train station. the children discover the rail and regularly sit on a small hill to wave at the passengers as the train chugs by. one day an old gentleman, going to his business in the city, looks up from his newspaper and finds himself waving back. it's not long before he will play an important part in the story. as time passes, mrs. waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to bear on her children. she begins to write stories to earn money. she teaches them their lessons and provides a home of warmth and security for them. the story, however, is about these three children, especially bobbie. at 14, she is old enough to want to share her mother's worries, yet young enough to enjoy the adventures she has with her sister and brother. they find a poor man at the station who cannot speak english. they discover he is a russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and child are. they insist he must come home with them, and their mother takes him in. before long the children have written a large sign to the old gentlemen on the train asking for his help. they help a young man taking part in a steeplechase who breaks his leg in a train tunnel. soon, he is at their home recuperating. they decide to have a birthday party for the station master, a man with few friends and several children who is a stickler for his dignity. it's not long before the children help him realize the difference between friendship and charity. in other words, the three children encounter all sorts of problems in their childhood adventures, and manage to be instrumental in seeing that all the problems have happy endings. but what of their own problems? bobbie finally learns from her mother that her father was taken away because he had been accused of treason, of giving state secrets to the russians. will bobbie be able to find a way to help? will the old gentleman be something more than simply an old gentleman on a passing train? will their father's case be reopened? will there be a happy ending? jenny agutter was almost 18 when she filmed her part; she plays the 14-year-old bobbie with great naturalness and charm. as important as the other players are, especially dinah sheridan as the mother, agutter is the heart of the story. for me, it is jenny agutter's talent and lionel jeffries' style and restraint that make this movie so memorable. the story's problems come with no serious doubt but that they will be solved. and jeffries does not just give us an expertly adapted and directed movie, he adds touches that are barely noticed but which charm us. this might include just a split second of a freeze frame as two people talk; or a slow close-up of a small, yellow wildflower in the grass outside bobbie's home, then a slow pull-back from a yellow oil lamp being turned up inside; or the realization that a delightful interior shot or a view of the green countryside or a look at the train station from a hill...all suddenly recall those charming edwardian hand-tinted drawings of a perfect by- gone time. perhaps this gentle story can't compete for the time kids need nowadays to perfect their nintendo monster-splatting skills. i'm almost positive it would never capture the attention of most of their parents, especially those weaned on batman and leone. still, it's a perfectly put together movie and shouldn't be forgotten. as an aside, 19 years later the story was retold as a television program. this time, jenny agutter played the mother.

i think together all the reviewers have captured this film really well. i have seen it many, many times, but i still feel a sense of joy and warmth just as i did the first time. my emotional response to this film never seems to fade. the final scene certainly brings me to tears, but so does the scene between perks and the children on his birthday. and as for the kindly gentleman. something else is going on with that character. the generous provider and solver of problems. he knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere. a perfect father to run to and make us feel safe. i do not know how the film does it, but it touches something very english deep inside, which has long gone from our daily experience, but yet we all instantly recognise and yearn for again.

in victorian times a father is separated from his family when he is falsely accused of treason and they are sent to live in the country. the children adapt to their new situation, make friends, and enlist the help of a kind old man they wave to on the train to help reunite their family.actors who direct movies are often not very good at it. jeffries however, the great veteran actor of dozens of british comedy classics, is one of the few exceptions. his brilliant conception (he also wrote the script, from the novel by e. nesbit) of a classic british children's story is what raises this film to art. whilst the story may be highly idealised, the wonderful performances and the fabulously evocative yorkshire dales settings combine to make a truly memorable movie. the photography by arthur ibbetson is the definition of good movie-making - not a shot is wasted in telling the story but at the same time the images combine to create a fabulously romantic atmosphere. agutter is simply perfect as the kind-hearted bobbie (okay, i fell in love with her at an early age, but i defy anyone to disagree) and cribbins, whose comic acting pedigree is on a par with jeffries, is unforgettable as perks the humble-yet-proud railway porter. this is a film out of time; romantic, charming, hugely enjoyable and with a beautifully naive sense of good-hearted kindness towards all.

i try to catch this film each time it's shown on tv, which happily is quite often. but i keep forgetting to video it. as it is, i practically know the script by heart, but that doesn't stop me having a good cry, in fact it probably adds to it as i cry knowing what's coming next. it's such a lovely film - well made, well cast, good photography. i love it. one of my top ten films.

i have watched this movie countless times, and never failed to be charmed by it's homely simplicity, sincerity and goodness. great characterizations by all of the cast, and the lovely little steam trains that play a such an important supporting role.i confess i fell in love with roberta in 1970, and she still touches me today. shown on tv in new zealand on christmas day, the nicest present i could have had.

an extremely powerful film that certainly isn't appreciated enough. it's impossible to describe the experience of watching it. the recent uk television adaptation was shameful - too ordinary and bland. this original manages to imprint itself in your memory.

the railway children was on tv again this weekend, and i had forgotten how good it was.if i have a criticism, it is that the episodic structure sometimes shows a little too clearly, there being little narrative flow from sequence to sequence. the charm and beauty of the film are such that this matters very little, however.i won't revisit the comments of others, other than to add my vote for the final scene on the platform as being possibly the single most emotional scene in the history of british cinema: as a cynical old git passing through middle age rather too quickly i, too, find i cannot even think of that moment without being hit with a severe case of "i've got something in my eye." in fact, it's not just something in my eye, it moves things around inside me, too, with that beautiful happy pain we sometimes feel.and jenny agutter was exquisitely beautiful in this film, standing with one foot in childhood and one in young womanhood, and bringing qualities of both to her portrayal of a girl having to grow up rather too quickly.plus a quick plaudit for bernard cribbins. regarded mostly as a lightweight actor, he deftly created a perks of great humanity.

proudly and defiantly working class porter perks(mr b.cribbins)is eventually won over by upper middle class family down on their luck. father(mr i.cuthbertson) incarcerated for treason - for which the penalty was death in those days,lest it be forgotten),mother(the very beautiful miss d.sheridan)brave and resourceful,loyal and loving,and - principally - older daughter (miss j.agutter) tottering on the cusp of adolescence - hurt and confused about the fate of her father. mr perks,like many working people of his time,will have nothing to do with anything that he considers smacks of "charity" and it is a key moment in the movie when he finally accepts that birthday gifts he has been given by the children do not compromise his principles. although the lovely miss agutter has received all the accolades it is mr cribbins and miss sheridan whose performances dominate "the railway children".they both know how edwardian society works from opposite ends of the spectrum but there is an unspoken mutual respect and understanding between them. but this is basically a movie about family.in an era when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and hold her to ransom and be considered as "socially inept" rather than unfit to live in decent society,and when two "human beings" can beat and kick a baby to death without being charged with murder,"family" may be seen as an old - fashioned,elitist, racist even homophobic concept,but a century ago it was the glue that held society together at all levels.mr cribbins' and miss sheridan's families are archetypal for the age.strong and loving,sticking together against outside influences,integral units with a moral certainty mocked in the 21st century. what might seem to be a dull,preachy political tract is turned by mr lionel jeffries into a delightful hymn to hope,faith,optimism and courage. that all those attributes were once considered the norm and are now too often the subject of scorn and cynicism is a reflection on our society rather than miss nesbit's. no one with more than a passing concern for the human condition can fail to be considerably moved by this quite perfect movie.

edith nesbitt's best book has been adapted into a truly magnificent film, i love it. the film itself has gorgeous cinematography, and fine realisation of the subject matter. the ending is enough to have you in tears, as it is so beautifully done. lionel has directed some truly excellent films, like the amazing mr blunden, but this is his best film as director by a mile. the costumes were absolutely lovely, that matched the beauty of the countryside, and the sparkling and conveniently-faithful script helped matters. however, it is the quality of the acting that holds this film together, as it is nothing shorter than incredible. dinah sheridan is suitably sincere as the mother, a much-needed characteristic of the character, and bernard cribbins was hilarious as perks. in fact, i preferred perks on film, as he isn't as humorous in the book. the children were perfect. gary warren and sally thomsett both gave spirited performances, but it is jenny agutter's enchanting portrayal of bobbie that impressed me the most. another special mention is the gorgeous music by johnny douglas, the title music reminded me of charlie chaplin's smile. in conclusion, a funny and poignant masterpiece, that is better than the book, i think. 10/10. bethany cox.

what is enjoyable about watching random movies at random times is that one never quite knows what to expect or where the next great piece of cinema will emerge. recently, my viewing has taken the form of stapled classics like "raging bull" or "raiders of the lost ark", but this time my vcr took me away from modern conveniences and plopped me right down in front of lionel jeffries' "the railway children". this is a skillfully directed film about three youthful children, a mysterious event with their father, relocation to the open fields of england, and eventually the rewards inherited by merely waving at trains. at first glance this seemingly simple children's film doesn't seem all that hopeful as it has been lost on vhs rarity for some time, but within the first fifteen minutes of this film, one realizes that it is more than just your common place children's movie ¬ñ "railway children" was created during a time when purity was more than just saying "no", when family meant everything, and where adventure was ready for you around every railroad track bend. this is more than an adorable film, it has amazing cinematic techniques used, it keeps the regular viewer glued to the screen with unanswered questions, and gives three perfect companions to follow along this 110-minute voyage. "railway children" is a lost treasure that needs to be seen by families and film aficionados alike.there are several moments that stand out proudly in "railway children" that transform this from mediocrity to excellence ¬ñ one happens to be our three children; bobby, phyllis, and peter. modern cinema assures us that these three children cannot provide ample darkness, laughter, and insight into the world surrounding them, but jeffries' children prove otherwise. from intelligently spoken lines (both from acting and the script), to sincere kindness and dedication to this small village, all the way to the final meeting at that train stop; these children are more than just child stars advancing a story, they are leading us with emotion, persuasion, and a realism unseen by today's children. there is more imagination packed in this small vhs than i have witnessed in film for years. a favorite scene that could have been handled with generality, of which i have seen in other films, was the birthday scene for bobby. the way that jeffries floats her between guests and gifts was exciting and refreshing, keeping our eyes excited about each scene, as well as our mind. another scene that captured my attention was when the children were working on gifts for perks, when asking one man for a gift, jeffries has him merely state, "no, i will not. i don't like perks." the children's reaction is hilarious ¬ñ providing moments for both children and adults to enjoy throughout. filmed in the 1970s, this tiny feature provides genuine laughs than most modern comedies. it is a creative film coupled with great choreography and direction.that is to say, as much as i loved this film, it wasn't perfect. jeffries does a great job of keeping us guessing as to what happened to father, but it did feel like the event occurred, the children were kept in the dark, and it suddenly resolved itself by the end. more detail to father, not much more, would have solidified his character and given us the opportunity to see more of the children's reaction. also, there is one scene in this film, one of those grandiose wide-screen shots of the english countryside that is just breath-taking, but when looking a bit closer you happen to see cars in the background. it made me chuckle, but didn't distract too much from the overall picture. cinema like this is sorely missed today, and oddly, it seems that only the british have the gumption to produce it. films like "love, actually" or "vicar of dibley" demonstrates the power and excitement for community towns, places where everyone knows everyone and we aren't afraid to be neighborly. this is more of a theme that american audiences could have more of ¬ñ more understanding of what is happening outside, instead of remaining secluded to your own events.overall, i loved "railway children". i didn't know what to expect when i first put it in the vhs player, but from the opening scene, to the exploding train set, to perks birthday, jeffries proved that he could handle the most child-friendly story with ease. his ability to make the child actors feel like real characters, to involve the adults less, and to involve the children like they were adults was outstanding. this is a film to be viewed as a strong alternative to anything disney releases. the continually occurring themes of friendship, kindness to strangers, and forgiveness blasts through the tv with grace and power. "railway children" is more than just a kid's film; it is a feature that should be a staple to modern audience viewing. not only does it give a great visual to the english countryside, but it also teaches (and shows) how life would be greater with an emphasis on imagination and courage, instead of fighting any cgi bad guys.grade: **** ¬Ω out of *****

this brings back so many childhood memories. (i'm not old, i'm 19) it's brill. the trains, the old house, the fallen runner, the really scary landslide (well it is when you're 6), the drama if the children can stop the train, or will it crash? this is a children's film without a doubt, but it offers great harmless no blood/guts/guns etc for children. and it's got bernard cribbins in it, who's cool. 8/10

what could ever happen in a dull texan town in summer? well, a bunch of teenagers find out a few things can and do happen.it turns out the mexican werewolf of this story is nothing less than el chupacabra, and the movie, unlike the name would suggest, is not a remake or lookalike of the american werewolf movies, but something completely different.overall, for an obviously low-budget movie, it's not bad! some clever camera work, quite decent looking traditional creature and gore effects, and for once not all-knowing people that can and do make mistakes, like shooting a colleague thinking it's the big bad beast, and are baffled by things they could not possibly know.sit down at this expecting a blockbuster million-dollar production, and you will turn it off in disgust after a short while. sit down at this expecting a bit of entertainment and a relatively simple story, and it's quite good! overall it gets an 8/10 from me for being creative, having ok acting, and pulling off some good work for the budget this movie had.

i saw the movie in izmir as the closing film of izmir film festival. i didn't know anything about it but right now i'm glad i didn't refuse the chance to see ding-a-ling-less! it is one of the funniest movies i've ever watched and believe me i've seen zillions of movies!! (i'm a film critic!) clever script and dialogs... smart details... what else can i say? an indie masterpiece with a totally unique style of humor... one can't stop by wonder what he's capable of right now. ding-a-ling less was shot five years ago and i'm sure the director onur tukel is more mature now. i heard that his next feature will be a political satire and i really can't wait to see that too among with his previous works like "house of pancakes"...

there are films that make careers. for george romero, it was night of the living dead; for kevin smith, clerks; for robert rodriguez, el mariachi. add to that list onur tukel's absolutely amazing ding-a-ling-less. flawless film-making, and as assured and as professional as any of the aforementioned movies. i haven't laughed this hard since i saw the full monty. (and, even then, i don't think i laughed quite this hard... so to speak.) tukel's talent is considerable: ding-a-ling-less is so chock full of double entendres that one would have to sit down with a copy of this script and do a line-by-line examination of it to fully appreciate the, uh, breadth and width of it. every shot is beautifully composed (a clear sign of a sure-handed director), and the performances all around are solid (there's none of the over-the-top scenery chewing one might've expected from a film like this). ding-a-ling-less is a film whose time has come.

am an ardent vijay fan. i have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this.it has all the regular clich√©s that one can expect from a commercial entertainer. a hero who is bad in studies but a star in his forte i.e.kabbadi. his friends to fill in the comedy quota. a heroine in a life-and-death situation. a villain, which i say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist. high octane chase and action sequences. music that can make one dance. and above all that a perfect storyline to keep all the above factors within an enjoyable circle. perfect.the director doesn't give any chance for the audience to loosen up. he just goes on from one nail on the head to the next. and one can see the lighter side of vijay in this film which he rarely executes.all said.....this movie was and will be perfect for many years to come....

when fellini committed 8 1/2 to film many commented that it was the most personal vision ever to find its perfect expression. when dante cast betrice to the flames of his undying passion many were aghast at the honest brutality of his unrequited feelings for a younger woman. when onur tukel, and a merry band of wickedly talented and misfited filmmakers--from the mecca of movie-making insanity--band together, during the course of two chilly weeks in december 2000, many commented that nothing more sophmoric had ever been committed...much less on film.well, to the doubters out there, watch this original piece and find out why the id is both a charming and powerful thing. and if that doesn't getchya, roll over and rub one out...it's probably time you did so.kudos onur on a great piece of art

man, i really enjoyed this, if only for fred willard's commentary at the dog show. there are some dead spots and some gags that don't work, but overall the film works very well. when i was younger, my parents bred dogs and the people that i met at those shows were not significantly less bizarre that the freaks at this show, i can assure you.i enjoyed this film for its artistry and for its commentary about how we tend to take frivolous things far too seriously... i enjoyed the acting for its accuracy (most of the accents were flawless) and its subtlety (i loved the way each person walked their dogs)...rent this film if you have any appreciation for the strangeness of human existence.

if you have seen the telugu version of gilli "okkadu" you will find this to be very similar in story line, but gilli has different songs and takes place in tamil nadu not andra pradesh. although this is a remake of "okkadu" you will find that vijay and trisha make this a unique film, vijay and trisha make a great pair. a few negatives were when vijays character slaps trishas character for going to buy a present for him, he never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end. good action and songs make this an all around great movie i recommend it.i give it a 10/10, one of the best i have seen.

i have to admit that i absolutely loved this movie. of course as i'm sure you know that "malcolm's in the middle" star frankie muniz, and the ever so sweet amanda bynes "the amanda show" starred in this children's comedy as two friends that i'm sure that we can all re-late to. the movie is about a boy jason shepard(frankie) and his friend kaylee(amanda)going onto an adventure in hollywood.spoilers aheadas it begins jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day life's problems. one day jason is hit by mr. wolf(the big bad director). jason's english paper is stolen by wolf and begins the adventure along with kaylee to earn his father's trust back. they fly to hollywood in search of wolf to get him back. frankie and amanda do all sorts of crazy stunts to get wolf back, and all he has to do is call jason's dad and tell him he stole his idea. but the end is no real surprise, being the good proveles and wins.the story is cute and fifth grade humored but what do you expect it's rated pg. i really belive this is one of the years best family comedies. not only is the childrens acting great, exceptional casting, well written, but it's good clean fun. it made me laugh as well as fall in love with it's innocent message. i highly reccomend it and would like to disagree with that someone who gave it a zero out of ten. the unemployed critic isn't unemployed for nothing. i give it (well i voted a ten out of ten) a perfect.

big fat liar is the best movie ever! it is funny, and cool. jason shepherd (frankie muniz) proves that he was not lying and goes to los angeles to get his paper back from marty wolf( paul giamatti). along with friend kaylee(amanda bynes), mess up his life since marty won't call jasons' dad and say he wrote the paper! yet it all turns out good and is a good movie to watch!

well it might be a kid's movie...perhaps but i'm not gonna let my kids from 9 watch it!,so the one who say it is a kid movie hmm?!,it is teenager movie i agree..,so but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very good..,so good that at the end nobody nows truth or lie.anyway it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a 8 for screen play and story ...i think they writers mend a litlle lesson whit it...''the truth is never overated''.

"five fingers of death" is a classic of 70's kung fu cinema. as the film that "broke out" hk cinema to the west, this is a must see for any serious fan of the genre. it's also a damn entertaining film, with hard-hitting, non-stop action, solid and mostly believable fight choreography and great over-the-top 70's era dubbing ("oh i see ... so you want it the hard way!! hwaa!!")."five fingers" is an eye-for-an-eye revenge tale ... and i mean literally, eye for an eye! it's great to see lo lieh portraying a hero. he played so many great villains later in his career - including pai mei in the classic fist of the white lotus, which was one of the characters tarantino used in creating the pai mei of kill bill.my only complaint is that i wish there was a better quality dvd - mine looks like it was a vhs transfer. overall this is a great film - don't miss it!bart blackstone film club - hollywood, ca

this was the very first kung fu movie that i have ever seen. the dubbing is not the greatest but alot better than some that i had seen. the plot is much better than some that are made today. it is gory at times but that is what gives it that special push. academy award material is it not. but if you like to watch fights and a decent story backround, this is for you!

this is my favourite kung fu movie. it has a very authentic flavour, seasoned by an eerie music score (of tradition chinese instruments, i think), and some wonderfully over-acted melodramatic moments contrasted by heavily affected comedy. indeed, while attempting to create their own "western" (i.e. cowboy film) genre, the chinese concocted a whole new animal, marked by kung fu fighting and its associated sound effects.the story of five fingers of death is simple, a story of revenge (for killing a loved one) and the pursuit of the main character to master the "iron-fist-technique" that will enable him to wreak holy vengeance on his enemies. there is even a love interest, though the awkward, polite kind (found in most chinese films of the period). the end result however is great and much more authentic than any bruce lee movie.

i saw five fingers at the drive-in in...what, 1973, '74? it was the the first kung-fu movie i'd ever seen and i was greatly entertained. i recently bought it on dvd and watched it again. i was greatly entertained the second time, too. i believe this is probably the one most kung-fu movies are modeled after. rival schools, different styles, revenge, "white hat" good guys and "black hat" bad guys. they even threw in the japanese (very bad guys) styles of karate and judo. i remember being amused by the dubbing dialog, along the lines of "hey you! you are a very bad guy!" and "they should not get away with this! i will have a go at this bad crowd!" this time it wasn't so distracting, i guess i'm used to it. if you have even the slightest appreciation of this genre, this is one you should see.

this film, based on the book by pascal laime' -la dentelliere- is an acclaimed film of excellent cinematography and costly italian language. set in a "scholastic" 19th century, balzac-style set, it portraits the story of a mad love story: a man and a woman. there is an infamous line at this shadowy-mussolinni strike which reads: "she does not smell like tomatoes." sage perfumery of this italian masterpiece, scola is a director of the stature of mussolinni: his cake will jump in your strawberries and if you let this director he will cream your olives as a superman. remember nietzsche? this one will scare the hell out of you: don't forget to visit mussolinni's cake next to the colisseum in rome, across the via appia. this movie will wipe your pampers inside-out and outside-in, it will make you cry out of romantic joy! if you liked ulysses, you will wipe it good with these strawberries until the end of the roll. enjoy!

a clever and bizarre angle to "beauty is in the eye of the beholder". at times you think this is campy and over the top, but the underlying poetic soul comes across strong and believable thanks to the performances of the two leads. one worth tracking down.

ettore scola's masterful rendering of this epic of the heart deserves a much wider audience. it is a worthy successor to the risorgimento classics such as vischonti's senso and il gattopardo, as well as rosselini's vanina,vanini. the 19th century is indeed a fruitful source for italian filmmakers. the period settings and trappings are beautifully realized here, but the story is timeless and could occur in any period. what is so intriguing in this story is that the hero becomes trapped in a claustrophobic situation in which he finds himself the vigorously pursued object of desire and he is quite powerless to extricate himself from the alarming circumstances. handsome and callow giorgio (giraudeau) is frustrated by his inability to visit his charming but light-minded married mistress (antonelli) and falls prey to the dangerous passion of enamored fosca (d'obici), the ugly and sickly daughter of his stern commander (girotti). the resulting anguish and ensuing tragedy this unlikely pair undergoes make them both understandable, pitiful and immensely sympathetic to viewers. bernard giraudeau's stellar performance will captivate and leave a lasting impression. not to be missed.

this is one of the few movies that was recommended to me as absolutely brilliant, that really is. if you give this movie a low note than you really missed the point. you could describe fosca as manipulative, but what if it is really serious, that she gets ill when the love she is sure of isn't answered. but what would you do when you are sure that the other one loves you, and is 'only' rejected by the fact that you are ugly. wouldn't you fight for it. at least i think it is better to fight for it that die in bitterness. and it reminds me of the fact how i, as a man, react at first sight completely on the physical ugliness of fosca and don't look further at the person she is or might be. this movie confronts me with very solemn questions about respect, trust, feeling manipulated and so on. how do i now if someone manipulates me or is just trying everything to make contact? what i think to be the most outstanding feature in this movie is that ettore scola made it absolutely believable that giorgio falls in love with fosca.

in this unlikely love triangle, set in 19th century italy, `the beauty and the beast' is being turned upside down and inside out and then some: giorgio, an army officer and the very image of male beauty, is being transferred away form his (married) lover clara and sent to a small garrison somewhere in piemont. there - initially much to his horror ¬ñ fosca, the grotesquely ugly cousin of his commander, develops an obsessive love for him. he suffers her passionate and demanding displays of affection out of pity and concern for her health (she is gravely ill), but becomes more and more fascinated by her ¬ñ until the dramatic finale¬Ödo not miss this most unusual love story, as twisted as it may sound. valeria d'obici, who deservedly won a price for her portrayal of fosca, is as alarming as she is touching. buy the video, read the book, go see the musical!
