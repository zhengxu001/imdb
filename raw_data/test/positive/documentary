the recent history of hollywood remakes of ghost/horror films from the east has been dismal. this film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or similar.it is well photographed and the sound is superb. viewing on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or dts enabled sound system is recommended. obviously it is subtitled, so if that puts you off, then i wouldn't bother with this. dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here.it is also genuinely frightening, with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to western audiences. i would particularly single out the stepmother character, who was utterly brilliant. the ending will have you wanting to watch it again, if you can cope. the plot is relentless, and offers no comforting moments of release along the way.if i do have a small criticism, there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the japanese version of the ring. we have, however, accepted straight copies of other peoples' ideas for western films for years, and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 10/10. i believe most fans of this genre will derive huge "pleasure" from this film which i for one hope goes down as a classic.

'a tale of two sisters', or 'janghwa, hongryeon', is a true masterpiece. brilliant psychological thriller, heart-wrenching drama, and gripping horror all wrapped up in one beautifully orchestrated package. from the intricate plot, to the beautiful cinematography, to the absolutely perfect casting, every aspect of this film is extraordinary.for fear of revealing too much concerning the plot, i will just say it is very satisfying. while it may appear to be a little difficult to understand at first, it does a good job of explaining things in the end. and whether you prefer psychological thriller, drama, or horror, i promise you will not be disappointed.from a technical standpoint, its nearly flawless. the set, the cinematography, lighting, and especially the soundtrack, all are captivating. the waltz seemed an odd choice at first, but proved to be an ingenious choice.as for the casting, we're talking absolute perfection. i'm su-jeong is totally convincing as the defiant, yet troubled su-mi. mun keun- yeong is equally convincing as her emotionally traumatized sister su-yeon. these two girls were magical on the screen. i will certainly be looking into their other films. yeom jeong-ah is deceitfully cheerful and hauntingly evil as the stepmother. finally, kap-su kim gives an excellent performance as the weary, broken father.i truly love this film. if you have yet to see 'a tale of two sisters', i strongly recommend locating a copy. it is a real gem, worthy of anyone's collection.(10/10)

this movie was an excellent acted, excellent directed and overall had an excellent story. ive had real life experiance with a boy like 'radio'. at the football program in my town, weve had a mentally challenged boy every year practice, travel, and have fun with the football team. this movie is really true and i can identify with it 100%. a boy like 'radio' just needs to feel like they belong to something; they need to feel like their life is worth living. thats how 'radio' feels and thats why that type of program is set up at my high school. this is a very touching movie that im glad has been brought to the big screen. my dad and i loved it and i will always remember this for being a movie that tells a riveting story of the goodness and kindness of man!

call it manipulative drivel if you will, but i fell for it. sure, there could have been more character development. yeah, there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant "movie of the week" score, but ed harris was impeccable, cuba gooding adorable and touching, and let's face it people, in real life, how many of us really get to know the motivation of others. not many. we did get a little glimpse into the coach's motivation (a very provocative dialog in my opinion, not to be soon forgotten) so in my opinion, this was a lovely tribute to one human being who broke out of his "comfort zone" to reach out to another human being, and in the mean time, touched the lives hundreds more. a lesson we all need to me reminded of. why is it that the right thing to do is so often the hardest thing to do? i recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart. you won't be disappointed. and bring your kleenex. 8/10

this movie is amazing. you will never laugh harder. it's a target. no, i think it's...yes it's...a boob! this movie gets funnier by the second--like when jackie chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene. this movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha! congrats if you buy or rent this. you'll never return it, in my opinion. i didn't, and i haven't found it in a store since. i watched this movie once and i was forever in love with kung-fu action flicks. if you're looking for an amazing film in the realm of great production value, good or even mediocre acting, and good special effects...this is not that movie. if you're looking for laughs and timeless wonderment, pick this up for a dollar and you'll probably never let it go. with friends, popcorn and drinks, it's the perfect evening.

the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to- due, in no small part, to john woo's masterful direction, coupled with kat's superb cinematography: some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental; there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art-house film. both james tien and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate. tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad. it's a role reversal the likes of which i don't think i've ever seen before (tien normally played a hero and, in fact, with his moustache, i didn't even recognize him at first). sammo's goofy "buck teeth" only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed; that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable- in a villain you love to hate kind of way. his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic. jackie chan appears briefly (early on and late in the going) as a blacksmith, and i believe i actually glimpsed yuen biao somewhere along the way. tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent.

the hand of death aka countdown in kung fu (1976) is a vastly underrated early work by director john woo. the film stars dorian tan (tan tao-liang) and features jackie chan, sammo hung and james tien in significant supporting roles. many people believe, or have been lead to believe by deceptive advertising, that this is a jackie chan film. this is not a jackie chan film, dorian tan is the star but jackie gives one of his best (most serious) early performances.the hand of death is about a shaolin disciple named yunfei (tan) who is sent on a mission to assassinate a shaolin traitor named shih xiaofeng (tien) and protect a revolutionary named zhang yi (woo). along his journey yunfei meets up with a young woodcutter named tan (chan) and a disgraced sword fighter (chang chung) known as "the wanderer." both men have suffered at the hands of shih and want to take revenge. the three team up to defeat shih and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety.the martial arts action is above average under the direction of sammo hung. dorian tan uses his trademark high kicks very effectively as the "northern eighteen styles kicks" along with some "southern five styles boxing." sammo hung and jackie chan provide excellent martial arts performances as well. james tien is not the greatest martial artist on the jade screen but does an acceptable job. some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem over choreographed but the final showdowns featuring chan, tan and hung are very good.director john woo provides plenty of interesting character development in the film, which is refreshing. the cinematography by leung wing kat is very stylish, unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era. joseph koo's music: a combination of soft flutes and 70's "shaft" style orchestral pieces is kung fu cinema at its best. hand of death is not jackie and sammo's usual kung fu comedy. hand of death is a serious, straightforward revenge driven story.hand of death aka countdown in kung fu is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre. the film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things to come from jackie chan and sammo hung. hung's great choreography is put on display here before his directorial debut and chan's early charisma and talent can be clearly seen.hand of death is a solid, stylish old school kung fu film and a brilliant early work of the legendary john woo.kung fu genre rating 7.5/10 wanderer to tan (referring to his new weapon): "the little eagle wing god lance." tan: "just a knickknack."

this film reminds me very much of the later rock hudson film man's favorite sport--about a fishing writer who has never fished and is forced into entering a fishing tournament. in this case, barbara stanwyck is a martha stewart-like writer who can't cook and doesn't really have the perfect family she describes in her articles--in fact, she has no family at all. well, like rock, she is maneuvered into performing--in this case, creating a huge holiday dinner while vacationing in the countryside. since there is no family, she takes home a veteran and a few friends and tried desperately not to "let the cat out of the bag" that she can't do any of the things she is known for doing. a cute little comedy and a welcome film to the annual holiday film lineup.

add this little gem to your list of holiday regulars. it issweet, funny, and endearing

this is a delightful, they-don't-make-em-like-this-anymore kind of film. well performed by everyone and peopled with interesting character actors. an intelligent, witty script acted with the right blend of broad comedy and understated humor. holds up for repeated (annual?) viewings.**warning** the re-make of this film with the same name, directed by arnold whatwashethinking, is an unbearable mess - painful to watch - without a scintilla of the charm and wit of the original.

"christmas in connecticut" is a gem of a christmas movie classic. while lesser known than some others -- it is nonetheless a delightful way to spend an evening at holiday time. i watch it every year.barbara stanwyck is perfectly cast as, elizabeth lane, the single, career girl. way before it was popular, stanwyck embodies the single girl on the rise. her nyc apartment, and her friendly "uncle" restaurateur around the corner typify the single girl in the city existence. she can't cook yet she writes a homemaking column for a magazine!dennis morgan is also perfectly cast as our wartime hero, jefferson jones, who wants to meet the amazing elizabeth lane. after being lost at sea, all he wants is to spend christmas in a "real" home. which sets up the delightful, madcap story that evolves. it is fun from beginning to end. we should all have an uncle felix too!

"christmas in connecticut" is an absolute gem, and a must-see for christmas! elizabeth lane, a precursor to martha stewart, is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakers--the perfect wife, mother, and domestic goddess. only thing is, she is none of these things--a total phony. unfortunately for her, she is about to be found out. her publisher, mr. alexander yardley (a brilliant comic turn by sydney greenstreet) gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to elizabeth's "perfect farm" for the christmas holiday. only thing, there is no farm, "perfect" or otherwise. the comedy involves how elizabeth is to keep her real identity under wraps so she will not lose her job. elizabeth's colleague, john, happens to have a farm in connecticut, so that solves that problem. however, he wants to marry liz, but she does not want to marry him. he offers her marriage, though he knows she doesn't feel the same way about him that he does about her. he makes the offer anyway, and assures her that he is willing to wait. and here barbara stanwyck, as liz, delivers one of the most devastating put-downs i have ever heard. with perfect innocence, she replies: "could you wait that long?" ouch! in addition, the scenes between una o'conner and s.z. sakall are hilarious. they don't seem to like one another (though one suspects they really do). they are rivals in the household, and s.z. sakall's mangled english is equaled by nora's strangled pronunciation of his name ("mr. basternook"). "my name is felix!" it is amazing how christmas-y these black and white films are. great character work by all involved. don't miss this one!

stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility. the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character. yardley is the modern equivalent of dickens' scrooge in the way he exercizes control over his employees -- until the christmas spirit overtakes him. the role is a 'walk in the park' for greenstreet who had been one of the stage's great falstaffs when he was part of the lunts' company. greenstreet had only entered films five years earlier when, at age 61, he was featured in what was to become a film classic, the first and best film john huston ever directed: 'the maltese falcon'. 'cuddles' sakall was probably never better in his traditional role as the embodiment of middle european gemutlicheit. the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.

after reading a biography on the last russian tzar (nicholas ii), and his failure to secure the army's support, i decided to give this film a try.i watched it with a completely open mind, not knowing anything about it (except its reputation).these are the things that impressed me the most.1) the shots of battleships, and the soldiers used as extras. more than once i stopped to think "if this was done in this time and place, 80% of this would have been computer-generated".2) the realism in it. from the maggot-infested meat to the shot of the sailor with his candle and the legend "killed for a bowl of soup", this movie makes no concessions to the pc cause (which, thankfully, hadn't been invented yet).3) the slow descent into madness of the odessa steps sequence. from the first shot, when the limbless man appears, you get the idea something might be wrong; since the overall shots are composed, though, you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings. then an amputee appears, and people start falling in dramatic poses. still, the shots are composed... until the cossacks appear into scene, and the incredible shot juxtapositions appear. this scene is easily worth the price of admission.4) the fact that this movie is 100% unadulterated propaganda. then again, when rambo fought in afghanistan he also was having something to do with "propaganda"; only a different kind.overall: a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative. nevertheless, metropolis, the cabinet of dr. caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive, edgy movies that are still remembered for their merits today. they really make modern movies look boring and repetitive.

have wanted to see this for a while: i never thought i'd be watching it in a damp trafalgar square, london with 15,000 other people and all to a new score by the pet shop boys.quickly, that experience specifically. a new departure from psb, it seemed to suffer from the same problem the miniaturist hugo wolf had when he wrote his opera der corregidor: the long structure was a chain of short ones, i.e. songs. psb produced a more fluid, integrated score although it was quite static on its own terms. neither could they resist song: a setting of the subtitled text worked in this respect a free standing meditation on the action of the odessa steps massacre during the action of that sequence itself was, i'd go so far to say, counterproductive. overall it was very exciting though, which is surely what eisenstein was trying to achieve.it is a very exciting film with choppier editing taking the place of acceleration of tension or action. in fact the film, though beautifully shot and passionately acted (it has a silent film melodrama, but not in the excess of the hollywood comic style) breathes through its careful editing pacing specific shots with a sense of the rate at which the audience will take them in. and there's a huge range of perspective too; either he had a lot of cameras or the sequences on the harbor and steps took a great deal of time.super film, which can be assessed irrespective of sound, as that's how the finished product would have been conceived. 8/10

the famous closeup of their breakfast meat, crawling with maggots still is recorded by fire in my neurons or the wind filling the right places of the sails, the fog better than carpenter's the fog cos is the real terror bursting out from human history instead of pirates ghosts. but , i tell ya' something: not even the magnificent scene in homenage performed by brian di palma with the excellent music of ennio morricone in the untochables (filmed in slow motion)can equal the effect of the original masterpiece of the crowd climbing down the ladders. we see not merely the baby stroller but i remember the hand of a baby stepped by militar boot, someone with no feet escaping at the last minute, someone wearing glasses (then a cut edition) and then the same glasses broken by a bullet that passed through....mini stories in a single scene.

/*may contain spoilers, but of course it does not matter :) */battleship potemkin is one stunning spectacle of haunting images. the visual direction is (well, and has been) inspiring, the sheer scale of the film is impressive, and the technique is certainly pioneering. what is really amazing is, to my mind, the depth and effectiveness of a film, devoid of proper literary script, sound (save the soundtrack), decent image quality, the faux-profound (self-)referentialism of today, exceptional acting, pretense, etc. what you get is a purely visual experience to be remembered.btw, the previous poster noted: "eisenstien felt after a lot of suffering to give the heroes what they wanted. the problem is that you think eisenstein is building up to a big final fight and then he tricks you. it's a little cheap. i would've rather seen a huge final action scene."i must warn you, that the end is not cheap, and eisenstein wasn't being generous to the heroes. history, however, was. potemkin really did go through the squadron as it was shown in the film.finally, i'd strongly recommend seeing battleship potemkin to anyone more or less seriously interested in cinema. see it with a fellow movie buff, it kept me talking for hours. however, if you tend to consider films, generally accepted as "great" or "classic", to be "slow" or "boring", this film might not be for you yet. not much cheap entertainment here.for me though, it is a full 10/10.

the marriage of an upscale new york city couple with child falls apart when the wife wants out ("it took a lot of courage for her to walk out that door!" a neighbor tells us); the busy, distracted husband takes on the "motherly" responsibilities and grows closer to his son, but soon the wife returns. highly manipulative picture doesn't give us a very realistic familial unit (with young justin henry certainly not resembling the product of a marriage between dustin hoffman and meryl streep!), but the dynamics are intriguing and involving, and director robert benton keeps the pace popping with lots of cleverness, marvelous classical music, canny editing and surefire bits of humor. streep's character is designed to be a cold, self-centered witch, but i was ready to feel a lot more for her than benton probably wanted. it all has to be painted in terms of black and white, good and bad, with hoffman learning how hard his wife had it and getting a second chance at being a good parent. the film never falters from its preconceived path, and very fine acting nearly saves it, but i'm not sure where benton was steering the film in the final act, and the closing scene is awfully abrupt. *** from ****

no, this has nothing to do with the sitcom "seinfeld" or its eccentric and hilarious character cosmo kramer. in reality, "kramer vs. kramer" is a fine drama movie, without a doubt one of the finest of its kind and one of the greatest movies ever. i'm glad that it won more oscars than "apocalypse now" because it really deserved such glory."kramer vs. kramer" is an excellent film, so well made and so perfectly balanced that i wouldn't change anything about it in any way. there is nothing wrong with the film. it's film-making of the highest quality. and it stands the test of time, too. not only it doesn't look any dated, but also its cultural impact is long-lasting and its realistic story remains just as significant as it was when it came out in 1979. a timeless classic. they don't make movies like this today.this movie is dramatic, realistic, simple but brilliant, intense, powerful, sweet and even tragic and depressing sometimes. yet, it has fine humor as well. it has no special effects, but who cares? this is not the movie or place to discuss such thing. for a movie like this, such thing would be pointless and absolutely unnecessary.the story is very interesting. the actors's chemistry is just perfect. all of the actors are great, but the 3 main ones are the very best. dustin hoffman, a brilliant actor, has his greatest performance ever here as the lovable but distant workaholic ted kramer. meryl streep is great as ted's wife, joanna. and cute little justin henry is terrific as the loving but sometimes stubborn billy, son of ted and joanna.the soundtrack is all instrumental and wonderful. the opening song (by the guitarist frederic hand) is brilliant. the rest of the soundtrack is mostly antonio vivaldi's classical music and is simply dazzling.this motion picture has also an incredible development of the characters. see the character ted kramer: a workaholic who becomes an amazing father after being left with no choice but to take care of his son, trying to adjust these new responsibilities with his job after being left by his wife joanna. with this, ted learns about the most beautiful things in life, but also realizes how though life is, with the problems in his job and the return of joanna, who wants the custody of their son. but even joanna changes for better and the ending is an unexpected surprise when one sees this for the first time.this movie has also some though things, such as courtroom scenes where both ted and joanna face brutal character assassinations unleashed by the lawyers. another though thing to see is when poor billy falls off a jungle gym with his toy (a plane) and gets seriously injured on his face. but then again, the scene is very well made and what comes next is very intense: his father runs quickly and crosses numerous blocks, ignoring the traffic to take his son to the hospital.overall, this is a movie which is a good lesson of life.this should definitely be on top 250.

i think not! i mean yeah if you compare this film to the godfather, or maybe a little older film like casablanca, or maybe even a little newer film like the english patient. it doesn't have the camera work or the cinematography like these other films, but that doesn't mean that this is a bad movie, or does it? i think the reason why this film is underrated is because a lot of people always compare it to other great oscar winning films (you should never do that) which makes it hard to understand the beauty and the realism in this movie. in the categories best picture, best actor in a leading role and best actress in a supporting role, this film really deserved all of them. the magnificent dustin hoffman gives us, once again, one of his best performances. a couple of times in this movie i forgot that it wasn't his son because it was just so real! i have never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play that specific role but still so beautiful. so dustin hoffman passes the test with flying colors, in my opinion. there are a few actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best: katherine hepburn, meryl streep, jane fonda and ingrid bergman (i can't help it, i think she's great). meryl streep, even though she's in a supporting role, is amazing and real and you just can't help but being drawn ed to her talent and the way she makes it hers and real. wow, that's all i can say. justin henry was great considering his age, his tears and his relationship with his mom and dad was beautiful, so i say good job to cute little justin henry. while i was watching this film for like the third time, alone, i couldn't stop crying. i tried but i couldn't. thank god i was alone! this is probably the purest film i have ever seen. other films that were nominated for best picture was apocalypse now, norma rae, breaking away and all that jazz. i'm ashamed, cause i haven't seen any of them, but from what i've heard, apocalypse now is great but when i heard about norma rae i only thought of sally field. i think that considering the other nominees, this film deserved it's five oscars, and that it'll continue to touch and make other people cry for a long time in the future, just like it has for the past 28 years. good job all the actors and actresses in this film for giving us great performances and memories from watching this film that we won't ever forget.thanks for your time.

i consider myself lucky that i got to view a wonderful movie with two marvelous actors. "kramer vs. kramer" was great to me because i think i could relate to it.unfortunately, my parents are divorced. even though i was older than billy in this movie, i felt his pain and confusion. having two parents who you thought were happy and end up hating each other is the worst. through this movie, actually, i think it made me realize that my parents are people too, and they had as just much pain as my sister and i had.back to the movie, this was a good one. yes, it's dated and meryl and dustin are very young. but i would recommend this for a lot of people, because i think most can relate in some way. there are funny, sad, happy, and relieving moments that are carried away terrificly by these great actors. it's a good movie and deserves more credit than a 7.5.9/10

after a decade of turbulent unrest, american movies began to switch gears and turn their cameras away from war-torn battlefields, political corruption, and general social unease to the more intimate world of family dysfunction. the toll the selfish baby boomers began to take on the american family as they grew up and had kids of their own was making itself felt."kramer vs. kramer" is one of the first of these dysfunctional family dramas that would continue to be so popular throughout the 1980s, and it's one of the best. it gets a rather bum rap now, because it's known as the film that beat "apocalypse now" for the 1979 best picture academy award, but comparing these two films is like comparing a banana to a marinated chicken breast: they're not remotely the same, but can't we enjoy them both? director/writer robert benton doesn't try to do anything fancy with his movie; its strength lies in its performances, those of dustin hoffman and meryl streep particularly, playing a divorced couple fighting childishly and selfishly over their son. the courtroom scene in which they duke it out for custody, and in which each is forced to hurt the other in terrible ways, is devastating, and feels authentic. the movie doesn't present hoffman's solid dad as a hero, or streep's straying mom as a villain. they're neither good or bad as people -- they're simply bad at being married.the film is tear-jerky at the finale, but not in a manipulative way. it earns its right to elicit sobs.grade: a

kramer vs. kramer is one film to hold on too and not forget. it isn't one of the most popular films ever made and is certainly one of the weakest best picture films, but it does not mean it still isn't important. i thought the movie was well done and made you just want to watch more and more of it. the performances were the best positive for the film and dustin hoffman played one of his best roles he's ever done as the lonely workaholic who has to take care of his son, as his wife separates from him. billy, who is hoffman's son, played another great performance along with meryl streep, playing the depressed mother of billy. kramer vs. kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect 10, but it succeeds in making the film worth watching and worth caring about it. certainly, one of hoffman's best films he's ever done. i highly recommend it.hedeen's outlook: 9/10 ***+ a-

although credit should have been given to dr. seuess for stealing the story-line of "horton hatches the egg", this was a fine film. it touched both the emotions and the intellect. due especially to the incredible performance of seven year old justin henry and a script that was sympathetic to each character (and each one's predicament), the thought provoking elements linger long after the tear jerking ones are over. overall, superior acting from a solid cast, excellent directing, and a very powerful script. the right touches of humor throughout help keep a "heavy" subject from becoming tedious or difficult to sit through. lastly, this film stands the test of time and seems in no way dated, decades after it was released.

this outstanding film has about the best acting that you'll ever see, and that alone makes this a must-see. the entire cast is excellent, but then again, it had to be in order to keep up with dustin hoffman and meryl streep. it didn't take me long to get hooked on this film, and aside from a courtroom scene that is merely good, this is top-notch entertainment. this is a rare film that actually deserved all the oscar recognition that it received. see it for yourself and you will definitely not be disappointed.

"kramer vs. kramer" is a terrific drama about an unhappy woman who walks out on her husband and young son. the husband now has to take up the responsibilities of taking care of the boy. as he does, they get to know each other better. but then, the mother and wife returns, and she wants custody of the boy. "kramer vs. kramer" has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure. dustin hoffman won his first best actor oscar for his brilliant performance here. most people say his performance in "rainman", which won him his second oscar, is his best. he was great in that film, but i disagree that its his best. in my opinion, the best performance of hoffman's career is in this movie. scene after scene shows us why hoffman is one of the best american actors working today. he's also funny at times. also giving a terrific performance is meryl streep, who wasn't as well known when she made this film like she is today. streep, like hoffman, also won her first oscar (for best supporting actress) for her work in "kramer vs. kramer" as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family. justin henry, who was only 8 years old when the film came out, is wonderful as hoffman and streep's son. he won an oscar nomination for his role here, and still to this day he is the youngest performer to receive an oscar nomination in a competitive category (best supporting actor). jane alexander is also fine as a conserned family friend. she too got an oscar nomination (for supporting actress where she lost to co-star streep). "kramer vs. kramer" is a great film from start to finish. writer-director robert benton has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable. **** (out of four)

i hate to say it, but i really do think this one's overrated, and i love jackie's films. it's got more plot behind it than usual, but unfortunately, though it has some great stuff, i find it to be a bit slow. all in all, i say it's entertaining, but not great.

hi! being able to speak cantonese, i found this very funny and was able to all the jokes that one might not get due to language barriers. the fight scenes are spectacular and it's a good movie. however, i have my criticisms. first of all, i find that it is not as good as the first one project a -go and see that now! :-) reason is, spoilers ahead-don't read on if you haven't seen the film!!!!!) because in project a, jackie ends by fighting his enemy; the man he is sent to kill, sanpao. that is what he has been striving to do all the film and the showdown is spectacular. but in a ii, hough he fights chan, the showdown scene between jackie and his nemesis is not long enough and the bulk of the action is against the empress's men. they are not nearly as "bad" enough and have only played a minor part in the film in relation to jackie so though their fight sequence is spectacular, they are not the ones jackie is hunting throughout the whole of the film, so thus leaving the viewer slightly unfulfilled. however, this is just my humble opinion so don't take it word for word-go and see it yourself! it is a great film in it's own right! take care and hope your admiration for jackie grows! yours sincerely, ian ps. you know the police chief in a ii? he's the same guy in first strike-nice to know he's still going strong!

sequels are a capricious lot with most nowhere near the stature of the original. sometimes you find a sequel that is considered better than the original, some critics (such as john charles) have stated that project a2 is better than the original, i disagree somewhat but this movie is still a worthwhile follow-up and fits well in the output of brilliant hong kong action cinema in the 1980s as well as jackie's own oeuvre. i do wonder how with such an awesome release of great films that his later films were not as good. he only has directed two films in the 1990s and none past that, but he has had much clout in many of the films where he is not officially the director.earlier in 1987 jackie had brain surgery following a disastrous fall in the filming of armour of god. this encouraged him to work on his next film close to home. this did not encourage him to stop risking his life and his stunt team for our amusement. what resulted is a smash hit at home that eclipsed the original in box office tallies (31 million hk dollars compared to 19 million for the original).jackie chan is once again police officer extraordinaire dragon ma and he is ordered to work with "three wan" superintendent chun (lam wai, royal warriors) who is the only chinese police officer allowed to have a gun yet is thought to be staging arrests to make himself look better and ignoring the crimes of a triad lord named tiger au (michael chan wai-man, dragon lord). apparently chun has too much power to be taken down directly, but he is relieved of the sai wan district (now he is "two wan") which dragon ma takes over. this inefficient and corrupt office will soon get a makeover and there is a great scene where three officers, who do not know who they are dealing with, attempt to assault ma to teach him a lesson about complaining about police officers. he soon has that district ship-shape and tiger au taken care of. the fight choreography and stunts with tiger and his men are quite awesome. my favorite stunt was a beautifully brutal fall from the second floor into a large vase and that vase did not appear to be soft.meanwhile a couple of subplots are happening. there are pirates who have survived from the first film who are looking for revenge and food. then there are revolutionaries including maggie (maggie cheung, in the mood for love) and (rosamund kwan, casino raiders) who are trying to raise funds for dr. sun yat-sen to overthrow the qing government as well as government operatives who are trying to find these rebels. throw in a mixture of corrupt hong kong and british cops as well as legitimate ones and you have a stew that is getting a bit too many ingredients, but yet still seems to coalesce. this works well when there is a marx brothers influenced scene (the marx brothers have done this type of scene a few times with the cocoanuts (1929) being the first) at maggie's place where everyone is looking for someone while hiding from someone else. many weeks were spent on this scene alone and the effort certainly shows.there are several faults with the film. there is a certain didactic nature that creeps in the film that seems a bit out-of-place  especially one small speech towards the end that jackie gives when dealing with the mainland revolutionaries and the extremely easy conversion of the pirates that survived from the first film. female characters are once again underused and under-appreciated, especially maggie cheung. i was not as satisfied with the continuance of the plot as much as the first film either. the individual scenes dominate my feelings for the film instead of thinking of this movie as a cohesive whole. i do not fault the film for not being able to have sammo hung and yuen biao like the first though (i have heard the main reason behind this was that those two were filming eastern condors, but i do wonder if jackie could have waited a small while to get them to perform in this  they would work together for the last time the following year in dragons forever), but they are missed.i found this to be quite an enjoyable and well-made film and it is rightfully regarded as one of the better comedic action films of the 1980s. this film is also quite good in a few unexpected places. the art direction is superb (eddie ma poon-chiu), the costumes are exquisite, the cinematography is good and the movie looks quite authentic. but the stunts, comedy and the action is what i remember this film for. there is a chase involving a handcuffed dragon and chun that is superb (part of the axe throwing scene would be used in shanghai noon). the last twenty minutes is full of awe-inspiring hits, falls, chili-peppers as a mouth-mace (jackie writes in his autobiography about how he used real peppers in this scene; you can see him in a lot of mouth pain during the outtakes at the end) and is a worthy conclusion to this movie. the most famous stunt from this sequence is his homage to buster keaton from steamboat bill jr. (1928) with the exception that there is no hole and only a weak section where his head pops through.fans of jackie and/or hong kong action cinema should consider this a must own and watch. i certainly do.

dragon ma (jackie chan)is back, having rid the seas of the dreaded pirate lo. back on land, he is assigned to the police force, where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb. along the way, he is caught up in the fate of several chinese patriots attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause. the chinese manchu government is after these revolutionaries, and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble, even if they are in the police force. i had big expectations for this movie after i saw project a. but sadly i was a little disappointed. there is just too little action compared to the first film. there is just one good fight scene until the big ending. that fight scene is in the "gangsters place" and its good, a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw. jackie chan and his stunt team don't disappoint here at all. the ending is very entertaining, jackie chan shows us why he is the best stuntman in the world. really exciting stuff! the only bad thing with the ending, is that the fights are too short and forgettable. conclusion: many funny moments, good acting and crazy stunts. but not enough fighting for a top rating.

project a ii is a classic jackie chan movie with all the kung fu, crazy stunts and slapstick humor you expect. not as good as the prequel but still it is a great movie if you just want something fun to watch. the story is simple, jackie chan versus the evil men. so if you want a movie that you don't have to be a braniac to understand, i would suggest this one.

i honestly dont know why so many people hate this movie, i have always thought that it was one of my absolute faves. the fight with tiger and his men rocked, the fight with the pirates with the axes rocked, the whole skit with everyone trying to avoid one another in the house is pure genious...ok so it didnt have the requisite kick ass final confrontation but the manchus were pretty good. i give it a 8/10.

this production was quite a surprise for me. i absolutely love obscure early 30s movies, but i wasn't prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story. if, by any chance, you're not convinced in the first half, hang in there for the finale. of course, you must look at the blatant racism as being purely topical. a fascinating viewing experience, but i think the cat's paw is not available on video/dvd yet. watch your pbs listings!

this film would be considered controversial today, but is still very funny. the racial stereotyping is done from the view of humor & not hate. this film strips off & shows how corrupt politicians already were in the early 1930's. this film proves it started before the 1970's & beyond when it has accelerated in the united states. lloyd is still in his typical genre here, even though his character was raised in china. the meaning of a cat's paw in this instance is a person who is running for political office but is being used by the established political machine to advance their agenda. in other words, they think this guy (lloyd)is harmless when he runs for office. then when he gets elected, he surprises them.this same theme is used later in james stewarts film mr. smith goes to washington. stewarts is more famous & has a stronger message. this film is more clever & subtle which are harold lloyds trademarks. there is still the heart of romantic comedy hidden with the facade of the movie but today's mainstream audiences would still appreciate the political humor & the ending is absolutely priceless. i wish someone could beat today's political system in this way. i was surprised how much i enjoyed this film & find myself wishing harold had done more like it during the 1930's. at least we have this one. i think the person who is quoted most in the movie is fictional ling po. i always thought confusicus was the wise one but this one makes me believe the wisdom of china was not limited to him & is a vast field of comedy lloyd mined in this movie.

i really enjoyed this old black and white talkie. at first i didn't recognize harold lloyd as mr. cobb, a missionary to china coming home to find a wife. there were many twists and turns in mr. cobb's attempts to clean up city hall. his methods of making the punishment fit the crime would likely be illegal, but this is not a movie based on reality. this would be a perfect movie for children except that there is female near nudity (pasties only on grace bradley)! the old telephones are enchanting. the only fault is a problem typical of the day - caucasians are used to represent chinese men. this is offset by the positive way the chinese are portrayed. they are the wise, good and friendly guys. trivia - a bekins truck appears in the movie when the police run out of black marias.

for those of you looking for the crazy stunts that typified a harold lloyd silent comedy, this is not the film for you. what the cat's-paw gives us is an interesting and atypical character for lloyd who was trying to establish himself in sound.for me the closest movie comparison to lloyd's character is that of peter sellers in being there. for all the education that lloyd has received in dealing with the world, he might as well have been brought up in isolation as sellers was.but where he was brought up was as a missionary's child in china and i don't know how much christianity he and his family were able to teach the chinese, but young harold has learned the wisdom of chinese philosopher lin po whom he quotes constantly like a fortune cookie aphorism. as it turns out lin po turns out to be one wise dude.anyway lloyd's father samuel s. hinds has decided his son needs some education in the modern world of 20th century america and he sends him back to be the guest of the pastor of the home church which sponsors the mission. the pastor there is the perennial candidate of the 'reform' movement of that town of stockport. but no sooner does lloyd arrive and the pastor dies.now the reform movement is a sham and the pastor a patsy of the political bosses who need a straw-man opponent in every election. they decide lloyd just might be a better patsy than the guy who just died.of course as it goes in these type of films the patsy proves to be not so easy a proposition. in fact lloyd constantly quoting from lin po, the way charlie chan used to dispense wisdom proves quite the adversary for the crooks who run stockport. in addition lloyd gains the admiration of una merkel, as cynical a dame as jean arthur was in mr. deeds and mr. smith. the cat's-paw is still a nice political satire though it did not establish harold lloyd as big a comedy name as he was in silent films. a nice cast of players was selected by director sam taylor topped by george barbier who plays a political boss who discovers lloyd and actually proves to have a streak of honesty in him.

this movie caught me by surprise. for years i have avoided many of harold lloyd's sound pictures (as well as those of keaton) because they have a generally well-deserved reputation for being lousy compared to the silent films because the basic formula has been lost. however, when i saw this film i was pleasantly surprised to find i actually liked it,...once i accepted it really was not a "harold lloyd" film (despite him starring in it). this is because although it is nothing like the style of his earlier films, it is highly original and lloyd isn't bad playing a totally different type of character.as i mentioned above, the formula of the old films is almost completely missing here. lloyd does not do the old familiar stunt work, the romance is quite unlike his early screen romances, and the plot is just plain weird! instead of the usual roles, he is the son of a chinese missionary who returns to america for the first time since he was a small boy. because of this, though he looks like an american (except for his white suit and explorer's helmet), he thinks and acts a lot like someone who is chinese. in many ways, he's very naive about america and is like an innocent among wolves. early on, he meets a man who turns out to be a local party boss. this boss always produces a losing candidate for the mayoral race--because he is bought and paid for by the corrupt mayor to produce a "token" candidate who has no chance of winning. well, the old geezer who they traditionally run for office just died and he decides to run the naive lloyd--he hasn't a prayer of winning! well, the unthinkable happens and lloyd wins!!! this, and lloyd's decision to clean up the town greatly upsets the old political machine and they stop at nothing to destroy honest lloyd. just when it appears lloyd is headed to jail on a trumped up corruption charge, he creates a scheme that is 100% impossible and very illegal to get signed confessions from the crooks. however, despite this, it is incredibly funny and a great ending. so, my advice is at the end, just suspend disbelief and enjoy.an important note: this movie is definitely not politically correct. the word "chink" is used repeatedly. i found it offensive but considering the times, i ignored it as you should too. if, however, you are someone who can't and like being angry, i suggest you never watch movies anyway--as you are bound to become offended again and again.

as a harold lloyd fan, i agree with the other reviewer's comments, except that i feel that "movie crazy" was his best sound film; "cat's paw" is a close second. (but, this is just my opinion).this film is a "hoot" from beginning to end and, in many scenes, george barbier (the crook that gets him elected mayor) almost steals the show! (especially at the end of the film).one wishes that una merkel's character would be a bit more sympathetic to harold, especially as the film progresses. only in the last few minutes of the film do we find out her true feelings for him. (and, even then, there is no "romance" - kissing, etc).this is a must-see film!

what is often neglected about harold lloyd is that he was an actor. unlike chaplin and keaton, lloyd didn't have the vaudeville/music hall background and he wasn't a natural comedian. he came to hollywood to act; and he discovered he had a knack for acting funny -- first in shorts, then in features. he made a name for himself as "lonesome luke", a chaplin knock-off; with the "glasses character" that made him the all-american boy rather than a grotesque, lloyd found his stride and his movies became some of the best produced during the silent era.he developed a reputation as a "daredevil" in some shorts, and retained this in some of his best movies ("safety last", "for heaven's sake", "girl shy"). he was more popular than either chaplin or keaton during the twenties and he became very rich before the advent of sound.the first sound movies were often disasters. to get the most out of their "sound", too much dialog was used in many movies.lloyd's acting skills were, after two decades, geared for silents. he didn't have a bad voice; its high pitch suited his "glasses" character. and his sound films weren't the unqualified disasters of legend. yet silent movies had been raised to a high art (especially lloyd's, which did not stint on budget and were extremely well-crafted); with the introduction of talkies movies had to learn to walk again and they made some missteps.though he tried to move with the times and embraced sound, lloyd's best bits from his early (overly talky) talkies were still visual -- such as the scene in "movie crazy" where he appears to be riding in a swank car, but actually "hitched a ride" on his bicycle.trying to recapture the daredevil antics that made him famous, as he did in "feet first", was misstep. (in "safety last", his best movie and the one that, deservedly or not, shoved lloyd in the box as a "daredevil comic", he played a determined young man, climbing to the top. "safety last" had a natural structure that ascended to his character's scaling the side of the building. he was obviously afraid, but his fear added to the humor. in "feet first", he arrived in a precarious building-scaling position by accident; his frantic cries for help detracted from the humor. his character was pathetic and cringing, aspiration to save his neck -- possibly an accurate statement of the 1930s, but not amusing).harold lloyd was not mired in the past, like some wacky norma desmond. he embraced sound and tried to take his movies in different directions, growing and changing with the industry. when "feet first" failed he left the daredevil business and made a satire on the talking movie industry, "movie crazy". just as he had to flounder through many movies as "lonesome luke" before carving his place in movie history with the glasses character, he had tried several directions in sound movies before hitting his stride in sound, which he did with "the catspaw".in "the catspaw" he plays a missionary's son reared in china who unwittingly gets elected mayor as a front for corrupt political interests. when he finds out the truth, he sets himself the task of cleaning up the town. only in his early forties, lloyd could still act the brash young man.yet "the catspaw" was another box-office failure, and lloyd made only three more movies, including "the milky way". of his chief competitors, chaplin still had silent movies in him and keaton was hopelessly mismanaged. "the catspaw" and "the milky way" suggest lloyd might have mastered sound comedy if he had been a little younger, or if audiences had given him the benefit of the doubt after his early sound fiascoes.though the movie has been unfairly maligned about the way lloyd's character cleaned up the town, it suits him. from his days in "shorts" lloyd wanted to scare his audience, and the climax of "the catspaw" achieved it yet again, in a surprising way; until the trick is revealed it appears gruesome, and then come the laughs.viewed as a product of its time, "the catspaw" is charming and funny. a very well-written sound comedy, well-acted by lloyd. directed by sam taylor, its curious blend of drama and sly humor make it look almost like a frank capra or preston sturges comedy.

it has to be admitted that the best work of harold lloyd ended with his last great silent comedy "speedy" in 1928. after that he enters sound films (like chaplin and keaton and laurel & hardy and w.c. fields) and does do better than keaton, but not as well as the other three. chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as producer (but he paced his films so there were five years between productions). laurel & hardy were under the protection of hal roach, so production standards for their shorts and sound films were pretty good. fields first worked with mack sennett, than with paramount, and then free-lanced. lloyd tried the route that chaplin took, but with less success.he produced his own films, but unlike chaplin he did not own his own studio. also his first two choices were not good (especially "feet first"). but he did begin to choose more wisely and "movie crazy", "the cat's-paw", and "the milky way" were all good choices. these three (and possibly "the sin of harold diddlebock") were his best sound ventures. they are all entertaining, but none are up to "safety last", "the freshman", "the kid brother", or "speedy". of the top four sound films "the cat's paw" is the most controversial. ezekiel cobb's solution to ridding the city that elects him mayor is very extreme for the tastes of 2005. or is it? when a movie is made dictates what it's politics are: "the cat's paw" is from 1934. that second year of the roosevelt new deal (itself rather controversial for heavier government involvement) movie audiences saw films like "gabriel over the white house" and "the phantom president", where our leaders did extra-constitutional actions to rid the nation of internal enemies (and to force disarmament around the globe). even cecil b. de mille got into this act with "this day and age", where a bunch of teenagers use rats to force a gangster to confess his crimes.to us, the use of violence to force anyone (even a bunch of goons and boodlers like alan dinehart's gang) to confess is repellent. after all, the supreme court has protected us from confession under duress. what we forget is that the reforms we are thinking of did not occur until the warren court and the burger court made them. for example, although mr. justice sutherland's opinion in the powell ("scottsboro boys") case of 1932 guaranteed every criminal defendant had a right to counsel, gideon v. wainwright did not extend this to ordering court paid counsel to defendants until 1962. the miranda case, with it's now well-known anti-self-incrimination warning is from 1963. nothing like this were considered necessary in 1934.if you study other movies of the period up to 1954 (and even to 1960) tricks are used to get confessions - kirk douglas confesses his crimes in front of witnesses in "i walk alone" while burt lancaster holds a gun to him. when lancaster leaves, douglas sneers about confessing under duress, only to see the gun is unloaded. suddenly he realizes that (legally - in 1948) he has confessed without duress. hate to say it, to any civil libertarians reading this note, but what cobb/lloyd does to dinehart and his pals in the conclusion of "the cat's paw" was not only legal, but would have led to their jail sentences in 1934. we may call it heavy handed, fascistic, or horrid, but it would have worked legally when it was thought up.

returning from 20 years in china, a young missionary refuses to become the cat's-paw for a gang of hometown hoodlums.this movie was a bit of a departure from harold lloyd's previous movies. comedy derived more from dialogue, often rather serious, predominates here, rather than the elaborate sight gags which powered harold's classics of the past. there are some splendid moments, however, which are pure visual fun, as when harold attempts to follow a convertible down a crowded street, or when he desperately tries to keep a nightclub stripper from losing her clothes. there is also the climactic scene, set in a chinatown basement, in which harold gleefully jumps unabashedly into the darkest comedy. but most of the humor derives from harold's refusal to be the patsy of the criminals who've run his hometown for years.and it's quite a collection of crooked politicians & thugs harold finds himself up against, played by a bevy of fine character actors: george barbier, nat pendleton, grant mitchell, edwin maxwell, alan dinehart, warren hymer & stuttering fuzzy knight. pert una merkel is on hand as the tobacco stand girl who catches harold's eye and keeps him intrigued by her no-nonsense outlook on life.movie mavens will recognize samuel s. hinds as harold's missionary father; charles sellon as an elderly stockport clergyman; and herman bing as a german gangster--all uncredited. also, showing up for only a few seconds as an attempted kidnapper, is noah young, a familiar face from harold's silent films, here making his final appearance in a lloyd picture.fox gave the film fine production values, especially in the opening scenes set in china.

went to the premiere at the tribeca film festival in nyc and i absolutely loved the film!!! i am diane's #1 biggest fan and of course, as always, she gave a magnificent performance!! i have seen every single one of her movies and i must say that this is one of my new favorites. diane was funny and moving and just took my breath away. donald sutherland was surprisingly humorous but also a good amount of serious. anton yelchin is just a wonderful young actor and gave an amazing performance. all in all, i recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate an excellent movie. 10 thumbs up!!! i would definitely go see it again and again and again. this is the best film of the year so far!!!

this is an adaptation of a dirk wittenborn book, which i did not read. young finn earl lives with his mom liz (diane lane) in a cramped lower east side new york apartment. he dreams of joining his anthropologist father studying a fierce tribe in south america. liz has boyfriends and does coke. when he is caught scoring coke for her, one of her customers (liz is a legitimate masseuse) a rich mr. osborne bails her out in return for being his full time personal masseuse in his huge estate in new jersey. they are driven there in a limo with her strung out lying in the back seat with her dress hitched way up and panties showing. (this and a few low-cut dress scenes is the only exploitation of ms. lane. some may be disappointed but i'm sorry she had to do all that stuff in "unfaithful" to make the a-list. that lady has more talent in her little finger than streep, roberts, and sally field do in their entire bodies and its time she was given her due.) when they arrive finn makes friends with osbornes grandson bryce, and has a coming of age with his new girlfriend, granddaughter maya. liz meanwhile joins aa and dates an aa doctor. she miraculously cleans up instantly. finn however does a lot of drugs along with sex with his new friends. bryce seems like an ok guy but gets jealous when osborne takes finn on a hot air balloon race instead of him, and this leads to tragedy.the genius of the story, (and movie) is that they cut from the violent acts of the fierce filthy rich blysdale tribe to the yanomano warriors. it's a little implausible though that when liz finds out what happens to her son she merely demands action from osborne and does not either contact the authorities or settle it thelma and louise style. there are elements of a gothic romance with a revelation by the village idiot. also they do almost no plot or character development prior to the move to blysdale. liz, for instance, like lane's pearl kantrowitz in "walk on the moon" had an unwanted pregnancy with finn at 18 and felt trapped. this is in the book but not the movie. still, these are minor shortcomings. the movie will be in full release 12/31/05 over a year after the original release date, and i just couldn't wait.there were lots of red carpet moments in the theater i saw the movie at, with almost the whole cast...except diane lane!! $#%#q$ director dunne said she was off filming a movie. i know she didn't promise to be there, but i came from way out of town and it would have been such a thrill to see her in person. the movie is a definite best picture contender, as for acting?? sutherland was quite good, and so was the boy who played finn. lane was magnificent as always, but i only recall one or two emotional scenes, when she catches finn with drugs "lets get f****d up together mother and son" and with osborne "your twisted grandson...". she would fare better with a supporting actress nod but it wont work that way. unless they give it to her for a "body of work."

from the opening scenes of fierce people (an interplay of tribal customs as photographed by the anthropologist father of the young narrator finn earl, demonstrating why this south american tribe of ishkanani is so fierce) the direction of the film is nebulous: are we watching a dark comedy about comparing life in the new york streets to uncivilized peoples, or is this a message film of a more serious intent? but as the story develops this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes increasingly clear. griffin dunne's direction of dirk wittenborn's adaptation of his novel may be a bit careless at times as it strays from rational plot development, but in the end there is a strong enough final impact to patch up the holes he created.our narrator finn earl (anton yelchin) lives with his coke-addicted masseuse/sexually obsessed mother liz (diane lane) in new york, waiting for the summer when he is to join his anthropologist father on a field trip to south america (a father he knows only from letters and videos), when a drug bust abruptly changes their lives: one of liz's wealthy clients ogden osborne (donald sutherland) rescues the down and out family and moves them to his ten acre estate, the epitome of wealth and power. in exchange for being osborne's private masseuse, liz and finn can live in the mansion with the 'filthy rich' osbornes - daughter mrs. langley (elizabeth perkins) and grandchildren bryce (chris evans) and maya (kristen stewart). osborne and his physician lead liz on the drying out path and finn bonds with osborne and his grandchildren, and despite the disparity in poor versus wealthy, the living situation works - for a while. incidents occur to alter feelings and finn is attacked and raped by a masked assailant, a turning point for the film and finn's view of the osborne family. osborne reveals his past to finn and together they manage to discover the truth about finn's troubling incident - and also about the fierce disease of the wealthy class.the film uses many clips of tribal activity during the film, drawing some disturbing parallels for some of the more challenging scenes. for this viewer that works well, but when the director elects to place tribal individuals in full regalia within the context of the osborne estate, the concept feel contrived, as though the audience has to be forced to 'get it'. the various subplots between maid jilly (paz de la huerta) and finn and the introduction of an obese retarded chalk artist whitney (branden williams) push the credibility edge of emphasizing the line between the wealthy and the 'lower class', but the performances by sutherland, lane, and yelchin are strong enough to make us forgive the film's lapses. not a great film but one with a lot of worthy ideas splashed around on the screen of a project that often feels lost in its struggle for direction. grady harp

to the eight people who found the previous fierce people comments by "psycolicious me" and "topdany" "helpful," as well as to any future site visitors who see them before their authors delete them: these negative critique's are not only shorter than the site guidelines mandate, but they are entirely bogus, nonfactual, incorrect, and misinformative. for instance, blythe's dad is in a coma, not dead--maya and finn even visit him in the hospital. furthermore, it was estate deer poacher dwayne--not blythe--who knocked up jilly the maid, etc., etc. so if you have add which makes you incapable of focusing on the simplest details, please keep your condition to yourself by not pretending to be siskel or ebert. otherwise, include a disclaimer with your comments!

a brilliant and sensitive movie with interwoven plot lines. as a general warning, the movie turns quite dark about half way through. as sudden as it is, this is a change that i found fitting to the themes of the movie, particularly the comparison of the ishkanani to the filthy rich, and (as is said by finn at the end) how each person makes up the tribe, and how the whole tribe is reflected in each person.anton yelchin (finn earl) is spectacular in this movie. he is probably best known as chekov from star trek or kyle reese in terminator salvation, but he's been in a whole plethora of movies you've probably never heard of (alpha dog, which is another brilliant performance on yelchin's part, house of d, hearts in atlantis, to name a few...) the point is that this kid really takes this movie and makes it his own. other excellent performances from diane lane and donald sutherland are what takes this movie up a notch, from great to excellent.

i really enjoyed fierce people. i discovered the film by accident, searching through my on-demand movie lists trying to find something interesting to watch. the film is mostly about class in america, and it quickly grabs your attention. the characters are smart and articulate and the story doesn't stick to the usual hollywood rules.the main protagonist is finn, a precocious, but underprivileged 15 year old who spends his summer with the osbourne family. donald sutherland plays the patriarch, ogden c. osborne, the seventh richest man in america. diane lane plays finn's mother, a friend of ogden who is also a habitual cocaine user and a slut. the osbournes own a large estate and seems to live by their own rules. at first they seem charming and sophisticated but the super-rich are different. they are used to getting their own way. the film is enjoyable mainly because it has crisp intelligent dialog, superb acting and a story which takes unexpected turns. it is also an r rated movie, so it's not entirely wholesome. the cast is excellent. anton yelchin is believable and sympathetic in the demanding role of finn. sutherland and diane lane have never been better. chris evans is impressive as osbourne's devious grandson. kristen stewart is good as the pretty grand daughter. high quality movie.

this is halfway to being a top movie. the opening section, which spoofs hollywood "social message" films is absolutely brilliant. it is a riot from start to finish.the second section, which introduces us to the main characters of the story is really great too. we get a lot of great comic setups, top notch performances, and the dialog is really dynamic.(spoiler warning!)the one think that really annoyed me about this film though is the ending, which i think contradicts everything that went before. my interpretation was that this film was taking the mickey out all the silly prejudices and innuendo of small town gossip and national tabloid sensationalism. i loved that the film was championing the cause that a person's sexuality is not determined by their hobbies, idiosyncrasies, fashion sense or whatever. and then the ending goes and re-enforces all the gossip and stereotypes that the movie successfully lampooned in the first place. it turns out everyone was 100% right!!! (godamit!) this was very disappointing to what was actually a great story.

paul rudnick (jeffrey, addams family values) wrote this frothy tale of a mild mannered school teacher (kevin kline) who is outted on the academy awards by a former student-turned-actor (matt dillon). the rest of the film deals with the absurdities revolving around this setup -the effect on the town, his fiancee (joan cusack), himself- and climaxes with an everybody-loves-everybody finale. if you're an angry gay rights activist or a naive youth looking for an accurate portrayal of a man's struggle to come out or a 'true' depiction of gay life, then save yourself the trouble and rent something else (maybe beautiful thing) or read a book (giovanni's room). if you are able to understand that this film was inspired by the piousness of tom hanks's speech on the academy awards when he won for philadelphia and pokes fun at hollywood culture and small town ignorance and you have a fondness for '30's screwball comedy (bringing up baby, holiday, the palm beach story) then enjoy! far from being a biting satire, the film tries for the exuberance of a preston sturges farce and comes damn close. no, it's not 'deep' or 'powerful' -neither were romy & michelle, 9 to 5, or young frankenstein- and it doesn't pretend to be; it keeps it's tongue-firmly-in-cheek. it gets too preachy and maudlin for its own good toward the end and sure some of the jokes are a bit stale (there's also a locker room scene that could have been cut) but after sitting through countless comedies that misfire, it's like a breath of fresh air. kevin kline and tom selleck are wonderfully game while debbie reynolds and wilford brimley add fine support. the excellent joan cusack's award winning performance is stellar and the great bob newhart is, well, bob newhart.  the fact that many have been offended by in & out is as absurd as the mentality of the townsfolk it pokes fun at; personally, i was more offended by philadelphia. i'll take harmless fluff over sanctimoniousness anytime.

after reading the comment made about this movie, and currently watching it, i can understand how the person felt about it. the decisions made were after listening to common sense. when the movie came out, i had heard the information as to how it came about. the storyline was made from an actual event. during an award show, an actor, thanking the li'l people, attributed the award to a former school teacher, unexpectedly outing the person.of course, many people come 'out' of the closet most every day. each outing is different for each person. in real life, the outcome of any individual is gonna be different as well. and a willingness to accept who they are is the most important thing in life to reach personal happiness. for those around them, the joy and honest acceptance can make life much more fuller. for the movie, the outcome of how howard is out'ed is a lot more comical than real life. and the acceptance of the community showed the others that howard was himself and nothing else.overall, the performances were crazy. the memorable quotes and use of music add to the stereo-types out there in the world, but taken with tongue and cheek humour. it's a movie. sit down, watch with an open mind, and laugh your head off.

in & out, in my opinion, is a very hilarious movie. i thought that cameron (matt dillon) was wrong to say that howard (kevin kline) was gay. the part i liked most was howard's bachelor party. this was because they were cracking jokes about a lot of things, including barbra streisand films. i also thought that emily (joan cusack) looked very beautiful in her wedding dress and that howard looked good in his tuxedo. my favorite quote of in & out is, "is everybody gay? is this 'the twilight zone'?" that was absolutely hilarious! the one character i couldn't stand was sonya (shalom harlow). this was because she was very conceited and snobby. in conclusion, i recommend this movie to all you kevin kline fans who have not seen it. be prepared to laugh hard and have a good time when you see it.

kevin kline offers a brilliant comic turn in the 1997 comedy in & out. kline plays howard brackett, a small town history teacher who excitedly sits down to watch the academy awards this year because one of his former students (matt dillon) is a nominee. he is nominated for his performance in a film where he plays a gay soldier and when he wins, he thanks howard in his speech for inspiring him because howard is gay. now this floors howard because he as no clue why thus guy would say this on international television. howard is even engaged to be married (to joan cusack, in an oscar-nominated performance)so he has no idea where dillon;s cameron drake got the idea that he is gay and finds he has to defend himself to everyone at school but is shocked that no one seemed terribly shocked by what cameron said on the oscars. howard has a birthday party where he is given birthday presents like the soundtrack to yentl and ends up explaining to his guests why barbra streisand had to make funny lady. his parents (wilford brimley, debbie reynolds) are shocked but promise to support their son, even if he is gay. he also gets a visit from an out of town reporter (tom selleck) who wants to do an article about him because he's gay too. the moment when selleck plants a big kiss right on kline's lips is a classic. but all of these little things have howard actually questioning his sexuality and wondering if he really is gay...much to the aggravation and frustration of his fiancée, cusack, who is beyond confused. the scene where she leaves a bar in her wedding gown and stands in the middle of street screaming about the lack of single straight men in the world is a classic. but what i like about this movie is the way kline fully invests in the role and was not afraid to look foolish or look gay. there is a fabulous scene, probably the most famous from the film, where he buys a record, on how to be macho, and the guy on the record is talking about how real men don't dance and a disco tune comes on (i will survive if memory serves)and the narrator on the record says no matter what you do, don't dance, but howard can't help himself and he ends up shaking his groove thing all over the room. it's hysterically funny and kline plays it with sincerity and gusto. the film is not pro or anti gay...it's just a deft and amusing character study about a man trying to figure out exactly who he is. wonderful film.

this movie is extremely funny and enjoyable,with suitable, funny and experienced casts. i find this movie enjoyable not only by the elements of humor but also the music in various scenes. kevin kline, a good comedian has done a good job at being funny in many parts of the film along with tom selleck who is amazingly different from many of his other films. the humor within this film are goofy which makes various exaggerations within many scenes, especially the beginning bits. joan cusack is also remarkably funny and exaggerated; and the same goes for all the other casts. this film has many elements of goofy humor and is enjoyable if you want to laugh.

joan cusack steals the show! the premise is good, the plot line interesting and the screenplay was ok. a tad too simplistic in that a coming-out story of a gay man was so positive when it is usually not quite-so-positive. then again, it is fiction. :) all in all an entertaining romp.one thing i noticed was the "inside-joke" aspect. since the target-audience probably was straight, they may not get the gay "stuff" in context with the story. kevin kline showed a facet of his acting prowess that screenwriters sometimes don't take in consideration when suggesting kline for a part.this one hit the mark.

this is truly a funny movie. his dance scene done with the tape is one of the funniest scenes i can recall. i thought the "i am gay" scene at the high school graduation ceremony a bit surrealistic, though it was funny. while watching it for the third time, i started to pick up on a little small segments that i had missed. one was when matt dillon's girl friend, a classic ditz, tried to use a dial phone which she had never used before. kevin klein made this film successful along tom selleck. this was also the first time i could appreciate debbie reynolds; she proved that she can be funny. she confirmed this in the tv series 'will and grace.' one discovery that i found after the third viewing is lauren ambrose of '6 feet under' fame. she sticks out with her red bangs, but it is obvious that this is one of her first films. bob newhart is also very funny at the high school principle.

the first, and far better, of kevin kline's two gay roles. (the second is the dreary "de-lovely" in which he played cole porter.) inspired by tom hanks' emotional acceptance speech for "philadelphia" in which he outed his high school drama teacher, the nominated film in this version was obviously more "forrest gump" than "philadelphia". here the hanks character is played by matt dillon.the reaction scenes in most of the film are very funny and, as has been often pointed out, are especially effective as done by kevin himself, debbie reynolds, tom selleck (a brave move since he was himself the target of such rumors, which he denied!), bob newhart and joan cusack as the eventually jilted bride-to-be.tom hanks' actual teacher criticized the graduation scene saying people don't act that way in real life. but this is a farce and not real life. that being said, it is not as effective as it might be and the misdirection of the final "wedding scene" which makes it look like tom and kevin are about to get hitched i found rather pointless, annoying and a cop out.the highlight of the film for me is, of course, kevin's scene with the how-to-be-a-real-man audio tape and it is hilarious but certainly not at all realistic when the tape reacts to kevin's actions.on the whole, a hoot!

shadows breathes the smell of new york's streets like no film before it. this kick off of cassavetes' directorial work is as atmospheric as political and the initial spark for a renewal in american cinema.maybe it solicits for watching cassavetes' first work in a double feature with another debut, godard's à bout de soufflé. both films shaped the cinematic production of their countries beyond decades and both breathe a peculiar lightness and jauntiness which was later rarely achieved by those filmmakers in their career.shadows tells from three afro-american siblings, ben (ben carruthers), lelia (lelia goldoni) and hugh (hugh hurd). the story is set in the new york jazz milieu and the driving rhythms on the soundtrack play a main part for the feverish, sometimes almost dreamlike atmosphere which draws through the entire film. there's not much happening in the plot. the everyday life of the three siblings is defined by problems in love relationship or in their jobs, but on both levels normality deceives. without moralizing gestus, cassavetes simply describes the mechanism of racial exclusion, in public and in private life. it was, regarding to the cinematic depiction of racism, a breakthrough film in the us. this film owes also a lot to the performances of the three leading actors which were all almost completely unknown before. especially ben carruthers established with his energetic portrayal the image of a new self-conception of young, urban blacks in america, an image which characterizes spike lee's films of the 80s and 90s. revealingly, none of those three doubtlessly extremely talented actors was able to start a big career afterwards. hollywood wasn't and isn't ready to ethnically expand its star system, and that is why goldoni, hurd and carruthers only found small artistic niches in tv and independent films later on.perhaps shadows is one of the less "beautiful" films ever shot, and one of the most beautiful ones at the same time; a film of shades and spaces, with a camera that merely watches the stream of life in the crowded street corners, bars, hotel lobbies, apartments, inducing an intriguing ramble through new york's vibrant streets.

"shadows" is often acclaimed as the film that was the breakthrough for american independent cinema. whether thats true or not, it is an undeniably important film, one whose influence can be traced all the way to today's sundance fodder. here is a film which tackles controversial topics of the day (namely racism), and refuses to give easy answers and show them in a manipulative fashion. also, it deals with sex in a frank manner that hollywood wouldn't even discuss until "the graduate".still, the question remains is it as powerful today as when it was originally released? the answer is yes. while many important films are hard to watch and dated nowadays, "shadows" retains every ounce of emotional resonance when viewed now. it deals with racism as a personal issue and not a political one, so its still relevant. plus, it works as a great time capsule, capturing the 1950s beat generation and new york art scene in a way possibly no other film has.on a technical level, its admittedly uneven. cassavetes had yet to gain full confidence as a director and the choppy editing reflects the film's low budget. still, the film's story is remains powerful. plus, the acting, considering the inexperience of the cast and improvisational nature, is phenomenal. all around, the actors create realistic characters, ones who remain sympathetic despite their often less than admirable actions. "shadows" is absolutely mandatory viewing for film buffs. (9/10)

watching john cassavetes debut film is a strange experience, even if you've seen improvisational films before.the first thing you notice is it's roughness. right off, it's obvious some of the characters are screwing up their lines. but then you step back from the situation, as you sink deeper into these people's intimate exchanges and you ask yourself: "do i ever stumble over my words?" the answer of course, is sure, we all do. it's unfortunate that most of the gaffes in this respect come early in the picture, because, by about twenty minutes, you've sunk so deep in you wouldn't know it if a bomb went off behind you.the next thing you notice...or maybe you notice it hours or days after the film ends, is that you never saw any substantial plot, yet the themes and the poetry of the dialog and characters never leave you. in fact, the treatment of the role race plays in the everyday lives of these characters is always there, but it's so ephemeral that even they aren't aware of how it's informing their opinions of themselves, their self-consciousness, their perceived status, or the fate of their relationships.the title is appropriate because you get a full spectrum of blacks, whites, and grays...and not just in the skin pigmentation of the characters. leila goldoni (truly remarkable here) is an afro-american/caucasian, her two brothers are white and dark afro-american. the irony is that they exist in what is undoubtedly the "hippest" most tolerant atmosphere of the time...beat-driven upper east-west manhatten...and there are still conflicts within and around themselves.i don't think i've ever seen a movie with such a subtle delivery or technique. it's a lot like absorbing a really great piece of gallery art and then just nodding off in bliss as you think back to the images it evoked days later.great mastering and extras on the criterion disc. arguably the first truly experimental independent film ever made.

what is there to say about an anti-establishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void, social indifference and authoritarian contentment. cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves. i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such 'beat' filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late 1950's known as the french new wave.they discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy; even at this stage this peculiar, highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth century.cassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we, as a culture, are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice. the great element to most of cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect; a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations, not so much imagery. this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretation.although my favourite cassevettes film is 'husbands', this one is his most important.

in the end credits of "shadows", after we read 'directed by john cassavetes', some white letters on the screen can be seen: "the film you have just seen is improvised", they say. i am always pursuing the fact that words are so important in movies since filmmakers started using them because, basically, there's no film without a screenplay and many other reasons.cassavetes pursued the same goal, and he believed in the freedom of words; "shadows" is the perfect example. it's a film with no real main characters, with no real main plot lines; it's mostly people in different situations, talking. yes, some of the situations are connected but cassavetes, apparently always in a rush to get to the talking, uses a fast forward technique when the characters are going somewhere or escaping from someone and are not speaking.appearances are everything in this movie. for example, there's a brilliant score, full of jazz influences and a lot of fantastic solos, and there's one character that says he's a jazz musician and plays the trumpet (ben, all the characters' names are the same names the actors'). however, we never see him play the trumpet or jam with a band; he doesn't even talk about music and just wanders with his friends around the city. they do talk, a lot, and about anything that's in their minds; going from how intelligent each of them are to the hilarious analysis of a sculpture."shadows" is funny in its intellectual references in parts like the one above, because these friends are not cultured. the only important female character in the film (lelia), though, wants to be an intellectual. but again, she has one very interesting conversation with an older man at a party, about a book she's trying to write, and about how to confront reality; but nothing to do with being intellectual. at that same party, a woman is actually making an intellectual statement, full of complexity, and asks a guy beside her: "do you agree?". "yes", he says, but you can tell he doesn't know what she's talking about.another character, a singer (hugh), talks about his glory days in occasions, and we see him perform only once; but no references to the musical industry there. the focus of cassavetes is the singer's relationship with his manager (rupert), which most of the time involves chats about trivial stuff and not real 'musical' talks. so the trumpet player's important deal in "shadows" is the time he spends with his friends; the intellectual wannabe girl's is her way of handling romantic relationships (one of the movie's strong points) and the singer's is the bond with his managerappearances.the reason why performances are not important in this movie is simple. cassavetes needed people who could master improvisation, without mattering if they were actually good. i believe some of them aren't, but they surely know how to improvise in a scene, and you can notice how well they do it. "shadows" is not about performers; it's about a way of making cinema, based on the magic of conversation; and there you could say that performances mean something.that's why in every conversation the camera is like a stalker, constantly on the eyes of every character, constantly looking for the expressions that come with natural speech. there's a scene where the trumpet player and his friends are trying to pick up some girls. they are three, so each of them sits beside one girl (the girls are three two) in three different tables. they all talk at the same time and the camera shoots through the table, and sometimes the friends look at each other, while they say whatever they are sayingit's natural.

in many ways, the filmic career of independent film-making legend john cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like alfred hitchcock, the consummate studio director. where hitchcock infamously treated his actors as cattle, cassavetes sought to work with them improvisationally. where every element in a hitchcock shot is composed immaculately, cassavetes cared less for the way a scene was figuratively composed than in how it felt, or what it conveyed, emotionally. hitchcock's tales were always plot-first narratives, with the human element put in the background. cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his films. if some things did not make much sense logically, so be it.one can see this even from his very first film, 1959's shadows, filmed with a 16mm hand-held camera, on a shoe string budget of about $40,000, in manhattan, with cassavetes' acting workshop repertory company, and touted as an improvisatory film. the story is rather simple, as it follows the lives of three black sibling manhattanites- benny (ben carruthers)- a trumpeter and no account, hugh (hugh hurd)- a washed up singer, and lelia (lelia goldoni)- the younger sister of both. the film's three main arcs deal with hugh's failures as a nightclub crooner, and his friendship with his manager rupert (rupert crosse); benny's perambulations in an about manhattan with his two no account pals; and lelia's lovelife- first with a white boy tony (anthony ray), who does not realize light-skinned lelia's race, even after bedding her; then with stiff and proper davey (davey jones), who may be a misogynist.in the first arc, nothing much happens, except dark-skinned hugh gets to pontificate on how degraded he feels to be singing in low class nightclubs, and opening shows for girly acts. he dreams of making it big in new york, or even paris, but one can tell he is the type of man who will continue deluding himself of his meager skill, for the one time we actually get to hear him sing, he shows he's a marginal talent, at best. that rupert keeps encouraging him gives us glimpses into how destructive friendships work. but, this is the least important of the three arcs. while this film is better overall than, say, martin scorsese's first film, a decade later, who's that knocking at my door?- another tale of failed romance and frustrated new yorkers, it has none of the brilliant moments- acting-wise nor cinematographically- that that film has. it also is not naturalistic, for naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve, especially in film, although the 1950s era manhattan exteriors, at ground level, is a gem to relive. while shadows may, indeed, be an important film in regards to the history of the independent film circuit, it certainly is nowhere near a great film. parts of it are preachy, poorly acted, scenes end willy-nilly, almost like blackout sketches, and sometimes are cut off seemingly in the middle. all in all it's a very sloppy job- especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of synch with the rest of the film, as cassavetes proved that as a director, at least in his first film, he was a good actor. the only reason for anyone to see shadows is because cassavetes ultimately got better with later films, and this gives a clue as to his later working style.the national film registry has rightly declared this film worthy of preservation as 'culturally significant'. this is all in keeping with the credo of art cassavetes long championed, as typified by this quote: 'i've never seen an exploding helicopter. i've never seen anybody go and blow somebody's head off. so why should i make films about them? but i have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way. i've seen people withdraw. i've seen people hide behind political ideas, behind dope, behind the sexual revolution, behind fascism, behind hypocrisy, and i've myself done all these things. so i can understand them. what we are saying is so gentle. it's gentleness. we have problems, terrible problems, but our problems are human problems.' that this film is 'culturally significant' is true, but that truth is not synonymous with its being 'artistically significant'. it is in the difference between these two definitions where great art truly thrives.

1st watched 8/26/2001 - 8 out of 10 (dir-john cassavetes): well-done early independent film by cassavetes introduced a style that was much different than what hollywood shows it's audience. this movie also introduced some very taboo subjects, especially the actual racism that probably was prevalent all over the country but was not displayed by the mostly white controlled filmmakers of the time. about the only black actors that had much respect at this time were the ones that acted and displayed personality like whites(aka. sidney poitier). besides this, the idea of ending a film without truly concluding the relationships that began leaves many moviegoers dumbfounded but actually makes the viewers realize that life is like this(it goes on...). i prefer this kind of an ending because it makes you think more about the characters and what may happen next and the conclusions are not just laid out for you. the movie follows the lives of people(particulary a couple of people who have a brief relationship and happen to be opposite skin colors) then we watch what happens when the white man realizes what he's done. this is done very well and makes the movie very special. the acting is supposedly done improvisationally which makes the movie even more amazing. i guess you can say i liked this movie, if you can't tell. if you can find it check out this classic early independent film.

it ends with the declaration that "the film you have just seen was an improvisation"-at once making you feel like an idiot for thinking an improvisation was an good movie, and astounded at cassavetes' genius...once again. of course, cassavetes told some guy it wasn't really an improvisation per se, on his deathbed, so...it's the story about a light-skinned black woman, lelia, who passes for white, and her family: another passing-for-white brother named ben, and a black-black brother named hughie. when she falls in love with a white jerk named tony, he is unpleasantly surprised when he finds out she's black, and from there it goes on about the three main characters' individual aspirations and shortcomings. hughie is a jazz singer in the process of becoming a failure, lelia's still hopelessly depressed over tony, and ben is angsty and violent in general, in desperate need of something to shock him out of his stale patterns of existence. overall, i suppose it's really about stasis vs. change in human life. i suspect that cassavetes had the plot organized enough, and it was just the dialogue that was improvised. the dialogue itself is very uneven - sometimes somebody will say something very memorable, other times it's memorably awkward. what's amazing is the extent of the amateur actors' embodiment of their characters. cassavetes went through the acting class he was teaching at the time he decided to do shadows, whispered in the ears of the ten best students, and this was the result...the guys playing ben and hughie are very good. at first i didn't like lelia, but as the film progressed you see more and more she's one of those actors who gets better as the tension and drama builds - not necessarily the best with small talk. shadows is hailed by many as the forerunner of the indie film movement (made in 1959) and it's definitely recommended.

john cassavette's decided as his first film, obviously as one shot on a shoestring in new york, to not even have a script with dialog, and delivers a 1959 feature equivalent of larry david's curb your enthusiasm- all the actors know what to do and say and even have the right look in their eyes when they talk. in other words, it's one of the most realistic looks at the beat generation, jazzed sweetly in it's score and telling a tale of racial tensions. a group of black siblings are the center-point, with one trying to get better gigs than the average strip-club, and has a sister, much more light-skinned than him, who gets entwined with a white man in a relationship, which shatters both sides. the film, however, isn't exclusively about that; cassavettes likes to have his characters wander around new york city (which not many films did in 1959/1960) and his style of storytelling is like that of the improvisational jazz artists of the day. dated, to be sure, but worth a glance for film buffs; martin scorsese named this as one of his heaviest influences.

i had never seen a film by john cassavetes up until two years ago, when i first saw the killing of a chinese bookie in a berlin cinema, which i found interesting, to put it diplomatically, but not so special, i instantly wanted to see more of his work. since then, i tried - with an emphasis on tried - watching his other work, shadows in particular. i must admit, it took me a a while before i actually enjoyed the film. at first the unpolished, raw and improvised way cassavetes it was shot, put me off somewhat and i thought of it as an original - absolutely - but flawed and dated experiment. but now, upon reviewing, these little imperfections make it look so fresh, even today.shot on a minimal budget of $40,000 with a skeleton six person crew, shadows offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an african-american family in which two of the three siblings, ben (ben carruthers) and lelia (lelia goldoni), are light-skinned and able to pass for white. cassavetes demanded that the actors retain their real names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group but saw the film as being concerned with human problems as opposed imply to racial ones. cassavetes shot the film in ten minute takes and jagged editing, a reaction against 'seamless' hollywood production values. cassavetes main inspiration - at least in the cinematic style the film was shot - were the italian neo-realists whilst also professing admiration for welles' pioneering spirit. the use of amateurs and improvisation might resemble some of the italian neo-realist directors, but with his bebop score by charles mingus ans shafi hadi, the film feels very different, very american, unlike anything made before really. the song with the feathered girls, "i feel like a lolly-pop" (or something) feels like light years back to me, ancient history. but no matter how dated it might look, it still makes a delightful time capsule of late fifties new york today. i think it's this is one of the first films made aspiring filmmakers realize they could shoot an independent film, without hollywood, improvised and without a real budget. seymour cassel, who acted and was involved in shadows, claims it was jules dassin's the naked city (1948) that was the first and inspired them all, but i think this was the one that really opened the eyes of aspiring independent american filmmakers.camera obscura --- 8/10

the remarkable, sometimes infuriating, often brilliant films of john cassavetes occupy a unique position in american cinema low-budget, partly improvised, inspired by cinéma verité documentary, and related to underground film, they have nevertheless frequently managed to reach a wide and profoundly appreciative audience after drama studies, the young cassavetes quickly made his name as an unusually unrefined, intense actor, often appearing in films about disaffected, rebellious youth such as "crime in the streets" and "edge of the city." setting up an actors' workshop, he worked to transform an improvisational experiment into his feature debut the result, "shadows," taking three years to complete and partly financed by his performances in tv's johnny staccato, was a breakthrough in american cinema about the effect of racism on an already fraught relationship between two black men and their sister, two of whom pass for white, the film is impressive for its irregular, seemingly formless style and naturalistic performances plot was minimal, mood and emotional apparent truth were everything

1959 was a landmark in the world of film. several great directors of the classic era were releasing career capping classics that ranked among their best. just a look at the titles is instructive, hitchcock's north by northwest, billy wilder's some like it hot, howard hawks' rio bravo, douglas sirk's imitation of life. add a couple from the previous year, orson welles' touch of evil, hitch's vertigo, and nick ray's wind across the everglades, and you've got a pretty good summing up of what was possible within the classic hollywood style.at the same time, two films appeared that hinted at a whole new way of making films. one was jean-luc godard's breathless, the other was john cassavetes shadows. the two films had certain things in common, largely improvised acting by non stars, handheld cameras, low budgets, and a certain youthful, jazzy swagger. in certain ways, though, they couldn't be farther apart. godard was still a believer in the director as arbiter of style. he knew more about film than most hollywood producers, and breathless was filled with the iconography of the classic crime film. cassavetes, on the other hand, was an actor, and a refugee from new york's underground theater scene. his first film shows him little impressed with the cinema, and a big believer in actors. godard's film constantly references it's own artifice, whereas shadows aims for a certain kind of naturalism.it doesn't reach it, mainly because naturalism is a myth, particularly in cinema. but it feels powerful, kinetic but lilting like the cool jazz on the score, certainly the main inspiration for the filmmaking style on display here. it ultimately doesn't hold together, mainly because cassavetes' actors here are amateurish beatniks, where cassavetes style requires strong, imaginative actors. his later work with gena rowlands, ben gazarra, and peter falk blows this out of the water. due to the director's technical inexperience, some bits of dialogue had to be redubbed later, which defeats the freshness of the improvisation. still it's fascinating to watch, both for the great moments (like the scene where leila goldoni talks about her dissapointment with losing her virginity) and to watch a groundbreaking artist finding his way.

this was really a pleasure to see; the dialogue was - for the most part - absolutely outstanding (i thought the women's roles were a little better written, which is a nice surprise). the performances were uniformly very good, too. frank gorshin overdoes it a little when he goes into his various cons, but this might be his overcompensating for what i see as weaknesses in how the character is written; he's very good otherwise. harry groener does similarly well with a slightly underwritten character (tony), overdoing some of the character's angrier scenes slightly. ursula burton is excellent as sister theresa, really carrying the film through some of its weaknesses. seymour cassel and louise fletcher are a little underused here, though i liked their work as always. shirley jones, wendie malick, jill eikenberry and faye grant are very good also (i couldn't help thinking grant reminded me a little of catherine o'hara here); cloris leachman rather tears into her role, with reasonably good results.i wish there had been more of a sure hand behind the camera, though. sometimes the framing or staging seemed a bit off, or awkward. the closeups seemed overused (or erratically used) to me. and we don't always go from scene to scene as smoothly as we'd like. some of the "tough guy" approach to the federal agent (music, costuming) was too over the top for me as well. and the few fantasy sequences didn't really work. but there are things that were very well done; the opening sequence set in buffalo around 1970, for example. and, frankly, all of the scenes regarding theresa's church work (i suspect the writer and actress liked the character a lot, which helps). the scenes between malick and eikenberry are very good.the plot is probably a bit overcontrived - there seem to be a few too many schemes going on at once to keep them all straight at times, and the coincidences got to be a little too much. and i was a little bothered by the ending (should we really be rooting for their biggest con yet to succeed?), but the ride along the way is very enjoyable. it would be nice to see more independent movies like this one made.7 of 10

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time. you know that the characters after finding out that the so-called "gift from god" was actually a loan, will pay back the money and that everyone will be happy at the end, but how they get there is not as obvious. the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going. the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip. frank gorshin, shirley jones, and cloris leachman prove that they are capable of more than playing the riddler, mother partridge, or mary's friend phyllis while jill eikenberry and wendie malick play characters different than we have seen on their tv series. ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church. if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a shirley jones rendition of "the way you look tonight"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try. i don't think you will be disappointed.

really enjoyed manna from heaven. if you liked my big fat greek wedding you will like this too! once the story line is set it begins to keep you guessing the outcome. i think we'll be hearing more from five sisters productions. i know i'll be watching for their next movie.

no bullets, no secret agents, a story that is entertaining, funny, and believable. met some of the producers/actors in this film at the theater. they seemed as interesting in person as their characters on screen. you may not hear about this movie on tv with high-dollar ad spots, but it is definitely worth checking out. i have spent $8 for a movie ticket on a lot of other movies that weren't this entertaining. looking forward to future projects by this production company.

this was a great movie, and safe for the entire family (which one doesn't see much of anymore. my wife and i and 15 year-old son loved it. even though you had an inkling of how it would end, it continued to be a fun journey, and the final ending surprised us. there should be more movies like this!!!

manna from heaven is a light comedy that uses exaggeration of human foibles to entertain the audience. throughout the film there is the expectation that goodness will surface in each situation. the result is that the movie goer finds himself/herself sitting with this silly grin on his/her face, peace in his/her heart, and high expectations for human kind. watching this movie was a most pleasant experience. (i would venture to say uplifting experience, but some would say that sounds corny!!)

its a feel-good movie that made me feel good. some in this genre can be sickly sweet, but this script is restrained. the movie is funny and fun. the acting is great.if this were a musical, i would have left the theater humming the tunes.

i thoroughly enjoyed manna from heaven. the hopes and dreams and perspectives of each of the characters is endearing and we, the audience, get to know each and every one of them, warts and all. and the ending was a great, wonderful and uplifting surprise! thanks for the experience; i'll be looking forward to more.

saw the movie last night w/o knowing anything about it (nothing else out seemed interesting and i had a buffalo connection to this movie - ub grad). it was a very enjoyable movie. liked the pace (it picks up after a slow beginning) and story. well written plot and good character development and relationships. highly recommend it to anyone who likes to see movies that have interesting stories. found myself talking about this movie afterwards over a few beers - most discussions don't last more than a few minutes.

inspired casting, charming and witty throughout. much like the currency in the opening moments of the film, the story floats along magically until you are emotionally "invested" in its outcome. the city of buffalo has never looked better! kudos to the burton sisters and the entire cast for a job well done.

witticisms, colorful characters, family relationships, coping with hardships, living with fun and humor. this film has it all and more. what a great 'every man (and woman)' story, with a top notch plot and script. it offers just clean fun, lots of laughter, many smiles and pure entertainment for the whole family. other reviewers describe the story some. i'll just offer this comparison teaser  it's part "best of show," "grumpy old men," "millions," and some other comedy and life flicks rolled into one.this gem of a film most likely had limited release and is probably not very available to rent. but, it's now out on dvd and i highly recommend it for purchase. if you like good old-fashioned fun and entertaining films for the family, you can't miss with "manna from heaven." this film is a sure fire cure for the blues or to chase the gloom away on nasty weather days or rough times.

at a time when hollywood thinks that louder, faster, and bloodier are better, manna from heaven is comedic and touching look at something we've all thought about: what would i do if a load of money fell from the sky.interestingly, it took the characters many years to realize that the money hadn't made a single difference in their lives. they all become what they were destined to be. unfortunately, in most cases, what they became was unhappy, in spite of their good fortune all those years ago.while manna offers the familiar hollywood storyline of good vs. evil, or in the case, generosity vs greed, what sets this film apart is that good wins out by converting evil, not by crushing it.i think the important message of this film is that you can change the world... even if you do it one person at a time.

if hollywood had the wellbeing of the audience at heart we would see 20 films a year with the kind of wholesome fortitude that is behind this film. there are several experiences of personal growth in this movie and while the characters are still very human even the lessons learned are not that greed will profit you, or do-unto-others-whatever-you-want-as-long-as-you-are-okay-with-it, no, this is what our sad, desensitized lives need, more sense... more love... more do-unto-others-as-you-would-have-done-unto-you... more hope. (thanks ursula!) this movie has an intelligent wit, not "yo' mama" cracks that run rampant in the so-called comedies. people need to feel good. this movie will make you feel good and possibly inspire you to better your life, and the lives of others. sidenote every person counts in ticket sales. this is a truly independent film. if you want more quality films you have to support them.

i didn't know much about this movie going in- my roommate kind of dragged me into it. i was so pleasantly surprised! the plot really grabbed my attention and held it, and the characters are well-drawn and realistic. the screenplay is very clever and funny, and the cast does great things with it. and the best part is that it managed to be entertaining without any explicit sex or violence! if this movie comes anywhere into your area you really should go see it- stand up for this little film, it is worth it!

my wife and i struggle to find movies like this that are clean and yet enjoyable for adults. if you can't find a cinema that is playing it, call your cinema and request it. bravo, five sisters productions for courage, tenacity and creative endeavor!

two things can happen when an ensemble cast is brought together. either you are left walking out of the theater asking, "why?' or you receive manna from heaven, a delightful comedy from the burton sisters, whose mother not only provided inspiration but the screenplay itself. ursula burton, plays theresa, a nun whose friend's and family had always believed she was touched by g-d. when money falls from the sky the clan use young theresa's faith that the money was gift from the heavens to allow all their dreams to come true. years pass and we find theresa returned home to her native buffalo. she comes to the realization that the gift needs to be repaid and calls together her friends and family, (academy award winners shirley jones, louise fletcher and cloris leachman) to return the debt before easter sunday. the money has long since been spent and all the characters find themselves in financial difficulties. shirley jones and frank gorshin, are a husband and wife con team that teach the all important lesson's in life, of how to dress for winter in buffalo and my personal favorite, "they expect you to take the silverware," when visiting a restaurant. the audience can only hope that if theresa does reach her goal that that someone won't run off with the money. the movie teaches us that it is not money, but ourselves that make our and other's dreams come true. every action has an outcome not just for you, but the community around you. when looking into the mirror we see ourselves as we'd like to be, manna from heaven, answers the question of how other's can see the image we'd most like to reflect. the burtons have done a superb job directing the cast to break out of their shells and create new and inventive characters. in the day of multi-million dollar budgets, this low budget indy proves it is not the cash in hand, but true talent that will draw the biggest laughs. wendie malick (the american president, just shoot me) adds a special flavor to this already talented cast.

true stories make the best stories don't they? there's always something enjoyable about a story, be it novel or movie or whatever, simply by the fact that it's real makes the story all the more fascinating. this movie is based on a true story of two young american men, one a government employee and falcon enthusiastchris boyce (timothy hutton)and the otherandrew daulton lee (sean penn)is a drug dealer. these two begin selling government, mostly cia, secrets in 1975 to the soviet union.the film focuses on the human aspect of the two men, as well as their growing personal problems (especially penn's character with ever-worsening drug addictions), rather than glorifying their status as traitors to america, which would, no doubt, hurt the film's credibility in the us. boyce gradually becomes more cautious and eventually frustrated and paranoid as their dealings drag on and they dig ever deeper into treacherous territory. daulton becomes more dependent and addicted to cocaine and heroin as he becomes more frightened, and more desperate to maintain control over a situation he has no control overon top of which, he already has problems with the law. the torment of boyce and daulton's families because of the way they lead their lives is also well portrayed and adds well to the idea that espionage against one's country, even if thought to be done justly, leads only to major problems and the ruination of livesincluding the degradation of the friendship and trust between the two main characters.here's the breakdown:the good:--hutton and penn each did extensive research on the characters to capture their individual look and feel, so they're portrayed with extensive depth and realism.--the acting is excellent.--the atmosphere of paranoia builds quite well.--the story is fascinating, and of course, as one based on actual events, it has some added kick.--nice sets.--the soviets working with the boyce and daulton are portrayed very well, and not stereotyped or given evil consciences just for the sake of making them look bad.didn't hurt it, didn't help:--the music is alright, nothing perfect though.--sound effects are occasionally a little iffysuch was the case with a lot of films from the seventies through the eighties.the bad:--chris boyce (timothy hutton) has a relationship with a woman that we hardly know. because of boyce's trouble brewing with the us and soviet governments, her life can be put in jeopardybut this isn't as expanded upon as it feels it should've been. minor problem, though.the ugly:--the apparent simplicity required to sell government secrets is a little unnerving. nothing like a constant state of unreadiness to keep the masses feeling as unsafe as possible.memorable scene:--seeing the first cia report accidentally sent to the wrong place with the reason being, "rough night."this was another film that suffered massive delays due to the controversial content of the story. studios and producers didn't see how a movie about two american traitors could ever be accepted by american audiences. luckily, it's filmed and portrayed with a high degree of class and quality. of course, it helps that the traitorous anti-heroes aren't portrayed heroicallymore like a couple young men who've made gross errors in judgment in their lives. as such, it becomes a very human drama, and one portrayed very well and very believably.acting: 9/10 story: 10/10 atmosphere: 8/10 cinematography: 8/10 character development: 9/10 special effects/make-up: 8/10 (little quantity, high quality) nudity/sexuality: 2/10 (one scene in a strip club) violence/gore: 7/10 (no gore, just some violence) music: 7/10 direction: 9/10cheesiness: 0/10 crappiness: 0/10overall: 8/10if you like films about espionage and spies, then you can't go wrong here. if you like dramatic films with a strong focus on the humanity of the characters, then this may also work for you. highly recommended.www.residenthazard.com

this movie is very good in term of acting and plot. the events and the setting (i.e. how chris gets the job, chris's work environment, the face-to-face between the two sides, etc) thereof, on the other hand, are found to be less than realistic.

i am not a fan of sean penn, but in contrast to my german colleague whose review appears here, i think he was perfectly cast as the neurotic, druggy character in this film. he has every nuance perfected and reminded me of several acquaintances who had similar tastes in "recreational chemistry." i saw this film but once, 10-15 years ago and this is the only part of the film that was etched indelibly on my mind. i don't say it very often, but in this case i will: bravo, sean penn! as for the story line, well, it's based on fact, and as such, it is a tragedy that people would sell their country's secrets to the then enemy. again, penn has shown what you can do if you disagree with the administration. use the freedoms you have, paid for in blood; don't break the law.

my father has worked with top secret information in the dia before and he is the one who mentioned this movie to me. when i was a kid i would always ask him what would happen if he gave away secrets and he recommended this movie.in the movie it really puts 2, almost completely different friends! in a tangle they never really knew what the outcome would really be. the snowman, daulton really cracked me up because the movie portrayed him as just some drug pusher that did not know what he was arguing about, and in the movie it seemed like he got the worst of everything. the falcon, chris is just a guy that wanted to express his feelings on u.s government in a very radical view.for movie lovers this is a must see!!!

christopher boyce (oscar-winner:timothy hutton) gives up on being a priest and he's returning home for an uncertain future. when his best friend daulton lee (oscar-winner:sean penn) is a drug dealer, who's always gets in trouble and enjoys taking drugs a bit too much. when christopher gets a job by working in a top secret government place titled "rtx". boyce and lee both have wealthy families, which they hoped to make it out of their own. when boyce decides to take secret documents out of curiosity, which these documents are supposed to be destroyed. he decides to sell these secret documents for a cheap price for the soviet union with the help of his best friend. but both of them never knew how far they will go for sealing documents for a living and since they are both amateurs. both of them have betrayed their country for top secret information.directed by the late oscar-winner:john schlesinger (the believers, eye for an eye, midnight cowboy) made an interesting character drama about two young men taking the wrong path in life. oscar-winners:hutton and penn are both extraordinary good in the film. the movie is even occasionally funny and quite disturbing at times. david suchet nearly steals the show as the man, who works for the soviet union. this picture has a familiar cast in the supporting roles. it was quite underrated, when it was first released. despite some great reviews by some of the top film critics. this picture is actually based on a true story. there's some flaws in the storytelling, like these two leads characters but overall, it's a movie worth seeing. based on a novel by robert lindsey. screenplay by oscar-winner:steven zaillian (american gangster, hannibal, schindler's list). (****/*****).

this moving was intriguing and absorbing; however, the story was a little choppy and hard to follow at times. although the two principal actors did a great job, just seeing senn penn acting with every fiber of his being and stealing every frame made this a very memorable movie. later movies have revealed him to be a not just one-role actor: he also showed comedic flair in sweet and lowdown. surprisingly talented and not the light-weight i used to think he was./

the acrobatics mixed with haunting music, make one spectacular show. the costumes are vibrant and the performances will just boggle your mind! simply amazing!

wow, don't watch this thinking it's going to be a relaxing circus evening! it will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through. circus has never been more colourful, more exciting and more breathtaking! the whole concept is truely amazing. you're taken into the world of cirque du soleil and are left with a thousand thoughts when you leave. there's only one thing left to do: get the cd and/or dvd and live through it again and again and again. get addicted! it's well worth it! must be next to the most beautiful thing on earth and one of cirque du soleil's best programmes.

this performance leaves you with no wishes. we saw it in offenbach, germany, and it is breathtaking. we only got the cheap tickets at the far back but still had a view over everything that happened. if you ever get the chance to see this live then go! it is worth the trip and if i were you i would wait a good half an hour after the show to 'cool down'. the performances are breathtaking and all around the tent there are colourfully dressed performers that are there to distract, help, smile and generally make the whole tent come alive. the music - live music!! - is as good as the cd-version: perfect! i bought a dvd later but the show that was filmed had less colourful costumes. it's the atmosphere in the tent that sweeps you from your feet. a great trip for old and young, and a great film, too

i purchased this video on vcr tape in a good-will store for us 50 cents. i have taken quite a few videos i purchased back for them to sell to others after i viewed them considering the 50 cent cost as a rental. this is the only one that will never go back. it is an explosion of artistic talent, color and sound. i don't know if i should calls it circus, dance, or both. it is bigger than life itself. they will only be able to do this well for just a few brief years in their life. these are the performers for the performers. if gene kelly and burt lancaster were alive today and saw them live they would be awe-struck. i would lend it to others to watch but i know if i do that i will never get it back.

i had the pleasure of seeing saltimbanco live before seeing the video version of the show. while nothing can compare to actually being there, the people behind the video did an amazing job of capturing the flavor, the feel, the sensation and so much more. the wonderful performances of saltimbanco's stunningly amazing troupe are beautifully captured throughout. the video flows as smoothly and artfully as the production itself. a wonderful experience.

my wife and i endorse all the positive comments below, made by other imdb members. while this is no box office smash hit it has a special charm all of its own. genuine and heart-warming.we saw this on video, at the end of a long day. we were very tired, and in bed. normally in a situation like this my wife drops off to sleep within minutes, that is, unless it is an exceptional movie and this one kept us both entertained right to the very end.perhaps younger viewers in their teens and twenties would not like this, but for the rest of us it is a true gem! see it!

this little film brings back a lot of memories, both fond and foul, of what can and does happen when one is a working musician. the not so pleasant accommodations for the band, the management of the venue jumping up and down telling you what to play, the sheer ecstasy of the applause.............. far from being farcical it is, in fact, very accurate in the way it depicts musicians, professional and otherwise, who have travelled a great distance to perform a season of gigs at a venue. there are those times when everything goes perfectly, there are those other times when you immediately start to miss your partner and wonder what the hell you are doing this far from home. in the end you have to make the best of it because there is no other way out.

this film gave me probably the most pleasant surprise of any i've ever seen. it was not a big-budget production and its premise, middle-age amateur jazz musicians get an unexpected professional engagement at a catskills-like resort, seems rather modest. what's not modest is the film's success. this is a little slice-of-life movie that is most entertaining throughout. director frank d. gilroy also wrote the script and it's full of interesting subplots and unexpected twists.the actors are journeymen who do a solid job. the biggest revelation to me was cleavon little. he plays a professional musician who is hired to fill in for an ailing band member. his attitude immediately clashes with the others. while they see it as an opportunity for big fun and a once in a lifetime thing, he sees it as his job and not a particularly interesting one. this leads to conflict but when the group gets in trouble, he steers them through. little, who died too young, really showed me he was a fine actor with this film.this movie is a true sleeper, the kind that a film fan always hopes to discover. i recommend it wholeheartedly.

night of the demons is definitely one the definitive cheesy 80's demons horror flick in the same vein as the brilliant evil dead and demons movies. this movie combines boozy sexually active teens and demons into one hell of a fun movie. a definite welcome addition after the 80's were overrun by slasher flicks, it was nice to see something a little different.the plot follows a group of teens who all meet up for a halloween party at hull house which used to be funeral parlour, hosted by angela. about 40-minutes of boozing and sexing eventually leads to a demon or demons finding their way out of the furnace and possessing each and every one of the teens. add some snazzy make-up effects, lots of gore, and cool-looking demons and you've got yourself a sweet 80's cheese-fest that would be ranked as one of the best demon-related films in many horror fans' lists.firstly i loved the setting for this movie, "hull house" is really creepy and scary and the perfect setting for a horror movie and plus when the demons emerge, that's when the action really kicks in and it becomes a night of terror and fear. this movie spawned 2 sequels, the first one in 1994 which was okay but nothing come pared to this and the third one titled demon house was absolutely horrendous. this is one of those horrors that has definitely stood the test of time and remains a true gem of mine for many years to come.all in all a fun cheesy flick with demons that's definitely worth checking out.

i saw "night of the demons 2" first before i saw "night of the demons". unfortunately, my old blockbuster thought it was a good idea to have the sequel, but no first one. looney, huh? now, i think all horror fans need this movie. it's like mcdonald's, you know it's bad for you and you'd rather have the cheesecake facotory(or whatever pricier restaurant you prefer), but you can't help but just wanting the cheap stuff.night of the demons has it all: your innocent, sexy, goes by the rules chicka-dee, your token black guy, that surprisingly doesn't get killed. you're slutty girl, you're slutty guy, you're dark girl or guy, the goof ball, the cheesy settings of a haunted house, bad acting, and lots of unnecessary nudity. isn't this stuff great? i mean, i know deep down in my heart of movies that this was pretty bad, but it was a good bad for horror movies. horror fans should enjoy and dig in!8/10

kevin tenney's "night of the demons" is an enjoyable horror film that reminds me a little bit "the evil dead".on hallowen night,a group of teens throws a party in hull house,an abandoned funeral home on the outskirts of town.lead by angela,they perform a seance-like ceremony and accidentally awaken the evil spirits that inhabit the place.one by one,the uninvited evil force possesses the teens,turning them into bloodthirsty demons."night of the demons" is a perfect horror film.it is scary,gory and pretty atmospheric.the characters are well-developed and the gore by steve johnson is pretty good.there is a gruesome impaling,a tongue being bitten off,fingers shoved into eye-sockets,etc.the scene,where suzanne(linnea quigley)shoves a tube of lipstick through her nipple is a hoot.give this one a look.followed by two sequels.

much more than any other film from that period, night of the demons represents the brainless and hugely enjoyable horror pastiche. it's undemanding fun with loads of nasty make-up effects, gorgeous looking (and horny) teenagers and adorable cliché-elements. a group of party animals, led by the alternative angela, goes to celebrate halloween in an abandoned funeral home that carries an eerie urban legend. it all starts out typical and "innocent" with dancing, drinking and the occasional flirt between youngsters that can't keep their hormones under control, but pretty soon a bloodthirsty demon possesses the hostess. in the most ingenious ways you've ever seen, the rest of the cast gets slaughtered viciously only to return as hideous creatures prowling for blood. the thing that makes this film better than most cheesy 80's horror films is finds a good balance between light-headed camp and atmospheric horror. some sequences really are creepy and the funeral house setting supplies night of the demons with an excellent tone. director tenney makes great use of the set pieces (coffins, a crematorium, endless dark hallways) and his young, enthusiast cast obviously love what they're involved in. the terrific make-up effects by a whole team of artists and designers are of course the obvious aspects to love and horror fanatics will absolutely love the large amount of severed limbs, poked out eyes and crushed skulls! the ultimate highlight however is linnea quigley's trick with the disappearing lipstick! this nymphomaniac bimbo shoves an entire tube of lipstick in her nipple and continues her sexual murder spree! terrific! night of the demons received two sequels during the 90's and, although they're still definitely worth checking out, they focus more on comedy than chills.

night of the demons (1988) was another in a long line of "teen" horror films that were released on video and pay-t.v. during that mecca of film making the eighties. but unlike most of the crap that was being peddled around, this one was actually a decent watch. a group of bored "teenagers" decide to party halloween night away with a pair of bizarre sisters (mimi kinkade and linnea quigley) at the infamous hull house. your usual cast of stereotypical teenagers are invited to the party. but an average teenage bash turns into a night of terror as they try to survive halloween night when they undead residents of hull house decide to crash the party. who'll survive this night of bloodshed and horror?a nice horror film that is best seen in the unrated version. if you watch the r-rated cut then you'll miss all of the splatter effects and nudity. stay tune for the amusing epilogue! a gory film that was followed by an equally entertaining sequel. for horror fans only!highly recommended.

the eighties produced a lot of gory little horror flicks, most of them within the slasher sub genre - thus putting this film ahead of most of the rest of its ilk. night of the demons is something of a cross between the ultimate gore film, the evil dead; and haunted house-cum-slash flick hell night. films like this usually feature a deranged/deformed madman as the lead bad guy; but here we have bloodthirsty demons, which is always more interesting than a lunatic if you ask me. there's also a lot of comedy in this film, and the first third of the movie could easily be the set up for a straight comedy film. but once the characters enter the central location; a sinister funeral home known as 'hull house' - the film morphs into the horror film that you would expect given the title. the plot line is as simple as you'd expect it to be, and we follow a bunch of kids that decide to put on a halloween party inside said funeral home. this turns out to be a bad idea, however, once it transpires that the house is possessed; and the demons start to inhabit the kids' bodies! their only salvation lies on the other side of the underground stream...but finding the gate to the grounds isn't as easy as it sounds.the film's centrepiece is the gothic mansion where the action takes place. this creaky old house makes for a great horror film location; the fact that it used to be a funeral home only adds to this. director kevin tenney shoots the house well, and a particularly good job is done of establishing the fact that the house is in the middle of nowhere and escape is difficult. the comedy towards the start of the film is generally very funny, and i was hoping it would keep up the laughs once the horror starts. the film does have its comedy moments when the kids enter hull house, but it's never overly funny and it's obvious that horror is the film's main aim. not that this is a problem; but the night of the demons could have been a lot better had it fused these elements properly. the characters are pretty much what you'd expect from this sort of film; but the acting suits the movie well, and it's clear that the young cast had a good time making this movie and it translates well to the screen. the effects are good in that they suit the film well, and as most of the death sequences are well executed; it's a good bet that most people won't get bored watching this. this isn't a classic or must see film; but i can highly recommend it as it offers a good time and will appeal to fans of silly horror fodder.

a bunch of mostly obnoxious and grossly unappealing teens go to a creepy, remote, rundown old mortuary located nearby a cemetery to attend an anything-goes all-out halloween party being hosted by freaky occult-obsessed oddball mimi kinkade and her vacuous, boy-hungry bimbette friend linnea quigley. the loutish, profane, beer-guzzling, sex-happy dipstick dimwits hold a séance as a joke (very bad idea, 'cause the desolate old dive is naturally said to be haunted by demonic spirits). of course, that ill-advised séance awakens those decidedly grumpy and hostile evil spirits, who gruesomely kill and possess a majority of the kids, turning them into ugly, fanged, clawed, boil-faced murderous ghouls who wreak the usual grisly havoc throughout the duration of an especially long, dark and harrowing night of pure terror.yep, this is essentially your umpteenth vigorously graphic and unrelenting wall-to-wall cheap shock-ridden "evil dead" rehash, replete with closed-off, there's no easy way out claustrophobic single self-confined setting, outrageously excessive splatter set pieces, an incessantly pounding hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, a total sense of gloom'n'doom-laden grim nightmarishness, and vibrantly in-your-face manic careening cinematography (the expected headlong rush-inducing hyperactive hand-held camera-work, smooth, sinuous tracking shots, crazily tittled camera angles, even the camera on a dolly doing a gracefully gliding 180 degree figure eight). fortunately, kevin s. tenney's slick, assured, stylish direction keeps the extremely threadbare and derivative proceedings thundering along at a speedy clip; moreover, tenny gives the film an attractive polished look and effectively creates a certain crudely energetic and enthusiastically grotesque spooky ooga-booga carnival funhouse atmosphere.however, steve johnson's marvelously gory and imaginative make-up effects are the true star of the show. bloodthirsty highlights include disgusting fat slob hal havins (who played a similarly irritating obese a**hole role in the immortal "sorority babes in the slimeball bowl-a-rama" around the same time) having his tongue bitten off, quigley shoving a whole tube of lipstick in one of her breasts (yow!) and gouging a guy's eyes out while she's making love to him (double yow!), a libidinous teen couple getting offed while doing exactly what you think in a coffin (the chick has her neck snapped while the dude has his arm chopped off), kinkade setting her hands on fire, and, in the film's single most nasty scene, a mean old man has his throat slit from the inside out after eating an apple piece laced with razor blades. the trashy'n'thrashy rock score likewise smokes. and then there's kinkade's incredibly wild, sexy and uninhibited demon dance, a sizzling number accompanied by a flickering strobe light and startling jump cuts that kinkade choreographed herself. okay, so this overall doesn't amount to anything more than a completely mindless and pointless, albeit quite nicely mounted and enjoyably vulgar hunk of blithely sleazy fright flick junk, but if you're in the mood for entertainingly brain-dead lowbrow horror scuzziness this cheerfully crass and juvenile dross does the trick just fine.

i neglected this film when i used to go to the movie store but then the curiosity got to me and i decided to check it out. i loved it!!! the movie starts off with judy and jay heading for a halloween party at the abandoned funeral parlor hull house. then we meet a few more characters, angela and suzzanne ( the hosts), frannie, max, rodger, sal and helen. then of course they start to party and when they''re really in the mood they decide to have a séance which awakens a demon. the demon possesses angela and she starts her gruesome slaughtering. will they survive the night of the demons.the movie was overall great. the gore was fine but the nudity provided by linnea quigley (trash from rotld) once again screws it. i never was a fan of hers and never will be.

it's the old, old story : kids have a party in an old house, demons are unleashed, death and gratuitous nudity ensues. you all know it, it's still a lot of fun.many people (okay, many horror fans, to be specific) have fond memories of this movie and it's always with slight trepidation that you revisit an old movie to see if it's still as good as you used to think it was. luckily, this is.it has something for everyone (well, everyone who happens to be male, i suppose). from a fun title sequence to a shoplifting scam involving cunning use of linnea quigley's ass to the "mirror" scene to the full on demonic fun, this is a blast from start to finish.the girls are cute, the guys are . . . . male, the death scenes are well done with some good gore effects and, unlike some horrors from the era, this actually keeps a good sense of atmosphere and even tension throughout. don't get me wrong, it's still fun first and foremost but it offers some nice, freaky moments that should please most genre fans.

this isn't the video nasty night of the demon as there are more than one. actually, there is only one, but it multiplies.after it inhabits suzanne (scream queen linnea quigley), she passes it on to goth girl angela (amelia kinkade) through a nice long kiss.next, we see linnea showing us her quigleys in the bathroom. she shows a lot more as jay (lance fenton) thinks he is in for some fun.soon, everything literally goes to hell as bodies drop one by one and are possessed. judy (cathy podewell) and max (philip tanzini) are the last two trying to escape. max isn't much help, leaving it to judy to figure a way out.the makeup was absolutely fantastic, and the only thing that kept this from being even better was the extremely long build up to the action.the old man (harold ayer) who appears in the beginning will be back and get his just desserts.linnea quigley may be the scream queen, but cathy podewell definitely showed the greatest lungs in this film.

a group of obnoxious teens go to a former funeral parlor for a halloween party. they get trapped inside, and become possessed by demons that they have accidentally awakened. the possessed teens start killing the others off and seem to be led by angela (mimi kinkade) who floats and talks in a really deep voice. the remaining teens that haven't been possessed yet are forced to fight off the demons and try to escape the house.this is a pretty decent horror film with great special effects which include linnea quigley (who has a couple nude scenes as usual) gouging out a guy's eyeballs and pushing a tube of lipstick into her nipple. there's also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin and a guy getting his tongue bitten out. this is a great film to watch with a bunch of friends late at night while eating some pizza. the terrible acting and atrocious dialog almost ruins it though. overall, i would give it a 7 out of 10.

the 80's is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun. sometimes, there were some definite brains behind it all ("evil dead ii", "night of the creeps" and "return of the living dead" for example) and then there were those movies that were mindless but had a definite low rent charm and were perfect for a night with beer and friends. movies like "pieces" and "blood diner" stacked rental shelves in the 80's and 90's, offering little in intelligence or craftsmanship but plenty in dumb entertainment. kevin tenney's 1988 movie "night of the demons" is a part of this tradition-stupid, poorly acted and not an original bone in it's body, but dammit if you don't have a good time.the plot is so simplistic it just had to come from the 80's: a group of dumb teens played by a bunch of actors in their mid to late 20's decide to go to a party at hull house thrown by angela (mimi kinkade) and suzanne (scream queen legend linnea quigley.) well, angela and co. decide to throw a séance. this turns out to be as will arnett's "arrested development" character gob would call it, a "huge mistake," because a demonic force soon possesses angela, and starts to get to the others as well.take "the evil dead", "a nightmare on elm street" and your average dumb dead teen flick, throw them in a blender, and "night of the demons" is what you get. the movie is anything but original, and really, it's not a good movie. the whole thing is insanely derivative, the acting is terrible, the jokes often fall flat, the characters are annoying (especially the character of stooge) and the plot holes are numerous. that out of the way, it's still a lot of fun. so why? well for one thing, the make up and gore effects are top notch, with some really memorable moments (especially a nasty and just plane odd bit with a tube of lipstick) that really stick out. it also rarely if ever takes itself too seriously, yet with the exception of some terrible puns, plays it straight and never wastes the audiences time with winking self awareness. plus, there's a definite energy and enthusiasm to the whole enterprise that's almost impossible to resist. yeah, it's nothing special, but it knows that, and it couldn't be more proud of that fact. it's a goofy party horror movie, and it never pretends to be anything more.it might not be a classic, but "night of the demons" is a good example of horror junk food done right. it might not be too memorable or original, but sometimes you don't want a fancy beer. sometimes you want a budweiser.

this movie took me by surprise. the opening credit sequence features nicely done animation. after that, we're plunged into a semi-cheesy production, betraying its low budget. the characters, typical american teens, are introduced slowly, with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this. by the time the shlitz hits the fan, we know each one of the characters, and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities. it's a slow uphill set-up, kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster. thankfully, once the action kicks in, it's full blown old school horror! steve johnson's make-up effects are awesome. equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films. and the scares are jolting. kevin tenney delivers his best movie ever, with heart-stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set-ups. the tongue-in-cheek, sometimes cheesy, humor marks this film as pure 80s horror, as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like "night of the living dead" or "hills have eyes." but for true horror fans, this one is worth checking out. play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of "house on the haunted hill." the set-up and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking?

i love this young people trapped in a house of horrors movie. not just because i'm a huge linnea quigley-jill terashita fan, but because it is a lot of fun and actually scary at times.the special effects are awesome, especially linnea's scene with the lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessed.plenty of nudity provided by linnea and jill, plenty of humor, cool soundtrack, high body count, etc...by the way, if you have never seen this one, try and buy/watch the unrated version which has more gore and some scenes the rated version is missing.

i remember watching this film as a kid and i was in complete awe of it, i couldn't take my eyes of the television. this movie has it all for horror fans! this movie had no funny moments expect a couple of one liners by stooge(who was my favorite character in the film) kevin tenney directed this jewel and did a wonderful job with a low budget, i thought the end was awesome the only thing that could stop them was by surviving the night they were unstoppable killing machines! the effects done by steve johnson we're excellent i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a love for low budget horror movies because as the old saying goes they don't make them like this anymore. the sequels were pretty good too, but not as good as good as the original. this is a must have in any horror collection, buy it if you can find it you won't be disappointed

this movie was great don't understand the disrespect it get's. i first scene this in like 87-88 and it was actually scary, if you are an 80's horror fan you should have no problem with this film it has everything that makes 80's horror great. i got to meet a few of the actor's and they were cool. what is not great about a creepy old house,demons,crazy party & horny good looking young people. the dialog and the special fx made this movie a classic. this film also took care of one of those classic rumors about horror the black guy does not alway's have to die in the end.even though this movie was great there is one thing that remains undiscovered to me what really happened to the old couple at the end was it on purpose or not that little side story thing alway's had me puzzled.

i must say. this is easily one of my favorite movies to watch on halloween. the halloween party, the horrid acting, the guy dressed like and extra from miami vice. great great great!!!*********************spoilers***************************i have a huge place in my heart for random 80's horror flicks and this one reached out and tugged at my heart strings. i always passes this flick at blockbuster and always laughed at the cover of the box. now every weekend i would grab a random movie i had never seen before...one weekend it was angelas turn. she seemed to have been taunting me for months. so i took it home put it in and spent most of the movie underneath the blanket.for me, it was terrifying and gross. and not just the acting! some of the things they came up with for this movie was amazing. i can honestly say the best part for me was watching suzanne (played by a fellow iowan) stick a tube of lipstick through her nipple. it was random and i loved it. watching creepy angela float through the hallways and hearing her creepy demon voice was enough to have me awake all night long! it isn't one of the most clever or best acted horror movies. but its 80's cheese and its got all the elements you need. creepy goth kid, virgin, slut, naked girls, scary house, bad acting, oh and did i mention naked girls? all the elements were there and were put together in such a way that made for one of my fave movies. kudos to the filmmakers.

i remember seeing this film in the theater and liking it. i happened to stumble upon it on fear net last month and watched it again and found it better with age. first of all for those of you who describe this as 80s cheese if you objectively compare it with the horror flicks of the past 2 decades it compares quite well if stacked up against films in its unique horror sub genre which i would term action/horror as opposed to psychological horror such as "the shining" or "the exorcist".furthermore for its budget this film really delivers the goods (or in this instance bad). the film actually has some character development and gives enough of a history of the infamous hull house to get the atmosphere right before the characters set foot in the front door. the film also has several hilarious one liners and gives the appropriate mood that a creepy horror flick should have. if you compare nod to contemporary big budget horror films such as "i am legend" (the vincent price version was much better) this film really stands out. modern horror flicks have become almost completely dominated by cgi. most have no plot or character devel at all and are completely predictable. the special effects dominate these movies from start to finish and the characters are 24k plastic. if this is 80s horror cheese i'll take it over 95% of current entries in the genre.on a closing note seeing nod again made me remember the beautiful jill terashita and wonder why i have not seen her in more films horror or otherwise. jill on the odd chance that you read this- i think you are gorgeous and should have been in more films. lastly, if you like action horror flicks you will probably like this one a lot.

penelope spheeris (of "wayne's world" fame) made her mark with the documentary "the decline of western civilization", about the la punk scene in the late '70s and early '80s. most of the documentary features interviews with the punks and footage of concerts (which often turn violent). overall, we get to see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies: whereas the hippies were into being natural, the punks wanted to have themselves as altered as possible, what with spiked hair and all. but also, we see how they're really disaffected and sometimes becoming skinheads.anyway, this is a really great time capsule. we're not really sure whether we want to long for that era or feel repulsed by it. but this is definitely not a documentary that will leave you neutral. truly worth seeing.

spheeris debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time. and as far as i know it's also the only one that focuses on the l.a. punk explosion of the early eighties. it's all there: not just great, great bands like black flag, fear, x, the germs, whose names may not mean much to you today, but whose influence on today's alternative rock music can not be over-estimated, but also the promoters, the media and first of all the audiences - the punks - all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh, shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy, the anger and the fury these youths put into their music. where is that today? the eighties may have sucked big time when it cames to mainstream music, but the underground was rocking. if you need a proof for that, watch fear's performance in decline. unmatched. great film! how come this is not available on vid, ld or dvd? p.s. the follow-up decline pt. ii is hilarious, too

first of all, i reviewed this documentary because i had an interest in the subject it portrayed, the la punks.i listened that music and i loved that music and i read a lot of the small zines that were made in the early 80's and that were not so easily achieved in finland.so if you don't like this kind of music why you write here about it? i like this kind of music, it speaks my soul, thus i know punks from all over europe & americas, so why do you, who find this music "repugnant" care to comment at all?

i saw this movie in the theater when i was 14 and it changed my life. i immediately cut off my hair and began buying all of the records of the bands in the movie. these were some of the seminal bands of l.a. punk rock caught on film at the peak of their powers. bands like black flag (pre-rollins), circle jerks, fear, x, and the germs have few equals in the history of punk music. i can't believe this film has never been put out on video or dvd. great movie for fans of punk rock.

i just got the dvd for hardware wars, in a shiny new package, looking irresistable. stuck it in my dvd player to find a slew of extra fun stuff. the extra content on the dvd is even longer than the movie. for those of you that have (shame!) never seen hardware wars, it one fantastically silly star wars spoof (of episode iv, of course). household appliances (such as irons, toasters, vacuums, and a waffle maker) stand in for ty-fighters, x-wings, r2d2, and the death star. instead of princess leia, we have princess ann-droid, complete with cinnabon hairdo. you get the point, i'm sure. mad silliness, and a fun ride for any star wars geek (like me!)now, the dvd - wow! a director's commentary where he basically goes off on the movie, making fun of himself and the project throughout. an interview with fosselius on creature features (remember that?!) and hilarious "director's cut" and "foreign version" of the movie (all jokes of course). anyway, this is great. i loved hardware wars in the theater, and am so glad for having the dvd in my collection - wedged in between mst3k: the movie and thumb wars!

undoubtedly the funniest movie i have ever seen. it's definitely worth the fourteen minutes it takes to watch. i will never look at my kitchen appliances the same way again. bob knickerbocker deserves an oscar. "relax, kid. it's only a movie"

i caught this little gem totally by accident back in 1980 or '81. i was at a revival theatre to see two old silly sci-fi movies. the theatre was packed full and (with no warning) they showed a bunch of sci-fi short spoofs (to get us in the mood). most were somewhat amusing but this came on and, within seconds, the audience was in hysterics! the biggest laugh came when they showed "princess laia" having huge cinnamon buns instead of hair on her head. she looks at the camera, gives a grim smile and nods. that made it even funnier! you gotta see "chewabacca" played by what looks like a muppet! it was extremely silly and stupid...but i couldn't stop laughing. most of the dialogue was drowned out because of all the laughter. also if you know "star wars" pretty well it's even funnier--they deliberately poke fun at some of the dialogue. this really works with an audience! a definite 10!

done on a spare change budget of twenty bucks tops, this cheapie thirteen minute short cheerfully parodies george lucas' legendary '77 sci-fi blockbuster "star wars" in the most infectiously dumb way imaginable. writer/director ernie fosselius delivers a winning and often gut-busting blend of ludicrous sound effects, ineptly staged action scenes, cruddy (far from) special effects (you just gotta love the cheesy scratched-on-film lasers, tinfoil asteroids, and household appliances ... eer, i mean spaceships being swung around on obvious wires), badly dubbed in dialogue, shamelessly hammy acting, and richard wagner's rousing piece of classical music "ride of the valkyries." the characters are presented in suitably broad strokes; my favorites are whiny wimp fluke starbucker, venerable jedi knight auggie "ben" doggie, and hateful arch villain darph nader (who spouts nothing but incomprehensible gibberish). moreover, 4-q-3 is clearly based on the tin man from "the wizard of oz" while artie deco is definitely a cheap vacuum cleaner. this film's true masterstroke is casting legendary voice actor supreme paul frees as the narrator; frees' deliciously rich and plummy histrionic tones add immensely to the considerable silly, yet sidesplitting tongue-in-cheek merriment (choice lines: "you'll laugh! you'll cry! you'll kiss three bucks goodbye!"). a total hoot.

the hysterical hardware wars is finally out on dvd. hw has earned its niche among parody classics and is not only a riotous little 20 minute short but a staple in low budget film production classes, which is where a lot of the film's cult status is derived from and resides. with the dvd, not only do we get a chance to revisit the original parody (4q2, cinnamon-bun head, ballistic toast, et al) that ernie f. did in 1978, but there is a lot of additional material showcasing the fosselius wit. antique sideshow is a dead-on parody that is very funny but makes a statement about the confluence of ignorance and greed at the same time. the director's commentary is also hysterical, as is the creature feature which parodies taking a film out on the talk-show circuit and actually is based on taking hw out on the talk show circuit, albeit the public access circuit. i'd love to see ernie, michael wiese and crew take on some other, contemporary overblown and overbudgeted targets to parody -- like just about any film that hollywood churns out at $100 million a pop these days -- not so much the crafty films like spider man or men in black (actually parodies themselves!) but any number of overblown, overhyped, overwrought and overpriced features.

out of all the parodies of star wars i've seen, this is probably the funniest. not because of the premise, star wars with simple electronics instead of spaceships, but because of how poorly acted it is. this is purposely overacted, and it makes it hilarious, and since everyone knows its purposely overacted, no one complains. the special effects were also purposely as awful as can be, and include a toaster on a visible string that shoots toast, and an egg beater on a string. this short is funny for any fan of star wars (which i'm not), or anyone that has 15 minutes to kill. great short!! my rating: *** out of ****. 13 mins. not rated.

i was lucky enough to see a test screening of 'el padrino' a couple months ago in santa monica. i was blown away. you don't see films like this anymore. in the vein of scosese, chapa deftly tells the tragic story of kilo as he maneuvers the tough streets of la to rise above the ranks to become a drug lord of escobarian proportions. the characters are complex and conflicted. the emotions are real. the action is fast and furious. the stunts are expansive. and tilly is hot. she hasn't looked this good since her 'bound' days. i'd recommend this to anyone. it's a fantastic homage to the epic action films of the late 80s and early 90s. and to all the naysayers out there watch it again; you obviously had your eyes closed the first time. congrats to all involved in the film. i'm counting the days until the sequel is released. anyone have a date on that?

finally a gangster movie worth watching!jennifer tily should get nominated for her role as tough murdering femme fatal!this movie flies like a bird , just a fast paced non stop gangster mayhem!jennifer tily is just so beautiful and bad in this movie.i was shocked to find faye dunaway still lives! the cast in this movie are so fitted to their roles. a real cool soundtrack rides along side and you get swept into the spanish soul of this film.the story is original deep and poetic.this flick has a lot of substance and never rests.the gang of spanish fire just set everything on screen alight.damian chapa is a joy to watch and a movie star.sit back and enjoy the ride.

this movie is the latino godfather. an unlikely mobster bridges the gap to some unlikely alliances and forms an empire. i enjoyed the action and gunfights along with the brash acting and colorful characters. this movie is no oscar winner, but definitely entertaining. hey, who needs an oscar anyway? chapa has got some balls to direct& act ( i think he produced it too?) this movie. reminds me of another filmmaker who likes to do it all, robert rodrigez. keep it up, is there a sequel in the works? there are a bunch of strings that need to be tied. son comes back and avenges dads death?

the 1979 film musical of hair was loosely based on the infamous 1960's broadway musical that became famous because of its infamous nude scene. the stage musical isn't really much more than a group of skits strung together with some amusing musical numbers; however for the film director milos foreman (who won an oscar for directing one flew over the cuckoo's nest) and the writers have taken the basic premise of the play and the score and constructed a real story to make the show more "user friendly" for the big screen. in the film, naive farm boy claude hooper buchowski (john savage) is about to go into the army and decides to spend a couple of days in new york where he meets a group of aging hippies (treat williams, dorsey wright, annie golden, don dacus)who get him involved in a group of nutty misadventures, including the pursuit of a snooty society girl (beverly d'angelo). the story divides into a series of vignettes that range from the ridiculous to the sublime, but it is all gorgeously photographed with a clever use of nyc locations and imaginatively staged musical numbers (outstandingly choreographed by the legendary twyla tharp). treat williams lights up the screen as berger, the unconventional and free-spirited hippie who does his best to get claude to loosen up and is matched scene for scene by savage as claude, who brings a lovely sweetness to the role of claude. annie golden is a charmer as jeannie, the pregnant hippie who is pregnant by wright or dacus, doesn't know which one is the father and doesn't seem to care. there is one outstanding musical number after another here..."aquarius" is a tour through central park which includes dancing horses...treat williams disrupts a fancy dinner party in "i got life"..."black boys/white boys" features the late nell carter and ellen foley extolling the ethnic virtues of men and "easy to be hard" is a powerful rendering of one of the best songs in the show by original cast member cheryl barnes, who plays wright's ex-girlfriend and mother of his child. this is a beautifully photographed, well-acted sung, and danced psychedelic acid trip of a movie that must be seen and once seen, will initiate multiple viewings as this dazzler has to much to offer to catch it all in one showing.

(may contain spoilers) i find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives. while it is most certainly not perfect, it is much better than it is given credit for. the acting and photography are excellent. some of the musical numbers are great; including the title number, "where do i go?", "easy to be hard", and "black boys/white boys". while i have not seen the stage musical, i think that it clouds the judgement of many. this is not the musical you see in theatres. do not attempt to compare them. the theatrical musical might have been sensational to watch, but it would never have had the same effect on film, so a plot had to be added. and the ending that has been added is just amazing. the movie left me feeling like i had actually watched something important, unlike most of today's movies, which only satisfy on one level.

the first time i ever saw this movie was when i was four years old. i remember loving it and everything about it. 13 years later, i am now 17, and decided to watch it about a month ago because i am taking a 1960's class in school. i didn't really know what to expect, since it had been 13 years since i last saw it, but i was completely blown away by it. the actors were amazing, the music was so fun, and i now find myself singing along to every song. treat williams is great as berger, the "leader" of the hippie group, who always gets what he wants, one way or another (except for at the very end, of course). john savage is actually very convincing as claude, the oklahoma draftee who falls in love with sheila (beverly d'angelo). d'angelo is lovely as the prim and proper rich girl who eventually rebels against her upbringing and joins the hippies. the other hippies are played by annie golden, don dacus, and dorsey wright. annie golden is just adorable as jeannie, the girl who is pregnant but still as cute and innocent as a child. don dacus and dorsey wright are good as woof and hud, the other two members of the group, and cheryl barnes, who plays hud's fiancée, has an amazing voice. the only problem i have with this movie, however, is that the relationship between claude and sheila is not very convincing. they are barely ever shown together, and when they are, they fight (remember the skinny dipping scene?). it seems as though their relationship is very weak, and by the end of the movie we are supposed to believe they are madly in love, only based on the few meetings they had. i also see that many people writing reviews here are upset by the pg rating this movie has. i personally would raise the rating up to a pg-13, only because there is some drug use... but remember in 1979, pg-13 didn't exist. i don't think the nudity is bad at all, it is in no way sexual (in fact, there isn't really any sex at all in this movie), and it is only to show the childlike innocence that the group maintains. in most european countries, nudity isn't regarded as something bad, and i don't see why it is here in the us. anyways, i give this movie a high rating, and i'm glad it was made back then, because in the insanely "politically correct" world of today, they wouldn't even think of making it, and even if they did, it would be a very "watered down" version, and i'm sure you wouldn't get the full effect. in conclusion, this is a very underrated film that is definitely worth checking out.

now more than ever we need peace & love in this world!this film really showcases the wonderful music of the broadway show, and the fabulous choreography of the legendary twila tharp! i saw it again after many years, and it still holds up well.thank you, mgm/ua for putting this on dvd! i love the option of seeing in widescreen. mgm rocks for doing this on many of their dvd releases.ya gotta love treat williams as berger and john savage as claude. they couldn't have picked better actors & actresses for this film! beverly d'angelo is such a 'hot mama' in this film--i had forgotten just how hot! wow!the supporting cast is absolutely great,with the late great nell carter making a singing cameo in a couple of scenes, as well as the kooky charlotte ray (mrs. garrett on 'facts of life')the story gets a little weak toward the end, but the anti-war sentiment of the late 60's still holds up, and is relevant today. it's beautifully filmed (quite a bit on location) and is so colorful and lovely and really brings the spirit of 1968 back on the big screen.i saw this movie when it was released in 1979 when i was 15, and was moved by it then, and it still moves me now at 40. some other reviews on here say they think it should have been made sooner--i don't think hollywood was ready to make such a movie back in the late 60's-early 70's.the vietnam war ended in 1975, and the whole thing hit a little too close to home, i think for this story to be filmed before it was (like in 1969, 70, 71)bravo to director milos foreman! i love this film!!!!!!!it's nice to see it again, this time on dvd. it never looked better!

from producer/writer/golden globe nominated director james l. brooks (terms of endearment, as good as it gets) this is a really good satirical comedy film showing behind the scenes in the life of a news reporter/anchor/journalist or producer might be like. basically jane craig (oscar and golden globe nominated holly hunter) falls for new reporter tom grunick (oscar and golden globe nominated william hurt), but correspondent aaron altman (oscar nominated albert brooks) also has strong feelings for her. the network prepares for big changes, and sparks will fly with all members of the studio. also starring jack nicholson as anchor bill rorich, moonraker's lois chiles as jennifer mack, mrs. doubtfire's robert prosky as ernie merriman, school of rock's joan cusack as blair litton, peter hackes as paul moore, christian clemenson as bobby, robert katims as martin klein, ed wheeler as george wein and stephen mendillo as gerald grunick. the comedy is subtle but strong, the romance has it's moments, and it is certainly a believable situation film. it was nominated the oscars for best cinematography, best film editing, best writing, screenplay written directly for the screen and best picture, and it was nominated the golden globe for best motion picture - comedy/musical and best screenplay - motion picture. it was number 64 on 100 years, 100 laughs. very good!

"broadcast news" is directed by james l. brooks (terms of endearment, as good as it gets) and has a great cast, including william hurt, albert brooks, and holly hunter. everyone gives a good performance, but they're all too unlikable to really care about them.some parts of the film are really brilliant, such as the prologue, and the short scenes with jack nicholson. the main reason it doesn't entirely work, is it's a film that relies on the characters being amusing rather than amusing things happening to them.you could consider it nothing more than a drama, but it's often too silly to be successful there as well. still, the script makes it worth a watch. certainly not for everyone.7.0 out of 10

i say sadly because if you see this movie now, you realize how low our media has sunk- all the warning signs are in this movie.it's a great film, i think the last great james brooks film, but others may disagree. it has rich characters (who are believable as well), great acting, great writing, and although the music got a little cheesy, i even liked that.william hurt has never been better. holly hunter is stunning. and albert brooks walks away with every scene he's in- this triangle of people is beautifully drawn and compelling and made the whole movie soar above it's vital and important topic of the news, and how it's slowly being compromised in our nation.watch this with network for a truly fun and frightening evening.

james l. brook is one of those directors who always seems to take a quirky look at life. he isn't only the producer for "the simpsons," he has some classic comedies under his belt -- "broadcast news" is one of them.although it doesn't match his later effort "as good as it gets," "broadcast news" is still a very clever, funny and witty movie about a television broadcasting station and all the problems they suffer. there's a great comedic sequence of physical humor where joan cusack is running around the building trying to rush a news tape to the editing room in a matter of mere minutes before it is to be broadcast live on tv.this isn't only very truthful in terms of how hectic broadcasting stations are operated, but also a skillful and honest portrayal of human beings.a low-key, subtle movie with good acting (especially from hurt, who i don't always like so much) and apt direction.

i'm sitting around going through movie listings and not really seeing anything i want to see. my appetite keeps saying, "something like broadcast news." that's what i want. something smart and funny, with adult ideas and great acting and writing, and a directorial style that doesn't call attention to itself. this may well be hurt's best performance (is this or the big chill, to my mind): however eccentric, hurt is smart, and to play an unintelligent person without making sure -- wink wink -- the audience knows -- wink wink -- hey, i'm not stupid... well, that's fine acting right there. hunter is note-perfect, and albert brooks is a revelation. (and he can read and sing at the same time!) great, great work.

essential viewing for anyone who watches tv news as it may help to become a little more sceptical, or even cynical. on a personal note i recall taking a course some years ago about being interviewed for tv - what to do, what not to do. the course instructors impressed on us that tv news was a "branch of show-biz". that depressing view, which is probably even more valid today than when it was made, is reinforced by this film. never mind journalistic integrity, what counts is the ability to look good and smile nicely. and make sure you don't sweat on camera.the interactions between the three main characters form the centre-piece, each with his or her own ambitions, capabilities and beliefs. brooks takes these differences and sets them into the volatile setting of a tv news studio, and adds more than a pinch of love interest to the mixture. the result is a complex, if somewhat overlong, portrayal of how we compromise every day in order to meet our ambitions and take others with us. it is always entertaining, although the final scene was, perhaps, unnecessary given everything that had gone before.

excellent movie about a big media firm and the goings on both on and off camera. covering several years, the film centers on 3 upwardly mobile, young hopefuls, all striving for their place within the corporation. well written dialogue, flawless acting, and a riveting story made for 2 hours of solid entertainment.

truly a wonderful movie. bruce willis gives his always-outstanding comedic-romantic acting power to this message-movie and the movie brings hope to the losers many of us know we are. a gift to everyone of middle age whose spent time seems both full and yet empty: there is more around the next bend and it can be great, enriching, and romantic. leave the recent past and return to the lessons of the distant past, and then take off on a favorite flight to your better future. if we could re-live our youthful experiences, if we could really remember the events that shaped us, wouldn't we find a special kind of freedom? see the movie, open the gift.

it is so nice to see bruce willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he really is a talented actor. he shines in this film as the near-40-year-old image consultant who has totally lost touch with his inner child--until he meets him face to face. this is one of those rare films that doesn't talk down to its audience and truly offers something for the whole family. it is about caring for each other, keeping some of the child inside you, and realizing that you don't grow up exactly the way you thought you would. willis seems to be building an impressive track record for working with kids (just witness "the sixth sense" with haley joel osment), and he has great chemistry with spencer breslin here. there is some nice photography and music, and the ending is wonderful and uplifting. a great film to see with every member of your family.

as a word of explanation, disney's "the kid" has absolutely nothing in common with the charlie chaplin 1921 classic of the same name. what we do have is a pleasant enough, though unbelievable, feel good family comedy as only the folks at disney can provide. bruce willis, in a change of pace, plays a self-centered stuffed shirt of an "image consultant". he degrades, not only his clients, but those close to him as well. you know that he is going to have to change before the final credits. into his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of willis' character as a nerdy 8 year old played with cutesy pie conviction by spencer breslin (disney always finds these kids somewhere). this forces willis to come to grips with his past and well..you know the rest. appearing as willis' love interest is emily mortimer and lily tomlin as his executive assistant. both have little enough to do as most of the movie involves the inter-action between the willis and breslin characters. "the kid", though not the greatest of disney movies is one nonetheless that you can sit down and watch with your family and come away from with a warm feeling.

while my kids enjoyed the movie (and announced afterward that they want to buy it later) i think i got more out of it that they did. the scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life (i did not use the cutting comment aloud, but i thought it). it is a feel good mid-life movie, a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others (why does the kid stay with bruce willis after he knows his mom is dying?), but all in all and good time. it also gave our family something to talk about - did my kids think my life was boring? what do they expect at 40? how can you not like a movie that gets a good conversation going with your kids?

this is my favourite film and i think it is perfect. unlike virtually any other film i can name, i never watch this film and think it would have been better if they'd changed this or that or whatever. is this the definition of a work of art? i think so. every brushstroke in mishima is perfect and it all flows from the schrader's script. i've always sort of liked paul schrader's work (you can't argue with taxi driver and light sleeper is an amazing film), but while his writing often seems to border on the bombastic, his directing style is usually non-existent. this is deliberate, i think, because his films usually deal with a search for redemption and are set in the real world; ugly and harsh. his style suits his themes as he presents his characters in a simple and realistic way, and lets them show the audience the truth of the situation. imagine if schrader had directed taxi driver or bringing out the dead, instead of scorsese. but like the protagonists of those two films, while mishima the man was ideal schrader material, right-wing, vain and at odds with society, his works were subtle and beautiful. in fact he had a secondary writing career as a woman's writer, churning out what can reasonably be described as romantic potboilers. so you wouldn't necessarily imagine that schrader was the ideal man to capture that subtlety and beauty on film. i think the film shows that he was. the script he helped fashion splits mishima the man into three parts; his life, his death and his mind. his life is represented in black and white, still camera, formal compositions. his death, for which he will always be best remembered, is handheld documentary style. and his mind is represented by the dramatised extracts from his novels, each one revealing the thought processes of this complex man, who hardly ever wrote a character that wasn't a reflection of himself. these dramatisations are beautiful to look at, thanks to eiko ishioka's remarkable production design and schrader's imaginative staging. in all parts, the acting is superb, especially from ken ogata as mishima, who captures the essential charm, arrogance and narcissism of the man. the photography is excellent throughout and contains images that the viewer will retain forever. finally, the music is simply superb, perfectly matching the images, although written and recorded before shooting, adjusted during the editorial process and then re-recorded. how much the music influenced the shoot i do not know, but it bonds perfectly to the image. i have seen many ideas of what various people think the theme of the film is, what schrader is trying to say. you know, the big stuff about life, death etc. but i do not think the film is saying anything. mishima has already said it, the film simply repeats.

there are very few films that are able to tell such a complicated story on so many levels as well as mishima: a life in four chapters. one of the most difficult aspects of story telling is the ability to flashback and forward without losing the pace of the film. this film not only flashes back and fourth with the greatest of easy, but it also flows through some of yukio mishima greatest stories. this film exceeds in every aspect and is a joy to watch. not to mention the incredible philip glass soundtrack.

movies are something you see on saturday night and forget by sunday morning. motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever. mishima falls into the latter category. this is the type of thing that should win academy awards, a brilliant, visual peice of film that is both depressing and uplifting. instead of doing a straightforward look at the life of yukio mishima, director paul schrader interweaves three adaptations of the author's stories into a look at his past and final day on earth, the day he tried to lead the japanese military into rebellion in the name of the emperor. failing to do that, he commits ritual suicide in an ending that hits you like a ton of bricks. the three short story adaptations allow a look into what led him to this and are presented in an experimental way that makes them appear to be filmed stage plays. ken ogata is magnificent as mishima. despite his eccentricities, he comes off as very sympathetic, a man who is quite willing to die for his beliefs and does. this makes the ending that much more devastating and the sense of loss more meaningful. of the three story adaptations, temple of the golden pavilion, kyoko's house and runaway horses, it is the last that is the strongest and most emotional. it also is the story that most closely matches mishima's mood in his final years and illustrates what truly led him to the events of november 1970. this review cannot be complete without a mention of philip glass' striking musical score. not since 2001 has a film score been such a perfect compliment to it's visuals. paul schrader crafted one of the most beautiful movies of the 1980s or any other decade for that matter. have the hankies at the ready because the ending will leave you in tears. mishima: a life in four chapters reminds you that sometimes film can still be an art form and as art it is brilliant.

it has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film. initially, i was struck by the stylized sets, but found the rest slow going and dull. i thought that such a sensational subject needed the ken russell treatment to take it way over the top. i now find the enforced restraint (placed on the production by mishima's widow) to be an asset. some of the more lurid aspects of mishima's life are reiterated and dramatized by corresponding themes from his novels. i think it helps to be familiar with the novels - that's what finally made the difference for me. still feel the film overall could be a little tighter and warmer, but it's genuinely unique, and deserves serious attention. love the fact that the japanese characters speak japanese - not english. the philip glass score is mesmerizing.

mishima is one of the greatest films ever made. now i think paul schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time, but i don't really like the films he's directed of what i've seen (with the exception of this and affliction), but this is an amazing, disturbing, and highly 3-dimensional character study. it follows the life of yukio mishima, japan's most celebrated writer, combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories. i don't know how, but paul schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way. the acting is great, so is the photography, and a perfect score by philip glass. although confusing the first viewing, this is one of the few films that becomes richer with each viewing. truly an underrated gem of a film.

one would think that a film based on the life of the japanese author yukio mishima would be a daunting if not impossible task. however paul schrader has indeed made a film "about" mishima that is both superb & complex. while it is not a literal biography, schrader & his co-screenwriter leonard scharder (his brother) have taken several incidents from his life, including his sucide and crafted what can best be described as incidental tableaus that are visually sparse and stunning. mishima's homosexuality is almost not there, due to legal threats from his widow, but in spite of this, the film is still terrific, and one of the best films i saw in 1985. i should also mention the important contribution of philip glass who did the score, which adds an additional texture to the film, and is superior to the one he did for scorsese's kundun. also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar. hopefully this film will soon be available on dvd.

the first season told pretty much how all elements of the marine corps would operate (i.e. ground, air, helicopters and jets) as a team. that's the season i give the high rating to! (true, there are still a lot of "liberties" taken in season 1, but the stories were more believable.)the subsequent seasons were a gawd-awful attempt of melrose place meets top gun! i was a marine stationed at miramar at the time and i remember them shooting the show around the san diego area. i got to talk to rod rowland and james brolin.rowland's character was good to go.brolin's character was good in the first season only. for some reason he slacked off after the first ep of the second season.if you want to see a little of how the marine air ground team operates, then season one is the one to watch.if you're into melrose place and soap opera like plots with an attempt to merge them into top gun, then see the last two seasons.

this was one of my favorite shows when i was a kid. it had it all--music, stories, a talking squirrel, and chuckling daisies. i wanted to be one of those hippie chicks singing and swinging on a swing. i'm 35 and i grew up in south jersey, but we got three new york channels with our cable hook-up, and i think it was on channel 11. they just don't make shows like this anymore (i know that makes me sound really old), and it blows my mind that i grew up with only 9 channels on our tv, but i could always find something cool to watch. i've only talked to one other person who actually heard of and watched this show. she's three years younger than me, and she grew up in north jersey. i would love to see this series on dvd, so i could show it to my 5 year old daughter, and she could see what silly (but great) stuff her mom used to watch! i just found a vhs tape of a few episodes, and a music cd from the show on ebay, and i bought them right up, even though they were a little pricey. i can't wait to get them to re-live the great memories!

when i was five years old, it was my favorite television show. i remembered it was on channel 11 at 2pm everyday. the show's premise was simple with carole and janis as the hostesses of this children's television show. they sang songs and read stories to us as children. it was done in a studio with only 54 episodes which was re-broadcasted over and over. i remember sherlock, the puppet, in the tree. the show taught us how to count, add, subtract, and the alphabet. for thirty minutes a day now, i learned something new with paula and janis. i remember those days as pleasant memories and now i hope the children of today can learn to love simpler things like hearing stories, inexpensive props, riding the swings, and talking to puppets. the set was ideal and simple but it was carole and janis who made it worth while while. i miss my childhood and those days where the most important thing was watching the magic garden. life seemed so much simpler and better. now, i hope the kids today enjoy the show.

i grew up in new york and this show came on when i was four-years-old. i had half-day kindergarten and this was on wpix channel 11 in the afternoon. i just loved the music and stories and remember humming them around the house when playing.i just saw part of an episode on youtube and for a moment i could remember how it felt watching those shows as a small child. i, of course, stopped watching when i got in 1st grade because it was on before school got out (no vcr's or dvr's back then). i grew up, not realizing that the show was still on until i was in 11th grade! i also had no idea that there are dvd's and wish my nieces and nephews were young enough to enjoy this show, but now they're all past the demographic, or i'd buy all of them dvd sets. this was so much better than a lot of the kid shows today.

one of the best memories of my childhood. should be on dvd. it captured everything we grew up with in the seventies - peace, mellowness, flower power and great acoustic music. the two hosts, carol and paula, were the definitive peacenik hippies, with long hair, peasant blouses and bell bottoms(they looked like a katherine ross(ala "the graduate") and ali mcgraw(ala "love story"),respectively.)they made us happy with jokes from the daisy "chucklepatch", gave us lessons on being nice through conversations with the crotchedy garden squirrel, and entertained us with music from their guitar. they were the best, and carol was also the original sandy in the original production of "grease"(cool).this show should be in a time capsule from the era that would also include, "the yellow submarine", "arrow to the sun", and marlo thomas', "free to be...you & me.", also, "sunshine", and "the point."and last, but not least, that theme song, "see ya, see ya, hope you had a good, good time, ah ha, glad we got to say good mornin' to ya , hope we get get to see ya again, see ya, see ya, glad that you could stay awhile, ah ha, hope we get see ya again, see ya, see ya.

it's hard for me to explain this show to my grown friends. i have a bunch of shasta daisy's in the back yard which i lovingly call my "chuckle patch." my friends laugh at me and look at me like i have 2 heads. it would be great to see this series on dvd for us folks who remember it fondly with our other childhood memories, or to show our friends that there really was a chuckle patch! where kids tv today is compiled of violent cartoons, characters who do magic, or a talking sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea, the magic garden was real in the respect that it taught us good values.i will hold fond memories of carole and paula, and the chuckle patch.

ohmygawd!!! the magic garden is perhaps one of my most vivid '70s childhood memories. two hippie chicks with ponytails, carole and paula would swing on swings, tell jokes they picked off the chuckle patch, dress up with costumes they found in a giant chest called the storybox, and argue with a pesky pink squirrel named sherlock that lived in one of their trees. they also could strum a mean acoustic guitar and sing a pretty melody. this was a great childhood show. very 70s feeling. but that's the problem: they don't make shows like this anymore. pity that. you could tell these two girls really had hearts of gold and loved kids, they were really sweet. magic garden is one of those shows that if they came out with a box set people would buy it, because its such a mellow walk down memory lane.

i saw this last night in fort lauderdale. in general it was funny and i liked the characters especially sabrina. the acting is good and the story line was ok except for the ending which left way to many strings dangling and we were like (what?) i wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been done so much better.the film did portray rule life really well and we laughed throughout. it has flaws that is for sure but for a first time film for ash christian i thought it was good. you might want to wait for the dvd on this one. but if you get a chance to see it give it a shot

my friends and i saw the movie last night in austin at a showing for agliff (a film festival). this movie was one of the best i've seen this year. it was a great comedy - very original and heartfelt - and funny as hell! everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the entire movie. texas is a big state - with lots of small towns - and of course, plenty of teenagers who grew up as "fat girls." i know a lot of people will relate to this film on a personal level. ashley fink and robin de jesus were awesome - they were so great in these rolls, it was like the script was written with them in mind. and speaking of the script, it was very well written (very believable), and ash is a great actor (his facial expressions alone made me giggle). it is an independent film - but don't let that fool you...it's a good one! seeing this caliber of work from someone so young is truly inspiring.

i caught this film at an outfest screening in los angeles in july, 2006. it's rough around the edges (sound recording in particular is wobbly) and often very funny. the script is rather jarringly episodic and ends abruptly, but ash christian infuses the film with lots of genuine heart. it's also a refreshing change of pace to have a gay film that doesn't star underwear models obsessed with partying and chasing straight guys. props to a warmly sympathetic jonathan caouette as mr. cox, a kindred spirit to rodney (ash christian), the lively and spirited ashley finke as rodney's best friend, and deborah theaker as rodney's mom, who is given the best one-liners in the script and steals her every scene. the film is like its writer/director/starlumpy and a bit odd, but also very sweet.

at the same time john russell was playing ranch owner nathan burdette, trying to free his no good brother claude akins from sheriff john wayne in rio bravo he was working the other side of the law on television. these years were probably the high point of russell's career, his most noted screen role and his most famous television role, marshal dan troop of laramie in lawman.russell kept law and order in laramie the same way that james arness did it in dodge city on gunsmoke. unlike gunsmoke, laramie never developed the all the minor characters that gave you the feel of dodge city at the time. instead it concentrated on russell taking care of business and learning the business of law to his eager young deputy peter brown.brown played deputy johnny mckay who was a most respectful young man, constantly referring to his boss as mr. troop. he was pretty handy with a shooting iron, but was inclined to be impulsive. good thing marshal troop was around.the other series regular was the kitty russell of laramie, lily played by peggie castle. this is where lawman most resembled gunsmoke. there was an unspoken understanding between russell and castle that even the smallest of children couldn't have missed. and i wasn't the smallest of children when lawman was in first run.sadly peggie castle developed substance abuse problems after lawman's run ended. i remember a small obituary marked her passing in the first half of the seventies. she was one beautiful woman.lawman was good no nonsense western from that golden era of the adult television western. it was one of the best.

the theme song often goes through my head after all these years. i was never much of a tv watcher, probably because i was just entering my busy teen years when my family bought our first set in 1948 and it never became part of my life. but from the first episode of lawman i was hooked, and it is the only tv show i've ever scheduled my week around.intelligent, believable, well-written and well-acted, and john russell is still to me the most beautiful man i ever saw. (peter brown was no dog, either :o) i agree that it is one of the most underrated tv series of all time. i hope i can find some episodes for my grandchildren to watch.

johnny crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in the middle of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. billy graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet, sometimes corny, but all the way sincere flick. he gives us a look at not only the social scene but gives good, solid advice that holds true today about morals, decisions, the generation gap, teen dating, (some of the statistics that are given in this movie are astounding. they sound like today's stats). just to see billy in his younger days is worth seeing. it's an awesome movie. it made me realize that human nature does not change, even though hair, fashion and language may change, humans are still struggling with the same issues they have been struggling with for thousands of years.

subject matter: cosmology, quantum physics and stephen hawkingsoundtrack: phillip glasshave i died and gone to heaven? you will be enraptured.

an introspective look at the relationship between hawking and the space/time contingent. this film expores the gallilean and newtonian laws and there relation to einstein's theory of general relativity.the film is methodically directed, exposing details of the man (hawking) as well as his work (black holes). interviews with his family are a little too long so sadly there is less development of his theories and ideas. a philip glass soundtrack superbly compliments the film. only one other man could compose such haunting instellar melodies (jean michel jarre).overall i would highly recommend this movie on the basis of hawking's 'nuggets of wisdom' and his adequate explanation of an event horizon!

stephen hawking has one of the greatest minds, or if that's too simplistic to coin for him one of the most curious and daring, that also happens to be trapped in a body crippled by a disease that leaves him in a wheelchair and a computer to communicate. perhaps i didn't know enough about hawking going in (i always knew him as 'that guy speaking like a computer who knows a lot about like, the universe and stuff, you know') that he is british, that he was a rather normal kid, and, perhaps most remarkably, the disease that could have possibly left him dead at 21 put him in the position of putting his life in focus.according to errol morris's equally curious and coolly, visually dazzling portrait in a brief history of time, hawking was already brilliant, in spurts (when other oxford students were faced with daunting algebraic equations, he answered more than three times the amount in an hour's time), but when faced with challenges, mostly from other theories by other scientists, he bounced back with his own. beneath some of the complex scientific talk- and if you got any less than a b- in astronomy, like me, you'll need to keep your ears especially perked up in explanations of time's possible infinity or the peculiarities of the black hole- there's a human being who just wants to enjoy his goose on his birthday.morris captures hawking just right for those who can't get enough of his theories on how particles may be going in and out of a black hole, or if there is even a creator or not depending on how much one takes into account einstein and time. but he also captures the back-story on the man and his condition, which creates this as something much more interesting than if morris had done one or the other. too much talk about the cosmos would make one's head hurt, and too much about his personal life and one might wonder what all the fuss is about this bloke who's book of the film's title was on bestseller lists for over five years.almost in spite of his appearance, hawking defines what it is to be a conscious entity in a universe which, he observes, he won't be apart of if and when the universe goes kaput another 10 billion years from now. through it all, in a brief history of time, we get a glimpse of a genius and his humility (not to mention his colleagues and family's' ten cents here and there) through an unfathomably hypothetical and mathematical thought process of the universe.

a brief history of time. the cosmological content of this documentary is fascinating, the thoughts provoking and the man... brilliant. yet i had a hard time enjoying this documentary. the way the family members and professors are interviewed feels so unnatural. these members were interviewed on specifically built sets and were directed uncomfortably. mostly, their accounts came across as very acted and forcefully directed. the (deliberate) non-inclusion of asked questions manipulates the given information into a very harsh and impersonal format. i do not know who are responsibly for the interviewing but they did a dreadful job and with that took away from the viewing experience.overall still a fascinating documentary well worth seeing, if only for the interesting concepts presented.

stephen hawkings is a genius. he is the king of geniuses. watching this movie makes me feel dumb. but it's a great movie. not highly entertaining, but very very intriguing. the movie centers around wheelchair bound stephen hawkings, a man who makes einstein look average, and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, the galaxy, and black holes. everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think they'v got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they'll write it all down. well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours. here is a man who despite suffering from lou gehrig's disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen. watch this and listen in on how he has formulated theories on black holes. awesome. you won't be the same after you see it.

i have been a huge errol morris fan ever since i saw thin blue line and heard it saved a life. to date, this movie is his best piece of work.the plot is a mixing of stephen hawking's book of the same title intertwined with the man's life. the story is told through interviews with family, friends, and hawkings himself.don't be fooled; it totally sounds boring but the whole package is dynamic and thought provoking. the blending of life and theories is seamless and thoroughly entertaining. i was particularly moved at how well they humanize this genius and omniscient man. tho physically powerless, hawking's greatness and shear brilliance is encapsulated into a real live human being that we are allowed to laugh at and aw over at the same time.find this movie. watch it and enjoy. and if the studio who owns this picture reads this, a 15 year anniversary edition would be perfect now...

based on stephen hawking's "a brief history of time", this amazing film by eroll morris documents the the life and work of one of the greatest minds in the history of astronomy. he has contributed more to science, despite his debilitating disease, als, than an able bodied scientist could only dream of.the film begins by telling of hawking's childhood, and how he was a poor student that was recognizably bright. he slacked his way through college and university, where he was diagnosed with the disease that would take away normal functions of his body, but would allow him to continue living and thinking perfectly.morris discusses how the brilliant mind of stephen developed from childhood to the present, at one point his mother tells how- when she was pregnant- she prophetically bought a astronomical atlas to read while in the hospital. hawking himself narrates the timeline of his discoveries, while morris interviews close friends and colleagues whom have been lucky enough to befriend the magnificent man. he tells how he was first intrigued by the discovery that the universe was expanding similar to how a star would expand. we also know that stars eventually die and become what is now known as "black holes", if this is the case,will the universe not too begin to contract, reversing itself until we reach the "big crunch"? as hawking puts it. and when the universe does begin to recede, will time not "reverse"? when posed this question, i began to think that death may not be the end, perhaps one day time will go backwards, and our death will become our rebirth and our birth our death. the universe is one big cycle just like everything else in life. this is what hawking is telling us, everything in the universe recycles itself. this is completely logical and can make your mind wonder in a million directions pondering it. this is why i love this film and why isay it is a must see!!! an 11 out of 10 ...morris never ceases toamaze!

a brief history of time is not only a documentary on the beginning and the ending of the universal and reality as we know it, this is a story about the man and the genius known as stephen hawking. it is his story that reflects the story of time and change throughout the history of the universal. the style of the documentary / editing style of the interviews begin and end with a quick fade to black. almost like blinking in between segments and interviews, the documentary gives you an odd feeling like this is the view point of stephen hawking and not the eye of the camera. the running time is only a little longer than an hour. it is a short story, then again, its subject matter could be talked about for days and days. an interesting and proud story.

warning: may contain some minor spoilers.hard to say anything bad about this movie, except for one thing.you don't get to see it much anymore !!!! then again, maybe that's because you have to be home in the morning or at 3 am to catch it the fox movie channel.too bad, for this is another gem lost to time, clifton webb takes his patented sour, know-it-all demeanor he had perfected as lynn belvedere ("sitting pretty" and sequels), and turns 'nature boy'.actually, it's like this.webb plays robert jordan the host of a sunday children's educational program that is losing audience share, and the network breaks it to him that he needs to do something about it, or else.part of the problem may be due to the fact that the married host has no children.bummer !!! but as such things happen, the local church pastor needs a leader for an unruly troop of boy scouts, and finds a willing victim ... ahhhh 'volunteer' ... in the host, so jordan he takes the position.problem solved, right ???wrong !!! this being a movie there are other problems.for example, it turns out one of the scouts is the son of his boss at the tv station, which causes a little friction; especially since the kid is overweight, has asthma as well as an attitude.and he is the more reasonable one.also, there is this cub scout, mike (george winslow) who wants to hang around, being the 'stray puppy' type.as it turns out, the reason is that he has no folks of his own, but is cared for by a relative who hasn't much time for him.it is things like this that makes his job harder than expected. all in all, webb becomes more understanding of kids, and not only saves his show but learns a rewarding lesson, and eventually even adopts mike.still a great movie after all these years.

robert jordan is a television star. robert jordan likes things orderly, on time and properly executed. in his world children are to be seen, not heard. so why would mr. jordan want to become the master of a rambunctious band of boy scouts? ratings. his staff figures that if learns how to interact with the youth, they will be more inclined to watch his show. of course watching jordan cope comprises most of the fun.like mr. belvedere and mr. belvedere goes to college this one is sure to please.anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this film please write to me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com

this movie was never intended as a big-budget film but was a cute little picture that pretty much anyone could enjoy. it probably won't change your life, but it is certainly charming and engaging.clifton webb plays a curmudgeon (that's certainly not new) who has a tv. however, his ratings are failing and he is worried about cancellation. so he decides maybe he is too out of touch with kids--as he and his wife have none of their own. so, he volunteers as a scoutmaster and regrets doing this almost immediately! remember, he is a curmudgeon and doesn't particularly like kids. to make things worse, one of the kids really likes him and follows him like a lost puppy. no matter how indifferently he acts towards the kid, the child just wants to spend time with him! the kid is cute and nearly steals the show all by himself! what happens next and the twists and turns of the movie are something you'll just have to find out for yourself. understand that this is a light, cute and yet not cloying movie you'll probably enjoy.

a middle aged man, robert jordan, set in his ways, takes on a boy scout troop after his predecessor leaves under duress. jordan takes on the pack mostly to learn what the boys like so he can revive his flagging radio program which is losing it's appeal to the younger set. he has a rough go at first with the boys, especially so with mike, an 8 year old who forms an attachment for the older man which is anything but reciprocated. do things work out for jordan and the scouts? check out this entertaining and amusing film from the old days.

clifton webb as "mr. scoutmaster" is one of the all-time greats for comedy and remembering an innocence, now diminished in the world. i cannot understand why the networks like american movie classics and such do not show this movie, although i have requested it time and again.this movie should be shown to children now for its portrayal of loyalty, respect, dedication and resolve to achieve the best possible on an individual basis. there is so much low self-esteem talked about in present daily lives, but this movie, among many, many others, would be a wonderful learning tool for the present-day younger generation to see what can be accomplished by common sense and decency and pride in yourself and your achievements to better yourself. sad that this type of movie does not appeal to modern audiences. it certainly appealed to us 'baby boomer' generation of yesterday. old lessons are universal and timeless.

i saw this mini-movie when it first aired, and loved it!it kinda funny to see how far people will go for money.it's also funny to see how much a boyfriend can be "whipped". "whipped" enough to kill. i think the cast was great, especially the character kristin.without her smooth talking,and deceptive looks the movie would have not been the same.i never use to watch usa but now it is one of my stations.

a proof that it's not necessary for a movie to have a deep many-layered story and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie. even if the story could be expanded in many directions, especially in more sociological way (people lust for money) it seems that it's perfect just the way it is. through many sudden changes it takes the spectator to the end without any unnecessary complications and without letting the spectator taking the eyes of the screen. but the acting for me isn't so good. with the exception of lindsey mckeon the others were average or even worst. in some scenes they just empty-stared in front of themselves. for exception of lindsey which was more convincing. it's a really simple movie for just laying back and enjoying. 7/10

the man with the golden arm, otto preminger's controversial, panoramic crime drama, plays itself out among the mental descriptions of its living and architectural occupants, in rhythmic, lashing arrangement. opening the film, a closeup from within a bar of frankie looking in through the window, already tells us to the prominence that the protagonist's subjective experience will grasp. pulled in the direction of increasingly slighter spaces, the film shuts itself off, as the local gangster's long-drawn-out poker game shuts itself from the daylight, bolts itself in, as sinatra's frankie machine has himself locked in a room in the celebrated scene of his harrowing struggle to overcome his habit. in delving into the shapes and faces of its jazzy urban haven, the visual traffic in the man with the golden arm characterizes skewed psychological circumstances, forming an overpowering environment, as maintained by the recurring tracking shots into closeups of frankie's eyes.the grace of this fiery drama, striking as early as the exciting opening crane shot, displays the command over the perceptible world that studio production allows. the wonderfully dilapidated urban sets define an independent place with no beginnings or ends, an indeterminate state, the sort that in reality hardly last as long as this skid row seems to before being gentrified or leveled. the flair of certain performances, particularly robert strauss's as the wonderfully named underworld gambling boss schwiefka and arnold stang as frankie's trusty four-eyed lapdog, becomes this fiery surreal feature pleasingly. the premise of drug addiction, sinatra's powerhouse performance, elmer bernstein's infectious, forceful jazz score and saul bass's famous, influential and controversial opening sequence centering on the animated paper cut-out of a heroin addict's arm ensured that, in its era, the man with the golden arm presses forward upon the cause for realism in the still reticent hollywood. it is impressionistic and subjective, as i say, but its intent, its force and its spirit are much closer to home.what absorbs me the most in this film is its aspect as a gangster film. it has the illegal card games, short cons, the fights, the guns, the double-crosses, characters on the lam, a femme fatale, a stunningly sexy gun moll, the shady nightclubs and urban landscape, but it does more than exploit this environment for entertainment. really, it is the perfect environment, and genre, in which to tell this story, a crime-ridden urban borough where it's all too comfortable to escape through a bottle or two, or three, or four, or drugs, a transient dose that really just functions to keep one in obscurity from any enlightenment and all the clear scenarios the world could bid.

but quite dated today. otto preminger made this movie without the certificate of approval that was needed then. it was enormously courageous and risky as he could have lost his investment and future.the film is not true to the wonderful book and is unfortunately hollywoodized.frank sinatra (and i've never been a fan) playing frankie machine, is astonishing in his performance. one forgets it is frank up there, the level of realism he brings to the role of a jonesing drug addict has to be seen to be believed.kim novak, eternally gorgeous and talented, does not disappoint in the role of the devoted outsider, always there for frankie.supporting roles, particularly a young, handsome and talented darrin mc gavin, are faultless.eleanor parker, playing frankie's wife, is hopelessly inept. she swings from irritating to melodramatic and is far too over the top. a forgettable performance.the stagey, cheap settings are appalling, as if a firm gust of wind would blow the whole tacky painted cardboards over the horizon. almost laughable at times in their tawdry cheapness.the music was irritating, poundingly so at times. as if each nuance of the script (example: when louie is getting frankie his fix out of a drawer) had to be underscored at a high decibel level.7 out of 10. sinatra truly deserved his oscar nomination. worth seeing.

"the moon is blue" director otto preminger tackled even more taboo subject matter in his controversial 1955 release "the man with the golden arm." whereas he had incensed the motion picture association of america with his use of the words "virgin" and "mistress" in his mild 1953 comedy "the moon is blue," preminger went far beyond what any movie had attempted with "the man with the golden arm" since dick powell made his law and order epic "to the ends of the earth"(1946) about thwarting the international traffic in narcotics. based on nelson algren's novel that won the 1950 national book award, this gritty, uncompromising, 119-minute, black & white melodrama deals with heroin addiction. initially, when preminger's film came out, the motion picture association of america would not issue its seal of approval because the filmmakers depicted addiction to narcotics. this groundbreaking film qualified as the first major motion picture to handle narcotics from the dope fiend's perspective and actually showed the paraphernalia that junkies wielded to shoot up heroin. the production code stipulated that filmmakers must refrain from showing characters using illicit narcotics. nevertheless, united artists released this unique frank sinatra picture and it grossed over $4-million dollars. the critical and commercial success of "the man with the golden arm" eviscerated the production code. as a result, the mpaa amended the code so that filmmakers could delve into other taboo subjects, such as drug abuse, kidnapping, abortion and prostitution. the film received three academy award nominations. oscar nominations went to sinatra for best acting, joseph c. wright and darrell silvera for best art direction-set decoration, black-and-white and elmer bernstein for best music, scoring of a dramatic or comedy picture. indeed, elmer bernstein made a name for himself with his jazzy score. the producers had thought about casting marlon brando in the title role, but sinatra beat brando to the punch. eleanor parker, kim novak, arnold stang, darren mcgavin, and robert strauss co-starred with ole blue eyes. mcgavin was particularly memorable as a sleazy heroin dealer, while eleanor parker played the protagonist's wife with a dark, deep secret of her own that comes as quite a shock. "the man with the golden arm" refers to protagonist frankie machine's ability to manipulate a deck of cards. frankie deals cards for zero schwiefka (robert strauss of "stalag 17") but he has been out of chicago for the last six months in a federal narcotics hospital recovering from heroin addiction. not only has frankie licked the habit, but he also has learned how to play the drums and plans to embark of a music career. optimistic as frank is about his future, he finds himself facing his past all over again when he returns to his old stomping grounds. schwiefka wants him to deal for him again, and nifty louie fomorowski (darren mcgavin of "counter-attack") tries to induce him to resume his heroin usage. meanwhile, frankie comes home to his invalid, wheel-chair bound wife, zosh (eleanor parker of "escape from fort bravo"), who manipulates him with guilt. frankie was drunk when he had a car accident and zosh wound up in a wheel chair. frankie shows up with high hopes and a drum set, but zosh sees no future for him as a musician and urges to go back to work for schwiefka. frankie plans to visit a music promoting and one of his own friends, sparrow (arnold stang of "my sister eileen"), shoplifts a business suit from a department store for frankie. after frankie refuses to work for schwiefka because he is going to see musical agent harry lane (will wright of "the wild one"), schwiefka turns both frank and sparrow into the police. meanwhile, schwiefka gets brach's department store to drop the shoplifting charges. the suit was worth $37.00. frankie agrees to resume dealing for schweifka and the hustler bails him out. not long afterward, despite his resolution to shun heroin use, frankie breaks down and pays louie the $2.00 for a fix. eventually, frankie meets harry lane and lane warns him that he is catches frankie shooting up that he will have nothing to do with him. what poor frankie doesn't know is that zosh has recovered her ability to walk, but she uses his guilt about the accident to hold on to him. zosh is also jealous of her downstairs neighbor, molly novotny (kim novak of "picnic"), frankie's former sweetheart who hustles drinks at a nearby strip bar called the safari club. when zosh complains about headaches that frankie gives her practicing on his drum set, frankie moves them downstairs into molly's apartment. schwiefka and louie are planning a big poker game with sam markette (george e. stone of "guys and dolls") and williams (george mathews of "gunfight at the o.k. corral"), two big-time gamblers who have heard about frank and his legendary 'golden arm.' schwiefka and louie persuade a reluctant frankie to deal for $250. after an early winning streak, frankie starts losing and he cannot reverse his bad luck. in fact, frankie spends about two days dealing. exhausted, his nerves shot and desperate for a fix, he falls apart on the second day and markette and williams catch him cheating. louie refuses to give frankie a fix, so frankie knocks him out and ransacks his apartment for the heroin.preminger pulls no punches in "the man with the golden arm," and the film is pretty disillusioning. none of the characters here are remotely sympathetic. essentially, they are either hustlers or hustled. sinatra gives another dynamite performance as does mcgavin and parker. to be sure, "the man with the golden arm" has lost much of its impact in the intervening 50 or more years, but it still ranks as a landmark film.

frank sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it's hard to single one out as the best. if i had to name the best thing he ever did, though, it would be his performance as frankie machine, the heroin- addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved, just barely, by the love of a good woman (played by an exceptionally babelicious kim novak). the "cold-turkey" scenes between sinatra and novak are terrifying and heartbreaking. the movie is very nearly perfect, in fact, from saul bass's title graphics to the ground-breaking jazz score by elmer bernstein. it might not be the sort of thing anyone thinks of in regard to the 1950s, but it's a must-see nevertheless.

the man with a golden arm was one of a trio of great films around that same time that dealt with drug addiction. the other two were monkey on my back and a hatful of rain. but i think of the three this one is the best.maybe if otto preminger had shot the thing in the real chicago instead of those obvious studio sets the film might have been better yet. who knows, maybe preminger couldn't get enough money to pay for the location. it's the only flaw i find in the film.frank sinatra is a heroin addicted card dealer who was busted for covering for his boss robert strauss when the game was raided. he took the cure while in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer. but a whole lot of people are conspiring against him.first bob strauss who wants him back dealing, especially because a couple of heavyweight gamblers are in town. he uses a few underhanded methods to get sinatra's services back. secondly darren mcgavin is the local dope dealer who wants sinatra good and hooked as a customer again. and finally eleanor parker his clinging wife who's working a con game to beat all, just to keep him around.frank sinatra got a nomination for best actor for this film, but lost to ernest borgnine in marty. sinatra might have won for this one if he hadn't won for from here to eternity in the supporting actor category a few years back and that marty was such an acclaimed film in that year. his scenes going through withdrawal locked up in kim novak's apartment will leave you shaken.eleanor parker does not get enough credit for her role. she's really something as the crazy scheming wife who wants sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost. if she had not been nominated that same year for interrupted melody, she might have been nominated for this. 1955 marked the high point of her career. darren mcgavin got his first real notice as the very serpentine drug peddler. his performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl.elmer bernstein contributed a great jazz score to accentuate the general dinginess of the bleak chicago neighborhood the characters live in. not a place you'd want to bring up your family.

(mild spoilers) frankie machine had been dealt a bad hand in life. a card dealer at an illegal gambling den in his chicago neighborhood he was busted when the joint was raided by the cops and given six months in jail. while behind bars frankie was treated for his heroin addiction at the prisons hospital and learned how to play the drums as part of his rehabilitation program. now out of prison and back in his old neighborhood frankie is trying to put his life back together by getting a union card in the musicians union and then a job as a drummer in a band and put his old life behind him but instead it catches up with frankie in no time at all in "the man with the golden arm". otto preminger's ground-breaking 1955 film about heroin addiction with frank sinatra giving the performance of his life as the drug addicted card sharp frankie machine, the man with the golden arm. frankie tries to getaway from the life that he lead but has this monkey or, better yet, gorilla on his back that just won't let him. soild performances by the entire supporting cast starting with frankie's friend sparrow, arnold stang. sparrows attempt to get frankie back on his feet by shoplifting a suit of clothes for him ends up putting him and frankie in the slammer, and almost back to prison, until his former boss at the gambling den schwiefka bailed him out. there's frankie's psychically as well as emotionally crippled wife zosch, eleanor parker, who sees that her hold on frankie is slipping and is slowly driven to madness murder and suicide. there's frankie's drug dealer louie, with darren mcgavin in one of his first acting roles, who's hold on frankie is only good as long as he stays addicted and louie goes out of his way to make sure that he does. there's the owner of the gambling joint that frankie works at as it's top card dealer schwiefka, robert strauss, who like louie goes out of his way to get frankie back to work for him even though if he's arrested again frankie's hopes for a new and better life will go down the drain. and then there's frankie's next-door neighbor and friend molly, kim novak,who goes to almost impossible lengths to get him over his addiction by locking him up in her apartment. it's there that he goes "cold turkey" and almost ends up dying trying to kick the habit in one of the most harrowing sequence ever put on film.a no holds barred movie with explosive performances by everyone involved makes "the man with the golden arm" one of the great classics of realism in motion pictures coming out of the 1950's.

we have moved far beyond this tentative foray into a forbidden area-drug addiction-for the 1950s. as such, the film may seem dated. the man with the golden arm served its function is peeling back a layer of the underside of society, an eye-opener to a southern country boy in 1955 when i first viewed this film in the theater. after some serious consideration about being too young, i was allowed to go. it was powerful and affecting then and still maintains some sharp, painful moments of the soul stripped naked. as a movie depicting the loneliness at the core of being, it succeeds.filled with angst, frank sinatra, in his best role, creates a vulnerability that makes him sympathetic to the viewer. he conveys his helplessness and ineffectualness in a beautifully restrained performance. as a voice of common sense in the dead-end urban jungle, kim novak as molly is quite good. she is compassionate and yet stands on solid ground. the interaction between sinatra and novak is really good. darren mcgavin plays a slimy character and does it very well. eleanor parker is superbly irritating and painfully insecure in her role of the pathetic zosch, the crippled wife of sinatra. arnold stang is another unlikely survivor of the street. regarded as pitiful and despicable, his character sparrow provides tart comedic moments. the music is almost the star of this film-brooding, frenetic, moody, poignant. elmer bernstein's score perfectly accentuates the tensions of frankie machine's spiritual weakness and physical need for heroin. molly's theme is bittersweet and captures aurally what the film depicts visually. i know of no other soundtrack that effectively complements the tension and defeat within a man as effectively as does this one.

a group of teens that have broken into a huge department store, are attacked by a crazed police man. exciting and suspenseful throughout and refreshingly devoid of extreme violence and gore, but those aussie hairstyles and accents are a bit much to take. and they can induce headaches. but this is still a good thriller. 7 out of 10.

there are only a few movies which can be called `must see' and shephered is one of those films. in many ways it was ahead of it's time (and you can tell it was a source of inspiration for several better-known films) copied by many, equaled by none, this truly is one great movie.the story is complex but unfolds itself as a taut yet frequently amusing thriller and highly thought provoking exploration of the nature of humanity. the story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos reigns. c. thomas howell is a `shepherd' one who protects the populace for various religious leaders by killing off any unfit members of the society. the whole idea made me think about our society. it's really a brilliant social commentary, which is more than i can say for certain recent sci-fi/action blockbusters. matrix reloaded and revolutions didn't make one feel that any real innovation was taking place, just dull video-game effects. but shepherd scores on the action scale too...not once does this movie let the viewer catch their breath. peter hayman proves himself to be one of the few genius action directors. we're talking 100%, high grade, down home kung fu fighting! it was excellent. really good special effects, shoot-outs, bleak-futuristic cyber-punk noir style the film really has its own elements.when talking about shepherd, it's impossible not to mention how much style it has. the vision of this city is really stunning. it recalls images of tim burton's very memorable vision of gotham in batman. and these sights are photographed by graeme mears with a degree of skill that puts gordon willis and conrad hall to shame. even the special effects proved amazing. doubtless the scenes where fighting occurs are landmarks in all of filmmaking. this movie is a ballet of awesome visual display.still, at the base of it all, there lies an interesting story, carried through by a strong cast. the acting (especially rowdy piper) and the plot are both great, and excellently directed. in contrast with loads of futuristic films made with a strong artificial flavor, the characters are believable and the dialogue is natural and full of wit. i'm always proud to see a great film like shepherd come along. it's a damn shame that it didn't receive good distribution and made nothing in the box office. it's a rarity worth searching for. this movie will impress you and make you feel 10 times cooler for having seen it!

this is a very strange series with dean learner. i really didn't understand the guests. i knew they weren't serious but whether they were really them was unclear because...i guess i'm just that stupid. i don't know if this classes as a spoiler but the guests aren't real like in ali g or anything they're played by one man or so i believe. i love the serious look that he's got going on. its like that programme that was on on a sunday morning that i forget the name of lol. i also really like the suit and moustache thing he has got going on. its quite hot. he's insensitive which is one of the funniest qualities. i also like the way he has subsections of the programme. it makes it seem more authentic.

a spin off comedy talk show from the creators of 'garth marenghi's darkplace' the new series, man to man with dean learner, focuses on garth's manager, publisher and publicity agent, as played by richard ayoade.nightclub owner, restaurateur, publisher, international playboy - dean learner is a one-man brand. after his co-funded channel 4 television hit garth marenghi's darkplace he now invites you into his luxury penthouse flat for an all-new, entertaining and immensely stylish tv talk show.man to man with dean learner will feature all dean's remaining celebrity friends, as well as plenty of live music and fine fish-dish cuisine in a show that reeks of class - but not fish!i attended two of the live recordings and it had me in stitches. there are distinct comparisons to alan partridge's 'knowing me knowing you' in the layout but richard ayoade and matt holness's unique writing style take it to another level.if your a fan of darkplace then you can't miss it. catch it when its aired late this summer

after the highs of darkplace it was never conceivable that holness and adobye would be able to create anything half as good as garth marengi. yet i think that man to man in its own right is as good a show (on the good episodes) as darkplace. i cant argue that 2 of the episodes really are'nt that good but the other 4 certainly make up for it. if i had to pick 2 great episodes id go for formula4 driver steve pising (pronounced pissing) and the great garth marengi. to already have a bit of understanding of the programme is a real plus as dean learner makes many inside jokes but even if you have'nt seen much dean id recommend this as some of the rants he launches into are genius ie. his argument with def lepord over their name. all in all a great show which just misses full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes.

the first episode of 'man to man with dean learner' that just aired was at least up to scratch with most episodes of 'garth marenghi's darkplace' and had me at "my maisonette". hope it keeps up the good work of 'faux terribles' on my tv. richard ayoade is one of the best in the new breed of "alternative comedy"(i hate this phrase but am too lazy too think of another one.) comedians on tv today.i'm glad that on a trip of local dvd retailers today "garth marenghi's darkplace" was sold out across the board. even from his brief stint in nathan barley i knew that ayoade was a serious talent and i'm sure he would have been great as dixon bainbridge in 'the mighty boosh' to continued success! in the vein of these programs i also felt it necessary to extend my review, in order to secure a place on this public domain.

the soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant at parts. you must watch it for its strong characterisation and the risks the plot about two troubled individuals falling in love takes. you must know the story through various other reviews, so lets speak about what is brilliant about this movie.firstly, the two protagonists are so real and such intriguing personalities. the first being a woman who has opted out of a four year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone coming her way. the second being a man who has always wanted to be a woman, whose pain and loneliness is shown with so much sensitivity and brilliance. you hate the former and your heart bleeds for the latter.the second thing about this movie is the entire concept of loving one for who one is, irrespective of gender. so, would you still love your partner if he/she were to change his/her sex? the movie explores that idea and it is a beautiful one.but there is one point where the movie fails. i wish the relationship between the protagonists had developed in a better way. that what they feel is love doesn't come across till the end. but watch it, and post your thoughts on it here.......

a strange relationship between a middle-aged woman and a transsexual who gonna be a woman soon. charlotte and venorica, both trapped by their inanimate lives and don't know how to get out of them. charlotte is an owner of a beauty clinic, she has broken up with her aggressive ex-husband, moved into an apartment alone with all the furniture packed except her big bed. veronica lives downstairs with her poor dog, she's sensitive and desperately bothered by her mother's visiting and the bad relationship with her dad. her only hope is that the upcoming transsexual operation will turn her into a real woman and then everything will be fine. all she can do now is waiting for an approval certificate.then these two individuals meet by chance and gradually they are all involved into other's lives, there are some sparkles between them, but no one is brave enough to face the truth because they are not willing to accept the change as most people do. eventually the ending is quite satisfying and leaves some imagination for us to think about it.the director's great work gives me an great impression, she handles the development of characters very well, the emotional atmosphere is quite full and intense. also i am so obsessed with the gloomy lights all over the apartment, delphic but full of desire.two main characters are played by trine dyrholm and david dencik, they are amazing in their roles, a very impressive performance and the chemical reaction between them is genuine and convincing.this swedish indie film is about encountering and change, no matter you're homosexual or heterosexual, male or female, the oddness of life exists everywhere, whenever you fall across it, you'll be hesitate and bewildered, but at least don't be afraid, follow your heart and choose the right way.

this film is a very beautiful and slow film. there is nothing hollywood about it. it is very danish and the characters are very real. it is the first danish film to take up this transsexual theme. it is really about love that has no gender. i would not say it is about lesbian love even though the two main characters (the transsexual veronika and charlotte) are attracted to each other. it is a story about love and life.the story pretty much takes place in the two apartments. there is almost no background music, which makes it seem more real and intense. the two actors playing the main characters are great. they really make them seem real. they are not archetypes, but real people you could meet in the street. i think it is the first time i have seen a transsexual portrayed this well. very well done.

this british documentary was recently shown on comedy central during their "best of" week and can also be seen on south park's second season dvd. i remember seeing many commercials for the dvd showing clips of this documentary, most of which occurs with matt stone, trey parker, and some other guy in a hot tub. it was funny when i saw it in the commercials, but i was used to seeing it by the time i saw the actual documentary.overall, "goin' down to south park" is a fairly funny and interesting look at how south park episodes are made and of the series' history going back to when matt and trey came up with the idea in college. however, there was something about the tone of this documentary that actually felt sort of depressing. it's not as fast-paced, rapid-fire, and as lively as the actual south park episodes. instead, it kind of has a slow, dry-wit style, which at times can be funny, but most of the time you're just waiting for something to happen. if you get the chance to watch it, by all means go for it, but i don't think you're really missing much if you never see it.my imdb rating: 7/10

going' down to south park is a 1hr long documentary about south park with interviews with trey parker and matt stone and all the other people who work on south park.there really isn't much to say, it shows the history of south park and what it takes to make one episode.it is basically a behind the scenes of the show. it shows the different merchandise that south park has made(it was really comedy central who put it out). it also shows the controversy which was caused by south park.it shows plenty of funny clips from the show as well.it's a fairly funny documentary.any fan of south park should check this out.you can find it on youtube.9/10

trey parker and matt stone, the creators of south park, finally get out of their grueling schedule to talk to the cameras while sipping champagne in their hot tub. at first, when watching this, i did not sense as much sarcasm as there was in this. i knew they were joking when they would complain about different actors on the show and when trey said he wasn't going to give his mother any of his money, but there is so much sarcasm throughout, that this documentary, is more of a mockumentary full of inside jokes.this "documentary" shows everything about south park (up until the second season anyways). it shows what goes on behind the scenes with the animation and the recording. it has interviews, many of which are fake interviews, but some, amongst all the fabrications, give insight into the show. clips from both of trey parker's spirit of christmas shorts are shown, as are many good clips from the show. if you were a south park fan, then this should have quenched your thirst for show knowledge back in late 1998 when this was made. now, obviously the show has changed, but this is still interesting.what we have here is an amusing documentary where trey parker (especially) and matt stone come off as arrogant jerks, and that's exactly what they wanted to come off as. they may be this way in real life, but here it was a joke, a 51 minute long insightful joke.my rating: *** out of ****. 51 mins. not rated, contains language and sexual content.

well, i saw that yesterday and it was much better than the other making-off from vh1, too bad than this one it's pretty outdated but you get to see all the staff who makes south park, very interesting stuff.it's also funny than this documentary portrays trey and matt like selfish greedy snobs creators who doesn't work and spend all the time having fun or relaxing (which is kinda ironic because they work pretty hard on the show).it also shows all the animation process to make a south park episode, interview with the actors who brings character's voices and much more.if you're a fan of south park i highly recommend you this.

ok, when i rented this several years ago i had the worst expectations. yes, the acting isn't great, and the picture itself looks dated, but as i sat there, a strange thing happened. i started to like it. the action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump. brion james, maybe one of the greatest b-grade actors next to bruce campbell, is great as always. the story isn't bad either. now i wouldn't rush out and buy it, but you won't waste your time at least watching this good b-grade post apocalyptic western.

it has to be said that this film is definitely one of the better "bargain bin" movies out there - i'd feel a bit cheated if i had paid £15 for it, but at about £1.50 i felt that i definitely got more than my monies worth. the film can't quite decide if it wants to be "mad max" or one of the clint eastwood "man with no name" spaghetti westerns, and as such is stacked with clichés from both. even the manic loony who hangs out with the bad guys in "mad max" is there.that guy from "blade runner" also cops a good billing, although he only turns up at the beginning and the end of the movie.favourite bit - for me the punch-up on top of the oil refinery - if you look closely you can see the "post-apocalyptic" rush hour traffic thundering past in the distance as the two protagonists knock seven bells out of each other.get several lagers in, a few pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately lightweight but entertaining drivel.

**spoilers** extremely brutal police drama set in san francisco involving a sting operation that goes terribly wrong. a cop det. falon, sam elliott,mistakenly and savagely beats to death an undercover policeman winch, mike watson,thinking that he murdered his partner det. sam levinson, mike burstyn. a partner who unknowing to falon was dirty.getting the lowdown that a group of policemen under his command are dealing drugs by knocking off drug dealers of their cocaine and heroin and then selling it back to them captain delgoti, paul sorvino, sets up a number of sting operations in his precinct with one of the cops targeted being det. levinson. levinson's partner det. falon who's as honest as the day is long has no idea of levinson's corruption. when det. falon find's his partner det. levinson stabbed to death outside a bar, were they were at drinking the night away, he goes nuts and attacks and beats to death the man on the scene winch. winch who was not responsible for levinson's murder was in fact there to get him to turn and gives up the names of his fellow drug-dealing corrupt cops.with the help of striper and girlfriend sally, mimi craven, falon has winch's body put in a car and drives down to the docks dumping it in san francisco bay feeling that the "cop killer" got just what he deserved. what falon doesn't know is that the two cops later put on the case of leinson's murder holloway & orlanski, dan lauria & richard gilliland, were the one's who murdered him.it's not until much later that falon realizes that his partner was dirty when he was assigned together with rookie detective michael murrow, esai morales, on the winch case and tries to cover-up his involvement in winch's death. falon's new partner senses that he's anything but interested in finding winch's killer and slowly puts two and two together. the two dirty cops, holloway & orlaski, trying to cover up their role in both levinson murder, whom they killed fearing that he's about to turn evidence on them, as well as their drug dealings. the two crooked cops set up ex-con jerome johnson, perry moore, by breaking into his apartment and planting drugs there and then, to make it look like a drug hit, brutally murdering him and his wife! this happens right in front of the couples two year old son in one of the most shocking and sickening murders scenes ever put in a movie.not satisfied with killing levinson and johnson, together with his wife, holloway and orlanski get to falon's girlfriend sally, who was a junkie and being supplied with her drugs by the late det. levinson. the two corrupt cops stick a needle in sally's arm forcing her to overdose not realizing, by sticking the needle in her left arm, that she's left-handed! which would make it physically impossible and which also alerts falon, who finds her body, that sally was in fact murdered and didn't kill herself voluntary or by accident.falon begins to come to his senses when he's later approached at his old watering hole by holloway and orlanski and asked to join them in their drug dealing operation. falon angrily refuses but now he knows that like his partner the late sam levinson that he knows too much and is now a marked man. meanwhile det. murrow, now a lot smarter and wiser, by getting to know what his partner falon is all about confronts falon about winch's death only to get knocked out and cuffed to a sink at the bar that falon was at. with falon now smashed from his drinking, but with a full head of steam, goes outside to meet holloway and orlanski knowing that no matter what happens he'll end up on the losing end.tough and uncompromising movie about police corruption with sam elliott as the old veteran who thinks he's seen and knows everything about crime and police work but has a lot to learn. still he overlooks his partners det. levinson, whom he worked with for 20 years, secret life as a drug dealer that not only leads to him murdering an innocent man but ending up being killed himself.

ah! when good actors take on bland material! if you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller you may be disappointed. while the situations are very true to life, the plot proceeds at a very predictable clip and you can pretty well see what lays ahead way before the actors take you there. many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion. much of the dialog is just plain silly.but! if you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it, then you will love this movie! sam elliott is nothing short of brilliant in taking the one-note character of detective falon come alive with depth and pathos. those of you who have never seen elliott emote that much beyond his usual scowling stoic stances will be delighted at the range of emotion he depicts in this film. and also, in his early fifties in this film, he looks fantastic! his bare chest scene gives hope to middle aged men everywhere! esai morales does a wonderful job elevating his role as det. falon's eager beaver new police partner. he could have easily played it as a robin to elliott's batman, but instead he breathed a genuineness and passion into this role. he makes it work despite some of the lame lines he is given to say.paul sorvino is fun to watch! he plays the eccentric police captain. he seems to know he is slumming in this movie and is having a ball doing it. he makes it fun for us too.this movie is very by-the-numbers in plot but makes up for it with great performances! sam elliott fans should definitely get this one as it is suck a kick to see him spread his wings and do so much more than he usually is allowed to do!

nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid flick in all respects. everything from acting to cinematography was solid. not a perfectly linear plot line, but there wasn't anything you couldn't see coming. perhaps a tad melodramatic at points, but again, a fairly decent movie none the less. definitely worth checking out. if in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend, give this a go. though you may not feel like running out and buying it, i found it to be quite worth while.

i must admit i wasn't expecting much on this movie. i was surprised i truly enjoyed it as much as i did. the script wasn't oscar material, but it wasn't horrible either. the acting was great by mark wahlberg. jennifer aniston had a great supporting role, and looked lovely as ever. what made this movie for me was the music. if you do not like 80's glam metal or hair bands, then you probably wont like this movie. its all about being a rockstar. some cliche's were present, but didn't bring down the movie at all. i would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll and remember to stand up and shout!!! 8 of 10 for great acting and awesome music.jason

i've been looking forward to the release of this movie since i first heard the concept two years ago, and i was not disappointed. i won't bother summarizing the story since everyone else has, but i will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout. the performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable.my only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely lacking; the movie wrapped up very abruptly- in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half, as though the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot. since the plot wasn't nearly as important as the music and the action, this didn't really affect the entertainment value of the film, so this is not as major a complaint as it would seem.(2) this is really nitpicky, but the music that the characters in the movie were listening to was sometimes dated after 1985, when the movie was set. inxs' devil inside was from 1987 and ac/dc's are you ready was from 1990, among other mistakes. this bothers me a bit, since they obviously went to lengths to make a good period piece, they could have checked the copyright date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier. again, not a big deal.oh, i thought of something else that was strange. the steel dragon band members were supposed to be english, but for some reason dokken bassist jeff pilson and ozzy guitarist zakk wylde played band members, and they each had a couple of speaking lines in american accents. that was kind of lazy also, but it was still cool to see actual musicians playing musicians, so i will forgive that as well.i could probably nitpick all day, but i don't want to give the impression that this wasn't a super entertaining movie. i will probably buy the dvd when it comes out, and i will certainly buy the soundtrack cd simply for the six steel dragon songs (some of which were sung by the singer from the band steelheart, if you remember them!). the highlight of the film was possibly a great outtake where mark wahlberg is lipsynching to a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays "good vibrations" by marky mark and the funky bunch. the surprised look of mark's face is priceless. classic rock and roll flick! score: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment

televised in 1982, from a los angeles production, this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage musical you are likely to encounter. issued on dvd in 2004 in a remastered digital transfer, it is quite stunning. hearn and lansbury give the performances of their lives and the rest of the cast are quite obviously caught up in the electricity generated. of course it is sondheim's music and lyrics that make this possible. if anyone doubts that he is one of the "greats" of the american musical form listen to this. the sets are stark, as befits the plot, and clever in allowing the swift scene changes required and the cameras catch the action without obliterating the fact that this is a stage production. a central, move-able and revolving platform is mrs. lovett's pie shop, with the barber's shop upstairs. around it are various gantries and moving stairs to allow the rest of the action to take place. the brutal tale of injustice leading to revenge, murder and mayhem is liberally spiced with dark humour and comic moments. sondheim does for barber shops what hitchcock did for showers ! an important work in american musical theatre is here given an electrifying performance.

well i'm not the world's biggest sondheim fan, so although i have the cast album and i've listened to it a few times i've never actually seen this show performed and i haven't seen the tim burton movie version either. i felt like i wanted to see something more faithful before i see the burton one and give it a chance just as a movie. this version isn't a movie at all, it's a filmed play with some of the original members of the cast, including most importantly angela lansbury's performance as nellie lovett. this is one of those performances that's just like a conduit into the heart of the magic of broadway and theater itself. she must have had so much fun with this role. sweeney todd himself isn't played by len cariou, who did it originally, but by george hearn. hearn does a fantastic job; his voice isn't quite as good as cariou's, but he seems to play it a bit broader.the only problem i had really was with the johanna character as played by betsy joslyn, and to some extent her lover anthony as played by cris groenendaal. joslyn's voice can't sustain high notes, but i wasn't entirely sure if that was maybe supposed to be the point since i'm not hugely familiar with this play. more importantly, i'm not sure if the story of "sweeney todd" really holds up enough weight to sustain some of the music, but thankfully the whole thing doesn't seem to have been taken too seriously by its creators. as a lark, and a bit of comedy in the vein of "grand guignol", it's quite enjoyable. i don't feel like it's as significant a piece of work as "company" and "into the woods" or some of his other shows. some of the music is quite spectacular, but at other points it seems to exist in a world outside of the show.i won't say a whole lot about it here because this is a film website and this is really not a film, but just a play that has been shot on film. there were maybe 3 or 4 scenes where they moved the camera around but that was it. people will want to see this, because it preserves lansbury's legendary performance which deserves its legendary status because it's a hilarious and insightful performance. george hearn can be proud of his version of sweeney as well. this would be a good film to show children over the age of 5 or so to get them interested in musicals because the blood and cannibalism will really surprise them. seeing a performance filmed so expertly and so faithfully makes me wish that more efforts like this had been made over the years with musical theater, because i prefer shows from the 20s through the 50s to these later era affairs. "sweeney todd" is an exceptional show from its era however, miles and miles above the al webber madness.

attend the tale of sweeney todd...the strangest, most off-putting, but most wonderful broadway musical. it is chilling, funny, and moving all at once through sondheim's most memorable and incredible score and sharp performances. george hearn is incomparable in the title role, bringing a strong voice and dead on (no pun intended) impersonation of the legendary demon barber, while angela lansbury provides the comic relief as she cheerfully grinds up his victims into meat pies. if you just allow yourself to enjoy it, "sweeney todd" is a real treat.

i saw this version about a decade ago, and have been looking for it ever since. i just recently found an original vhs version, and purchased it for $125.00. sounds crazy, but if you, like me, consider it as one of the best the broadway musical stage has ever produced, you wouldn't even think twice.why, it's just a little over paying for a broadway ticket today. i really hope they re-release this in dvd form soon. it's a piece of musical theater that screams to be seen by all!

not having seen the 1936 version of this story, i cannot offer any comparison there. i can, however, state that stephen sondheim's musical treatment of this story is absolutely genius. only sondheim could come up with music and lyrics that are stellar in their own right, yet perfectly suited to the very bizarre subject matter. if anyone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is, they should see this (and "dr. strangelove" as well). when mrs. lovett goes from having the "worst pies in london" to a booming business with high acclaim, we aren't talking "soylent green," - but the ingredients are similar. particularly brilliant is the song where mrs. lovett pitches her idea to mr. todd. even in the introductory number, the line "...they went to their maker impeccably shaved..." gives a great indication of the premise, the drama, and the comedy to come. outstanding!

i viewed my videotape last night, for the first time in at least ten years. i found the work itself and the performances just as gripping as they were in my memory. george hearn, of course,was the master of the role of sweeney; there is never a touch of softness in his determination to wreak vengeance on those he believes caused his wife's death and his daughter's disappearance; at least not until the end, when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to murder his wife. angela lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex portrayal, as mrs. lovett. she understood that sondheim wanted that role to be something of a "comic" counterpart to sweeney; and even brings some tenderness into her courtship of sweeney and her nurture of the boy tobias. for those with long memories, this performance takes one back to her debut performances in the picture of dorian grey and gaslight; long before murder, she wrote. only a year ago i saw the musical at lyric opera of chicago. with current opera superstar brynn terfel as sweeney. others have commented on the operatic quality of the score. my conclusion is that "sweeney" works better with actors who can at least handle the vocal lines, than with opera performers who have limited acting skills. as a final note, i commend the performer who portrayed tobias. with his mixed loyalties and confusion about what is going on around him. it seemed appropriate that he had virtually the last word.

i can't get over the quality of the score, the book, and the performances. this is the first production i've ever seen of sweeney todd so i have no others to compare it to. but the impact is so strong, i just can't imagine anything better.first, there's the music -- take "johanna" (act ii), during which sweeney, anthony and johanna sing an interwoven vocal line incorporating the melodies from three songs. it's like a bach chorale in that sense -- just a masterpiece of composition. and the underlying chord structure and voicings are so perfect -- a little bit of melancholy, a little bit of contentment, a little bit of yearning, all expressing these three singers' points of view.then -- the lyrics. the rhymes are so clever. the rhyme schemes sometimes seem random but they always add up at the end. (the dvd, which i watched, has closed captions, and these are indispensable for appreciating the dialog and the lyrics.) sondheim deserves a literary award for his poetry alone.finally, the performances. i can't imagine anyone better than george hearn. why haven't i heard of him before? his singing, alone, is masterful, but the range of his acting is simply amazing. angela lansbury totally surprised me. the song about "you and me down by the seaside" -- who could do it any better? her timing is flawless, pitch is perfect, every beat of the score is accounted for; and overlaying this achievement in musicianship is her utterly delightful comic delivery.it's a dark tale but i found it to be sweet at times; and the tune to "johanna" continues to play in my head.

it looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film! but do! i expected nothing from this movie, just something to pass the time, but i was hooked from the start! two interesting premises - a bank robbery gone wrong, a million dollars missing and two girls on the road to start a new life - how will these two stories collide? just when you think you know what direction the movie is headed, it does a 180 and you are left blown away by the great twists in the plot! it has a great but unexpected ending, and you are left wanting more - always a good sign - rent it or even buy it, you will not be disappointed!

black day blue night was actually good modern noir. three young nomads on the run from their own lives team up on something of a road trip through a desert in the middle of nowhere (as most modern noir does). one woman finds that her husband is cheating on her, and after finding him in a hotel room, decides to head off and start anew. strangely enough, she travels with her husband's mistress, who is forgiveable given that the sleazebag never told her he was married. and together, while driving in the pouring rain, they meet a third, very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets. while they're giddy and free and all suspicious of one another, the cops back at town have them marked as suspects in the death of a policeman.black day blue night starts out with immediate confrontation, and throws in a pretty good story with all it's twists meant to mislead your suspicions of one character after another, leading to a very unusual ending. that is, the movie starts with immediate action confrontation, and once you think the story is solved, you are immediately thrust into yet another turn in the plot, revealing just a little more than you expected before the movie is over. but, as some viewers have written, the ending is slightly confusing and a bit of a let down. the killer is not who you would immediately expect and, once revealed, becomes somewhat confusing due to a rather thinly explained flashback which reveals all of the necessary motive to solve the mystery. but actually, there is a finale beyond that, which i would think is the most interesting of the film. because modern noir always involves a circle of criminal suspects, almost always all of them guilty of something, it is also a genre that always involves money. and thus the question in these movies always becomes --how far are the characters willing to go for money?if you like this rendition of modern film noir, i would suggest watching red rock west (it's also got j.t. walsh and some going-ons in the blasted desert)!

blondell & farrell are excellent. blondell was edible. this was very funny and i laughed often throughout it. great dialogue and its loaded with wisecracks. i could've watched it for hours. tremendous fun to watch.

dear readers, 2001: a space odyssey is kubrick at his best...although i really can't say that as space odyssey is his only film i've ever watched. but still, it's a good film. strange, but good.the movie is in three acts, much like the novel...which is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay. anyhow, we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with also sparach zarathustra blaring on the speakers. then comes the boring beyond belief 'dawn of man' sequence. then there's the odd 'finding of the monolith' sequence on the moon, played to strauss's blue danube. finally things get good with the spaceship scenes and hal going berserk and killing people. after that things die down and we have the 'entering the monolith' sequence which was way too long and the ultra-strange ending. even though, 2001: a space odyssey is a good film. it's not star wars, stargate, terminator, or the abyss, but it rocks. my compliments to the chef, mr. kubrick.signed, the constant dvd collector

i played sam (the porter, lou's sidekick) in the film "dead rail" which later aired as "alien express." and, i have to say that for my part i thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. as a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) turi(the director) and steve and scott (the producers) were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production. i made many friends (lou, todd, steven) and i consider myself very fortunate to have been able to work with these incredibly talented people. there was not a day that went by that i did not laugh my butt off. the real tragedy isn't so much the special effects, it's that every single person who watched this film didn't get to see what happened behind the scenes and all the talent that truly went into it. craftsmen building the set, prop masters, gaffers,wardrobe, makeup artists, script supervisors, the cinematographer, production assistants, extras, craft services, producers, director, and actors. it's a given that sci fi didn't spend a terrible amount of money on the film (2 million) but there was a lot of time, energy, and man power that was instilled into it. i look on the film now as a production that brought a lot of talented people together for a fun project that was shot without complications in less than two months. it was a magnificent cast and crew and i'm just so glad to be apart of it! on a further note to those of you who don't know lou diamond phillips, todd bridges, and steven brand. they are fantastic people who are incredibly funny. lou i still am working on my deniro impression and can't thank you enough for introducing me to "midnight run." todd, every time i hear an elvis song i can't forget the story you told me about hanging out with him at his house for dinner. "can you please pass me the pa tators?" (im a huge elvis fan!) steven, "mr. brand!" you are a true gent and all the advice and encouragement i received from you will always be appreciated. i miss you guys and hope you are well. thanks for the good memories, stories, jokes,and friendship. oh and miss utah says hello! wink wink.joe-

really don't care that no one on here likes this movie,, i do , and that's what this review is about. lou diamond phillips is great in this comedic role. that line about train a b and c is now to me an instant classic, the cg is great, yeah train looks a little fake,, but the aliens wow do they ever rock,, todd bridges,, where's arnold, and mr. drummond,, wow he's been out of the loop , guess that's what jail does to you.. a bullet train is on it's way to las vegas with the senator for him to deliver a big speech, a meteor has just hit,, and now all of a sudden we got aliens running loose aboard the train, and our hero cop has to save the day, to make matters worse his ex-wife is on board arguing with him. i just thought this movie was so wonderful,, a must see if you like action.

the movie is good and i think tiffany amber is very beautiful. i liked the movie. can anyone tell me how i can get hold of the songs from this movie? even the soundtrack will do. if that's not possible, can i at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? i tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. i tried cd baby, not there either. i browsed through google to get some details but there weren't any. i would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question. i know that the songs belong to country music and is sung by a country artist. i just need the title names along with the singer. i would recommend this movie or rather the songs to any country loving person.

surprisingly good made for t.v. thriller. i wasn't expecting too much from this one but i'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. it's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. the story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.the background story of thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.the "stranger" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society. a serial rapist does not respect society or even his own family and this movie displays the sickness and crime in a perfect way. my beef with the movie was the non sense situation when thiessen's character returns home with her deranged husband after he's released on bail. by that moment she knew what he did to his young relative (played by the cute allyson hannigan). but that's just the typical hollywood scene that provokes more trouble. the climax scene shows thiessen following her husband when he's about to commit another rape, then she calls the cops who come in time just to capture him. the ending tells us that the husband was sentenced for 99 years in prison in real life. the acting is also pretty good, and tiffany is great and gorgeous as always. the direction is also very good.

hmm, is it right to compare tiffani thiessen and mark-paul gosselaar's post saved by the bell acting? of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. and is right to give this movie a `10' rating? hahahahahaha... that's funny. this movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than i expected it to be. made-for-tv movies are often so so so similar. so many of them have the same feel to them. this one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story. before it started i had envisioned ms. thiessen as a vixen type 90210 seductress but here she was as innocent as kelly kapowski which was refreshing. eric close surprised me by playing his part really well. with some decent writing the director got a pretty good, convincing performance out of him without being at all cheesy. all in all it was somewhat interesting, definitely better than most tv movies. my grade: b-

gerald mcraney,(dave morgan),"war crimes",'01 tv series, was like a father to tiffani thiessen,(jennifer gallagher),"a kiss before lying",'03, who experience a very bad situation in her life and it caused jennifer to be withdrawn with people and young men. dave morgan tries desperately to get her out of the house and manages to introduce jennifer to chris (gallagher) who falls madly in love with her at their very first meeting. in almost one or two dates later, chris asks jennifer if she will marry him and she agrees. it is not very long after the wedding that things start to happen, chris is in the navy and does not like working in submarines and things start happening to young gals in the neighborhood. this is a very excellent tv film and it sometimes makes you wonder if the guy or gal i want as a soul mate is the perfect person !

when i saw the preview for this movie, i figured to myself, "here's another dumb tv movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera," but when i saw it i was surprised. tiffany-amber thiessen stars (and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (now and again's eric close) but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community. at first, she is blinded by his assurances that he is innocent and her love for him, but as time passes she continues to be suspicious of him.while this sounds like the set-up for another boring melodramatic tv-movie, it is really much better than that, because the characters are well-acted by thiessen and close, and the movie's script allows them to be much more complicated and intelligent than you'd expect; these aren't just caricatures or cardboard characters that exist only to move the plot along but real, three-dimensional people, and we find ourselves really caring about them. and the movie is smart enough that it is able to provide an exciting, involving climax to the story without resorting to dumb action scenes, mindless cliches or cheap melodrama. instead we share in the main character's inner conflicts and fears, and are given a realistic portrayal of how she might be able to resolve them and do the right thing.if you get a chance to give this one a look, please do so. it's production values are not exactly top-notch (it is a tv movie, after all), but if you can look past that, there is an excellent story to enjoy.

at initial thought, the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and a gag, just for stan lee's amusement. i expected nothing more than a sleazy, animated version of barb wire with low production values, much like those short pieces of crap you see on adult swim for short term amusement, but can never taken too seriously. boy was i wrong!stripperella has even better production values than similar marvel toons. the animation is very good and it seems that they've taken this series very seriously and given it a full effort to make it a professional production as possible.the humor is good too, on the sexy, suggestive and sleazy side. it is very similar if not exactly like the simpsons style. you may encounter clichés and a lot of predictable humor but its still fun nevertheless. if this were running today, i'd surely see it regularly. its surprisingly one of the better toons ever made.

one cannot help but be impressed with the intelligence and scale of this film, and simultaneously disappointed by the lost opportunities.i found the script to be excellent, and the vocal talent of edmund purdom quite impressive. however, as an artifact of its time, the film suffers from too many hollywood-isms, especially poor casting, too much lushness of the sets, and too much pretentiousness. edmund purdom (who plays the title character) is so obviously awkward with physical acting, i suspect he had primarily been in shakespearean theater before this.so if movie people are reading this, i propose this as an excellent candidate for a remake, especially if you cast real egyptians as egyptians!

i had the pleasure to view this film when i was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in egyptology). i know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.the film only approximates mika walteri's "the egyptian", in plot. a good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.the music score by b. hermann and alfred newman is beautiful!!! performances as follows. the late edmond purdom gave an excellent performance as an orphaned child adopted by parents past their child bearing years. he states that he keeps to himself,has the best education available and lets' face it is a rather emotionally distant person, given his upbringing and high intellect.jean simmons is fine as a humble tavern maid; honest loving and sincere. bella darvi, people complained about her accent, well she is a babylonian. it is not that apparent in the film as to why sinhue is so insanely obsessed with nefer nefer nefer. her correct name. in the book sinhue is enjoying her carnal fruits and gets his revenge early in the plot by leaving nefer nefer nefer's drugged body with the "house of the dead's " workers.gene tierney as baketaten, is brilliant! when she tells sinhue that he is pharoah, she looks like she could devour him (in his weakness). she is intense, brilliant and coldly beautiful.michael wilding is heartbreakingly tragic in his mission to bring all people to know his one god. i believe that we are viewing ankhnaten thru the lens of egyptologist a. weigall. a view at the time that had a pre-messiah feeling about ankhnaten's vocation. did his monotheism influence the jewish people? note psalm 104. and other egyption imagery in the psalms?mr. peter ustinov provided the alter ego to sinhue. he is street wise and cunning a survivor. excellent acting as always.mature never thought much of his acting personally, his horemheb is fine as an ambitious "super patriot" who ultimately has sinhue murder more than one person in his quest for power, (walteri's book).i felt that the ending to the egyptian was confusing as sinhue's personality changes too easily. he has a living son (toth dies in the novel), power is handed to him through is half sister baketaten, he world savvy now and has a grip on international affairs. so he became enlightened? he could have modified the amon priesthood as he was capable.but no! sinhue gives everything up, everything including his son's future to become a ragged beggar preaching monotheistic love?this change was too immediate and the major flaw in the script!again the look of the film,colour, most of the costumes(nefer nefer nefer's gold dress was too over the top as she is more richly dressed than the royal family), music is beautiful.i will watch this film again easily.p.s. i know that you porbably know that horemheb did not directly succceed ankhnaten, but i could not resist stating this fact.

the philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. i'd give it 10 stars for that alone. that being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what i take, possibly incorrectly, to be its art direction. many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated munsell color model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. this makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself. i think this movie is genuinely unique for this quality, and if for no other reason, earns it a full, careful, digital restoration. fox, are you listening?

when this film gets it right it really gets it right. and when it goes wrong... i'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. i can even isolate the bad bit. it's everything that has to do with the romance. everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. i'd recommend skipping that section if you can. it does nothing except explain his exile. it should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside. fortunately, the period from about 0-30 and 1:00-2:19 (the end) is excellent.there are a number of excellent performances in this film, and an equal number of terrible ones. just like everything else in this movie the acting is either perfect or terrible. peter ustinov as the slimy one-eyed slave kaptah is perfect. it is one of his best performances, up there with his role in spartacus. victor mature as the ambitious horemheb is also perfect. again, one of his best roles. jean simmons is wasted as merit, the perfect girl in love with our hero john carradine gives a nice supporting role as a philosophical grave robber; and michael wilding is excellent as akhnaton, the idealistic pharaoh who tries to bring peace and monotheism to egypt only to see it fall apart due to his unwillingness to fight. now for the bad. edmund purdom as sinuhe is sadly miscast. this is doubly unfortunate as he is the main character. the entire film revolves around him. he actually does rather good as the disillusioned exile and the wise old man. this is because of his sorely limited range. he doesn't seem able to put any passion into his words. this is especially apparent during the love scenes which are beyond awkward. he spends the last half of the film as an old man, a performance at which he is decent enough at. he does have the perfect voice for the character. the less said about bella darvi as nefer, the treacherous babylonian woman, the better.the costuming and sets are magnificent. this is the only film that i know of that attempts to depict life in egypt that isn't overshadowed by jews or romans. the film takes place in the 14th century b.c. which is before even exodus. the only monotheists are the pharaoh akhenaten and his followers. there is the same strong element of religious zeal that can be found in most epics, but it is done differently and it only shows up at the very end. an interesting note: by having akhenaten followed by horemheb as pharaoh, the film completely skips over the most famous pharaoh of all: tutankhamen. seems kind of a strange thing to do when using that name could increase awareness of the film.be warned: this is a 1950s epic film. if you don't like that type of thing then don't expect this one to be different. it is different, but it is still an epic. i appreciate this film, and i appreciate what it did and what it tried to do. this is a film that should be better remembered than it is.

film historians have said much about ancient epics that have been the interest of many directors from the beginning of cinema. the pioneers of such epics, particularly biblical ones, were d.w griffith with his "mother of all epics" intolerance (1916), and cecil b demille with his flair for magnificent spectacles, costumes and lavish scenes. who can forget his ten commandments (1923, 1956) or the sign of the cross (1932)? nevertheless, here comes another epic, made in the 1950s, directed by michael curtiz, and based on the novel by mika waltari, "the egyptian." michael curtiz, already famous for his great classic casablanca (1941) wonderfully manages to adjust his film to the audiences of that time, to entail the most important ideas and facts from the thick novel, and to recreate the lifestyle of the egyptians who lived in one of the most amazing periods, in the reign of akhnaton.the first and most important fact for me in this movie is the psychological development of the main character that edmund purdom plays. sinuhe, having been brought up in a simple family by his step parents, becomes a physician. all his life, he never stops asking a question "why?" and searching for the answer. alluring love that he finds in a courtesan nefer (bella darvi) leads him to financial and spiritual disaster. he has to repair the mistakes by hard work in the house of death and starting to build up his reputation from nothing. first, he thinks that the only cure is revenge. however, in the long run, he realizes that "eye for eye" is no solution. finally, what stands before him in very strange circumstances is the temptation to be a pharaoh. nevertheless, there is one moment he finds the answer for his questions that touched him throughout his life... the story of the main character, though based on the book, is so interesting psychologically that every open minded person should consider this aspect in the film. the main character's psychological struggle is intensified by the times he lived in, the times when, probably for the first time to that extend, the power of sword clashed with the power of thought.curtiz's movie also retains one rule that all films of his era kept to: great cast and lavish sets. there are mostly british actors and actresses who give very nice performances. how is it possible not to mention the mainstay of ancient epic, victor mature. this time, he is not demetrius, hannibal or samson but horemheb - a fighter, a lover, at last a pharaoh. jean simmons appears in a very delicate role of merit, a woman who loved sinuhe all her life but it was too late when he realized that. peter ustinov, probably most famous for his gorgeous performance as nero in quo vadis? three years earlier, does a great job as kaptah, sinuhe's friend. the royalty of the film is also played by two great cast, gene tierney and michael wilding. tierney is excellent as cold, desirous of power baketamon, the sister of pharaoh. wilding gives a marvelous performance as "insane" akhnaton. when i was in louvre in paris and saw akhnaton's original face carved in stone, he looked very much the same as the actor in the film. bella darvi, an actress born in poland, is quite memorable as a wicked courtesan nefer. and there is one more actress who appears only in one scene but whom it is hard to forget, judith evelyn as taia, pharaoh's mother. this voice, these eyes!the sets are magnificent. the director recreated the most probable image of the outdoor temple of aaton, the god that the egyptians worshiped to in the reign of amenhotep iv. i also loved the scene of pharaoh's first entrance. what a glorious picture that forever lasts in one's memory!!! however, there is also one aspect that i would like to draw the attention of all people interested to see the film. the egyptian is similar to other epics in many respects, but it also stands out as a unique film. there are very few films which make such a wonderful use of different curiosities as for ancient times. there is a mention of iron used first by the hetites. it's also the only film about ancient egypt which talks openly of egyptians' magnificent curing abilities. it memorably shows the contrasts of lifestyles, particularly the moment of a slave's death for whom no one cares followed by the announcement and consequently the widespread mourning after the death of pharaoh. finally, "the egyptian" shows one historical fact: there were other nations except for jews (before christ) where the spirit of god shone in some human hearts. yet, the only difference was that it did not survive that long as at jews' because it did not have a strong fundament. the scene of akhnaton's death supplies you with so many biblical and christian values that you may think you watch a religious movie.all things considered, i highly recommend michael curtiz' film. it is a great production at multiple levels: an entertainment for epic fans, an admiration of marvelous performances for cinema fans, a soul feast for spiritual people. finally, it is a beautiful story of extraordinary things which happened thirteen centuries before the birth of jesus christ.

few people realize it, but there was world literature in the ancient world before the greeks came on the scene. besides the literary remains that are in the "old testament" of the jews, there were considerable works from mesopotamia and egypt. the summit of the former were the religious poetry and "the epic of gilgamesh". the egyptians produced many poems, but there main addition was a tale of adventure of a traveler and physician called "the story of sinuhe". it is from this work (actually a fragment, that we don't know the ending of) that the novel "the egyptian" came from.the story is unique (as is the movie). "the egyptian" was a best seller in the early 1950s, and darryl zanuck decided to take a chance making it: yes he wanted a showcase for his girlfriend bella darvi as nefer, as well as the rest of the cast (victor mature, edmund purdom, peter ustinov, michael wilding, and gene tierney), but he was aware that these films rarely made large box office. one can chalk up this as an example of zanuck trying something different.the number of movies that deal with ancient egypt are very small. "land of the pharoahs", "the egyptian", "the ten commandments" (both de mille versions), "moses", "holy moses!", "cleopatra", "the mummy" (all versions), "the scorpion king". if there are 20 films about ancient egypt it's is tremendous. but "the egyptian" is unique. while the second "ten commandments" discusses ramses the great (pharoah ramses ii - yul brynner) and his father seti i (cedric hardwicke), and the films on cleopatra deal with her, few other names of ancient egypt crop up in film. egypt's greatest pharoah was thutmose iii, who conquered most of the known middle east of the era of 1470 b.c.e. or so. no film about him has appeared, nor of his usurping predecessor, history's first great female ruler hatschepsut. but the only known pharoah who attempted a religious revolution that approached what the jews (and later the christians) attempted - a type of monotheism - is the subject of "the egyptian". this is pharoah akhnaton.in reality akhnaton was practicing a personal form of monotheism that was not meant for public consumption. but it angered the priestly class who worshiped amon, rather than aton. due to our uncertain historic records (although akhnaton's official records - the "tel-el-amana" letters - are quite complete as far as they survive), we do not know if the pharoah was killed in a palace coup or not. however he died, he was succeeded by a young brother or son of his whose name is better recalled than any other pharoah except ramses: tutankhamon.this film is actually quite good as far as it goes. wilding makes a good natured akhnaton, who is too weak to be as effective as a religious reformer is supposed to be. mature is good as the ambitious (and - outside the film - ultimately successful future pharoah) horemheb. tierney and purdom do well in their lead parts and ustinov is good as purdom's friend. also good is ms darvi, in a large supporting part. in a wonderful cameo is john carridine, as a philosophical grave robber. the film is certainly worthy of viewing, as one of the few attempts to show part of the history and culture of ancient egypt.

one of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. to have it totally wash over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, experience it to the fullest. every time i see it, 'the egyptian' is such a film. over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. but perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. it is at once forbidding, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies within! the haunting chords of the music, seen over the 20th-fox logo, usher us into titles of other-worldly turquoise lettering.strange! archaeological! decadent! it is as if we are descending into some vault of antiquity, wherein might be great treasures, mixed with uncertain hazards. (one might imagine darryl zanuck commanding: 'make it ancient!') then, what a darkly dramatic story unfolds, all within the same tone set at the start.of hollywood's mid-50s 'egyptian trilogy', 'the ten commandments' portrayed the civilization's sternness, the phenomenal 'land of the pharaohs' its nuts and bolts, while 'the egyptian' shows it all, from glamour to tragedy, for us to wonder at.no need to say much about the players here, but i think that, with the passage of time, bella darvi is being redeemed. what a perfect face for the role, right out of a symbolist painting. if her acting does not please some, it might be argued that, in her role as a 'courtesan', she is obviously better in bed than yakking to some poor helpless admirer. i think that curtiz captured the kinkiness of her sado-masochistic relationship with edmund purdom's character with aplomb, censorship being what it was at the time. sir peter ustinov, in his memoirs, was pretty kind to 'the egyptian', writing that it was 'like being lost in a huge set for 'aida'. his pronunciation of the word 'beer' i have adopted myself ever after.(one of the film's historically accurate references: the egyptian's invented beer!) henry daniell, egads, what a perfect performance. gene tierney, what a screen treasure. bless dfz for giving her this 'late' role. c'mon folks, don't be so hard on victor mature! he's a cheesemaker's son! who rose to be pharaoh! sounds like a peculiarly american opportunity. one of the best moments: john carradine's existential observations on the sands of time. and purdom's utterance about dwelling beyond the sunset of the world. if that isn't grade 'a' epicness, what is?of course, along with everything else, the music is sublime. it is frequently noted that alfred newman and bernard herrmann created one of the screen's most compelling scores, perfectly harmonious, yet each theme is well developed, with a life of its own. newman, pressed for time by dfz, called in herrmann, someone he could trust implicitly, to take up half the burden.benny, not the easiest guy to work with, obviously respected newman enough to really deliver inspiring music. they alternated cues, an ingenious approach. no spoilers as to who did what here, but benny brings an edge with him, mysterious, awesome sounds. alfred brings fulsomeness, longing, poignancy. both are consummately epic. even when seen on a squeezed tv print, the effect of seeing the two composers' names side by side in the main credits, which the ultra-wide anamorphic screen could comfortably accommodate, is spine-tingling.leon shamroy, the dean of cinemascope, does not let us down here. the lurid greens and moody shadows (probably distortions in all the terrible tv prints i've seen through the years) perfectly accompany the multi-dimensional script (by the great philip dunne and wb vet casey robinson, whom curtiz must've brought with him to 20th). how remarkable it is that shamroy, who was as much of an institution of cinematography at fox as newman was with music, would lens 'cleopatra' a few years later, but in the brighter, sharper images of '60s todd a-o. these old studio guys are really heroes of mine.to me, who wants to fret about all the imperfections and criticism opportunities in a picture like this? i'd rather yield entirely to its spell, and dive off into its sea of lavishness, to emerge after the inspiring climax of 'the end' refreshed, moved, and hungry for more.and yes, we should cry out to 20th-fox for a dvd release worthy of dfz's legacy.

although, this episode was offensive to the tourette syndrome association, others thought it was funny, while others thought it was a bad way to start the new season.this episode was funny and just shocking. south park has made history as being their first episode with the most cuss words, unless you count the movie as an episode.i enjoyed how they made fun of chris hansen and his television show, to catch a predator. i didn't like the idea on how they thought chris hansen would do a show on tourettes and let a boy speak out and bash the jews.one thing i did not like is how south park thought that people with tourettes syndrome would just blurt out bad language like that. i've seen people on television with tourettes syndrome and they do not just blurt out bad words. unless i am incorrect.

i tell you although it is funny how how this many swear words are in this one i'm sure the number of profanities and swear words in it would probably count up to about 200 because from what i last heard the greatest number of swear words on a south park episode is 165 counts of the word s**t but aside from that its so funny because in it there is swear words and also paedophiles shooting themselves in the head watch this for your own survival also look out for a mention of cartmans father and also the annoying voice of chris hanssseeeen and also kyle has to save cartman from paedophiles (the catch a predator show is also on dateline) and they track a peado down and when they got there the peado "shot himself"

la petit tourette is a pretty funny south park episode.cartman is at the toy store one day and here's a kid swearing out loud but not getting in trouble for it.his mother then tells everyone that the kid has "tourette syndrome".cartman loves the fact that he can swear without getting into trouble so he tells everybody that he has tourette syndrome.kyle, however finds out that cartman is lying and tries to tell people, but they think he is insensitive and is put in a "tourette sensitivity training" type place.cartman's tourette's eventually land him a spot on a talk show, however he finds that he cannot control his tourettes and starts saying embarrassing things that happen to him.meanwhile, kyle tries to sabotage the show in an interesting way.

this was another great episode from season 11 of south park. cartman fakes having tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. he is able to swear at the other kids at school. kyle tells the principal that cartman is faking it. but, she doesn't believe it. chris hansen is planning on having cartman to be on dateline to talk about tourette syndrome live and uncensored. but later on, cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff. this was a funny episode about cartman faking tourette syndrome. i recommend it to any south park fan.

this is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the season 11 episodes (with the exception of the imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of season 11. so basically cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to cartman. you can imagine, now cartman has tourette's syndrome and is great since kyle once he knows about this is like "he's faking". cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody. on the other hand we have kyle who now is the intolerant one, basically for saying that cartman was faking he was taken to meet children with tourette's syndrome just to let him see that tourette's syndrome is for real and is great since kyle is like "well maybe someone is faking to have tourette's for fun", in short kyle could not explain that cartman was faking. probably my favourite scene of this episode is when cartman is with kyle's family but right after this scene another kid fins that cartman is simply faking, the kid with tourette's who was at the toy store, cartman basically said to that kid this: "isn't having tourette's awesome". but to be saying whatever he wants and be for everybody a brave boy is sort of just the beginning for cartman, his master plan: going on national tv to say anything he wants ("people will call it brilliant tv, they'll probably give me an emmy"- fantastic, in this episode the word "s***" is used 26 times and certainly that's not all. south park won an emmy like a month or so before this episode aired). but here there's a twist, cartman basically removed all the bricks of the wall, he says now everything without thinking so we hear from cartman that he wet his bed last night, now is not fun for cartman and he is like "i can't control what i say" and certainly the person who was with him is like "well of course you can't control what you say, you have tourette's" so cartman is like "my tourette's has gotten worse, before i just blurted out cool stuff about jews being lame and stuff but now it's gotten really bad". there is also stuff about chris hansen and to catch a predator, actually what happened with a pervert here happens with a lot more perverts, kyle and thomas were behind that to stop cartman, kyle ends being cartman's saviour! fantastic!tsa voices concern over "south park" october 3rd episode on wednesday, october 3, the cable network comedy central will air an episode of the animated series "south park" in which one of the young characters, cartman, "gets" tourette syndrome. given the nature of this program, we fully expect it to be offensive and insensitive to people with ts and garner numerous calls and emails from our members and the ts community.we have already taken some pre-emptive strikes, such as requesting that comedy central air our public service announcement (featuring comedian richard lewis) during or after the show. in addition, once the episode airs and we are able to see exactly how ts is portrayed, we will be able to respond with specific issues and problems we have with the show to the writers."we are actually surprised it took the creators so long to use ts as comedy fodder in this program, since no disability, illness or controversial topic is off limits to them," said judit ungar, president, tsa."we always see portrayals of ts (good and bad) as an opportunity for awareness and education, and a show of this magnitude and popularity is certainly no exception and provides a way for tsa to spread factual information about the disorder," said tracy colletti- flynn, manager of public relations and communications, tsa.we will be posting an official statement on this site with tsa's reaction to the program after the show airs.tsa responds to "south park" episode unfortunately, as has been the case with far too many media portrayals of people with tourette syndrome (ts), the season opener of south park ("le petit tourette," 10-3-07) served to perpetuate even further the outright myth that most of those affected by ts have involuntary outbursts of foul language. in point of fact, fully 85-90% of people with ts never experience this tragically socially stigmatizing symptom (medically termed coprolalia). for viewers less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder, the misleading take away message couldn't have been clearer  unless you curse, you don't have ts. despite our pre-airing trepidations, we do concede that the episode was surprisingly well- researched. the highly exaggerated emphasis on coprolalia notwithstanding, for the attentive viewer, there was a surprising amount of accurate information conveyed. the scripted input from parents, a neurologist, peers and the therapy session with the "ts children's support group" all served as a clever device for providing these facts to the public. "no doubt this south park episode did generate increased national awareness about ts. nevertheless, we are very concerned that school children with ts will be mocked and even bullied by insensitive peers who may have seen the program," said judit ungar, tsa president. "we realize that for over a decade the writers' satirical parodies have spared no group be they celebrities, the disabled or political figures. the fact that ts was the subject of a popular tv show attests to the fact that the public is so much more aware of the disorder. obviously, this increased awareness we've worked too hard to accomplish can at times prove to be a double-edged sword." tsa contacted the program's executives prior to the airing, and we will be in touch with them again. perhaps we'll succeed in turning this into an opportunity for positive ts awareness.

america's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately i have become bored with it.cycle 1: yeah i'm happy adrienne won, i wanted her to win from the beginning.cycle 2: its too bad, i think mercedes deserved it.cycle 3: i did not like eva, but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle.cycle 4: kahlen should have won. i don't know what they saw in naima, but i definitely know what they saw in kahlen.cycle 5: like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either. but out of all the girls, nicole as a winner? eww!cycle 6: i liked sara and joanie, but danielle is okay too.cycle 7: caridee definitely deserved it.cycle 8: no, i didn't want jaslene to win. i didn't like her. i saw other girls in that cycle with definitely more potential than her, although i did not see much of this cycle.good show, i've just seen it too many times to like it much anymore :d

i mean let's face it, all you have to do in modelling is pose for photos. the judging is so over the top with it's criticism. the show however is entertaining, especially with tyra banks, nigel barker, j alexander and the supermodel herself twiggy. i've watched season 5, 6, 7 and in the middle of season 8. it looks like american idol gone sexy but i'm a guy and i only watch it because of the hot girls posing in their bikinis! the show can be quite boring, when it comes to judging, tyra tends to go on and on and it's really off-putting. anyway would i recommend it? yes, would i recommend it to women wanting to go into the modelling business? no.

this is the best show ever no matter what you say!i have been watching this show since cycle 1.this show is never boring its wonderful how you see peoples dream come true of being a model.tyra is trying her best to help young women not be ashamed of their bodies and make them believe that they are beautiful in their own way and that you don't have to feel beautiful by being anorexic.and just as tyra says on the tyra show so what if your curvy so what if you have a big round booty so what if you have a big nose so what if your not as beautiful as the people in magazines you are beautiful to her.so what...............................

"americans next top model" is the best reality show! i was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.i kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, i did blink) it can be sad, funny, or addicting.(mostly addicting)"america's next top model" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. it is also on more that one channel. sometimes it's on mtv other times it's not. i hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series! it's great for pretty much all ages so every can enjoy it! :)also, if you watched the show before, haven't you noticed that tyra has a different hair style each time in the judging room? she'll have it short and curly one week, and then long and straight the next.

having dabbled in the modeling industry (as a model), i watch this show with a slightly different view than most might. while i admit antm can be a fun, and entertaining show, as the seasons go on it seems to continue to drift from any reality.the show seems to be almost pure publicity for its contestants, seeing that none of the show's winners (or fellow contestants) have made much of a name for themselves out from under of the show's umbrella. maybe that's because the truth is any girl with real potential to be a high-fashion model shouldn't have too much difficulty submitting to agencies (you can do so via email or snail mail if distance prevents you from attending an agency open call), signing to an agency, and starting a modeling career. yes, the process does not guarantee success, but apparently neither does antm. and participating in a reality show seems to offer less of a boost in the modeling business, than signing to a top or decent agency (which only one contestant each cycle has a guarantee of anyway).nonetheless, the show can't hurt, certainly can be amusing, and has a sort of magic that particularly works for teenage girls, i have found. though, i must add, antm may become a tad tiring and dull, after watching several cycles, as it has become for me. and besides some unrealistic situations (each more outrageous than the last) the only other annoyance, is the overuse of "tyra, tyra, tyra!" tyra seems to genuinely want to guide these girls to success, but is it necessary for each of models' temporary digs to be covered in tyra pictures; for virtually every panel and challenge to include a story or scenario that "tyra" experienced and overcame? i think not.in my opinion, take out a little tyra, put back in a little more reality, and antm could be a 10 star show, instead of a 7.

this is ten times better than "who wants to be a super model" on bravo i think it is more true to the business. tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and is able to get the most out of each aspiring model. the photos look for depth in each of the models, in personality and beauty, strength and demure attributes, and the ability to endure and work for what they want. i enjoy seeing tyra's personal experience brought into the photo shoots and on the runway. i don't always agree with the judges decision's or tyra's comments and at least one of the winners, i feel did not deserve to win. but this is just a show and every girl on there is very lucky to have this chance.

yes, i watch this show. because my girlfriend watches it, of course. well, at least, that's what i tell my friends. but as nobody here ever known me, i can say this; i love it! that's excellent trash tv. first, there's the panel; tyra herself, who doesn't miss a single opportunity to talk about herself, yet she is to be taken seriously, as she is quite the businesswoman. then there's jay manuel, a sober gay guy, very serious and amazingly professional, and miss jay, an extroverted one, "queen" of the catwalk and a damn funny guy, and nigel, self-styled as the only man on the panel.second, the show is an in-depth look at a shallow industry, and we've got to give it to the producers for showing us the inside view, which can be informative as well as entertaining.finally, the edition is great; there is just the right mix of everything; the girls living together in the ego-house, their impressions on sets, the competitions themselves and the judging. all of this slides smoothly with just the right beat. there are no lenghts.of course, there must be other factors that led to eliminations that we don't see in the shows; the panel is made up of capricious divas, extroverted and quick on the bitching; woe to those who offends them! but that being said, as long as one contestant does not step on their toes, their judgment is usually fair - i think.so, give your brain a break; if you can't beat them, join them, and have a good time watching this bit of reality tv with your loved ones. it will make crave for more, somehow.

as if reality shows like "american idol" weren't enough, in which judges like simon cowell shoot razor-sharp barbs to contestants trying to make their mark on the music world -- barbs that many a time has reduced even outstanding singers to tears after what was deemed a "bad performance", now "america's next top model" has for the past three years invaded the boob tube with its own version of "looking for the next big thing" in a business that values superficiality, concepts of beauty, and body dysmorphia.a concept created by tyra banks, who is also a judge in the show, it gathers some fifteen contestants from all walks of life and has them submit themselves to innumerable "tasks" in which they must prove their "talent" in front of the camera and subject themselves not only to the now departed janice dickinson (self-dubbed "american's first supermodel") but the equally catty jay manuel and nore marin who may at one point focus on one girl not performing well and blithely rip her to shreds like it was bad morning coffee. like in many other reality-based shows, each week one contestant is voted off and must pack her bags and immediately leave (a thing that they are reminded by tyra at every turn). of course, there is the bitchy tension between several of the more type-a females, female bonding, tears, dramatic swells of music in key moments, and some truly breathtaking pictures that transform erstwhile ordinary, pretty girls into unattainable goddesses.i'll have to admit, the show is a guilty pleasure. maybe it's the state of mind i'm in, but i kept wondering where the vomitorium was in cases when the already thin girls would need to hurl to make the cut and look the way the judges and photographers and many fickle designers would feel was correct for the moment. even so, it's drawn me in despite my previous paragraph, possibly because i've always had an interest in the fashion world and have always loved watching stunning women being made even more unworldly with make up and perfect lighting. but i wonder where are they going with these increasingly difficult photo shoots. it's as if they were competing with "fear factor". shoots that look like re-enactments of fight scenes in crouching tiger, hidden dragon, shoots where the models have to pose underwater or in almost impossible situations, what's next: posing while tied to train tracks as an oncoming amtrak roars upon them at 70 miles an hour? or a shoot where they are underwater, chained, trying to set themselves free in record time while at the same time looking smashing in chiffon, and never, ever forgetting to smile their pearly whites at that camera? how about a "pit and the pendulum" version of a photo shoot?in one thing the show has to be given some kudos, and it's in a way akin to "american idol". with this i'm probably going to justify the harshness of both shows, and its abrasive judges -- and essentially go against my initial paragraph. "america's next top model" is a show that is an extended audition, like "american idol", and in it the girls will get the sort of test treatment they will receive in the real world, where prospective designers and photographers, as monstrously fickle as they can be, will crush them to bits at the drop of a hat if they can't sell themselves the way they're expected to, and where one is asked to leave, another will supplant her with the necessary requirements. which makes it a wonder that any girl would want to get into such a difficult media, but that's what dreams are made of.going into its fifth season it's been a major disappointment with the departure of janice dickinson; during her run she was a pretty tough barometer as to how the girls should walk, talk, emote, express themselves, and ultimately present themselves as a walking, living product that sells. with the cold addition of twiggy i wonder where it will go from here -- twiggy just can't replace the over-the-top temperament of dickinson. so with janice's absence the show has lost some of its edge and may even have signaled its slow demise, but in the meantime, it's still a catchy pleasure to watch, mindless entertainment on weeknights, if at all for the gorgeous visuals. if at all, it's the show that launched adrienne curry into the spotlight. curry has made a name for herself due to facts that have less to do with modeling as much as her theatric love-affair with one time child actor christopher knight in their very own reality soap opera.

america's next top model is a great reality show in every sense. it has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true america's next top model. of course this is not something easy to do, therefore usa and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.but it's obvious that its intention is not to present the america's next top model, but yes, the america's next pop model. the show gets together a bunch of models without any experience with different personalities and big personal, professional and financial problems, giving them a chance for bringing to life a dream or to make their lives something worthy. it's obvious that tyra banks uses all that for her advantage, she gives the dream, but in exchange for that she gains audience and more popularity. anyway, she deserves it, because she is intelligent and, if i might say that, a pioneer to this kind of show. tyra also is a great observer and knows how to give based opinions, differing herself of other models and hostess of foreign versions of the next top model franchise. in brazil, as an example, fernanda motta is its hostess and "once-upon-a-time"-top model. she doesn't have even 1/10 of tyra's professional skills, which keeps tyra banks on the top. tyra have professional and personal knowledge about what she says and she's a great mentor because she not only criticizes but she points the mistake and teaches the right way with wisdom.the show doesn't suffer from big problems, it does and fulfills what it promises during the cycles. the models chosen to work on the show in fact are not the best unknown models of entire country because tyra banks bets with the difference, and she is right, because she (and also good part of her audience) believes that it's time for the modeling world to change some straight parameters. during the cycles, she and her team really makes fair deliberations, where the weakest go away and the promising ones have new chances to prove their capacities but must be fast to do that, otherwise they lose it.other very interesting thing is that tyra also knows to decide who should or shouldn't win even when she's against people's opinion. she knows that whoever wins will be famous, but has a very few possibilities to truly be a worldwide recognized top model. at the same way she knows that, some times, the second place is more valuable than the first, because 1st place wins the title, but second doesn't gets the title stigma. hardly she makes mistakes when she decides the future of any model during the show.after 9 cycles the show is getting a little tired with some old ideas, it's time for tyra to change some things and lines because it's getting boring and comparing to the firsts cycles we can see that she's getting bored too, so she needs to do that if she wants the show to live a little longer.anyway, the show explores the fashion and modeling world, but it's also entertaining for those ones that live outside all of that. it gives the opportunity for some girls and also the market, and also gives great tips for those ones from the audience who shares the same dream.

this show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! when i first tuned in to america's next top model, i expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. i didn't. this show is actually serious fun. i read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be america's next top model. and it so does! who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? on antm you get to see what it's really like. and who doesn't love hearing the girls bitch about each other and get into fights? or enjoy wanting to throw something at that janice lady?give this a chance. don't expect something intelligent or a show you can look to for a life lesson. just enjoy it for what it is. serious fun!

yes, i am ashamed to admit it, but this show is positively devine!!!it's so entertaining, and i have the absolute greatest time watching it.ever since cycle 1 it's been great, and i haven't noticed a downfall in it's glory at all.tyra banks as you know is the host, and as fabulous as she is, there's also the other judges and co-hosts such as j. alexander, jay manuel, nigel barker, and twiggy.the main point of the show is for every girl invited to become america's next top model, has to work their way up to the top by completing and winning photo shoot competitions.it sounds great already doesn't it, and let me tell you it is great!!!!!it's awesome watching all the different kinds of photo shoots the girls take, and each one is different, cool, and daring.anybody who hates this show, doesn't have a clue, and i will tell you that this show will be on for a long time, so deal with it!!!

i saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! it is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! i was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. it's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. i really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a saturday night rental. with your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :d it's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings. not to mention, beautiful landscape shots and fantastic acting. see it, i'm sure you'll love it as much as i did!

i don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but i saw a poster for some things that stay and i thought, "that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper bs". so i decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. i must tell you, i was happily surprised. i went to this film with no expectations. i didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by katie boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision. alberta watson also did a fantastic job as the role of tamara's disease-stricken mother and i must also add that i was quite impressed with the comedic stylings of megan park as tamara's friend brenda. the film was wonderfully directed by gail harvey, and pulled together in the kind of kitschy 50's way that leaves you feeling warm and happy, even if the storyline tended not to be so uplifting. i also thought that the film was well-shot, many beautiful images of a 1950's countryside will remain in my mind for weeks to come. this film as a whole was quirky and great. i found it to be unpredictable and although the story ends in a somewhat open-ended way, i was still left satisfied. whether you are looking for a fun, yet powerful coming-of-age story, or simply want to reminisce about life in the 1950's, i guarantee this film is for you. even if you have no expectations, it is still quite likely that you will be most impressed. give this one a shot!

this film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. i'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. great acting, directing - and it is canadian to boot! it is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. the locations in ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. with so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. for any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord! it approaches the idea of the afterlife in a contemporary way - without cheaply capitalizing on all the "gohst" and supernatural themes that have become staples in hollywood and the tv networks.

i saw this movie at the philadelphia film festival today and enjoyed it overall. it is an interesting and adept analysis of the all-too-common revelation that our parent's marriage was more flawed and difficult than we originally imagined. in addition, this movie is an excellent example of process of discovering truths about our parent's lives after their death and the issues associated with that. however, i found the sound quality (recording and editing) to be relatively poor and annoying. *** it may very well have been related to the specific theater and projection conditions *** i am not a film maker / student or anything and claim no real understanding of the sound production process, but as a consumer, i found the audio portion of the movie distracting. specifically, i heard very unpleasant lip smacking noises through out (especially one long interview with the younger sister) the film, and often the background noise level was higher in volume than people's voices (for example the scene when a small group was sorting through the mothers papers). has anyone else seen this movie, noticed anything about the sound... thanks

a fascinating slice of life documentary about a husband and wife and their marriage told through the eyes of their son. we all like to think that our parents lived happy lives, that their marriages were full of fulfilment, love, and happy memories. sadly many of us know this not to be the case of their own families and that of their parents. this wonderful little documentary is told through the camera lens and emotional perspective of the son of a family that has just experienced the death of their mother. the son being a documentary film maker has filmed his elder family for many years, for as he states "posterity". three months after the death of his mother his father remarries his long time secretary. the suddenness of this occurrence stuns the family and pushes the son to dig into the past lives of his mother and father. what he reveals is a fascinating look into the lives of two rather ordinary people who like so many of their generation married early for the wrong reasons and found themselves stuck in a family life where they found they just had to "make do". a wife who found herself at times bitterly lonely and unloved and a husband who buries himself in his work. she and intellectual at heart, he a much simpler individual who seems to find most of his pleasures in the quiet solitude of work. they are obviously wrong for each other, this much is clear. yet they stick it out, for what? well that's part of the mystery, they clearly show affection for each other at times if not ever much love. you won't find any truly shocking disclosures here, aside from infidelity on both sides, which in good part is what makes this such a gem. you really feel that these could be your own parents if circumstances were different and indeed makes one question the lives of ones own parents.

fantastic documentary. a movie within a movie. i'm so glad block forged on after his mother's death. makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. what might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? the audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. she was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. she seemed to feel trapped by the situation. i wonder if the therapist ever tried to get her to think about what she could have done to change her situation and free herself? meanwhile, wife #2 was just the opposite. she was out there, working with his dad; ended her bad marriage, supported herself and appears to be a very confident, giving person. whatever the state of the marriage, the blocks did something right in raising 3 kids who could look at their parents' story, be ok with it and share it with us and maybe lead us to start conversations with our parents and spouses.

this film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. this is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and "man of the house". it could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. it touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. i laughed, i cried, i couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really? especially a documentary. this is an excellent film and one that i highly recommended to anyone who enjoys documentaries, stories about families like yours, stories about love, life, parenting, loss, expectations, soul searching, yearning, wandering through life and finding your way, or not.

watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. this is what today's documentaries are all about. it's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. mr. block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. it's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. this film treads very carefully and quite successfully.one would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. quite the opposite: it made me feel good. i feel that i now know more about marriage...about women.definitely check this out, it'll make you think - exactly what a good documentary should be designed to do.

this film took me by surprise. i make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler. all i knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that imdb readers gave it a 7.8, rotten tomatoes users ranked it at 7.9 and the critics averaged an amazing 8.2! if anything, they underrated this little gem.filmmaker doug block decided to record his parents "for posterity" and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents, outspoken mother mina, and less than forthcoming dad, mike. i immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker (mike & mina's son doug) was going to take us. as a matter of fact, i doubt that doug himself knew where he was going with this!life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. it is difficult to verbalize just how moved i was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must-see even if you aren't a fan of the documentary genre. this film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten. "51 birch street" is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. the best news of all is that hbo had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience, eventually, millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work. bravo!!!!!!!!

i first saw love in limbo playing late on free to air tv about five years ago, and since then it's a movie i'll always remember warmly as one of those films you see and are forever influenced by.for the uninitiated, australian film has a long history of making off-beat comedies about lovable losers, and love in limbo is a sterling example of this. whilst russel crowe is the only name actor in it (although these days he's all a movie needs), the rest of the aussie cast is good- he still steals the show as a nervous, nerdy, virgin loser though.the general premise is a lot like american pie. a group of friends wanting to get laid and become men. as you'd expect, the entire movie focusses on this (with a sub-plot about the lead's mother and various other incidents), and is full of humorous situations that push it towards the inevitably sweet ending.if you enjoyed american pie, don't expect this to be the same- but expect the same conventions to make appearances. love in limbo isn't a gross out romantic comedy- but it definitely has its share of laughs, fist pumping moments when the good guy wins, and the situations every guy, australian or otherwise, can relate to.see it if you liked: american pie, almost famous. strengths: good aussie cast, easy to relate to, good perve value. weaknesses: predictable at points. my rating: 8 out of 10

this was a television show that i watched during the 1960s as a child and was captivated by it. in the many years that have passed, i have often thought about this show and how good it would be to watch it again, but being mindful that things of the past are not always as good as you remember them. this was a great show in the 1960s and has lost nothing, even now in 2007. sure there are a few odd production mistakes that you see when watching old shows, and it takes a couple of episodes to get used to the dubbed voices, but having done that, i was as captivated now as i was back in the 1960s. the samurai is played by koichi ose, who plays the role in a very humble manner. i remember during the 60s, due to the popularity of the show here in australia, he toured performing sword play etc, and was overwhelmed by the interest in the show and in him. it was great that one of my all time favourite shows still held the magic that it did during my childhood. a must see series.

i am a new convert you might as well say. i borrowed the dvds from my local library. i have been interested in samurai since watching 'the last samurai.' my dad told me he used to watch shintaro when he was a kid. he said that it was pretty good. we are up to series 3. i absolutely love it. it takes a little to get used to the dubbed english voices over the characters speaking japanese but i really enjoy it all the same. it is a little strange to watch the slight pauses when the ninja stars are thrown at characters and they stick into a tree or wall. i was not used to this but i am now. but i suppose that's the technology they had in the 60s. i've noticed that shintaro is kind, friendly, willing to help those in need, he's very humble, most of the time he doesn't big note himself (he only says he is better than the enemy ninja). i admire shintaro for these qualities. it's really interesting to watch the swordsmanship that koichi ose has. it is amazing. this series is for anyone who are interested in samurai.

i recalled watching this program as a young boy in australia in the 60s, and enjoyed it on dvd again as a 50-year-old father of young kids. although the bad guys are mostly shallow characters and there is a component of violence, i am very happy to have my 6- and 8-year old kids watch this because the central characters are deep, kind and honourable, the japanese culture shines through, the violence is not gory, nobody glories in it, and the program is beautiful to watch. it does not promote nightmares, but instead it shows much of the culture that must have primarily influenced the design of jedi knights in star wars. the quality of the dvds does leave something to be desired. video perfectionists will not like this one. it is strongly reminiscent of something held on 16mm film and projected onto the wall in some basement... which it may well be. the soundtrack is also lacking in the quality we have come to expect from home theatre. however, my kids noticed only that it was not in colour, and i suspect they only noticed that because we had been talking recently about how old things are often like that. the beauty of mt fuji is evident even in b&w. something about the 17th-century setting makes the quality part of the atmosphere, as if you peer into the past through some time window.overall this program is better than most things on the air, and a far better advertisement for japanese tv than pokemon, but you may consider it of marginal value if you did not have the experience of seeing it back in the 60s. my score of 8/10 takes its age into account.

this short was in part four of the "short cinema journal"--a film i rented from netflix but which appears to have originally been a monthly film series for people who like mediocre modern short films and love to have the dvd chock full of commercials. i have so far tried two of the journal's dvds and felt enraged at the horrible way that a viewer needs to navigate the disk in order to see the films. talk about an over-produced and overly complicated way of doing this! while i have and will continue to see as many shorts as i can, i really doubt if i'll bother with the journals because of these factors.now it could be that because i disliked the disk so much that i was not favorably disposed towards this portuguese animated short. this is definitely possible. however, even if this is the case, i feel that the other reviews were way too positive about this simple little film. some of the artwork was indeed nice--i liked how the simple black and white drawings suddenly became 3-d environments as the camera went from a dull distant shot and dove into the city below. this was lovely and took some work. but as for the story about a cat who wants to go to the moon, it just did nothing for me.important update--i saw this film again on a dvd entitled "cartoon noir" on 5/09. it was a pretty unappealing collection of art films. however, this time i saw the story of the cat and the moon with an entirely different audio track and boy did it make a difference. instead of portuguese with subtitles, it had a french accented narrator who spoke english in a film noir style. while i usually hate dubbing, this time it really made the film. the narration of the portuguese version leaves a lot to be desired if you don't know the language or understand the subtleties. unless you speak the language, try looking for the other version (provided you understand english).

awww, i love this! the tale of the cat and the moon doesn't really need an synopsis, as that's what it is... the cat chasing the moon, to a spanish poem. it's the artistry that's interesting. in fact, there was this animated short called the fan and the flower that was an academy award winner last year (2005)... yeah, almost same thing, which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off.but this is a really good short, with stark black & white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction... if you believe cats are poetry in motion, see this and you'll believe it more.also, it has such a touching end.--polarisdib

i caught this as part of the cartoon noir package at the clinton street theater in portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.a perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. funny, charming, and touching. a small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. if it's in your town, see it. this one short is worth the price of admission.

although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. i saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...i just had to live in new york. it has great opening shots of the manhattan skyline with johnny mathis crooning "romance is still...the best of everything..." that rival those of west side story. there is a rather stilted performance by the world's real first supermodel, suzy parker (sorry about that, janice d.), but it's great eye-candy! it also offers a bit of insight into late 1950's american mores--our obsession with (and repression of) sex (in the workplace, no less!), romance, and marriage before women's lib. it represents an era in which new york was at it's finest and a super-bitchy performance by joan crawford is just the icing on the cake.

this 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. this follows the same idea as three coins in a fountain a few years before. this takes place in new york while coins takes place in rome, italy. our three beauties are hope lange, in her first starring role, suzy parker and diane baker. lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely joan crawford. suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau. hard to believe that anyone could reject this beauty for any reason, but louis jourdan, her heart throb, does just this. sort of takes you back to paul neuman rejecting the gorgeous elizabth taylor in cat on a hot tin roof, doesn't it? diane baker, the third damsel in distress, meets and dates robert evans, before he became the producer, and husband to ali macgraw, he is known for. hope's boyfriend from home, played by newcomer brett halsey, is promising to marry her. she also meets stephen boyd, a fellow worker, who has interests in our hope. all three ladies have their drama ahead of them. crawford almost steals the film. her presence and her usual strong bitchy self is fun to watch. veteran actor brian aherne plays one of the bosses with a yen for pinching our leading ladies' back side. he's delightfully charming. also in the cast is martha hyer, wasted in a thankless role never really explored. too bad as i like this actress who never seems to get that one role to distinguish her abilities. she has a crush on a married man in the office played by donald harron, whom i had the pleasure to work with in a couple of shakespeare plays in nyc. he is a distinguished actor that is wasted in this film also.all in all it's great fun, in technicolor and cinemascope, directed by jean negulesco.

having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. good afternoon fare. i understand that louis jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential gorgeous suzy parker. everyone wanted to be in and i believe it has done well and held up over time. best on screen kiss between hope lange and the late stephen boyd.it may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment. i thought the movie was well cast except the awful acting of evans. what a grease ball but he found his niche someplace else. other than that, all stepped up to the plate.

i watched the first few moments on tcm a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. i saw it listed on the schedule at the stanford theatre in palo alto, and i vowed i would make the 40 minute drive. the stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut yes, they have curtains. they opened as the fox logo fanfare began to play. when "the best of everything" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the new york city skyline, i knew i was right for waiting.i lapped this movie up. there were so many little moments that added to the look and feel of the movie: when hope lange walks into the publishing office for the first time, the titles of the magazines published there are etched on the glass (the teenager and elegance); joan crawford's swanky apron that she wore so she could serve her guests at her party without mussing her outfit; the way the camera tilted to indicate how crazy suzy parker was becoming (it was almost sideways at one point); how hope lange kept living at that dumpy flat she shared with the others even though she obviously was making a lot more money than at the beginning of the film (guess it was too scandalous for a single gal to live alone).hope lange was so beautiful; so was suzy parker. and how about mark goddard in a non-speaking role. i fell in love with him when i was a kid watching lost in space.seeing this gem on the big screen prompted me to plan another trek down to the stanford to see the old dark house. incidentally, i bought a small soda and popcorn at the concession stand, and i was taken aback when the worker asked me for two bucks.

this is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. in many ways, it's like a 50s version of valley of the dolls--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of valley polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in the best of everything does have aspirations of broadway).the film begins with hope lange coming into the company for her first day of work. she's assigned to tough-as-nails boss, joan crawford, who is appearing in her first supporting role in decades. despite how nasty crawford seems, lange is determined not to give in--to make it in this job. and, over time, she quickly moves up the ranks from secretary to editor. at the same time, her two new roommates also try to move up the ranks--one through the stage and one through a relationship with a rich playboy. like valley of the dolls, all of them have their ups and downs (mostly downs) but by the end of the film there is some hope that at least some of them will make it--battered and bruised, nevertheless.in this film, men are mostly pigs. the only guy who seems decent is played by stephen boyd, so naturally hope lange neglects him for a ne'er do well ex-boyfriend. as for the guys played by veteran character actor brian ahern and the rest, they are sexist scum and eventually you understand how crawford became so bitter and nasty.this film has it all--adultery, premarital sex, abortion, etc. and is certainly not an artistic triumph. however, thanks to excellent production values and a juicy script, this one is a joy to watch. just don't expect shakespeare!!

caroline bender (hope lange) is just killing time getting a job. her real ambition is to marry eddie and have a baby. april (diane baker) is too innocent to stay that way for long and falls in love too easily, a dangerous combo. greg (suzy parker) is a go-getter and wants to be an actress. all three are doomed for dramatics in 'the best of everything', a 1959 soap opera/morality play/sometimes solid movie that is aging by the second.set in the cut-throat world of paperback publishing, its not as trashy as "valley of the dolls" but not as vanilla as "three coins in the fountain."the men in the mix - brian aherne, stephen boyd, louis jourdan and robert evans - are slick, well-dressed and no good, for the most part. aherne is the resident sexual offender - will pinch anything walking by, and makes unwanted advances right and left. his character is offensive as hell, but its not played seriously at all. harassment hadn't been discovered yet, i guess. boyd works there, too, although you never see him actually doing anything. he's too busy being older, wiser and drunker. evans is abroad just so diane baker can suffer in style - he's a rich kid who's gotten her in 'trouble' so instead of marrying her, as promised, he's taking her to get an 'operation.' jourdan is a director who mistakenly has an affair with parker. they share a fight scene which is fairly no-holds barred, in a movie like this anyway, but the scene is ultimately ruined by parker's histronics. she ends up nearly stalking him, and she really didn't deserve such a lousy fate, her bad acting notwithstanding.joan crawford breathes fire as amanda farrow, the resident 'witch' who is automatically rude and dismissive of any of her legion of secretaries. well they are younger, aren't they? isn't that sufficient reason to hate a person? caroline doesn't think so, as she admirably stands up to miss farrow every chance she gets. crawford only gets to let loose once, when she tells her married boyfriend 'you can your rabbit-faced wife can both go to hell' and slams down the phone. you never get to see the poor soul who dare crosses her. martha hyer's 'storyline', as it were, is extremely weak, and she is painfully over-the-top as an unmarried mother. short of wearing a huge "w" (for 'whore') on her cardigan, she walks around like a pathetic mess for most of her screen time. even worse, she is not given the courtesy of having it all 'tied up', one way or the other, at the end. it won't matter that much, but still..its painfully obvious this all took place in a totally different world. people were nicer to one another for the most part and work was not a drag but something exciting, for a girl from outside nyc anyway.one unconvincing drunk scene aside, hope lange helps it seem reasonably real as caroline, who at least has more than one side to her character. i admire that women are seen having an opinion, a chance and a choice. not that its not wrapped in a nice bow, but it makes some points for equality. in 1959 that was probably noteworthy and possibly controversial. 7/10.

i finally snagged a copy of kannathil muthamittal through netflix and spent new yera's eve watching an amazing drama unfold. it began with shyama (a winsome nandita das) getting married to dhileepan in the backwaters of sri lanka and then a war takes over their romance. shyama has to flee to india and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child. several years later we see amudha, a playful well-loved child (p. s. keerthana), who is the darling (or burden) of teachers, parents and fellow schoolmates alike, in a very how to solve a problem like maria sequence. on her birthday she is told by her parents thiru (madhavan) and indra (simran) that she is not their biological child, she was adopted. this tilts her confident love-filled world and she constantly dwells on why her birth mother left her. several attempts at truancy later the adoptive parents take her to sri lanka to try to find her birth mother. the country is torn asunder by a raging civil war and the trio are inevitably caught up in the mess. but this also leads to their meeting the new shyama - one who finally is confronted by amudha and asked why she abandoned her daughter.the story of a child who has to grapple with the fact that she was abandoned at birth, her obsessive drive to reconnect with her birth mother, the unconditional love of the adoptive parents, the demons that drive the birth mother, the normalcy of chennai and the horrors of terrorism ravaged sri lanka - mani ratnam made a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring. ar rahman's music beautifully complements the magical and the poignant moments in the film. the film has excellent performances from madhavan, nandita das, simran and an absolute stunner role as amudha - the abandoned one - done by the child artiste p. s. keerthana. this performance won her a national award.the cinematography is visual poetry - each frame is beautifully crafted and breathtakingly shot. i am intrigued by the connection mani ratnam has with terrorism, love and obsessions. i think his exploration of these subjects is absolutely outstanding. mahadevan's character was quite unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish, rather was well matched with how much he cared for the little girl. his one liners were hilarious. the mother played by simran was also quite multi-dimensional - she was idealistic, loved the adopted daughter but also worried about her biological kids. the shock, angst, and obsession of the child amudha was outstandingly portrayed by p. s. keerthana. her wide accusing eyes did most of the talking. in fact the enigmatic characters were those of nandita das, and her husband. perhaps mani deliberately made them mysterious so as to not give us overt ideas of why they were the way they were - the enigma of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes. it also kept him from being judgmental - this was another conflict in which he took no sides but merely reported while showing the human tragedy.kannathil muthamittal is visual poetry and a soul stirring drama - i rarely weep in the movies, but this one left me moist eyed and a little heartsick. this is a beautiful film - a treasure and a keeper if you can find a copy; beg borrow or steal one today and watch the film!

the director of kannathil muthamittal directed the first indian film i had seen "dil se" which led me down the path of buying well over 122 hindi dvds in thecourse of four months. i can say i understood the total attraction, i wassomehow confused as to why the film would stop for "music videos". it was an excellent movie, i didn't know what to make of the dancing and the femalevocals were a bit shrill for my western ears, but somehow i found ar rahmen's score hypnotic. i bought the soundtrack the following day and then lagan, kuch kuch hota hai and k3g the following week and with the exception of "ichi thekiller" a few other korean films , i can't be bothered to watch much else. kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict diet of hong kong, horrorand action/science fiction films for the past 30 years.but i should get back to kannathil muthamittal, it is one of the mani ratman's latest efforts and i laughed, cried, got totally mad, terrified and most of all i didn't feel manipulated. the acting was superb, the photography was beautiful, i think you could stop the movie at any given time and would notice that any give frame would be worthy of painting. the music fit the movie perfectly and after thecredits rolled, i wanted to watch again... so i did.it would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you may miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters develop. this is what great film is all about! i stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over!my wife is watching now, and i can't wait for her reaction, i can't expect it will be anything less than mine.

this movie was astonishing how good it was! the plot is extraordinary, and the acting spectacular. at first i thought this wasn't going to be that great because of a summary, but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie, it struck me that i was dead wrong. i literally cried about four or five times in this movie, and despite this, i must've watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week! no, the song scenes were not as awesome as they could've been, but the plot is what really gets you. american or asain, i would recommend this to anyone--and i have now. i guarantee that after seeing this one, you'll get the best out of it, and its plot. i hope you feel the same, and write a rave review too!

of all the seasons and episodes of the twilight zone, after seeing all the great, mind boggling, thought provoking stories, this one stands on top. that's right. this story, this one entitled the hunt tops the large number of the finest scripts in television history.true, there are no interplanetary space flights, no inexplicable cracks in time. there is no living nightmare, no sudden changes of setting. there is seemingly nothing out of the ordinary for our protagonist to deal with.the main character, played by veteran character actor arthur hunnicut, sets out from his cabin in the hills, accompanied by his faithful hound, to hunt raccoon. because the raccoon is a predominantly nocturnal animal hunt is by moonlight.the man and dog soon encounter a large raccoon, who hops on the dog's back and attempts to drown the hound in a pond. the man jumps in to help his dog. there is a sort of almost black-out, after which the pair are seen on the shore, in a lying, almost sleep like position.calling his dog by name, (rip, i think) the old man sets off to return home. when he arrives, he finds the wife weeping and unresponsive to his conversation. he also observes visitors coming and going to his house, paying respects and giving words to console his wife.still seeming puzzled at the strange reception and goings on around the home cabin, the man and rip take off on a long walk down the road, where he remarks out loud that he did not remember such a long fence in these parts. he eventually comes upon a rather large fellow, dressed in garb similar to his-overalls, hat, work shirt. they are at a gate, which leads to an area where a lot of smoke is freely rising up. the gate keeper is overly eager in his persuasive pitch in trying to get the man to enter. rip sounds displeasure. the gate man tells the old man that he may enter, but the dog would have to remain outside, offering to watch the animal for him. the man will have none of it and the two continue on their way down the path.after a little more hiking they come upon a second gated entrance where the gate keeper recognizes the man and welcomes him. when the old man reports what has happened down the road, telling him of how the guy at the other gate tried to separate the man and dog, and added, "with no dogs allowed, that must be a hell of a place!" the 2nd gate keeper stated that he was right! "that's exactly what it is!" our family had lost our 1st dog, lady-a mixed lab, in october of 1981. about 6 months later, as good fortune would have it, the wife(deanna) and myself along with our 2 daughters (jennifer 9 and michelle 6) viewed this episode on tv, wgn tv, channel 9 chicago. well, it all made perfect sense to us at that time.we're certain that anyone who has had that relationship with a family dog, would agree. the episode still brings a condition of watery eyes to this now 60 year old writer.

a warmly sentimental tale from the author of the waltons. were someone to pitch the material to me, i would probably reject it as too maudlin. but the dramatization here manages a tear without the expected embarrassment. no one in the 1950's was better at lovable hayseeds than arthur hunnicutt. his appeal here is put to consummate use as a mountain man doggedly faithful to a loyal hunting hound. their fates are tied together as inseparably as any human bond. good. i see a subtle environmental message here. all critters go to heaven, because how can we condemn any poor devil that merely follows instinct in order to stay alive. there is no deceit in the kingdom of animals, and yet how cruelly we often treat them. an oddly satisfying episode that confirms this important message.

red dust is both well acted and well made but what the movie is about i think will bore many viewers as it did to me. there was a film that was out earlier called "in my country" with sam jackson and it was not that well received and both films were about nearly the same exact thing, i do think red dust was better because of the more interesting performances especially by future oscar winner chiwton ejofor but the plot is just to lacking, it starts off pretty strong but then the film hits the viewers with countless un-interesting court room sessions, this could have been a great film if the writing was not so lacking. but see if for the performances.

we saw this film in toronto at the film festival last year. it was a truly moving experience. i had heard of the truth and reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. this film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. archbishop tutu and the others involved in developing the t & r process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions. seeing this film gave me hope for the human race. if we can do t & r, we just might not destroy ourselves. people will look back at t and r as the first step out of human adolescence and toward maturity.as a film, of course there were flaws. i did not notice any major problems in acting, directing, or writing - but for the first time in years i was totally lost in a film, so perhaps i did not notice.see this film. the audience in toronto would not give up the stage for the next film, we had so many questions and comments for the stars and director. tom hooper, jamie bartlett, and chiwetel ejiofor went outside to the sidewalk to continue the conversation. people came by just to shake their hands and thank them for the film. it moved us all.

police officer dirk hendricks (jamie bartlett) files an amnesty application alex mpondo (chiwetel ejiofor).a member of the south african parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist.south african born attorney sarah barcant (hilary swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent mpondo.as well as steve sizela, mpondo's friend who was arrested along with him, and never heard from again.this film is one of the best films to come out about the south african regime of aparthied, in the past.everybody should watch it.

...and normally i don't like surprises!! watch this movie by chance in a motel in south africa second week of a three month motorbiking holiday in za. apart from being well shot and acted it helped me in understanding the countries problems tremendously. just watched the " million dollar baby" and had to look up hillary swank since the name sounded somewhat familiar and her acting was superb. didn't realise she was the solicitor in the "red dust". well now i'm not to worried that she will disappear as so many other sidekicks of clint before... now i am being asked to write ten whole lines of comment which is rather ridiculous for i have written what i wanted to write. ok, here it goes: i think if you are from a western country, especially europe, watching will help you to understand a little better why what is happening is happening down there! so this hopefully will fill ten lines.

where this movies differs from traditional hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. in europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or with each other at the end of the conflict. in the us, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the us citizen never had to live with its enemy. this explains in my view the often simplistic nature of hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife. but in this movie, the director and screenplay did not fall into this cliché. it turns out everyone in the story has some right and some wrong. it's a great story of morality, hidden truth and compromise.

what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.

possible spoilersno one is likely to pick up a dvd of red dust without knowing that it is about south africa's truth and reconciliation commission. hilary swank stars as a south african exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing alex mpondo (chiwetel ejiofer), a member of the south african parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, pete muller (ian roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the truth and reconciliation commission. they could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a south african accent; ms. swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably american accent. nevertheless she is the only well-known actor in the movie, and it would probably not have been made without her or someone equally well known. she does a passable job. however, ejiofer and muller (pronounced in the german way with an umlat over the "u") are outstanding as is jamie barlett as the chief of police, responsible for murdering mpondo's comrade and fellow prisoner. the torture scenes are shown in brief flashes but they are vivid and believable. what is not believable is the truth and reconciliation process -- except that it actually happened. "red dust" should be seen for that reason alone because it was and is unbelievable that the anc prisoners could actually forgive the torturers, and this is as close as we are likely to get to seeing the process in action.

i haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that i couldn't take my eyes off the screen. i was busting for the loo; and i didn't even want to pause it because i was drawn right in. emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. it gives you an amazing insight to south africa; their struggles and their lives. the acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; i was captivated. i don't want to even try and explain the story; it's way too complex and i wouldn't do it justice. please see this; you'll understand why when you do. cheers, hol

i was unsure of this movie before renting and did so on the assurance that hilary swank has always given excellent performances in her movies. she seems to rely on restraint to gain the emotional impact that she does. and she didn't prove me wrong in this movie.however the movie also had fantastic performances from all other members of the cast both speaking and non-speaking. i have to single out jamie bartlett and chiwetel ejiofor - the two main protagonists - for their outstanding acting abilities and portrayal of true human feelings and failings. the whole movie ran almost like a documentary.i must applaud tom hooper as the director and avril beukes as the editor for keeping a multiple layered story being revealed smoothly whilst keeping dialogue and action moving along in an understandable fashion. the opening sequence of the south african landscape was striking and i had to push the pause button to savour the photography.why can't a movie like this ever get nominated for an international award. it seems to me to hit the high-rating button on all counts. it was not just a film it was a true experience of life in a country coming out of apartheid. a life of poverty was all around but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit.

not knowing a great deal about the truth and reconciliation commission, i can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. i started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from bbc2 earlier this year) but once i'd started i had to watch to the end.the down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. like a good novel, i couldn't put it down. all the way through, i wished i was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice. what happened to its release in theatres? i'm an admirer of chiwetel ejiofor since i saw him in dirty pretty things, and hilary swank looks terrific in this - very female and sexy for a change (possibly out of place, but she adds to the visual attractiveness of the film).this picture deserves a wider audience than it seems to be getting.

i saw this film at the 2005 palm springs international film festival. i went in with the assumption that if it stars chiwetel ejiofor and hilary swank it had to be at least decent. well, after a kind of a slow start, i was far from disappointed. in fact, i was quite pleased with the final product.i must admit the afrikaaner and xhosa(?) accented english of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing "waking ned devine", "trainspotting" or any other film with heavy-accented actors i adjusted after about 15 minutes. and i was trying to figure out why hilary swank was supposed to be south african and sounded like she was trying to put on an accent but sounded very american... as if she was making a weak attempt at putting on the accent. but later in the film as more is revealed about her character and how she moved to the us as a teen you begin to understand how she might have lost some or most of her accent. so it began to make sense that only certain words might have a afrikaaner lilt to them.i know it's a little weak for one to use film as education but one of the great things about this film is that it was interesting to see a dramatization of a truth and reconciliation trial. i'd heard about the t and r process in south africa after the fall of apartheid but i didn't really know how it worked.the final verdict is that although some of the scenes felt a little contrived, this was overall a very strong film. the closing sequence where the "truth" comes out was the strong finish every film hopes for. a definite must see for anyone who cares about what happens outside their borders.

the truth and reconciliation process in south africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa. i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process. almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. we all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. what's happening in south africa should guide us all. i found it credible, moving and at times upsetting. there were no outstanding acting performances but this added to the strength of the narrative. once again the bbc has been instrumental in taking a complex topic and turning out a top class movie.

archbishop desmond tutu, who is seldom a favorite of mine, said that everyone should see this film as it is something that can help heal the world....it is one of the most poignant movies i have seen and delivers on tutu's comments.... i have read many comments and while they range from good to average to comments on the choice of actors... the fact is that it deals with one of the most extra-ordinary events in our world. the truth and reconciliation commission.... for the first time a country has opted to air it's horrific history, to find a way forward and to create a way for people to heal...while the movie starts out with the white policeman being offered a chance to absolve himself for brutal crimes and the black guy is trying to ensure that he does not get away with it, it delves into the humanity of the people and the enormous need for healing that we all need....definitely a thumbs up..... to everyone involved.... once again, i am proud to be a south african.....an interesting comment can be found here: http://www.biz-community.com/article/196/97/5223.html

an interesting comedy, taking place on a train from stockholm to berlin, december 1945. one can't help to feel sorry for the poor writer/critic who quits his job and jumps on the train to berlin. his ambition is to make a difference, and to participate in building the new unified europe after the war has ended.i like the black and white format of the movie, as well as the closed scenery of a train in motion.robert gustafsson makes a classic "gustafsson-role" in this movie. if you're a fan of him, this movie is for you!the philosopher wittgenstein, through his saying "one can never assume that anything is what it seems to be", is referenced several times in the movie.

...and this movie easily exceeded my expectations. the fact that it is written and directed by peter dalle led me to believe it was in style with other films i'm used to (and bored with) seeing him in. anyway, i grudgingly went along to see this flick and that i'm glad for. this stuff has humour and depth. 9 out of 10. see it!

this solid black and white slapstick comedy with a dark (but hopelessly contrived) plot is a true crowd pleaser that will have you howling with laughter (as well as rolling your eyes with disbelief).it's the old psychopath on a train story but that is of no big importance as the thriller portion of the film almost seems to be merely a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian robert gustafsson. his hapless, nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a fashion that almost rivals chevy chase.the thing about the film that appealed to me the most, however, is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday joys and nuisances of train travel. they add a most welcome sense of realism and recognition.this thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its "suspense" from hitchcock and should, in my opinion, only be watched for its comedy value (which is high indeed). besides gustafsson, lars amble's solid performance as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission alone.heartily recommend.

in an early scene, luca (david pasquesi) and james (jeff garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in french on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting james to remark, "there's nothing hotter than an angry french woman." a few blocks later, they pass an old filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and luca remarks, for referential effect, "there's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly filipino woman."the humor in jeff garlin's i want someone to eat cheese with is best characterized by the word quotidian. the film is a conversation. we might as well be eavesdropping. rather than go for antics, the film relies on character flaws and human curiosity to deliver laughs. while it's not innovative, it is far from banal, and even if james views himself as being rather jejune, we know that he is fairly average, and this endears him.self-betterment is the primary theme of the movie. sarah silverman, who plays beth, is excellent as the catalyst of change; she revitalizes james, and so reminds him to live a better life. even so, achieving some idyllic dream is not the end of these characters, but rather something simpler: that they might pick up what pieces there are of the life they love, just to keep for themselves at least enough to carry on.a movie about life lessons can be overwrought, as it can forget to connect with its audience. i want someone to eat cheese with is subtle and winsome, and while its moral may not be inspiring, it is still resonant. this is low-key comedy, but it will stick with you.

james aaron, a chubby actor living in chicago, is a man that loves to eat things that are no good for him. that is made clear early on, as dick, a friendly store clerk, advises him to stay away from junk food. aaron, an actor working at chicago's second city, is a loving man with not much luck in the love department. he still lives with his mother, a spunky lady who encourages him to go out and enjoy himself. james has another job in a sort of gross "candid camera" where people are set up for unusual situations, such as surprising a mechanic and telling him he is the father of a daughter he never knew about.on the day he meets his friend larry he gets to know about the casting call for the remake of "marty", his favorite film. being a large man, he clearly identifies with the character in the movie. in many ways, james' own life parallels that of the paddy chayefsky's creation in the picture. he wants to try for the part because he knows he can do justice to the role.one day he meets beth at a soda fountain. james takes a liking to the woman, who one day invites him to go shopping with her for intimate apparel. he ends up having sex with her, thinking they have a nice thing going, but beth has a another surprise coming when she tells him the reason they went to bed was because she had never done it with a fat man. after being disappointed, james stumbles into an attractive elementary school teacher who seems to share his love for jazz. at the end, we watch james fulfilling his long dream of starring in a theatrical production of "marty" in a nursing home.jeff garlin, who is an affable character man, shows a talent for the type of comedy associated with his friend larry david. although both men differ in acting styles, his take on james aaron is right on the money. as a director, he has done it before, although this is an original concept that he should pursue. one of the assets of the film are the people involved in the project. sarah silverman makes an impression for her take of beth. bonnie hunt underplays her role of the school teacher to good results. mina kolb, is seen as his mother, a role she has played in "curb your enthusiasm" with excellent results. director paul mazursky is at hand also in a minor role. joey slotnick, tim kazurinsky, richard kind, david pasquesi, larry neumann jr, gina gershon, and the rest of the cast make valuable contributions.jeff garlin is a talented man whose next effort will be welcomed by his fans.

jeff garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter. as in curb your enthusiasm, his screen persona is hilarious; but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. while the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, performing success, and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. the supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways. the simple joys of food, friendship, and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes. the use of music is creative and adds to the many pleasures of this film. any fan of jeff garlin's tv appearances must see it!

has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating tv networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? is that a good thing? this film does not answer the latter question either way, but it does appear that without curb, jeff garlin would not have been able to make i want someone to eat cheese with. like most new producers/directors, jeff garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (curb). and yet, is it a sensitive guy film? he isn't really a sensitive guy. likable, sure. relatable, indeed. what this film really is about is a bit hard to say, i can only relate what i took away from it. i rented the film because of the trailers, particularly the scene of a counselor portrayed by amy sedaris informing james aaron (garlin) that a particular woman is interested in him mainly because she is a "chubby chaser." i just about fell out of my seat. based on that scene alone, i ran to my computer to write a note to myself to rent this movie. the reason - i thought the school counselor (sedaris) was talking about beth, portrayed by sarah silverman. i imagined a lightish romantic comedy between the foxy silverman and the fat garlin. i didn't think the story would be anything original, but that the dialogue would be snappy and the scenes would move along at a satisfying pace. in short, i thought it would be a comedy. it was intriguing that the film started out that way but then took a much much more realistic turn when beth gives james the heave ho because "i've never really been with a fat guy before." that is how brutally we live life, and it was completely realistic. i applaud the decision. it just meant that beth has now left the building and with her, the one snappy person in the film.james's relationship with his mother was also interesting. that part made me wonder if the whole concept did not start out as a play. it had that intricate feel to it. (the whole "marty" movie within a movie thing was utterly lost on me, as i have never seen that film.)there were serious doubts i had about the character of james aaron, though. is it really possible that at 39 he had not had a serious relationship? and he is an actor? that did not really square with me. to me, his persona was less actor-y, and more corporate. i could not really buy his ordinariness either. no doubt he was extremely disappointed that things with beth did not work out. we felt that. but then, did he really care? another thing - how in the world can both he and his mother afford to move out at the same time? hasn't he just lost his job? the last one he had? that was one reason he did not seem ordinary to me. where's the funding for his life coming from? and yet, i have read reviews that talk about the realistic portrayal of urban loneliness, so there is that. yes, it is very realistic, the way we must be satisfied with what we have because it is all that we have. the way we sort of disappear from ourselves and each other in interactions (james and stella), some kind of self-effacement that takes place just to move on to the next moment. that, contrasted with the possibility of defining ourselves through our moments, our thoughts the way james had with beth, it's really crushing.very well done.

garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (garlin) wandering around chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. the laughs keep coming almost every minute. it's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedic writing and acting. the supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.rose abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. sara silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with jeff. bonnie hunt is classically great in her role. i only wish there was more of her in the film, as i think most will agree. it's certainly refreshing to see her in a tight leather outfit.david pasquesi was the aloof detached sidekick, and voice of reason. mina kolb plays jeff's mother who he lives with. there were numerous other cameos, all of them done very well.at the premier jeff mentioned his inability to do more with bonnie due to production issues. still, it's good to leave you wanting more. i think it's that indie thing of keeping some things ambiguous to let the audience do some thinking for themselves to fill in the blanks. the wordy title should clue you in to this.jeff said some of the basic characters were based on his past relationships. this explains why they work so well. real life people are always unusually colorful and makes great characters. he departs quite a bit from what you might expect, having seen curb your enthusiasm and some of his other work. it's one of those break out things where an actor takes some risks to do something they maybe always wanted to do but couldn't.i think it's noteworthy that garlin's improv second city background, and hunt's for that matter, set the style here of acting being the focus of the story and the directing. it's perhaps a new innovative hybrid of improv meets indie film-making.

garlin is unquestionably a comedian's comedian and a comedian to anyone looking for a good time. his first film, which is entirely his own creation and production, tells the story of a struggling chicago actor james aaron with whom jeff obviously identifies. he wonderfully juxtaposes james to paddy chayefsky's "marty" and to jackie gleason's poor soul as he exposes james' dilemmas with an array of actors that in real life are jeff's friends, many who are fellow second city alumni.he delightfully uses sarah silverman's diametrical cuteness and scathingly absurd humor to exemplify how despite common sense and talent, life's contentment can too often belie unyielding frustration. bonnie hunt gives an endearing performance as a romantic interest.don't let a simple story mislead you, the characters and conflicts are well thought out and ring true. those that follow garlin's career and understand that his humor is based on telling reality humorously, not necessarily creating fiction which too easily can be contrived, will appreciate his dialogue driven story.we surely will see garlin working much more as director and writer with other talented intelligent comedic actors who undertake the great challenge of making life funny.

my original title for this review was going to be, "ending disappoints, film triumphs." but i actually thought about this one on the way home. it is not the fairy tale most of these films are, it takes turns that are different and while its ending is at first disappointing, it slowly sinks in and hits the core on a satisfying tone.the plot follows a man named james aaron(curb your enthusiasm's jeff garlin, who also wrote and directed) a struggling actor who lives in chicago with his mother and deals with both his obesity and his inability to find someone to love.yes, it sounds corny, but it experiments with elements that make it somewhat unpredictable, and actually makes you wish it were longer. the ending came kind of abruptly and had me saying, "that's it!?" but once it starts to take it's toll, it really makes you smile.it does have many tones of seriousness throughout, but fear not, for it is also very funny. some scenes offer huge laughs, and those who have seen jeff garlin's stand-up will recognize a couple (primarily when he gives a speech at career day for his niece's kindergarten class and bombs). it begins on somewhat of a serious note that you do not expect, but what follows is very funny, entertaining, and quite poignant as well. it is the kind of movie that you keep watching and always enjoy. and as i said before, while the ending may seem absurd at first, once you take time to think about, it is a true joy.

any movie that offers bonnie hunt, sarah silverman and amy sedaris in the supporting cast has to be well worth watching, and comic actor jeff garlin takes advantage of the terrific talent he recruited for his 2007 directorial debut, a sad-sack comedy about an overweight man who feels out of step with the world around him. familiar as larry david's manager jeff on "curb your enthusiasm", garlin plays james, a still-struggling, 39-year old chicago actor who still lives with his widowed mother. his self-esteem is so low that he can't meet women, but it's the comical way he views his single status that makes his dilemma involving. if the storyline sounds a bit familiar, that's because the film is partially a tribute to the 1955 ernest borgnine classic, "marty", about a lonely bronx butcher living with his meddlesome mother. in fact, garlin uses "marty" as the play which james is desperate to do since he is so empathetic to the character's situation.naturally there is a love story of sorts in this new millennium version, and silverman plays beth, an off-kilter, sexually voracious ice cream parlor server who takes him on an underwear shopping spree. their best scene together is in his favorite convenience store where they improvise different characters in different aisles. hunt plays a lonely elementary school teacher who shares a passion with james for jazz musician ben webster. they meet accidentally in a record store and then again at a career day at her school where he hilariously exposes his sexual neuroses in front of a classroom of first-graders, including his best friend luca's pert daughter penelope (played by dakota fanning's look-alike baby sister elle). in a wedged-in cameo and looking quite a bit like jerri blank, sedaris plays the school's counselor who speaks to james after his inappropriate monologue. david pasquesi plays luca, a retirement home manager, and his scenes with garlin have an easy rapport that makes their friendship easy to believe. almost stealing the movie is character actress mina kolb, who plays james' pixilated mother with pluck and heart.there are also unexpected cameos from teen idol aaron carter and gina gershon (don't askbut the set-up is funny), as well as sharply played bits by director paul mazursky (as the snaky director of a candid-camera-type show, "smear job"), tim kazurinsky (as the unsuspecting victim of that show) and dan castellaneta (as the tough-love convenience store owner). with his rueful bouts of insecurity and self-loathing, garlin's comic sensibilities resemble those of albert brooks, and the casual dialogue at its best reminds me of "modern romance" and "defending your life". the one persistent problem i had with the film is pacing as some scenes dragged out longer than necessary. the problem is more evident in the first half when garlin is trying to establish the right tempo, and the lack of real conflict adds to the sluggishness. regardless, what he does well is capture that gnawing sense of desperation one feels upon the revelation that life is not what it is supposed to be, that a significant other may be out of reach, and that a steady diet of junk food eaten on a car hood is the only sure thing when it comes to gratification.

garlin did a great job. nice concept well executed, and tightly produced. came across as a very sincere story. as a fan of "curb your enthusiasm", where jeff was pretty much the straight guy role, i was delighted with how much depth he brought to this role in a simple yet effective portrayal.much of the humor was understated and subtle and drew on poignancy, which i really liked, rather than being slapstick or over-explained. and there were some nice little surprises and twists. the convenience store vignettes were a delight.when i say it is a wonderful "small" film, i don't mean budget or quality. it is simple, intimate and hand-crafted. it tells a highly believable everyday story. relax and go see it. let it wash over you, and you will feel good for having done so.

turner and friends are closing in on hbo for the top spot among made-for-tv movie producers. this is a nicely paced, contemplative thriller of sorts. william macy is stellar, as always, and adam arkin offers one of his better performances. a bit more lively than classic hitchcock but not as in-your-face as typical movies of its type, a slight case of murder eases you in and never lets go. (note: i saw a preview copy, which means i didn't have to wait through commercials. those interruptions may hurt the pacing, but you know this will be available on video sometime

i saw this last night at a screening for a marketing company. it is fargoesque, and was a lot of fun to watch. it held my attention all the way through and did not seem to lag at all. i'd recommend watching it when it airs!

not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. bill macy shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good. great supporting cast, especially jamie cromwell as the extortionist private eye.the movie's greatest strength is the work of macy, who reminds us of his jerry lundergaard role from fargo. he has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulating and deceitful character. it's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel, and for a while i was happy that things were turning out well for him. *** out of four.

this one was a surprise and better than most films i've seen recently. highly enjoyable from start to finish, this is a film that will surely satisfy 99,9% of movie fans worldwide. great acting from everyone, great script, great story and fantastic plot and twists. try not to miss it!

i can not say this movie was a hilarious, but i must have had a grin on my face the entire time. i like this darker kind of comedy; "very bad things", "8 heads in a duffel bag" or "coldblooded"the way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. to me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be, but the way that ending came about was. another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience. the way terry looks at us is hilarious, you can almost pretend you're his accomplice.

william h. macy always gives a good performance. he never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else. in short, he's what more actors should be like. "a slight case of murder" is directed by steven schachter, who went on to do two more great films with macy (door to door, the wool cap).television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting, poor cinematography, and sub-par scripting. that's why it's so refreshing to see a tv movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for. to tell a small story (not a simplistic story) that does not require viewing on the big screen."a slight case of murder" is light, entertaining fare, and an great watch.7.6 out of 10

just as in "columbo" we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. what follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. the investigating officer, adam arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike "columbo". it is william h. macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his "perfect crime". william h. macy fans will enjoy "a slight case of murder", as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities. add some well timed comedy, and this is very similar to a fine episode of "columbo". highly recommended. - merk

"a slight case of murder" is an excellent tv movie, which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. william h. macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress, and then has to try to conceal the crime. although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite light hearted and funny, with many memorable lines ("acting is harder than i thought- you ever see body heat? i think i owe bill hurt an apology" and my personal favourite "for next week answer these two questions about film noir, what do these people do during the day? and why is it always raining?). the film has a great supporting cast including macy's real life wife felcity huffman, james cromwell and adam arkin. a must see for macy fans!

william h. macy is terrific in this alfred hitchcock-esque film. macy stars as a film critic who accidentally kills one of his girlfriends. the characters that ensue are hilarious. james cromwell gives a terrific performance as a blackmailing private detective. as always, macy is incredibly funny and gives a phenomenal performance. see this movie whenever it is on t.v. and check your video stores because this is one you don't want to miss.

william h. macy is brilliant as everyman caught in a desperate situation. starts off with a bang and never lets up. twists and surprises are fresh, unpredictable. use of film noir clips and frequent quotes and references to 30's and 40's flicks makes this a delightful "must" for movie buffs.

this was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. i'm a big fan of william h. macy, and he puts in a wonderful performance. his great likeability, coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. i found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him (and by extension myself, as his confidante and silent witness). it took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended, i was so wrapped up in it. good performances all around, too, not just with macy. arkin was quite good, as was cromwell (he was surprisingly fierce). in short, i highly recommend this film to any fans of macy and/or the murder mystery. but you may want to prepare to feel a little guilty.

co-scripted by william h. macy from, arguably, donald e. westlake's best and hardest to find novel, "a travesty". *very* faithful to the story, the movie stars macy as a hapless man who gets in way too far over his head after attempting to cover up an accidental death. costars adam arkin and james cromwell in good supporting roles. the strength of the movie is in the intricate twist-after-twist storyline and in the acting, particularly by macy who routinely and delightfully breaks through the 4th wall here and gets away with it every time. a good storyline with much dark humor, this one engaged me enough that i've watched it three times in the week since it came out. prepare to shelve your critical faculties and emit a loud, bipartisan "wheeeeee!".

after learning that her sister susan is contemplating divorce, kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. when kate arrives, however, susan is nowhere in sight. that's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. as a storm rages outside, kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! in her first post-bewitched vehicle, elizabeth montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance. merwin gerard's teleplay is based on a short story by mcknight malmar. malmar's tale was first brought to television in 1962 as an episode of boris karloff's thriller anthology series. thriller stuck very closely to the story, which is kind of a pity, for it could have used a little punching up. granted malmar wrote a moderately creepy number, but gerard (creator of the one step beyond show) adds several clever ingredients that heighten the tension and suspense.

i first saw the victim (aka out of contention) well over 25 years ago when i was very young. being a passionate fan of bewitched since i was a child, i loved to watch anything that starred elizabeth montgomery. this movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of miss montgomery's work or not. elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in a case of rape and as the suspected murderess in the legend of lizzie borden. her performance in the victim as kate, a terrified woman trapped in an isolated house during a storm, with a killer after her is brilliant. if you like exciting suspenseful thrillers than this is one movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end. another great performance well worth mentioning is that of eileen heckhart who plays the eerie and suspicious housekeeper. unfortunately like most of miss montgomery's movies, the victim is not available on dvd and i believe that although it was released on vhs some years ago, it is a rarity these days. i was lucky to have taped it when it was aired on television some ten years ago and so have a nice copy of this very good movie. a must see!

i remember watching an elizabeth montgomery movie when i was maybe 5 years old (if that) and to this day i can remember this movie (in just bits and pieces). it was the movie i remembered all throughout my life because i was sooo scared. i think i remember the story part of it and the house constantly being dark. the main part that was the most freaky to me was elizabeth walking around the house all dark and then there was someone in the field outside. at the time i thought i was an old witch but the memory of it is now way hazy so i can't really remember who it was but it was someone definitely in a field outside lurking...and that part is what freaked me out the most. i really wish i could see this movie again. if anyone knows how to get a copy please email me at valid908@yahoo.com

i remember watching this movie when it came out as a t.v. movie of the week in the early 1970's.although i haven't seen this movie in over 30 years i remember how creepy it was...the sister's dead body in the basement, the storm raging outside, the creepy house with no electricity and a killer still on the premises.they just don't make t.v. movies like this one anymore. elizabeth montgomery was a very underrated actress and i liked her in not only "betwitched", but several of her post-bewitched roles, such as this one and 1975's "the legend of lizzie borden".i really wish that someone would come out with a dvd that has several of the 1970's t.v. movie of the week on one dvd. wouldn't it be awesome to watch "when michael calls", "bad ronald", "don't be afraid of the dark", "crowhaven farm", etc., all on one dvd? i know there is a market for a dvd like this for all of us baby boomers who grew up in the 1960's and 1970's. maybe, if we are lucky, someday someone will offer us a dvd with a great selection of t.v. movies like this.

i believe that this is one of elizabeth montgomery's best performances in a movie, and i have seen most of her movies.i saw this for the first time on television when i was around fourteen, and i was so scared.i watch this movie every now and then, and i still enjoy it very much.i know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much.that just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so.i love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you. the cast in this movie was top notch. jess walton, who played the sister in the story was very good, even though her part was rather small. she also played in a terrific made for television thriller around the same time called you'll never see me again with david hartman.i got the biggest kick out of eileen heckart's performance as the housekeeper. eileen was so good as a lady with a very bad disposition.george maharis who played the husband was quite effective.this story obviously had a lot of so called mistakes in the plot, but i love the movie anyway. i highly recommend this movie to people who love a good thriller without graphic violence.i gave this movie a vote of seven.

this excellent movie starring elizabeth montgomery is long overdue for release in dvd form. the same can be said for her earlier, also excellent movie, a case of rape. i can only hope that my comments spur some enterprising soul into placing both elizabeth montgomery movies on one dvd to be made available to her many fans. i for one believe this excellent actress's role was unfortunately stereotyped by her role on bewitched and, as a result, more serious acting roles were not made available to her. i am confident that if these two movies, perhaps even a trilogy with the legend of lizzie borden, were released in dvd form, her fans would set the record straight on how highly they regard her serious acting abilities.

i thought this movie was pretty good!ok, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major chad michael murray fan, but because i enjoyed it. i was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends and i really enjoyed it and we were talking about it the whole way home! i would tell my other friends to watch this movie. i'm not saying it's the best movie that's ever hit the box office but it's a lot better than some people are describing it to be. everyone has their own opinions so if you really want to know whether it's good or bad, watch it and then decide.

i've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that paris hilton was in it as well didn't give me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it really scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through. so i say go watch it and decide for yourself and if the fact that its a scary film doesn't convince you to go watch it then it also has chad michael murray in it which can't be bad to watch for a couple of hours eh?

i loved this film!! i have been waiting for this film to come out so i could see it. i saw it opening night and loved it, some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but i thought it was great. the actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. paris hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. the set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made. the two brothers did a great job and the death sense were great. the killers were really scary and made me want to close my eyes and not look at them. i can't wait until this film comes out to video so i can get it and see it over and over again. the over view of my review is go see this film if you like hororr films and you will not be sorry i loved this film. i give this film a 10 out of 10 it rocks!!!

(synopsis) graduating high school senior bartleby "b" gaines (justin long) finds himself without a college to attend. he has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. his mom and dad are very disappointed that bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. his parents think that if bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. several of bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to. to satisfy their parents, bartleby comes up with an idea to start his own college with an internet site. they convert an abandoned psychiatric facility into the south harmon institute of technology. they will be the only students. however, the web site states that we accept anyone. on the first day of school, they unexpectedly have a large number of accepted students that were also rejected by all colleges. with a million dollars in tuition money, bartleby must make his fake college into a functioning one. he hires uncle ben (lewis black) as the college dean. the fun begins when they design their own curriculum, make their own rules, and party all night.(my comment) the premise of starting a college without a teaching staff is a little off the wall. since it was a fake college, bartleby really didn't need a staff. the movie reminded me of the classic movie "animal house", the college setting, the fraternity, lots of gags, and pretty young women. these new college freshmen had a different notion of what the college experience was all about. the movie not only has lots of humor, it also has a good message for life. people should reach for their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not settle for what other people want them to do. the ending was a little unrealistic, but it is only a movie. the movie was made for the young crowd to have a little fun. (universal pictures, run time 1:32, rated pg-13) (7/10)

the best thing from the american pie "bakery." i found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the american pie movies to date. .also concerning the appropriateness of the content i found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous american pie movies. i thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. when the movie first came out i read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...i now regret that decision. the movie far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot, dialog/scripting, and overall quality. i give it two thumbs way up!

i saw the trailer and read some reviews, and i had low expectations for this movie. i was pleasantly surprised. while the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. the writing and jokes are far more literate than i have come to expect. better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.the main reasons i wanted to see this movie were justin long and lewis black. long is from "ed" and the new apple computer ads. he was just coming into his own as an actor in "ed," and he was excellent here. he's a natural in front of the camera. lewis black is a social commentator who pulls no punches. he's on "the daily show" on comedy central about once every two weeks, but he really shines in hbo's "red, white, and screwed." i regularly catch him on xm radio's uncensored comedy channel. give black an idea and let him improvise. whether his rants and lines here are scripted or improvised are no matter. he's priceless delivering his thoughts on middle class angst. one thing about black's delivery, his hand gestures are not those of a comedian. it just seems like he's having a conversation with you, and i think that makes him unconsciously more effective.

contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an "against the system" type of movie and attitude. it is an excellent portrayal of the "system" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. the funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. and that is to learn what you enjoy. that is what college should be about..i come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines. i think i have given my opinion on the matter. so i now write a couple more lines just as filler. i hope you have been entertained during this time. i encourage you to go see the movie. it is well worth your while so long as you follow it and immerse yourself in the movie.

a great movie. the movie was even better then the commercials put on. and believe it or not it was very very inspirational. i really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.it was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up. i laughed. i laughed very hard on some parts. the acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. i can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being clerks ii). so after all of that i give it a 7/10 (a high seven, but not quite an eight).

i for one was very anxious to watch this movie.though i knew it was going to be another type of movie in the style of revenge of the nerds, i was still impressed.there is plenty of truth to the fact of this type of learning and believe very strongly that it should be allowed in a "new style of schooling".conventional teaching methods do not always teach students what they need to know or should know or want to know.this approach to teaching should be further sought out in true academic courses.while there still was too much of the partying scenes, it obviously had to be thrown in there - for hollywood's sake of making a comedy about college...even though we all know that life isn't really like that by any means.a touch unbelievable, still funny and with a killer ending.awesome ending. crucial to the entire story and very surprising.without the final scene, the movie would have been half as good.i liked this movie and it didn't have to have overly amounts of swearing or nudity or gross out jokes for it to be good.great crew and cast, story and even the generic typecasting of the obligatory "hampton frat members" was well done.american pie 1, 2 3 and american wedding or whatever clones it makes doers not measure up to this by 1/3.far better than most comedies about first year college with no demeaning stupid jokes to make somebody throw up with.i liked it, even though it was simple...it was interesting and even had heart...my only regret for watching this movie is that it wasn't longer.

this is what movies should aspire to. funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. i've been seeing justin long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, i figured with the right role he could break out. (mac commercials not withstanding.) this film just might put him on a fast track to the a list. the rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message. (but you don't need to buy the message to have a good time.) lewis black is, as usual, hilarious, and blake lively is a fresh faced beauty. take a couple hours and see this film, they will not have been wasted.

i had the pleasure of witnessing this brilliant film at a preview screening in sydney. although it was a pleasure to see it. pleasure is not the emotion you are left with as the credits roll.2:37 is a film that tackles not just one stigma felt by young individuals but all of them. chief of which is isolation. it is not just to place the films final galvanising scene on a pedestal above the others, but rather it is important to see it as the culmination. and from that, it is important to realise what it represents to both you as the viewer and to the people directly effected by it.2:37 is not a soft picture but the manner in which mr thalluri handles it's subject matter with a profound dignity and it's no holds barred approach acts as credit to it's message.i do not believe films such as 2:37 should be scaled by votes of favour. rather it should be recommended to those looking for purpose in their viewing.a brilliantly crafted portrait of innocence lost. and a master stroke for a as of yet untaped talent.not to be missed.

2:37 succeeds admirably at showing us what australian teenagers feel and don't say. these are the stories of real kids and i think we would be naive to think otherwise. the only new thing 2:37 really brings us is an australian point of view. we often watch troubled american children but often fail to link the same problems to our own teens. executed with clever and artful cinematography, i did however (upon immediate recognition of the disappointing final song) find the musical direction lacking in sophistication. i applaud the fabulous casting of this film. these are regular looking aussie kids who invite plenty of sympathy because of this. great performances all round and you can't top gary sweet, this film made me remember why sometimes high school sucked and unless you're squeamish, or you like to leave with warm and fuzzies, go and see 2:37.

at 2:37pm in a bathroom at an adelaide highschool a student takes their own life and the different worlds of six teenagers are changed forever.2:37 is a brutal, honest and breathtaking film centered on the pain of being a teenager. the film follows one day in the lives of six teenagers, all intertwined, all dealing with their own personal dramas. while there are a couple of stereotypes in the mix  the beautiful would-be popular girl dealing with body issues, the over-achiever obsessed with his grades, there are several horrors that are as far from main-stream as you can get, including a social outcast dealing with a brutal illness and a young girl trying to make sense of a devastating event in her past.the movie is mixed with documentary-style interviews from the characters, which some viewers may find a little out of place in the otherwise seamless narrative. the pace is also a little slow, but it fits with the feel of the movie. the young australian actors are all stars in their own right, in particular theresa palmer who's heartbreaking performance earned her an afi nomination.the film is very well shot, with terrific direction. some scenes are a little hard to watch  in particular the five-minute-long suicide scene, but overall it is a film that leaves a big impact on its' viewers. it draws you in right from it's shocking opening scene and keeps you guessing as to which of the six main characters is going to be the one to end up in the bathroom. ultimately, it's a beautiful made, but slightly disturbing look at teenage life.

it was riveting. i just could not look away. as the movie rolled on i started to feel that it was powerful and confronting, but i had no idea how much more intense it would get. the movie gives an insight into what unfortunately is everyday life for a lot of school kids. some of us live outside that environment and would walk by and not know what is happening.parents need to see this film in particular, just to see a glimpse of what their kids go through. often parent dismiss their kids problems as trivial, but unfortunately to a high schooler they are massive. and unfortunately the problems can escalate into a tragedy.definitively a must see for all.

well... what to say.i think i shall start with a confession. i have cried 4 times in my life. once when my dad died, twice due to a girlfriend in high school, and at the end of this film. this film deals with the real confronting issues of 6 school kids, forcing them quite uncomfortably into the open for all the world to see. i have never seen a film that deals with the human emotional condition as well as this. everything from incest to incontinence is covered here and i doubt there are many people who are safe from the sting of familiarity with at least a couple of scenes.it starts off with a suicide. at 2:37pm. then without letting you know who it was that died, the story begins to be told from the start of the day. it follows the lives of 6 school kids up until 2:37pm. it interchangeably, and edited with personal interviews of the 6 teenagers, lets you know everything about their lives. their loves, hates, dreams, desires, secrets, shame, false confidence, self loathing, corruption and arrogance. the overall outcome of which is a sort of "whodunnit" trying to discover the identity of the suicidal before it is revealed at the end of the film. without spoiling anything i must let you know. do not feel cheated by the ending. it contains a very important lesson.and now a warning. this film is definitely not for the faint hearted. many people actually walked out of the cinema half way through when i saw it. disgusted by some of it's content. or perhaps it's that it's sometimes hard to face the cold hard truth of reality. this is what high school is like for many people. i'm sure most would agree.

hi, i have to say you got some wrong information about the series here. the main author was richard carpenter, he created the series. later on there were some other authors but they only did a few episodes.the first director who did most of the series (i think complete series 1) was ian sharp who created the distinct look of robin of sherwood.clannad did indeed see some of the material and they read the scrips. i know this for sure because richard carpenter told it on a con in england last year.i think this is a masterpiece of television-entertainment, because it has great characters and cast, good costumes and great story lines. for me still one of the best tv-series ever!

i remember watching this series avidly, every saturday evening. it was the highlight of the week. i loved everything about it, the location, the costumes, the actors and the wonderful music by clannad (i still have their legend album). i loved the way they solved the problem of michael praed leaving by creating another robin, this time the earl of huntingdon. i believe there were legends of several robins in medieval times. another thing i loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors, i'm sure robin and his men would have young, after all people didn't live that long in those days. other robins always look too old (kevin costner with his ridiculous accent looked like robin's granddad). the only sad thing was the ending, it's a shame they couldn't at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending.

used to watch this when i was very little, then used to watch my videos. now i watch the dvds, i love this. ray winston is 'the dude', the rest of the cast is all good and even with the changing of robin hood it all works. great stories, twists and the way it was shot - to the untrained eye (not that mine is trained) can be miss-interpreted as being ropey but it adds to the films absorption of the audience. with the green hillsides and the contrast of the lush sunny lit forest to the dark corridors and dungeons of the castles - its great. personally the definitive interpretation of the robin hood legend. i cannot stress how much i think you should watch this, if you get a chance then you must watch it.

this is a video version of a stage production, with extra shooting for the video edition. the result gains both the drama of the stage with the impact of well produced film. the set by george tsypin, with sculptures and masks by julie taymor are superb.jessye norman is terrific, and one gets to hear (and see) the young bryn terfel. this production is stunning, emotional and majestic. if you don't see this you have missed out.

i wish i could have met ida lupino. when people ask who you if you could have 6 extraordinary 20th century persons over for dinner, well, for me one person would be her. i think she is now one of the great unsung and unprofiled personalities in the film industry. her life story would make a great tele movie (hey, mr bogdanovich........). ida lupino has been the driving force in many fascinating noir films of the 40s and 50s. i can remember being saddened at seeing her reduced to a horrible part in a ghastly aip film is the late 70s. she was bitten by a big worm at the kitchen sink. ugh. i should have contacted her then as she died not long after.. more from the part than the worm too. from high sierra, roadhouse and the extraordinary rko thriller on dangerous ground, ida lupino was often the producer and the lead actress. later, with her husband howard duff they produced many now timeless noir dramas that are still very engrossing today. one of them is jennifer which i think is the last film with a monogram pictures copyright. monogram changed the company name formally to allied artists in 1953 and jennifer has both company names on the opening credits. this is a superior haunted house thriller equally as scary as both the innocents and the haunting made 8 years later. really chilling and very creepy, this tiny film is exactly the sort of really good film ida lupino made and was responsible for. try and find it...you will always remember it and as i feel, much admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress/producer.

i first caught up with jennifer years ago while out of town when it showed up on tv in the middle of the night; i fell asleep before it ended but it stuck with me until i had to track it down. its appeal is that, though there's not a lot to it, it weaves an intriguing atmosphere, and because ida lupino and howard duff (real life man-and-wife at the time) display an alluring, low-key chemistry. lupino plays a woman engaged to house-sit a vast california estate whose previous caretaker -- jennifer -- up and disappeared. (shades of jack nicholson in the shining, although in this instance it's not lupino who goes, or went, mad). duff is the guy in town who manages the estate's finances and takes a shine to lupino, who decides to play hard to get. she becomes more and more involved, not to say obsessed, with what happened to her predecessor in the old dark house full of descending stairways and locked cellars. the atmospherics and the romantic byplay are by far the best part of the movie, as viewers are likely to find the resolution a bit of a letdown -- there's just not that much to it (except a little frisson at the tail end that anticipates brian de palma's filmic codas). but it's well done, and, again, it sticks with you. extra added attraction: this is the film that introduced the song "angel eyes," which would become part of the standard repertoire of ol' blue eyes.

the movie jennifer with ida lupino and howard duff is film noir magnificence.this is a mostly unknown movie that all film noir fans should see.jennifer was filmed with the most unusual camera angles for that time, which made the movie have a surreal like quality at times. i love the stark black and white film noir movies.film noir in color is not as good.the cast and script is excellent.the rather creepy music is fun to listen to.ida lupino is one of the best and talented actresses to ever grace the screen.i have never seen a production that she was in that i did not like.she was not only breathtakingly beautiful,she was a fine actress.the first movie that i remember seeing ida lupino in was roadhouse with richard widmark and cornel wilde.i never forgot the movie,or her. i saw her last films like food of the gods and women in chains, and even though the movies were not her usual fare, she was still delightful in them as an actress.howard duff is always terrific to watch.i highly recommend this masterpiece to everyone.i have this movie on vhs tape.

an assassination thriller in the mould of day of the jackal, in the line of fire has the added twist that eastwood's old-timer bodyguard frank horrigan is troubled by past failure on the job. the chase becomes personal as john malkovich's reptilian assassin leary taunts him over this neurosis - with the rather clunky exception of the love of a good woman (russo's lilly raines) nothing's going to set frank's mind at rest than taking leary down personally.malkovich is a volatile presence - not simply combustible on screen but often a changeable actor too. this is one of his good films, focused and playing director petersen's game. eastwood is too old but a) the audience don't care, cos it's him and b) his age is written into the script, not only in the narrative but also as a recurring joke. pretty much as you'd expect but well-handled. 7/10

i really love action/adventure films and this is one of the best. of course, we love the stars of this genre, bruce willis, sly stallone, clint eastwood, kurt russell, arnold schwarzenegger and the rest, but its the story that really counts. the best are somewhat feasible but we can tolerate those that are a little "over the top" as in the comic book style of action. the more twists and turns, the more dire situations the heroes are involved in and the more shocking moments in the film; the more we action/adventure fans enjoy them. "in the line of fire" has all the elements required for a rip-roaring action thriller. it has clint eastwood as a near-retirement secret service agent whose one bad moment of failure haunts him. it has one of the most evil, despicable, maniacal villains in john malkovich, the type in which you can't wait to see him, "get his due". it has rene russo as the 'love interest.' it has twists and turns, an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor. it is extremely well paced by director wolfgang petersen and even has a score by the great ennio morricone. this one is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller! don't miss it!

frank horrigan (clint eastwood) is being harassed by mitch leary (john malkovich), a bomber terrorist who literally believes he will not be caught. in the opening is everyone's favourite modern serial killer, "john kramer" (tobin bell) from the saw series. through clever planning and influence, frank is able to make the arrest of mendoza (bell).from thereafter, its a series of cat and mouse chase. malkovich is a tremendous actor and incredibly versatile. once again showing a different role in this film, he astounds me with his ability to interchange his characters with the next film.i've watch malkovich play in con air as a menacing insanely smart cyrus, in of mice and men as the tragically challenged bunny lover lenny, to name a few. he plays a very smart bomber terrorist who is very sane but is deluded into thinking he can elude his captures.clint eastwood is no one special me. he's too old to really do much action in films so the only thing he can really astound you with is his ability to create dramatic scenes. the characters he plays are simplistic and one-dimensional.rene russo plays eastwood's love interest in the film and captivates me with her supporting actually being a bigger role, to me, than eastwood's.while this might seem like an action blockbuster, it's relatively slow paced and plays on anticipation. you have to wait for the build up and the ending and it will pay off in the end. along the way, you'll be mesmerized by malkovich and eastwood's chemistry and their scenes of cat and mouse.

"in the line of fire" is one of the best thrillers i have seen, it builds and builds to a great climax. this film really draws you in your heart is beating and you are out of breath from the action. the cast turns in strong peformances, particularly clint eastwood and john malkovich. this film is expertly directed by suspense master wolfgang petersen. thrillers don't get much better thn this, don't miss it.

i just saw this movie for the first time last night. wow! what a movie! this is the kind of movie you want everyone in the world to see because its just so cool and so interesting.i do not want to give a single word about the plot because i think it would be better for people to go in cold. do not read the plot summary before you see the movie! all i'm going to say is that eastwood, malkovich, peterson, and the screenplay by jeff maguire are top notch. i wish all thrillers were more like this one.

i am a huge fan of big, loud, trashy, completely stupid action movies such as the rock, con air etc. all of these are great fun to watch but, when you think about it, extremely silly. in the line of fire tells a story and it tells it well. with plausibility as well as excitement and suspense it also addressed several important moral questions that really make you think. the last shot of the movie is eastwood and russo sitting together on the steps of the white house watching the pigeons to gentle, peaceful music and i felt a deep feeling of satisfaction. this was because i cared about the characters and i was happy for them that their story had come to a happy conclusion. it felt like a true story. as the aging secret service agent tormented by the fact that he failed to protect jfk on that fateful day in dallas, clint eastwood is fantastic. he brilliantly conveys his paranoia and his personal need to stop his adversary. on the other side of the spectrum is john malkovich, as the creepy predator who tortures eastwood about what happened in 1963 by openly telling him of his plan to kill the current president. this oscar nominated performance really gets under your skin. throughout the movie, malkovich talks to eastwood as if they are friends. he doesn't threaten him, he doesn't lie to him, he doesn't laugh at him, but he tortures him with his unbearable friendliness right up to the last moment. as well as this thrilling main plot, there is a charming love story involving rene russo, another agent and eastwood. despite the age difference, they have superb chemistry on screen and the director wisely does not let this dominate too much but keeps it as part of the backdrop which works nicely. to sum up, i love this film because it has a mind.

'in the line of fire' tells the story of the game between an old presidential bodyguard and a former-government assassin turned psycho. the secret service agent/bodyguard (eastwood) is on defense and the assassin (malkovich)is on offense. the stakes? the president's live.i really like this movie...i've seen it numerous times on tv and have recently bought it on dvd. yet, it's not an excellent movie. the plot is way too thin and the attempts to thicken it are downright ridiculous. the whole love-story isn't very plausible and the way they brought an extra character into the story, just to be able to kill it off is kind of insulting to the more or less intelligent viewer. though i feel these mistakes can't be forgiven, i can easily look past them to mr. malkovich exquisite performance. i've always deemed him to be a great actor but in this movie he's really on fire. there's a reason why he got an academy award nomination. rene russo and clint eastwood were okay, but i don't deem their performance to be memorable. they're never at the best of their abilities.if you don't expect too much, you'll certainly like this movie. it's no masterpiece but john malkovich is really extraordinary and i don't think anyone can't enjoy his performance. really worth the watch...

back when i was working person, i remember having a really obnoxious client to deal with who insisted on making everything on a personal basis. i was telling him things that my agency could do and could not do and he firmly believed i was personally out to do him out of what was rightfully his. i swear but i was thinking of this guy as i watched john malkovich and clint eastwood in their battle of wits.in the line of fire casts clint eastwood as a veteran secret service agent who was on the job in dallas as a young man when john f. kennedy was assassinated. he's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real shambles. he's gotten back on the white house detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the secret service, it's eastwood and partner dylan mcdermott who draw the case.but the assassin is no ordinary crank case. he's a professional at his job, trained by and used by the central intelligence agency. john malkovich earned a deserved academy award nomination for best supporting actor. he lost that year to tommy lee jones for the fugitive and i'm not sure, but that i thought malkovich was better.oddly enough malkovich might have been better off, but he saw eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. he calls eastwood throughout the film and taunts him. and after a while what malkovich says and does causes clint to get real personal. the presidential assassins we've had in our history have been lucky amateurs, unless you believe in some of the conspiracy theories about some of the assassinations. a guy like malkovich, a professional with a real or imagined grudge, is the most dangerous kind of foe.others to note in the cast are fred dalton thompson as the white house chief of staff (and would be president in real life), rene russo as another agent who falls for the eastwood masculine charm, john mahoney as the secret service head, gary cole as the white house head secret service guy, gregory-alan williams as another agent and jim curley and sally hughes as the president and first lady.but when malkovich is on he owns in the line of fire. the climax with him and eastwood is unforgettable.

here's another entertaining clint eastwood action-suspense film. i am not a particularly fan of his but i have to hand to him: he knows how to make entertaining movies. this is one more example. it didn't hurt, either, to have john malkovich as his co-star. now there is an intense actor! in this story, malkovich plays an assassin, and he is fascinating to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialog he was given. he also has a interesting voice.rene russo is fairly low-key (for her), but that's fine and eastwood plays the usual loner-cop role, not appreciated by his superiors but showing them all up in the end. i guess he couldn't stop playing the "dirty harry"-type figures, but he played them well.there were some negatives this film, however, namely: credibility in parts as there were a couple of times, had this been real-life, the killer would have done away with eastwood. the climatic scene, in particularly, had too many holes in it. there also were too many abuses of lord's name in vain in here.overall, however, this is good, escapist fare.

wolfgang peterson's in the line of fire is cunning and occasionally a truly white-knuckled ride, even if once or twice we might feel like we've been down similar roads before. how could one not when clint eastwood, right after (allegedly) closing the book on his western legacy, likely closes the one on his gritty detective pictures (don't count blood work in there). but there's more than that because eastwood's character, here a hard-bitten, demon-ridden and hard as nails secret service agent, has a slightly charming side to him, even the more romantic side that one never got to see in the pictures where he spouted his trademark lines. there is some complexities going on here that don't rely on just the usual swagger, and it's note-worthy for how such a possibly contrived back story (didn't save kennedy from being assassinated in 63) is made somewhat believable amidst the rest of his persona, which more than likely hides his wounds- most of the time. eastwood goes to town to make himself a great presence in the film, however, and under the circumstances the character seems tailor made for him.but there would be the risk of his part in the movie being slightly conventional (we still get the 'harry' type scenes of him being smarter- and as smart-ass- over everyone else in the room, and being scolded and told to back off by the top brass, here a chief of staff), including here protecting a president that (wisely) we never really see or know at all. even the romantic sub-plot, which is sort of undercooked if there for some machismo laughs, would make the picture a little sub-par if the other quasi-dirty harry aspect didn't come into the picture: an indelible villain. this time there's some extra hollywood suspense, however brillaintly intelligent suspense (almost smarter than the rest of the movie deserves), with the "john booth" character, played in an oscar nominated performance by john malkovich, as someone who's described more as a predator than an assassin. there's ways this could go wrong with the eastwood character, but malkovich possibly trumps some of his former villain counterparts by being extremely cool and un-collected (there's that devastating, cringe-worthy scene where he kills the bank teller and her roommate), and as his past is revealed, there's still that element of 'what the hell is with this guy' that keeps the audience and eastwood's agent guessing and extra paranoid. it's a classic malkovich performance, quintessentially creepy and always measured in the level of insanity and professionalism.it's also, aside from the conventional points, just a sleekly made picture from peterson and company, and they come pretty close to the spunky pulp realism of don siegel. but peterson also has a couple of cinematic tricks up his sleeve that had me grinning at times; anytime someone puts in such a blatant but exciting homage to vertigo- jumping from rooftop to rooftop, hero dangling from the ledge, the 'twist'- it still provides some shivers down my spine. there's also the phone conversations between eastwood and malkovich, where we see the depths of the cat and mouse game, probably another kick in the ribs to hithcock. but in the end, even with all the excitement and brutal danger and crisp formalism in the climax, it's also a characters picture in some ways throughout, and everything is fairly realized to give the audience a fine amount to ponder over, at least in the suspense-movie sense. eastwod's a great lead, russo plays the female possible love-interest sincere and mature, and malkovich is top of the pops. there's also a few notable supporting roles too, and a fine studio score in there. one of the better films of 1993.

i was watching the perfect storm, and thought about another wolfgang peterson film which is much better--this one. although certainly not based on a true story, in the line of fire is how a movie should be made. it has a terrific story with a great cast. malkovich won a well-deserved oscar for his performance as the creepy killer with a grudge against the government he served all too well. eastwood is good as the tortured secret service and russo is easy on the eyes. if you haven't seen this, definitely rent it or buy it as i did. definitely one of the best crime thrillers of the past decade. 9/10

i have seen quite a few action thrillers in my life and this is clearly one of the best ever! there are very few films which i even consider watching several times and this is one of them. everything in this movie is just right: clint as the superb leading actor, rene russo as his non-stupid female partner(this is a very rare combination - sad,but true!). of course, john malkowich deserves a lot of praise for his excellent villain but let us not overlook eastwood`s initial buddy, played by dylan mcdermott, who in my view fits the role perfectly.the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic - but sadly never released on an original soundtrack cd (shame on the producers!). the plot makes sense and there is no loss of pace, the audience is kept in constant excitement of the outcome of the duel between eastwood and malkowich. i give this one 10 stars!

one of the finest movies i have viewed...good script, original plot of a man who is haunted about jfk's assassination when he was assigned to protect him on that cold november day in 1963. thirty years later another anti-social lunatic wants to assassinate the current president. the secret service agent loses his partner along the way,to the crazed gunmen who schemes,lies and murders anybody in his path who'll stand in his way of his mission. the movie accompanies with a great memorable score,and a restrained but meaningful romance between russo and eastwood....which displays how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work. malchovich is great,sure many other candidates could have played the role that he played,but how many could acted with such craftiness,and intellect that he displayed in the movie?needless to say,i thought this was a great movie...everytime it's on television i have to watch it..and i own it on dvd! i'm a big eastwood fan,this only boosted his already fabulous career,and malchovich's best role to date!

in the line of fire, in my opinion, is an excellent, suspenseful, and edge-of-your-seat action/drama/thriller! i thought that agent horrigan (clint eastwood) and agent raines (rene russo) looked good in the attire they wore at the presidential dinner. as for leary (john malkovich), he was a sick man who loved to toy with frank by phone. he looked good in the tuxedo he wore near the end of the film, though. one thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between agent horrigan and agent raines. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that the entire cast and crew did an outstanding job, i loved the setting, and i couldn't get enough of it. now, in conclusion, to all you clint eastwood fans who haven't seen this excellent, suspenseful, and edge-of-your-seat action/drama/thriller, i highly recommend it.

this is another of eastwood's many movies mixing intrigue, action, and a dollop of romance, along with "the gauntlet," "firefox," and so forth. clint's acting range by now is pretty familiar. in this one, he's taciturn and a bit outrageous, especially with women and superiors. there are no surprises in his performance. but the film itself is something of a surprise; it's above average. clint is frank, a secret service agent who, perhaps in a moment of doubt, failed to catch the bullet that killed jfk. he then took to drink, which drove his family away, and now plods along in the bureaucracy until he is contacted by john malkovitch, calling himself "booth," who strikes up a sort of skewed relationship with him based on their shared, disillusioned conviction that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape dreariness and predictability. now, this is rather an anfractuous set of attitudes for a performer like clint to project, but he does rather well, less robotic than usual. and he does seem to carry around with him, like a burden of stone, the memory of that moment in dallas. he's tested again halfway through this movie. he is hanging from the roof of a tall building, grasping booth's hand, and he pulls his pistol and points it at booth, who asks him if he is really willing to shoot. if he does, of course, he saves the president from an attempted assassination by a cia-trained murderer, but he does so at the cost of his own life. booth twits him about the situation as they hold hands in midair. and clint even has a short speech, talking to renee russo, about his failure to save the president in dallas. "if i'd have reacted quickly enough, i could have taken that shot . . . and that would have been alright with me." it's underplayed, but his voice chokes slightly, his eyes water, and his lip trembles. it's one of the few scenes in any of clint's films that might properly be called "moving." we know from his newfound resolve that given another chance he would take the bullet this time. (the irony is that he doesn't like the current president. who could? he gives pompous speeches in colorado about how they "carved a nation out of the wilderness." didn't they do the same thing in las vegas?)it's often said that a movie is only as good as its villain. it isn't true, nothing is that simple, but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case. the reptilian john malkovitch with his tartar eyes is marvelous.talk about disillusioned. okay, he can ham it up a little, sniffing with disdain even as he plugs two innocent hunters between the eyes, but he's fascinating on the screen. renee russo has little do to. fred thompson, as the chief white house aid, is now back in politics, a relief for movie-goers. if clint's acting range is limited, thompson's is something less. in every film he's been in, he wears the same solemn and dissatisfied expression, as if constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorder.the direction by wolfgang peterson is as good as it was in "das boot," which is pretty good. there is a great deal of the usual suspenseful cross-cutting in the final shootout. and when clint and russo fall into an impassioned embrace in her hotel room and scuttle backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat, peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor -- not only the usual garments but handcuffs, guns, beepers, palm pilots, dick tracy wrist watches and other impedimenta. interrupted, clint lies back on the bed and sighs, "now i have to put all that stuff back on again."well written and worth watching.

a great performance by clint eastwood and particularly john malkovich in my opinion his finest one to date. malkovich had this one nailed right down to the floor it's incredible. eastwood is agent mike horrigan, an aged and cynical secret service agent who is finishing out his career busting counterfeiters and chasing down routine assignments. but one assignment which appears to be run of the mill at first turns complicated and deadly serious. horrigan and his new partner al are sent to investigate a threat on the president by a "wacko". as fate would have it horrigan has stumbled not upon a delusional nut but a professional lone wolf who has a big bone to pick with the white house. as horrigan dives deeper into "booth's" world he attracts the bad guy's unwanted attention and unbridled admiration for him. horrigan was jfk's top agent and present in dallas, texas when he was assassinated and blames himself for what happened. now he feels it's up to him to stop the current head of state from joining the list of dead presidents. but this killer has turned the tables on horrigan and now he's the hunted one in a life or death cat and mouse game. who will win? who will die? it's a race against time to save the pres from a chameleon-like enemy who can get to anyone. my favorite secret service movie and as good a nail biter as any.

frank horrigan (clint eastwood) is a secret service agent plagued with guilt over the assassination of president john f. kennedy, while he was on duty. thirty years later and the current president is entering a re-election campaign, but he is receiving death threats; and horrigan has been called in to assist in what should be a routine research operation. john malkovich plays the professional assassin and master of disguise who is tracking the president, and using the past he begins to torture horrigan in a psychological duel of cat and mouse.malkovich, eastwood and rene russo all give wonderful performances in this top notch thriller. the direction is excellent and the entire picture is charged with tension and intrigue throughout.a must see for thriller fans 8/10

clint eastwood scores big in this thriller from 1993.teamed with an absolute master of edge of your seat suspense,wolfgang peterson, eastwood delivers as only he can.also,john malkovich goes on my list of most effective screen villains in the history of cinema as the demented assassin.as for rene russo as clint's love interest,i think kirk douglas said it best when he said,referring to his own career,"i keep getting older,and my leading ladies keep getting younger".this film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going.eastwood and peterson should team together more often. top notch movie.

quite simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted movie. eastwood is classic as grizzled secret service agent frank horrigan and rene russoholds her own as partner (and love interest) lilly raines. but the movie'sgreatness rests on the shoulders of john malkovich as "booth". he capturesthis character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity oddly enough. personally i think this was his best performance and should have received anoscar for it (but i loved tommy lee jones in the fugitive as well that year). overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and beon the edge of your seat the whole way through. enjoy!!

in the line of fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse. clint eastwood is plagued by john malkovich in this riveting film. malkovich says he's going to kill the president, and he purposely calls eastwood, and pushes his buttons. he questions eastwood's ability to protect someone. malkovich brings a cold, but very intelligent mindset to his character. everything he does, he does for a reason, and he's not shy about killing. eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors in order to catch malkovich, but no one wants to listen to him. the result is a film that crackles with suspense that escalates to a tense scene in a ballroom at the bonneventure hotel. wolfgang peterson ratchets up the tension and we feel every turn.

'in the line of fire' is one of those hollywood films that shows up on tv quite a bit, but although i've seen it a few times, i usually end up sitting through the whole thing again. why? - it's good! clint eastwood is great as usual, and the character he plays is interesting and more fleshed out than usual. the character, secret service agent frank horrigan, is haunted by the fact that he was on the detail that failed to protect president kennedy in dallas, and now he's forced to match wits with a professional assassin that is openly declaring that he will kill the president. however, the film doesn't make him a depressed, brooding, and obsessed character. he's charming and personable, and is realistic as a guy that has experienced a lot in life and is comfortable in his own skin. he's even quite convincing when he flirts with the pretty younger agent played by rene russo. the killer, played by john malkovich at his best, is cerebral, deliberate, and enjoys playing high stakes games of life and death. he even goes by the name of another presidential assassin, john booth. the film is consistently enjoyable, and it delivers all the goods - suspense, action, romance, and drama - all in their proper amounts. it's a fun film that is really helped by the great actors in it!

written by brilliant monkees' tv writers gerald gardner and dee caruso,which way to the front was the last of the "jerry lewis" movies until "hardly working" almost a decade later. jerry's comedy is evidently an acquired taste, and admittedly he can occasionally be his own worst enemy when he helms as producer/director--but even in the dreariest of his films, there are always moments of brilliance.which way manages to be amusing,entertaining and yes,quite funny. it is somewhat unlike any of the typical lewis films.the pace is very upbeat and ther are lots of excellent supporting players--a kind of jerry does hogans heroes.the whole thing looks kind of like an unsold tv pilot and you will either love it or hate it---but hopefully you vill laugh

for some inexplicable reason, jerry's movies often seemed to come in for diatribes from certain quarters although they were rarely box office disappointments. it's one of life's great mysteries to me because his films have always had a 'feel good' factor about them for me. but this film is not only not bad: it's an exceedingly good and clever comedy. to those who may be tickled by 'modern' crude or cruel humour, don't see this film: there's nothing in it like that and you'll be wasting your time.i've only seen this film once on the television. i've waited ever since to see it again and that's been quite a few years. you'd think the idea of an arrogant millionaire businessman heading off to win the war against the nazis with his own small private army of subservient employees would be boring wouldn't you? well only jerry lewis would dare try such a plot for an out and out comedy and it works, i have to say, brilliantly.i think that, as with 'the nutty professor' and most of his other films, this movie is testimony to his comic genius, both in concept and execution. i think buddy love might have said, "you know, true comedy can not only make a six year old hysterical, it'll do that for his dad too." maybe a few nutty nazis generals with monocles and a limp would dislike this movie, honestly. if you only see one more comedy in your life, see this one. be careful though, you might die laughing. and i'm not joking!

a very different jerry lewis film, not like all those more famous films that everybody knows. lewis deals with the difficult task of ww ii and national socialism in germany in a rather unconventional way. but even more interesting and important, he does it in a very un-american way. and as with so many things in the world and especially in the film industry un-american means more sophisticated, more subtle, more intelligent or simply better. that is the reason why the film was no success in the us but a very great success in europe.all in all, jerry lewis has proven by this movie, that he is able to do much more than simple slapstick comedy.

i think this movie is the most misunderstood film in jerry lewis career. it's little slow starting, but after it gets going is very funny & jerry's use of irony like never before in his earlier films..., ie, who's minding the store, the nutty professor, etc., the idea, is clear, it's a mock of the dirty dozen, instead of getting soldiers on death row to do a suicide mission as in that film, you have 4, 4-f's & 2 tag alongs. including the former l.a. dodgers all-star centerfielder, willie davis as linc! hilarious! love that movie!

a sick man carleton hendricks (dee snider), cruises the teen chat lines as captain howdy. he poses as a teenage boy and invites other teens over his house to party. he instead knocks them out, strips them, sews their mouth closed and tortures them (mostly with needles). he captures the daughter of cop mike gage (kevin gage). he finds him, arrests him and he's institutionalized. four years later he's released...totally cured. but a lynch mop (led, amusingly, by robert englund) attack him and hang him. he doesn't die but he snaps and captain howdy is back...a very sick, disturbing, twisted horror film. captain howdy enjoys pain and torture and is trying to show the kids he kidnaps how to enjoy it also. the torture scenes aren't that explicit (you hear more than you see), but what you do see is very very sick. there's no humor and the (muted) screams of his victims sound way too real. i was cringing away from the tv during most of the scenes. the acting varies. kevin gage isn't that good as the cop--he's not terrible but he could have been better. dee snider is very scary as captain howdy--his attack scenes are not pleasant.all in all, not your typical horror film. i'll probably never see it again (this film really gets under your skin) but i recommend it to all horror fans--at least those with strong stomaches. i give it a 7.

many people have said that this movie was not a good movie, at a horror perspective i agree, it was not very scary, it did have some gruesome ways of torture yes (hooks going where they shouldn't) but not scary. but it was a good movie at a comedic stand-point, i thought it was hilarious, such bad acting from dee snider with his stupid theological questioning and every second word he said came out as "what is____, define______", then the angry mob at his house with one of them holding a sign saying "we're not gonna take it" (which is a song from his band twisted sister. but i think the part that made me laugh the most was the one guy's wife that was dead and dee snider was holding her up and making her dance, when i saw that i broke out in tears... so i would not recommend this for avid horror lovers, but for those who love horror for its comedy i recommend this movie 100%

despite its many faults, hallmark's 1995 version of gulliver's travels is still the finest adaptation of jonathan swift's satirical classic - largely because it not only includes all of gulliver's many travels but also includes the satire that's often overlooked. unfortunately the twin problems of the book's highly episodic structure and a television budget (even a fairly lavish one) remain. the book is a somewhat rambling collection of traveller's tales moving simply from one surreal landscape to another, but simon moore's adaptation tries to impose some order on the chaos by providing a parallel plot that sees gulliver returned to england clearly deeply traumatised and trying to prove his way out of the insane asylum where the rival for his wife's affections has had him committed. the england scenes at once mirror and comment on the travels, elements of which occasionally spill over into the real world. the trouble is that for the first hour or so it acts more as a distraction, constantly pulling you away from the story just as it starts to get interesting. the lilliput scenes suffer worse here, with the feeling that the home scenes are too often designed to save them from filming the more expensive setpieces - this has to be the only version where we don't see gulliver pulling the blefescu fleet behind him.yet once gulliver makes his escape, the tone becomes more consistent as he finds his situation reversed and himself the pet of the giants of the utopians of brobdingnag, a guest of the wise men of the floating island of laputa who are so engrossed in science that they have no common sense left, the guest/prisoner of a historian who leans history directly from the source, offered immortality with all it's terrible consequences before finally finding a world he wants to belong if only he can convince the sublime talking horses the houynhnhms that he's not an uncivilized yahoo, each new destination convincing him of what an absurd and petty species humanity is. for the most part it's a darker set of travels than expected, with only gulliver's curiosity and commonsense and disappointment keeping it from plunging into irretrievable bleakness - and even this is offset by the scenes in the asylum where it becomes more obvious that even if he is telling the truth it may well have driven him genuinely insane. it's in these latter scenes that ted danson's gulliver really shines, never more so than in an extraordinary speech where he turns his trial into a disappointed judgment on the whole human race.being made for television, the yahoos are rather less literally scatological here than on the page, but for the most part this is a more adult treatment than you might expect with no real dumbing down. the star cast is certainly impressive, and for the most part well-used (if somewhat briefly in a few cases) - mary steenburgen, james fox, peter o'toole, edward woodward, omar sharif, shashi kapoor, edward fox, ned beatty, alfre woodard, kristin scott thomas and isabelle huppert among them. it's hard to imagine the upcoming jack black version even coming close to being a fraction as impressive as this.

this production was quite well done for a television original, providing a very appropriate original slant on swift's work. to make the frame story work well the film begins with gulliver arriving home. everyone who has read the book knows that will happen anyway. the frame story of the book has gulliver's crazed confusion in sections. for example, he is horrified that he will trample little people in england because he has just returned from a land of giants. but the film has all the book sections within one long voyage. when gulliver narrates his travels the editing cuts from england to the travel are very effective. i confess i found them intrusive and irritating at first, then they became natural. by the end, moreover, they have become a welcome addition to the story. as he tells his adventures to a larger and larger audience, more and more people listen to his compelling fantasy even though they doubt its truth. for example, his hatred of filthy yahoos and admiration of pure logic from the fourth section comes across well when he is defending his own sanity. the intercuts between events in england and similar events or scenes in the tale is very effective. for example, ripping the cloth from the table to suggest the motion of towing a group of ships is inspired filming. the addition of gulliver's family threatened by the lecherous doctor works well. swift only hints at this by having the long-suffering wife protest against further voyages. it becomes a natural part of this story. the casting and acting were competent throughout. some roles were exemplary. omar sharif's mad magician is superb. o'toole's little emperor is doddering delightfully toward senility. many specific complaints made by other writers here strike me as simple personal preference, which, after all, is what we are about here. i read the abridged version several times a year from fourth grade on. i may have escaped the complete version until a college class but have read it a few times since. and i had to start it again as i began reading about this film. while the danson version is superior to any previous film, it does not replace the book. however, i think it will bring many readers to the book. if you have not read the book, enjoy this movie then go to the source. if you appreciate the satire in it, find swift's "a modest proposal" and his "drapier's letters." both are satires attacking the wretched treatment of ireland and the irish during swift's time. the drapier protests cheap, inflated copper coins being dumped on ireland. these were wood's light weight coinage, not good for face value in paying taxes and official debts. the outcry from swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another mistreated british territory, the american colonies. the universal satire in swift's book and this movie just poke fun; they cannot change human nature. give danson's torturous experiences a chance. i think you will find them thought provoking and entertaining.

i first saw this when i was a teen in my last year of junior high. i was riveted to it! i loved the special effects, the fantastic places and the trial-aspect and flashback method of telling the story.several years later i read the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see what swift was trying to say, i think that while it's not as perfect as the book for social commentary, as a story the movie is better. it makes more sense to have it be one long adventure than having gulliver return after each voyage and making a profit by selling the tiny lilliput sheep or whatever.it's much more arresting when everyone thinks he's crazy and the sheep do make a cameo anyway. as a side note, when i saw laputa i was stunned. it looks very much like the kingdom of zeal from the chrono trigger video game (1995) that also made me like this mini-series even more.i saw it again about 4 years ago, and realized that i still enjoyed it just as much. really high quality stuff and began an excellent run of sweeps mini-series for nbc who followed it up with the solid merlin and interesting alice in wonderland.

excellent story-telling and cinematography. poignant, biting social commentary.superb effects. well-filmed and acted.however, the parallel action between the present and the travel adventures (though very well done) at times drags on a little too much (about 3 hrs), and over-interrupts the flow of the story.i first read the book as a child, and enjoyed the parts about the giants and the tiny people -- but the book lost me when it got to the floating island and the land of the "yahoos"! well, although the adventure plot may sound like a children's story, it's in fact a very adult story, full of symbolism about the moral decay in england at the time of jonathan swift, the author of the novel that the film is based upon.

well as you can see, i got to this party quite late but, have the advantage of reading all the previous entries before making my comments. i found this site by happen chance, when i was looking for other marine corps films. so, let me start by telling you that i played a marine boot in the movie, pvt. labarsky, and was stationed at mcrdep, san diego at the time. jack webb and his crew selected 15 permanent personnel, of which some of us had the speaking parts, and another 15 marines that had just completed boot camp. that made up the platoon and the marines who portrayed the various "dis". to the best of my recollection, the capt. and pvt. owens (don dubbins) were not in the marines. we spent about three weeks up in hollywood (studio city film lot), ca shooting the section of the movie that we were involved with, and then they completed the other shots after we left.so as i ramble along here, let me clarify some of what has been questioned in previous entries as best i can. "cuff daddy" was commenting about the ability of our platoon to yell "yes sir" without moving and etc,, yes we did the yelling for the sound guys, and it was while shooting the scene. as you fellow marines remember, when the di or who ever started to ask a question and before they completed it, you had already taken your breath of air enabling you to yell at the top of your lungs the proper response. that is how it was done."74sooner" commented about walking through the same building at paris island, however, as i mentioned earlier all the scenes were shot in studio city, ca . they were built from photos taken at paris island and from on site trips and marine advisers from paris island. sorry, you were in the real buildings, not the sets."schappe1" brought up many good points, but, about the incident with the platoon at paris island at the time all that jack webb said to us was, "the movie came about because of the accident, and the marine corps didn't want to put out anything that would impact any of the family members of the marines that died that night. although, the marine corps would provide any marines and assistance needed for a movie answering to the public why a marine di does what he does".as mentioned by a few of you, i also at the time we were shooting the scenes caught my self thinking this dialog has been cleaned up to much and obviously isn't how it goes down in real life. back in the 50's,that is how it had to be done.one story i would like to pass on is about the interaction that occurred between us marines and the movie crew, and between the movie crew and jack webb. from the start by custom the marines replied "yes sir" to anybody that moved. going into the second week it was getting more common to hear "yes sir" coming from all directions. on stage someone would bark out a request for something to be done with the lighting and from out of nowhere up on a catwalk above the set a reply of "yes sir" would sound out. to all of this at one of our informal gatherings, jack webb stated. "if i had known that i would have gotten this much respect from this crew, i would have brought you guys up here years ago." there was a lt. brought up from san diego to play the role of the di from the other platoon and the one jack webb fights with, but during one shooting secessions he was up to take number 32, and still webb kept trying to work him through how he wanted it done and didn't show any lack of patience with him. the next day they used the paris island adviser who was a di sgt. from paris island and he worked out fine.at the time i was somewhat of a camera buff and got to know the still camera man to get some pointer from him and as it turned out he would give me still shots and some of the 35mm film of the daily shooting that were not going to be used. those film strips i cut up and made slides out of them. after the movie came out in vhs tape (the di, 11706 b&w/106 min.) my kids and the grand kids have a blast when they try to se who can find me the most times on the screen.

i was a marine at camp pendleton when the d.i. came out (1st marine division, 11th marine regiment, 3rd battalion, i-battery). i still remember standing in line with a bunch of other marines to see the movie at the "star" theater in oceanside, california.we did not remotely expect the movie to portray everything we experienced in boot camp but we were all pleasantly surprised at how well done the movie was. the idea of using real marines in the movie was a great idea (i believe they were all real drill instructors too). as good an actor as jack webb was, he just couldn't "call cadence" like a real marine drill instructor.all of us got a laugh when the "problem" recruit's mother came to boot camp to talk to the captain. never in a million years would this have happened, but that's hollywood, and we didn't let that episode keep us from enjoying the movie.i went through boot camp at mcrd in san diego during the summer of 1956, and at that time there was virtually no limits as to what the d.i.'s could do to you. the "ribbon creek" event at parris island had not yet affected boot camp, at least not at mcrd - san diego.i agree with what a lot of the other reviewers have commented on concerning sgt. moore's "stiffness" around his girl friend. i believe this was just webb's acting style, and although they could have deleted this part of the movie, it didn't really hurt the production that much.one minor note, the character (uncredited) of "pvt. rodriguez" was played by one of my drill instructors, sgt. peter j. o'neill. sgt. o'neill used to tell us that some day he wanted to be an actor. we secretly laughed at this, but he surprised us all. he was a great drill instructor, and i thought he did well in his bit part. also, he really did enjoy throwing knives. he often demonstrated his skill to us that summer in boot camp. i have often wondered if he is still alive.

the d.i. (4 outta 5 stars) wow, i certainly did not expect to be enjoying this movie as much as i did. i had never even heard of it until i saw it sitting in the discount video bin one day. i figured jack webb playing an army drill instructor might be good for a chuckle but figured the drama would pale in comparison to such recent movie d.i.s as portrayed in "full metal jacket" or "an officer and a gentleman". boy, was i wrong. this is probably the best work webb has ever done... far and away better than his one-note "dragnet" performances. the delivery of his tough guy dialogue is just brilliant... done in his patented deadpan monotone and yet you *know* that the guy means every word of it. the story might seem a little hokey compared to the grittier military movies that have followed but i still found the movie fascinating and compelling. even a completely unnecessarily musical interlude in an army nightclub had me hooked. anyone know where i can get a copy of that terrific ray coniff song "if'n you don't, somebody else will"? webb plays the toughest dang drill instructor ever... and he's under pressure to kick out the deadbeat private owen but, by golly, he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and he's gonna drag him out kicking and screaming! great stuff!

i had the good fortune to be at perris island in the fall of 1959. the di showed one evening at the outdoor theater directly in front of our barracks, plt 162, b co, 1st bn, 1st itr.although we hadn't been there long enough to even think about seeing a movie, we could hear those that were laughing. it's one of the many indelible memories of my thirteen weeks at pi.at some later date, i got to actually see it in a theater. i'm still convinced that, to date, it remains the most realistic portrayal of the experience in the late 1950's ever done. no one has done it better than jack webb...

jack webb is riveting as a marine corp drill instructor in the d.i.. webb play sgt.jim moore, a tough but fair marine whose job it is to prepare young teens for possible combat. no one could have played this role any better that jack webb. as a former marine,i can assure that this is the most accurate film dealing with basic training in the corp. extremely entertaining!

of course i'm a bit prejudiced but for the time it was the most accurate portrayal of marines ever shown on the big screen.i was at camp pendleton undergoing infantry training when webb brought his crew down to film some outdoor scenes and our company was asked to participate. it took about two or three days as best i can recall.webb and don dubbins were serious and businesslike.during the filming of our short scene--which seemed to take forever to an 18 year old--webb was very conscientious about getting things (marine things) right and he did a good job with one exception--that scene where a recruit was wearing sunglasses. never happen for a host of reasons.i have a video of the movie and will bore my grandkids anytime i can make them sit still for a few seconds as i show them their papaw when he was a young stud and part of the world's greatest fighting force (no brag, just fact).what amazed me then was how well the real marines carried out their acting roles. that was before i realized that dis have to have some acting genes to get their job done. the only film i've seen since that is the equal of the di is the first half of full metal jacket and that part is superior only because of the foul language. when the di was made, cursing wasn't allowed on screen. despite the lack of profanity, it's still a great movie to rent.ooooo-rahhhhhh!!!!!semper fi, do or die

okay, this wasn't the greatest horror movie i've ever seen in my life. despite the fact that it's lower budget, it's a pretty decent movie, though. the monsters are unique and believable. heck, they're even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family. although, when you finally do get to see the monsters completely, you really think "wtf!? those itty bitty things are after them?!" the only part that really disturbed me is when *sniff* they killed the kitty! not the kitty, noooooo, why? seriously though, if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore, this is not the movie for you. go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines. if you have small children, i wouldn't recommend watching this with them though; probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room.

*minor spoiler* inhabited isn't scary, but it is creepy. it is an interesting 'little' story with good acting and great special effects makeup.basic plot: a little girl blames the strange things going on at her family's new house and accompanying playhouse on her faerie friends.the movie doesn't waste time getting moving, though the ending could have been more involved.i don't recommend this movie to those expecting/wanting hardcore horror, but i do recommend it to those who want a chiller and not necessarily a thriller.

this little flick is reminiscent of several other movies, but manages to keep its own style & mood. "troll" & "don't be afraid of the dark" come to mind. the suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from g to pg. i especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, i could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections. if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.

malcolm mcdowell diagnoses megan gallagher's daughter and she as having a form of illness, when they believe they are seeing "the huldre", troll-like creatures which live with "the rocks and the roots" (to quote the movie).basically a family moves into an older house, which has a smaller doll-house in the backyard. the daughter (well played by sofia vassiliova) starts to befriend the creatures, until they become vindictive. the family cat also disappears.there are a few good scenes with megan gallagher ("millennium") and malcolm mcdowell as the psychiatrist. there is also something strange which occurred to one of mcdowell's patients.if you enjoy this type of story, you may also like "bad ronald", which had a similar odd theme, and the house is haunted by bad ronald (scott jacoby) only that movie is from the 70's. 7/10.

`shadow magic' recaptures the joy and amazement of the first movie audiences. it also shows the power of film in its ability to bring the world a little closer, overcome cultural barriers and to preserve ourselves for generations yet to come. certainly, anyone who truly loves the art of the motion picture will enjoy this film. it's a great first effort by writer/director ann hu, who will hopefully have many films to follow.

this is a beautiful, funny, vivid film. it's even better than "nuovo cinema paradiso" -- which it parallels but doesn't replicate. the story completes a full circle and had the theater beaming as the credits rolled. a hundred years after this story takes place, we're just as intrigued by flickering images in a dark theater.

unlike some movies which you can wonder around and do other things, this movie kept me in front of the screen for the entire two hours. i loved every minute of it.however, i have to say that the story is not very believable. especially when the foreigner was expelled by the government, and then later on, actually sent a package to the guy who helped him. xiao liu is a very good actor, he shows his emotions, and he shows his silliness, and his love toward that girl.

a lovely little film about the introduction of motion pictures to china. captures the amazement of film's first audiences pretty much as it's described to have been worldwide, and uses actual lumiere films for most of the actualities. i don't agree with other people about bad acting on the british fellow's part - i thought he was fine, but the chinese lead really stole the show. in any case, i found myself with a smile on my face through most of the movie. people who fear subtitles might note that a lot of the film is in english (which for some reason is given subtitles as well as the chinese on the dvd).

a beautiful film about the coming of early silent cinema to china. shadow magic deftly combines a love story with the drama of the cultural clash between china's ancient traditions and modern western culture in the form of film. an amazing first film by chinese director ann hu. if i correctly understood ms. hu's comments at the 2000 sundance festival, this film was produced as an american film with co-funding by the chinese government, and shot in china. shadow magic reminds me of films like il postino and cinema paradiso - not necessarily in theme or plot, but it has a similar feel.

pat o'brien had his best role ever as notre dame football coach knute rockne. from humble beginnings, rockne entered notre dame as a student circa 1910. he is into chemistry but becomes a marvelous football player and hero.upon graduation, he teaches chemistry at the school but he has got the football fever that tugs at him, this forces him to give up chemistry to pursue his dream of coaching the game. in a way, too bad, the school probably lost a great chemistry teacher-certainly far better and nicer than the one i had in high school. (erasmus hall in brooklyn to be exact.)he motivates his students. he will not tolerate academic underachievement. he is a coach for all seasons.o'brien captures that common kind touch. one of his students, george gipp, is memorably played in a fine brief supporting performance by ronald reagan.the years pass and the achievements run high-but knute remains the same kind coach who testifies before congress when football is called into question.donald crisp is outstanding as a notre dame priest who knew that rockne was destined to coach football. albert basserman is adequate, but his jewish accent in the portrayal of a priest is awkward at best. basserman was nominated that year in the supporting category for "foreign correspondent."rockne's tragic death, in a plane crash, robbed the world of many more years of a totally professionally wonderful human-being. the film is great.

you don't have to be a notre dame football fan to enjoy this, because i am not....but, as a football fan in general, this was fun to watch. it almost makes me a fighting irish devotee. if you can't get caught up in the emotion in this film, gridiron fan or not, you better check your pulse because this is an emotional film with some very touching scenes.as a sports fan, i loved watching the classic footage of early college games. they had some pretty wild plays back then with a lot of laterals. they interspersed that footage with pat o'brien shown as head coach knute rockne on the sidelines and some of the players, such as george gipp (ronald reagan). reagan gets pretty good billing in this film but his part really isn't that large. o'brien is the only actor with a large role in here. the rest - all playing nice characters - include gale page as rockne's wife "bonnie;" donald crisp, as the notre dame's "father john callahan;" albert bassermann as chemistry professor "father nieuwland" and reagan, as gipp, perhaps notre dame's most talented and famous player ever.what this film does nicely is balance the personal story with the football. neither angle is overdone. the characters in here all people you can root for, as there are no villains. on my last look, it was interesting to discover johnny sheffield - tarzan's son - playing rockne at the age of seven and to see george reeves, tv's superman, as one of the players. there have been very few football movies made in hollywood, for some reason, and precious few good ones. this is one of them.

this is a classic street punk & rock movie. if you remember those times out on the city streets 14 years old two in the morning and nothing better to do than skate from friends house to friends house and sparking it. this movie brings back old memeries.

i watched the movie about 13 yrs ago while living in airlie beach qld australia. i had found it in the shelves of a little shop in the back that most don't bother to browse.to my pleasure i found it and watched it with the intention of one day owning it and being in my collection. i still do not have it but will one day.i like the concept with the poetry and the fantasy. the semi deserted street scenes with a busy teaming city in the far background added to the visual effect.i have numerous times mentioned this movie to people that enjoy this genre, with nothing but praise. it has stuck in my mind and will for a long time to come.i fully recommend this film, but only to those that are into this type.this comment and the one from la,ca can assist you when choosing to watch this film. the comments may be negative but i found them positive if you look past the derogatory connotation.

the beat was an exciting movie about a couple of young punks trying to survive in 1980's new york. this involves fighting with the other street gang that they directly share a high school class with, trying to stay in school, as well as going to local shows that involve bands that look like the dead kennedy's and have the name skulls for their band name. rex (played by david jacobson) plays an autistic kid who starts to get a long with all of these kinds, and starts to show them that poetry is really beautiful, and if applied to what these kids do in life can really make things work out for the better! billy kane (played by william mcnamara) and kate kane (played by kara glover) are brother and sister. although they roll with this crowd of thugs, these kids are not the same type of people as this group. they care for rex and they care for others, and really show an enlightened side of themselves. while his sister sleeps with the head of the gang, she is also falling in love with rex, trying to show him that she is not a slut. but in the end, the teachers at the school finally get to him and want to put him in a mental institution, he finally feels it is time to end his life, while animals of sound played without him. but they like to think that he is not dead, he is just living his life to the fullest, riding sharks and being happy living in the ocean. this movie, was one of those movies where i was glad that i watched it. while it was extremely entertaining, it also had a big message to it. something a long the lines that these kids had no direction, no future, no figure heads to look up to, but because a troubled kid came along they all realized that there was way more important things to life then fighting the local black kids, or being destructive to everything. rex showed them the beauty in angry music. rex showed them the beauty in rats, disease and murder. rex showed they the beauty in almost everything, while some of those things have no beauty involved, they still were able to see that when used in poems, these poems speak to people. rex played an important part in this move, who changed everyones heart from depression, to see that there is hope for them, and thats why he started to show them; the beat.

i think it's the sort of film you either love or hate and i'm really not the type to go in for arty movies. my mother rented "mullhuland dr" the other night and i nearly ran from the room, ha. but i love this film.we recorded "the beat" one night when we had just let the tape run and got a great film that way by accident. saved that tape and watched it a lot. i eventually got the vhs to add to my collection. i've watched it many times and at one point copied down the poems. i even tried to preform one scene for my high school drama class. she had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words. she refused to let me do it. if it could upset my drama teacher that much it has to be good :) honest she never treated me the same after that.i liked the acting it came off very true and honest. it wasn't clean and polished but it was better than that. it was true to life, how anyone would truly behave and display emotions not how hollywood does. it was great acting especially by the one playing rex.the story was original. not only do the characters get drawn into his world but you do too. not your typical person meets inner city kids and saves them through knowledge film at all. simply caring and friendship make things a bit better.the only thing is that even in the 80's there was more gun violence and less simple stuff like rock throwing but that little bit of innocence didn't hurt this film.i think it's a must see. you will either love or hate it but either way it makes an impact and that makes a good film that you will remember and talk about later.

my first review at imdb, after a few years of using this site constantly...anyways, saw this on the tube the other night, loved it. it's in the mindset of a dangerous minds or a substitute, but much better. was sure for a moment that rex was speedy levitch, in waking life, but after checking, it doesn't seem so.i can see why many have problems with this plot and its poetry, but i also think these people are close-minded. admittedly the ending wasn't quite what i was hoping for, but overall it was so unique and well-acted, i can't complain. i wouldn't call this cheesy, as one reviewer did, it pulled off the scene better than most films of the 80's did. and they refrained from playing any really dateable 80's music.can't remember everything that made me smile when i saw this, but basically it realistically showed very creative individuals surrounded by mediocrity, and whether i share rex's beliefs or not, i love original attempts to describe the meaning of life. and his mutant theory is, to my knowledge, original. he rambled a lot as well, but they showed how confused he was at times, and why he might have some psychological issues. and then in his moments of clarity he was a philosopher extraordinaire, a person who noticed the little details in life and tried to give expression to them.also i was very impressed with john savage as the teacher. usually actors fail at that role. he pulled it off brilliantly.if you enjoyed waking life, i say watch this movie if you get a chance.9.5/10pk

"... the beat is too strong ... we're deaf mutants now--like them", rex voorhas orminei am surprised that this movie has been uniformly bashed. let me be the first to actually discuss the virtues of "the beat" and why you must see this film now.make no mistake, this movie is cheesy and "bad" in the conventional sense: the story is preposterous, the poetry is silly, and the acting is inconsistent.but these are the film's charms--all of these ingredients form the recipe for one of the most underappreciated cheezy films of the 80's.if the reference to "deaf mutants" didn't pique your interest, then perhaps this will: what kind of name is "rex voorhas ormine", anyway? it is such an unusual name (for north american audiences) that i said to myself, "even the names of the characters in this friggin' movie are firggin' silly."well, "the beat" is so fabulously cheezy that the "meaning" and "symbolism" behind "rex voorhas ormine" is revealed not-too-subtly by bart waxman (the misguided guidance counselor you love to hate). i won't spoil the revelation behind rex's name, but please don't get too excited, o.k.?overall, the acting is inconsistent (john savage--who plays the "concerned teacher" mr. ellsworth is pretty good, as is the fellow playing bart waxman, but the rest of the cast are unconvincing). that said, the acting does not detract from the film. why? there is a sincerity in each of the actors' performances that makes the characters they play endearing. so although the performances may suck, you are still left with the impression that the actors are really trying to do their best. as a result, the actors' sincerity succeeds where their acting fails (which is quite often).the homage to "beat poetry" in this film is bad, bad, bad. but this is a good, good, good thing when it comes to entertainment. would you actually enjoy "better quality" or "more respectable" poetry--especially in a film like this?folks, that would be boring (think about the droll they made us read in high school--sanitized to avoid "corrupting the youth", politically conservative and devoid of any critical analysis, etc.) even if you don't like poetry or "arty" movies (with all of the "intellectual" posturing that implies), you most certainly can (and should) appreciate ludicrous poetry in a wannabe art film!!!! how could you not enjoy the following?"do you remember the roar of the dinosaur? a woman's scotty craps on the floor bad scotty bad, oh the woman's so sad she washes her hands and then waits by the door today, yeah--today!"yes, that is an example of some of the remarkable poetry liberally sprinkled throughout "the beat." but what about the story, you ask?well, the story is preposterous. but then again, that is the beauty of this film. apart from some cliches, stereotypes, and predictable plot points, there are enough genuinely unique elements to the plot/story to keep things interesting. who is rex? where did he come from? what the heck is he talking about? deaf mutants? illiterate angels? do billy and kate really understand what rex is saying? is the audience supposed to understand rex and his poetry posse? (i've seen the movie several times and i still haven't figured everything out.)will bad poetry and high school talent shows really end gang violence?i guarantee that you have never seen anything quite like "the beat"--a perfect combination of brilliantly bad poetry, mediocre-yet-sincere acting, and a "mythopoetics conquers gang violence" storyline that has yet to be rivalled by any film ever made.bonus for fans of classic nyc hardcore: the cro-mags make a rare film appearance as the "iron skulls" and it's a hoot to see them perform several songs. i wish they included more concert footage, but maybe that will be an "extra" included on the "collector's edition" dvd i fantasize about.

of all the major 30s star actresses, miriam hopkins has been the most bizarrely overlooked and underrated. her string of excellent 30s and 40s films is quite impressive but she is often referred to as stagy or brittle. yet she had a great sense of humor and was memorable in several comedies, including this film, old acquaintance (with bette davis), and the smiling lieutenant (with maurice chevalier and claudette colbert). hopkins was famous for her dislike of hollywood, and the results has been a bad rep--undeserved.in wise girl she play an heiress trying to rescue the children of her dead sister from their guardian--the sister's brother-in-law (ray milland). the film offers several hilarious scene such as hopkins taking a bath is a storeroom, hopkins joining milland and guinn williams in a greenwich village restaurant for $3 apiece to act as "bohemians," and hopkins going ringside during one of williams' fights. milland is also excellent and very funny.hopkins and milland make a great couple. the film also boasts solid support from williams, walter abel, henry stephenson, james finlayson, margaret dumont, grace hayle, leonid kinskey, and inez palange. the two girls are ok.but hopkins, drunk on a "slice of wine" and wearing a pinned-together dress that is twice her size is hilarious as she blows at stray hairs while smoking.... a scream.

society heiress susan fletcher (hopkins) and her wealthy father simon fletcher (henry stephenson) are vexed that their young nieces joan (betty philson) and katie (marianna strelby) are living a bohemian lifestyle in greenwich village with their artist uncle john (milland) after the death of their parents (susan's sister and john's brother). simon has given up trying to convince john to allow he and susan to take care of the children and have resorted to using private detectives to catch him in either unbecoming behavior or unemployed and therefore unable to care for the children properly. susan finally decides to take matters into her own hands and goes to greenwich village herself, posing as an actress, to try to gain information and/or persuade him to see reason. what she discovers however, is that she not only likes the free and artistic lifestyle john and his friends are living and that the girls are being brought up well, but that she is quickly falling in love with john. inevitably, her true identity is discovered and she is faced with the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate who should belong with whom.i really enjoyed this film, and found that its very short running time (70 minutes) was the perfect length to spin this simple but endearing story. miriam hopkins, one of the great 1930's-1940's actresses is delightful in this film. her energy, style and wholesome beauty really lend themselves to creating an endearing character, even though you know that she's pulling a fast one on the people she quickly befriends. this is the earliest film i've seen ray milland in, and he was actually young and non-patrician looking. (and apparently three years younger than his co-star) his energy and carefree manner in "wise girl" were a refreshing change to the demeanor he affects in his usual, darker, films. honestly, though i am usually not remotely a fan of child actors, i really enjoyed the two young girls who played susan's nieces. they were endearingly precocious, and were really the jewels of the film. unfortunately, i can't dig up any other films that either of them were subsequently in after this one, which is a shame since both exhibited a large amount of natural talent."wise girl" was a film that was made three years after the hollywood code was instated, and to some extent, this was abundantly clear by the quick, happy ending, and the pie in the sky loftiness and ease with which the characters lived. the alleged bohemian co-op was in fact a gorgeous cul-de-sac where the artists lived for free or for trade, and everything is tied up very nicely throughout. fortunately, this was a light enough film and the characters were charming enough to make allowances for its fluffiness and short-comings and i was able to just take "wise girl" for what it was; a good old-fashioned love story that was as entertaining as it was endearing. unfortunately, films of the romantic comedy/drama genre today are considerably less intelligent and entertaining, or i wouldn't find myself continuously returning to the classics. 7/10

sometimes it's hard to define what separates a successful, delightful comedy from one that falls flat. in this case, the contrived plot about a spoiled rich girl who schemes to take her nieces away from the greenwich village 'bohemian' who is raising them, only to fall for him herself, is not promising. and nothing in director leigh jason's filmography suggests that he was an overlooked major talent. and yet he must have been responsible for creating a relaxed, happy atmosphere on the set that was faithfully recorded on film.he also had the good sense to cast this movie properly. the one small flaw is miriam hopkins in a part that ginger rogers would have been perfect for. hopkins is efficient but brittle, lacking the warmth and sexiness rogers would have had. she is further hampered by a pair of bizarrely long and sooty false eyelashes that are sometimes a distraction. but a very young and very handsome ray milland couldn't be better in an exuberant, uninhibited comic performance of great charm.and better than that, particularly for new york city residents, is the hollywood depiction of greenwich village in 1937. though completely synthetic and idealized, it remains recognizable to a contemporary viewer. art director van nest polglase created an amiable jumble of mews apartments and ramshackle shared backyards that is the perfect backdrop for this picture's collection of artists, strivers, smart-alecks and wannabes. best in the supporting cast is guinn williams, bringing sweetness and light to his role as a prizefighter-sculptor-dressmaker, suggesting the self-invention and fluidity (sexual and otherwise) of life in the village. even more refreshing are betty philson and marianna strelby playing the little girls. plain, intelligent and full of humor, these girls seem like real human beings and are nothing like the professional child actors of the time.of special interest are a couple of memorable comic set-pieces: ray milland's vacuum cleaner demonstration to a woman with a howling baby is played with more spontaneity than one expects (the baby and his contortions are marvelous 'found' moments) and a phony domestic 'play' in a department store window that degenerates into a free-for-all is also fun. the movie slides slowly downhill with a straight-faced custody trial and then never quite gets back on track when the action moves to long island, but this movie is still worth a look.

i bought this a while back, during a massive martial arts movie phase. although this certainly ain't the best, i do love this kind of film making, and there was a lot to keep me entertained in this one. leung kar yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars, i always appreciate the fact that, whilst he lacked formal martial arts training, he usually gave a more than capable fighting performance. he also has a good beard. this movie has him in a good, heroic role and although he doesn't kick as much ass as in some of his other movies, he still acquits himself well. early appearances from cherie chung and chow yun fat are also nice too see, especially for the fact that chow yun fat takes on the bad guys without his trademark gun play. he may not be a great fighter but he does ok. eddy ko is as great a bad guy as ever, he performs the same villainry as in many of his other films and does it great, as per usual. the fellow who plays bu is good too, i don't recall his name, but he's in magnificent butcher too. although the fighting isn't as good as other movies of the era, the postman fights back makes up for it with a lot of imagination, quality cinematography and a nicely quirky ambiance. there are some very nifty scenes, good characters and a good eclectic mixture of hong kong talents all coming together to decent effect. all in all, i would recommend this to kung fu and general hong kong action fans. it may not be a stylised classic like the shaw brothers films, or as crowd pleasing as jackie chan or bruce lee, but it is rock solid entertainment.

i am a huge fan of the $5.50 dvd bin at my local walmart. hopefully you have one at your local branch. you can find a bunch of campy flicks, a bunch of trash, and the occasional surprise. this movie is one of the surprises. my friend recently bought this one, and in thinking it would be another cheesy kung-fu laugh riot, i was genuinely surprised at how good it was. i watch a lot of movies, and as a result, i can almost always call how a movie will turn out; and if there's a plot twist, what it will be. not this movie! the directing is brilliant, the plot is awesome, and the fighting is unbelievably inventive. if you see this one sitting around somewhere at a dirt-cheap price, get it! if you see it at full price, i would still recommend it.

freely, from one scene to another, from one story to another, just like when walking, from a shadowy path to an open place, like the wind in the leaves, from a tree to another, how many different sounds ? just like when traveling, people meet and tell their stories and then part forever, who knows ? and just like when walking through these places full of the lost expectations from another time, the human 'thickness' of the world takes the breath away.i saw this movie with friends of mine, not all of them liked it, maybe were they too used to scenario-based and ready-made stories, i don't know. so this movie is for the silly ones who love looking at the sun sparkling on the sea, walking without any hurry in the hills or through the little villages, listening to the growing grass, which tells the stories of those underneath, six feet under, in the warm wind of summer.

in august days/dies d'agost marc recha has given us a sun-saturated catalan documentary-style road movie that's mostly a meandering improvised meditation on brotherhood and reclaiming the dead. the beautiful sometimes large-scale, richly atmospheric 35 mm. landscape images, nice soundtrack and catalan-language narration are enchanting as a mood piece, if one is content with a trajectory that hasn't much momentum and doesn't lead anywhere in particular. filmmaker marc recha and his non-identical twin david are the stars and the narrative is voiced by their younger sister. marc had been researching the life of ramon barnils (1940-2001), a socialist editor who had been a family friend. he felt he was saturated with information and had to take a break. the break turned into making this film, which seeks to capture the mood of the interviews with barnils' associates, thoughts about the spanish civil war, the drought season they were experiencing, the rugged landscape, the recha brothers' affection for each other, swims and suntanned nudity and whatever characters or stories they ran into as they camped out of their van. this leads to pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. in the end david has to go back to barcelona to be with his daughter and marc has to return to his project, and there it ends. i found it fascinating to listen to an extended narration in the catalan language with its blend of spanish and french-sounding words (perhaps linked with provençal?). this isn't a major film but it commands attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing around with genres and blending autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thought-provoking way.an official selection of the 2006 new york film festival at lincoln center.

this is the fourth full-length feature film by marc recha. by the third 'les mans buides' -empty hands- i promised myself not to cut my veins anymore. but this time round the plot is completely different -a kind of homage to ramon barnils (sabadell 1940 - reus 2001) a catalan journalist-. the visuals in the trailer are stunning -a gleaming river bathed in sunlight- and the promise that marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother -none of both professional actors- convinced me at last, six weeks after its release. abandon yourself in this very unusual road/river film. learn almost nothing about ramon barnils but his most poignant legacy: his constant fight against amnesia of what we catalans chose to forget. 'la batalla de l'ebre' -look for battle of the ebro at the wikipedia- was lost not once but twice because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of half-hearted democracy nobody has done much to remember the legitimate side of the spanish civil war and those who fought it. this film is about the lonely people roaming the same places with very little conscience of what took place there 70 years ago. this film is about the landscape.

thank goodness not all dutch people are that ruthless. i think jason is being judged like that by most people, simply because he has a famous father. maybe he's not as great as some of those actors, but he's definitely not as bad as suggested. i watched the movie some years ago, and i actually loved it. i knew jason from other movies and of course robin of sherwood. but i must say i really liked his acting from this movie on. it was really good!during the movie, i actually forgot he was the son of. sean.. who?and if you're a shakespeare lover, i can recommend this movie. i'm sure you'll enjoy it!

what do you mean son of actor, not an actor. you don't become an actor just because your daddy is a superstar---it doesn't work that way, not in uk at any rate.macbeth (this version) is a low budget scottish movie. you can't compare this to the polanski version because polanski has all the budgets in the world. jason acted throughout school, but his big break came in 1985, when he landed the role of robin hood in britain's "robin of sherwood" television series. he has appeared in many films since then, including "shanghai noon" and "lord of the rings 2″. jason has since moved behind the camera, forming the production company, unconditional entertainment. he recently wrapped filming on his latest movie, which stars cuba gooding, jr. and ray winstone. and all this has nothing to do with being the son of sean connery. if you think jason said to sean, "daddy, i wanna be in macbeth movie that they are going to film," and sean said, "sure, son, whatever you say," and made a phone call and got his son the role, you are mistaken. in fact, jason connery is being cut out of his father's will. seeing as how his father is sean connery, that's a big chunk of change jason will be losing out on. the reasoning behind the decision is apparently sean's strong feelings that his only son should learn to provide for himself. the relationship has become fairly strained, with jason even threatening to change his name. ------------------------------------ of being the son of sean connery,"i realize that i'm always going to be compared to my father. there are innuendos all the time. should i spend my whole life justifying myself?" ------------------------------------so stop being a jackass and accuse him of not being able to act just because he is son of sean connery (big deal!).watch jason in bullet to beijing and you'll form a different opinion about his acting ability.

every review i have read so far seems to have missed a crucial point. shakespeare wrote for the accent and the pronunciation just as he did for northerners in other plays. the scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and affects profoundly what is said and the way it is taken. so, listen again and note the difference. the play is well done and the rhythm of the words are so much better than that provided by people using received, polite, well- enunciated english. i am reminded of the time a teacher in a school in leicester, unknowingly, asked me, age 14, to read a piece of walter scott which was written in the tone of the border. i come from the border and when i read it as it should be read it made all the difference.

excellent performance. there still are good actors around! also great directing and photography. very true to shakespear, and a 'must' for all shakespear fans. macbeth (jason connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)he gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting. helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil. if you love death and decay, and shakespears lyrics... this is the one.

what about dj cash money??? this film fails in part by not covering the mid to late 80s. there was only a small mention of dj cheese in 86.also, it's grandmixer "dst", not "dxt"!!!!!

...scratch it. just as african's created rhythms with the jawbone of an ass and virgin islanders welded oil drums into ear pleasing steel bands, so did urban dj's itch to scratch in the pursuit of new methods of creative expression. "scratch" is a wholly unnarrated documentary which will take you to the heart of the hip-hop/rap movement and explore the genesis of turntablism, the art of scratching vinyl, and the ultimate dj/mc contempo entertainment expression. the film reveals some surprisingly intelligent and articulate "scratchers" with startlingly unique abilities in concert and competition where the beat meets the street. good stuff for anyone interested in grass roots or ghetto gutter movements in sound art. (b)

just saw this film at resfest and was floored. i've never been a huge fan of scratching, but this film had me hooked from the getgo. it's listed as a documentary, but never really felt like one. (can't remember the last time i had so much fun watching a documentary). it has a style and an energy that is refreshing, insightful, and never too preachy. the production values were up there too. (shot on film with cool cuts and an amazing soundtrack). overall a smart, entertaining, and enlightening piece.

wow - most of the audience just seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary at the sheer wizardry displayed on screen.the shift from the early days as a new-york based black-american phenomenon to current days as a racially diverse subculture (and largely west coast-based) is profiled well.the humble turntable is not given the respect of any traditional musical instrument, but it can be so much more versatile and technically complex. these djs take the required skills for any musical instrument - dexterity, rhythm and timing, among others - and apply them to a new technology with several more variables.dj qbert's comment that he pictures what "music" must sound like on advanced planets and then works it out, seemingly silly at first, makes more and more sense as you watch these guys go and spit out a multitude of sounds that no single traditional instrument could ever create!some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain 'stars' and squanders an opportunity to profile the wider hip-hop culture. one film at a time people!

this film is essentially for those who have had little or no introduction to hip-hop, specifically turntableism, as was the case with the director before he started this film. it was cool to have it focus on the bay more than expected, because ny is always getting all the credit, but comin from the bay the q-bert worship is a little out of control. this film didn't introduce anything new to me, but it did change my opinion in that going into it i was sketchy about the prospect of giving the tables the distinction of being a bona fide instrument. this film ought to convince anyone that it's right up there with the viola and clavichord.

wonderfully funny, awe-inspiring feature on the pioneers of turntablism. dj shadow and q-bert are amazing in this terrific documentary. check out just about every major dj crediting their getting in to scratch thanks to herbie hancock's post-bop classic 'rockit', and archival footage of some of the most complex and mind-blowing turntable routines of all time.

scratch is a documentary about djs and their art of scratching. from that one line description of the film you would have no idea how entertaining and educational this little film is. it is a joyous and vibrant celebration of a cool subculture which is little known. it's filled with great underground hip hop music and you get to see some top djs (e.g. dj q-bert, dj shadow, and mix master mike from the beastie boys) showing off their stuff. going into the film i wasn't sure that "scratching" can really be called an art form, or that the turntable can be viewed as an instrument in its own right. scratch completely changed my mind on these points. what these guys do with their turntables is truly amazing--it is definitely some kind of art--and the turntable, if you know how to use it, can be transformed into an instrument that you can "play," as much as a drum or a guitar. and you even get a lesson on the basics of scratching from dj q-bert (e.g. how to use the fader to get different sound effects). all these djs in their own way were inspired to take up the art of scratching after watching herbie hancock perform his song "rock it" (you remember that song, don't you?) live at the grammys. what got their attention was not hancock himself but his dj and his scratching. not only is scratch about scratching, but it does some "scratching" of its own thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is shot and edited. there are moments where clips are quickly "rewound" and then "forwarded" several times, which mirrors (in the film medium) what happens when a dj quickly moves the record on his turntable back and forth while using his fader (that "wicka-wicka-wicka" sound). whether you're a fan of hip hop or not, you can count on scratch to give you a very enjoyable night at the movies. after seeing it, i had an itch to go buy a turntable of my own. and i mean this as a compliment.

being a huge fan of hip-hop and turntablism to begin with, i always knew i would like this film. however, i wasn't prepared for just how good the documentary actually is. it covers almost all the important aspects of the only element of hip-hop which has been there from the very start. the "story" begins in the early 70's, and follows the evolution of turntablism as an art from up until early 2000 (turntablism aficionados will point this out as significant).the editing is nigh on perfect throughout the film. aside from the excellent visual "scratch" techniques which they used, the rapid cutting between interviews and the stock footage is excellent, giving the film pace when it is needed. the sound editing is also very good, with some nice sweeping sounds being used to help with transitions.the absence of a narrator was also welcome. we aren't taken by the hand through the story, and as a result the audience is able to make their own assumptions easier. each dj adds another side to the story, and it is so interesting to hear about the unknown stars of hip-hop, especially those who were there when hip-hop was being shunned left, right and centre by the music business.although there are many excellent things about this film, i do have a few gripes. the biggest of these is the absence of several notable djs, such as ca$hmoney and jazzy jeff, and also djs from outside america, such as scratch perverts and dj noise. however, if you watch the commentary on the dvd (something which i highly recommend), producer and director go in to great depth about how they regret not being able to feature them. the deleted scenes contain many interviews with ca$hmoney, jazzy jeff and the scratch perverts.this is definitely the best documentary i've seen on hip-hop culture and music. it does stop short of showing the true potential of turntablism; for that i highly recommend checking out the dmc and itf videos. however, that is a minor quibble. i highly recommend this movie, not least for the phat soundtrack, with excellent music throughout. (9/10)

the omission of jazzy jeff, the creator of the chirp and transformer scratch, raised a few eyebrows, but it's good to see he made it to the extras of the dvd after all. with scratch, doug pray, who previously chronicled the grunge phenomenon of the '90s in hype (1996), made an excellent documentary about the world of the hip-hop dj and the evolution of turntablism. his latest documentary, infamy (2005), explores contemporary american graffiti culture. after a couple of viewings four years ago, my dvd had been gathering dust ever since, but recently i watched it again and besides the subject material, i was surprised how well-shot and edited this documentary actually is. an immensely enjoyable soundtrack as well and not just talking heads, but lots of music, old school footage, parties, break dancing, you name it. one of the best things about the film, is that it mainly examines where the art of turntablism is today (in 2001 that is), without disregarding the pioneers of course. good stuff.camera obscura --- 8/10

this is the first american film i have seen at this year and i think it will be the greatest one because of the feeling . as a teenage singer in america,aaron is not as pop as before,most americans i met said his song is fake and that he even didn't know how to rap.but attention,everyone,he is a kid,how many people can understand him.being a pop fan is difficult,and being a pop star is more difficult.i think this time aaron(jd) has shows something real to us.and i think people should learn to understand each other. at another hand,i like the music in the film very much.i remember the first song appeared in the film is "saturday night" and it also include some aaron's real live show,and the second one is "one better",so i think if you enjoy this film,maybe you'll be a pop fan,too. at last,i hope you will have a great time^^ a voice from a chinese boy.

i love aaron carter but even i expected pop star to be predictable, but i was so wrong! aaron carter was really funny in it and a great actor! also the actress who played jane was a brilliant actress! every one who i no who watched it loved it!the music in it was also really good!the my favourite lines from the film is "you cant send me to a public school mom! im a celebridee!!" and "take your time, it'l come to you!"although the endings kind of cheesy,all the good chick flicks do! this film is great, and a proper good chick flick, that i can watch over and over again!

this is an outstanding criminal thriller, and with a great cast too. spanish language cinema's best and most popular actors of the past couple of decades, victoria abril and federico luppi, team up in one of the better spanish language crime thrillers of 2004-5.the film begins by focusing on thirty something ernesto (ernesto alterio), an elegant, attractive and slick thief who learned from childhood friend gitano, and more recently from manco, an old seasoned swindler. manco introduces ernesto to federico (federico luppi), an also elegant, but more astute & experienced methodical thief - the best in his class.federico's only known weakness is pilar (victoria abril), his former mistress and partner. she suddenly appears and proposes a fabulous rip-off scheme to her former lover, a crime in grand scale, which will eventually require the help of ernesto, manco and gitano, among others.the script is full of twists and surprising reversals, particularly towards the end of the film. one criticism about the film i've heard a lot is that there are too many plot twists towards the end, but i disagree. the film captivates the audience so much that all the unexpected events are not too much to follow. in fact, these are what make the film outstanding. i highly recommend it.

i used to watch this too at junior school in petersfield hampshire around 1975. the odd thing is that from time to time i still think about it (i am now 40) the big question running through out the length of the series (no idea how many episodes 6??)was the identity of the person riding the motorcycle !'i've ask friends in the past about this series and they have no idea what i'm talking about and think its some kind of weird dream i've had. i've never understood to this day the educational benefit of this but thought at the time it was great but slightly scary. i seem to remember that there used to be a break of some sort in the middle of each episode. no idea why. would love to see it again. got hold of a short clip via the bbc cult website.

to regard the film as nothing more than a documentary about skateboarding would fail to recognize several important aspects of dogtown. peralta (a well- known skateboarding figure himself) has crafted a film that not only deals with the birth of what we know today as skateboarding, but also examines the socio- cultural and economic circumstances in which this sport emerged and gained wide appeal. in addition, his film is rather personal: peralta's first-hand association with this cultural phenomenon serves as both the informed cinematic investigator and the involved participant-subject. in this role, he is a quintessential "participant-observer," while gathering together a wide array of personalities whom were integral to this movement and those who were profoundly affected by the advent of skateboarding as a competitive sport and subculture. the film employs a uniquely stylistic form of film and sound editing, and the narration (by sean penn) and interviews adopt a rather genuine, unrehearsed form that is akin with the anarchic, nihilistic spirit of sidewalk surfing. the film exhibits the kinetic appeal of a protracted sporting, music video tempered with an archaeologist's sensitivity to the importance of time, place, and circumstance.

not only was this film exhilarating, but it took me back down memory lane with its true to life sound track. these were the things we were saying, and doing...these were the songs we were listening to...all during this same time period, in the same era, way down south in alabama. i may not have been one of the skateboard set, but i was definitely one of the observers, sitting on the curb with the old transistor radio, listening to neil young, watching those more brave than i ever hoped to be, as they put the spin on their surfboards on wheels, applying the tricks of alva and adams, hoping that maybe, just maybe for a brief moment, they'd adopt the zephyr style. it just goes to show how much alike we all were during those wonderful days. ~ klj

shame represents a high point in the career of a master. ingmar bergman penetrating, existential study of a couple on the island of gotland dealing with surviving a long war. liv ullman and max von sydow give painfully detailed performances in this spare, stark drama. the films intensity rests in bergman's keeping our focus on the minute, intimate relations of his two characters - both accomplished musicians - trapped in a landscape they have ceased to understand. we see the way the external pressures of the war complicate and corrode their relationship. both characters are forced by the material circumstances of the war to betray their own sense of ethics. in one of the most powerful episodes bergman forces us to reflect on the manipulative power of the cinematic medium by showing us a filmed interview with ullman's character that has been re-edited and distorted for political effect by one side of the conflict and is used by the other side as evidence of war crimes in a brutal interrogation scene.

a very credible and unsettling movie portraying the effects of war on the general public, shame gives us a chilling understanding oh ingmar bergman's beliefs. the absence of color and sound (as in a soundtrack) helps to give the film a more realistic feeling. there is no soft or hard lighting or a variety of camera angles to give the story a charming or dramatic effect. everything is very simply portrayed as it would be in reality. at times the storyline was confusing, but perhaps in order to give a sense of the characters' frame of mind  how they too do now know what is happening or why. the simplicity of the film made it somewhat boring, but i could understand how the director is trying not to glamorize the story and points. he depicted the harsh and unsettling events and effects of war. in the beginning the characters were introduced and shown as content with the lighter settings and very long, drawn-out shots. when all of a sudden the war struck upon them, they were much darker and quiet with less intimate shots. bergman did a good job on allowing us to be consumed by the war ourselves and presenting an image of it the so adequately corresponded to war. although the storyline itself was not too impressive, the content of the film was.

extremely pinching vision of a war situation where the couple from vargtimmen (ok, they have different names and initial situations, but the actors are the same) gets caught in the crossfire of two fronts. the depiction of the fighting parties as faceless, superordinate authorities are often captured in sublime surreal pictures and draws interesting parallels to orwell's 1984, even if bergman thwarts this context on a personal level of a slowly burgeoning conjugal war. that is why countless fundamental and philosophical questions towards eva's and jan's marriage are relevant and essential, while the threat and danger from the outside tears open an abyss in the inside which was toilsomely covered with lambencies before. an intense allegory on the fragile facades of civic conventions.

this begrudging and angry film is against not just the war during which it was made, but all war. it doesn't care what war it is. it might be the most emotionally involving experience i have ever had with ingmar bergman's work. there are no sides to the two main characters in this impacting drama, which doesn't intimate a point in any ceremonial symbolism as per bergman's usual, but plainly showcases people and their lives and exercises what bergman has already proved he understands about a person's reaction to a movie.his top-drawer regulars liv ullmann and max von sydow play an internalizing but bickering married couple who were once orchestra musicians. now they live in a weathered farm house on an island. part of the building frustration we grow to share with these two people fertilizes in the detail that nothing in their house seems to work. they are not reclusive intellectuals, either. they are a rather familiar marriage that has more or less resigned from life and is essentially apolitical; they only get wind of distant rumors of a war that has been going on forever. ullmann is concerned with the danger to their lives and to her desire to bear children. her husband von sydow shrugs off that the war will pass them by. their serenity is interrupted by screaming fighter planes flying low over their house, the killing of a parachuting airman, the arrival of dubious troops, their inquisition, and eventually their capture by what appears to be the local side, but loyalties have long since splintered. they are sent back to their home, witness gratuitous destruction and suffer the vindictive consequences of such an agonizingly distrustful marriage. this, one of my top favorite bergman efforts, is a study of a couple jarred from their safely self-unaware lives and violated by a manipulative despair, testing them both to reveal who they really are. she lacks compassion to some extent, too self-serving and restless to have any patience for his capricious breakdowns into crying. his suppressed emotional issues have led to the repression of the very initiative and excitement that attracted them to begin with. the immense last twenty minutes, sporadically interrupted by images of the overwhelming gray sky, are among the closest to real emotion that bergman ever filmed.all systems of dogma and faith are the antagonists in this very essential and downbeat portrait. the basically clearcut personalities of ullmann and von sydow's characters are hurled into the degenerate world of war because they are accused of being "sympathizers," but the film, shot on bergman's small home island of faro, doesn't give any information about where or when it's set, who the two sides are, and for what they're fighting. to an uninvolved civilian caught in between, the knowledge base is likely to be quite similar.ullmann and von sydow are not sympathizers for the apparent enemy, but they're partisans for who are apparently their side. this 1968 reactive allegory could be about the common noncombatant citizens of iraq, or kosovo, or vietnam, or israel, or palestine, or...

ingmar bergman's meditation on war concerns a couple living an idyllic existence on a small island off the coast (of what country isn't specified). raging off in the distance is a war they know only from news reports. as they go about their day the war comes to them and it soon becomes a struggle for survival as both sides seem not to care about them. bleak look at the human cost of war and those not readily engaged in battle but caught in the cross fire none the less. its a movie ahead of its time as some 40 years since it was made the notion of armies at war where most of the casualties are the civilians have come of age. this is a dark disturbing film that is told from the average person's point of view with the complete sense of hopeless and confusion best expressed in the thought that kept running through my head, "what do i do now?". as an intellectual exercise the film is top notch, this is a film that will make you think. as an emotional film it is touching but never fully moving. i was never moved emotionally even as the horror of the situation made my brain do flip flops. (i should state that i admire bergman intellectually for the ideas that he brings to the table, however i have never been moved by his films. i am not a "fan". i always sided with fellini in the old film class argument as to who was better since he had more emotion to his films). reservations aside this is require viewing especially since we live in a world were war, for most of us, is just a thing on a tv screen.

bergman's regular max von sydow and liv ullmann starred as a village couple, jan and eva rosenberg. the story began with an ordinary couple who fights and make up. jan was a sensitive person, but an escapist who isolated himself from the world. eva is a practical woman who is getting fed up with her husband's lack of ambition. because jan procrastinating in fixing their radio, the are oblivious of the impending war. of course the war arrived, and the movie was a fascinating study of their transformation of each other and to each other through the invasion as they were mistreated by the enemy and by their own government.there were no musical score to the movie, but the soundtrack was the war noise. in one scene the pulsating background gun shot, the explosion, and sound of the fly by planes was incredible. now and then, bergman zoomed into the facial expression as different event took places. when something violent happened, he zoomed out to let the audience sensed the violence rather than seeing up close. very well done movie.

this film offers one of the greatest experiences available to movie-goers. it is by no means a pleasant film, but offers realities and emotions the human mind may never have meant to touch upon. it opens pathways in how an individual thinks, and afterwards will change the person forever. the first time i saw this film was in class, and immediately after seeing it i had to skip my next class and walk around campus in order to reset my body and mind. i felt devastated and, somehow unreal, as if i didn't exist. it was only a few months later that i was telling one of my friends about shame, and she asked, "oh, is that when you were messed up after seeing it, and ran into me talking all strange about it?" i didn't even remember running into or talking to anyone at all while outside that day, i was astonished. in plot terms it is the simple tale of a couple torn apart by war. there suffering is greater than that of the dead and by the end...there are no words to complete the image that bergman creates. its like a horrible dream which causes you to wake, altering your own reality forever. this film must be seen.

what bergman has got here is "what if all that bad stuff happened here in sweden, to nice people like us?" and what he gives us, in the swedish language, with swedish actors, on swedish locations (and using what appear to be genuine swedish military vehicles) is what was familiar from war films set in almost every other country in europe-- all the confusing invasions and counter-invasions, political lies, internment camps, faked confessions, summary executions, torture, turncoats, "collaborators", and so on. as in a modern short story, it's done in the abstract, with no real names, cities, or countries used. but the stronger faction are "nazis": they strut about self-importantly, and some wear shiny knee boots. one even whips things with a riding crop (ok, it's actually a cane). the victimized couple are named rosenberg. apart from the shame they feel at finding dirtier ways to survive-- and who would not do what they did?-- what all of the above suggests is that the title is clearly meant to refer to stockholm's de facto complicity with the nazis. indeed, what we are shown is what sweden might have looked like if germany had asked for a bit more than mining concessions.the first half plays like a black comedy. we see the "fog of war" from the point of view of a comically passive couple who ignore the troops all around, the long convoys, the bombed-out buildings, the news reports, &c. they do not even bother to find a working radio. they are the ultimate in "not in my backyard". they talk of wine and lingonberries; meanwhile friends are mysteriously conscripted and growing numbers of troops show up in the town. they show no curiosity about the war that has been going on around them for many years.the man (von sydow) is cultured, sulky, and a navel-gazer; the woman (ullman) is somewhat more impulsive, passionate, and outward-looking. there's a beautiful scene in which the man talks about his violin: the manufacturer, he says offhandedly, fought in the napoleonic wars, but his own interest stops with the cultural artifact in his hand-- or, more precisely, which his own warm feelings about owning it, and the security that that ownership assumes. not in my backyard! but when war finally breaks into their bucolic idyll, the man's timidity, an irritation in good times, turns into a liability, one he ends up overcompensating for-- as is often the case-- as bergman demonstrates subtly and beautifully. definitely worth seeing.

this is one of the bleakest, the most harrowing of bergman's films i've seen. i also think this is one of the most powerful films about the ugliness of war and what it does to the human souls.the couple of musicians, who left a big city for a remote island and make a living as farmers, find themselves capable of unspeakable and shameful acts that would have ordinarily been impossible for them even imagine, as they struggle to survive horrible reality of war. they betray their souls, their friends and even each other in a desperate attempt to simply survive another day. liv ullmann and max von sydow are brilliant as usual as lost, confused, and terrified couple that got caught in the midst of a civil war.9.5/10

the apolitical musicians eva (liv ullmann) and jan rosenberg (max von sydow) have been married for seven years and live in a small farm in a remote island to escape from a civil war in the continent. they provide lingenberry to a couple of costumers to raise some money and buy some supplies. they love each other and eva is twenty years old and wants to have a baby but the reluctant jan, who is a weak and sensitive man, does not want to have children. when the rebels arrive in the island, their peaceful and calm lives turn to hell, and they get in the middle of accusations from both sides. when colonel jacobi (gunnar björnstrand) stalks eva, jan changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man, and the love and affection they feel for each other change to hatred and indifference."shame" is an antiwar movie by the master ingmar bergman focused by the eyes of a couple of artists that are apolitical and does not listen to the news, but when the war arrives to their lands, they have their love, friendship and affection destroyed by the senseless soldiers. liv ullmann and max von sydow have top-notch performances as usual and i do not recall seeing the breast of liv ullmann in any other movie. the process of brutalization of the pacific and sensitive jan rosenberg by the war is impressive and the bleak open conclusion is pessimist and adequate to the dramatic story. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "vergonha" ("shame")

i watched this movie on a big screen a few months ago. i didn't know what to expect precisely, and for the first ten minutes i feared i might not enjoy this film. it was beginning very slowly, in silence and almost banality, which was all the less exciting as the sound was quite bad and the subtitles sometimes impossible to read.but i definitely do not regret to have gone on watching it. it is one of the most beautiful bergman movies i've ever seen, at the same time human, ruthless and psychologically so convincing.seldom have i seen actors play so wonderfully, with such an intensity on their faces : liv ullman's interpretation is unforgettable and sydow is excellent too.there is always psychological violence in bergman movies, and this one may be the most physically violent of them all. the strained relationships between the man and the woman evolve in parallel with the physical violence that is surrounding them...finally, this sober, violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly striking human depth. an excellent bergman.

lifeforce was one of cannon films' biggest flops. it received mostly bad reviews and did nothing to help director tobe hooper's career in the wake of the spielberg/poltergeist controversy. all of this is unfortunate, because lifeforce is actually a really great movie. it is supremely entertaining, moves along at a fast pace and features some of the most outrageously over-the-top direction, production, performances and special effects ever to explode across the screen! it must have looked bizarre on paper: the producers of the delta force, the screenwriter of alien, the director of the texas chainsaw massacre, the composer of breakfast at tiffany's, the special effects wizards of star wars... audiences were not ready for this demented exercise in weirdness.what more do you want??? we got an alien spaceship full of giant bats! we got a sexy, naked space vampiress sucking out people's souls! we got exploding bodies! we got zombies! we got possession! we got an s&m interrogation! we got the entire city of london on fire! it's dracula meets night of the living dead meets quartermass and the pit meets earthquake. it's quite possibly the single most outrageous horror/sci-fi/comedy/action/disaster/erotic/apocalyptic epic ever unleashed, that is, if there are any other ones out there.try watching this movie while chemically altered. perhaps then you'll understand. a genuinely f***ed up experience, and one of director tobe hooper's most underrated movies. maybe one day, it will find its audience.

danny boyle was not the first person to realise that zombies can run like the clappers. that honour belongs to lifeforce, which is, of course, the greatest naked space vampire zombies from halley's comet running amok in london end-of-the-world movie ever made. tobe hooper may have made a lot of crap, but for this deliriously demented epic sci-fi horror he deserves a place among the immortals. plus it offers space vampire mathilda may, the best thing to come out of france since simone simon, spending the entire movie naked. which she does very, very well. just bear in mind that while she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence anyone on earth has ever encountered, she's also "totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous." it's a pitch meeting i'd have loved to have sat in on: astronauts from the british space program find three naked humanoid alien life forms inside a giant 150-mile long artichoke/umbrella shaped spaceship hidden in the tail of halley's comet filled with giant desiccated bats and bring them back to earth with near apocalyptic results as they proceed to drain the population of london of their lifeforce amid much nudity, whirlpools of thunder and spit your coffee across the room direlogue ("i've been in space for six months, and she looks perfect to me." "assume we know nothing, which is understating the matter." "don't worry, a naked woman is not going to get out of this complex."). oh, and we'll get the writers of alien and blue thunder to write it with uncredited rewrites by the writer of mark of the devil, the sex thief and eskimo nell and the director of the jonestown monster. sounds like a winner, here's $22m  have fun. and they do, they do.true, there's enough promise in the raw material to have made something genuinely creepy and thought-provoking (at a time when aids hysteria was approaching its height, a sexually transmitted 'plague' offers ample opportunity for allegory), but in the hands of the go-go boys at cannon, what could have been another quatermass and the pit quickly turns instead to be more plan 10 from outer space. it's full-to-bursting with delirious inanity, be it frank finlay's hilarious death scene ("here i go!"), peter firth's grand entrance ("i'm colonel caine." "from the sas?" discreetly shouts michael gothard across a room full of reporters: "gentlemen, that last remark was not for publication. this is a d-notice situation" he replies to the surprisingly obliging pressmen), the security guards offering mathilda may's naked space vampire a nice biscuit to stop her escaping, reanimated bodies exploding into dust all over people, the sweaty prime minister sucking the life out of his secretary and london filling up with zombie nuns, stockbrokers and joggers as the city gets its most comprehensive on screen trashing since mrs gorgo lost junior at battersea funfair and went on the rampage. and that's not mentioning the "this woman is a masochist! an extreme masochist!" scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the male vampire's "it'll be a lot less terrifying if you just come to me" line while a lead-stake wielding peter firth adopts his best action man voice to reply "i'll do just that!" in one scene alone you have a possessed patrick stewart embodying the female in our deeply confused astronaut hero's mind, steve "i-never-got-over-playing-charlie-manson" railsback and his amazing dancing eyebrows in full-on "helta-skelta!" mode trying to resist the temptation to kiss him, the inimitable aubrey morris (the only man who makes freddie jones look restrained) playing the home secretary sir percy heseltine as a kind of demented brian rix, peter firth (one of those actors who always looks like he must have been a doctor who around the time no-one was watching it anymore) hamming up the blasé public school macho in the hope that no-one will ever see it and the peerless reaction shots of john hallam as the male nurse who keeps on opening the door mid-psychic-tornado to bring in more drugs. as if they needed any more in this film. it's just a shame that frank finlay's mad-haired scientist who isn't qualified to certify death on alien life forms (a role originally intended for klaus kinski) missed out on the action in that one.no matter how mad you think the film is, it still manages to get madder still, whether it be a zombie pathologist ("he too needs feeding") exploding all over the home secretary's suit, patrick stewart's blood and entrails forming a naked mathilda may or the space vampires turning st paul's cathedral into the world's biggest laser-show to transport human souls from the london underground to their geostationary mother ship. i loved every gloriously insane moment. in it's own truly unique way, this might be the greatest film ever made.the dvd offers the original 116-minute version that opened in the uk rather than the heavily edited 101-minute us version, which not only offers much more hilarity for your dollar, but also fully restores henry mancini's score to its original glory (the us version covered a lot of the gaps with additional cues by michael kamen and james guthrie). although a somewhat surprising choice at first sight, mancini cut his teeth on many of the classic universal sci-fi horrors of the 50s and his score is quite superb, with a terrific driving main title that offers a rare reminder of just how interesting he could be away from blake edwards. sadly there's no more than a trailer by way of extras, though it would be nice to hope some day for a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from hooper's originally intended 128-minute cut: from what's on display here, these might just offer even more comedy gold!

though it hardly compares to other sci-fi film giants like 2001: a space odyssey or close encounters of the third kind, lifeforce does work as a totally berserk and bizarre melding of science fiction and horror elements. somehow, despite dialogue that approaches the ridiculous and acting that does the same, it manages to work because of a few highly different elements.loosely based on colin wilson's 1976 novel "the space vampires", this film from director tobe hooper (poltergeist; the texas chainsaw massacre) focuses on a joint us-british mission aboard the british space shuttle churchill to study halley's comet. led by an american commander (steve railsback), they discover an alien spacecraft in the comet's coma. and when they investigate the interior of the spacecraft, they find alien occupants that look like giant bats. later on, the churchill reaches earth's orbit, but no response is given from radio calls issued from the mission's home base, the space research center in london. columbia is launched to rendezvous with churchill, but they find the entire ship gutted by fire--all except for the alien beings encased in glass who, far from being untouched by the fire, look absolutely perfect. the aliens are bought back to earth...and that's where the incredible happens.these space vampires escape from the space research center and, instead of draining their victims of blood via bite wounds, suck their victims' lifeforce totally out of them. one of them is the space girl, a thoroughly nude vampiress played by mathilda may. railsback, the only actual survivor from churchill, is bought in by the src's chief (frank finlay) and a british special agent (peter firth) to track may, who is in telepathic contact with him. pretty soon, however, the vampires have turned london into a scene of pure holocaust; people are either being dessicated or turning into zombies, and the threat by nato to sterilize the city with thermonuclear radiation looms large. railsback finally catches up with may, and sacrifices himself by impaling her with a large metal sabre.undoubtedly disjointed, unquestionably uneven, but nevertheless worth watching, lifeforce, despite the frequent incoherency of its script and its acting, benefits from some drop-dead excellent special effects work by john dykstra (star wars), some of the best ever seen. the other working element, and a surprise one it is, is the incredible orchestral score by henry mancini, almost wagnerian in the same way john williams' score for star wars was--and mancini, like williams before him, uses the london symphony orchestra, to boot!largely forgotten these days, and a critical and box office disaster in 1985, lifeforce, if for no other reason, should still be seen for anyone with a taste for the bizarre. there had never been a film quite like it before, and there will certainly not be anything like it again.

like several other reviewers here, i'm surprised to see many negative reviews on this film. dan o'bannon's previous effort was the groundbreaking 'alien' of 1979. because it and 'star wars' introduced the stylistic approach of 'used' or 'dirty space' in art-direction for these kinds of features doesn't mean that this was the only way to produce them.rather than dismiss 'lifeforce' out-of-hand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature, it's important to recognize that the film draws upon the 'esteemed' traditions of british horror and science-fiction - specifically hammer and american international features like quatermass (specifically 'quatermass and the pit', 1967), doctor who and 'the day of the triffids' (1963), if not the works of gerry anderson ('ufo', 'space:1999' and 'thunderbirds'). but none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer o'bannon's genre-scholarly appreciation for 'queen of blood'(1966) and 'it! the terror from beyond space'(1958) - the immediate sources for 'alien' (1979).granted this film has some 'legacy' elements, but perhaps it's worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers - 1981's 'an american werewolf in london' and 'the company of wolves' (1984) - other 80's films that share a 'looking-back' while they adapt those stories to the 80's zeitgeist. all three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same, but substantially sexed-up their themes (because they could), and, at the same time they recognized the tongue-in-cheek, humorous aspects of their projects.neil jordan's 'wolves' played to many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around at the during the '80's, while 'american werewolf' curdled its theme as a 'coming-of-age' film. it's called artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latter-day dramedy inherent in the 'scream' franchise, 'i know what you did last summer' and 'final destination'. but these teen-targeted, films seem to be part of a box-office trend, whereas the 80's films like 'lifeforce' belong a canon of british sci-fi - even if this one was written by an american.in many ways this film holds up much better than latter-day disaster and alien-invasion flicks ('independence day', 'armageddon', 'deep impact') in that the 'solutions' don't reside in gun-battles, weaponized payloads and testosterone. at the opposite end of the pole, it is unfortunate that steven soderbergh and james cameron didn't examine tarkowski and lem more closely before they remade 'solaris'...the goal of this film was fun, not ponderousness or stupidity.7/10

** and 1/2 stars out of **** lifeforce is one of the strangest films i've ever seen, so ridiculous, yet at the time it's strangely compelling and never the least bit dull. whether it's due to the nonstop nudity, the large amount of violence and action, it all comes together to make an entertaining 2 hours of cinema.the spaceshuttle churchill has been sent to investigate halley's comet when they detect something hiding inside the coma of the giant rock. a small team, led by colonel carlsen (steve railsback), has been sent to search the area. what they discover includes hundreds of frozen bat-like creatures and three nude and seemingly unconscious humanoid beings inside strange crystalline containers, two male and one female (mathilda may). they decide to take all three back with them, which results in a catastrophe.when london receives no response from the crew, another crew is sent to find out what's going on. when they dock with the churchill, they find the remains of the crew, all dessicated beyond recognition. the humanoids are still in perfect condition, and they take them back to london.after various tests, the scientists still don't know what these beings really are. then, late one night, a security guard in the compound feels compelled to enter the room the female is being held. he touches her shoulder, and she awakens, stands up, and smiles at him in a seductive and wicked manner. she approaches him, and begins to kiss him, when it becomes clear that she's actually taking his lifeforce, sucking him of all of his energy (the effect is slightly cheesy).she escapes from the compound and begins to leave a trail behind. another man, colonel caine (peter firth), is brought in to track her down. then the men discover that there is a pattern to the lifeforce process. the corpse of the security guard awakens in 2 hours, and takes the lifeforce of a doctor. it seems in every 2 hours, this process is repeated by a victim. with the help of the churchill's sole survivor, carlsen, they attempt to track the girl down before it's too late.lifeforce is pretty good late night entertainment. it has all the elements one could look for in such a movie, loads of nudity, blood/gore, and plenty of special effects. this is certainly better than a similarly plotted film, species, thanks in large part to a more riveting finale.the performances range from decent to terrible. faring the worst is easily steve railsback, who overacts to no end. much better are peter firth, who comes through and convincingly, and the gorgeous mathilda may (she's as beautiful as french actresses sophie marceau and emmanuelle seigner). may does go through virtually the whole role without wearing clothing, and there were reports that it was hard on her while filming, so the fact that she is able to go through every scene without fidgeting and looking uncomfortable is impressive. there are times when she can be quite creepy, being simply seductive. most of the film manages to work because of her.

daisy movie review by james mudge from beyondhollywood.comon paper, "daisy" sounds like an asian film fan's dream come true, directed by "infernal affairs" co-helmer andrew lau and starring everybody's favourite sassy girl, popular korean actress jeon ji hyun. unfortunately, despite the talent involved, and the fact that the crew flew halfway around the world to shoot in amsterdam , the film turns out to be a bit of a disappointment, being a clich'd romantic drama which wallows in misery and self importance.the plot follows hye young (jeon ji hyun), a rather naive korean girl who lives in amsterdam , spending her life working in her grandfather's antique shop and doing portraits for tourists. one day, she begins receiving flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer, who she believes to be a mystery man from her past who once built her a nice little bridge. one day she meets jeong woo (lee seong jae, also in "holiday" and "public enemy"), who unbeknownst to her is actually an interpol agent tracking asian criminals in the netherlands .with hye young assuming that jeong woo is responsible for the flowers, the two fall very slowly into a chaste romantic relationship. however, it turns out that the man sending the flowers is actually park yi (jung woo sung, from "sad movie" and "musa"), an assassin working for a chinese crime syndicate. inevitably, the love triangle turns tragic and the two men end up facing off while poor hye young tries to work out which of the two is the love of her life.although "daisy" is ostensibly a love story, it has the feel of a funeral, with a slow, sombre pace and a plot which piles on the misery. half of the film's running time is taken up with scenes of the characters staring longingly out of windows into the rain, with the silence broken only by bouts of self pitying narration. director lau seems to be under the impression that the film is a weighty shakespearean tragedy, rather than yet another gloomy hit-man love story. as such, the proceedings have a rather pretentious air, despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and based largely around glaring cliché borrowed liberally from the likes of "fulltime killer" and john woo's classic "the killer".almost every aspect of the film is riddled with angst, with the three lead characters suffering as if the weight of the world was on their shoulders, and steadfastly refusing to do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations. park yi in particular, as the kind of overly emotional, socially retarded assassin so beloved of modern cinema, is faintly ludicrous, from his blatant incompetence on the job to his hilarious attempts to discuss impressionist painting with hye young or his penchant for flower growing. this languid passivity does make the film's central romance somewhat hard to swallow, and lau's attempts to evoke the feeling that it is fate which brings the characters together comes across more as shoddy coincidence.fans of jeon ji hyun should note that her character is far closer to her role in the glum supernatural drama "the uninvited" than "my sassy girl" or "windstruck", and while she tries her best to pull a few wacky faces here and there, her performance is certainly more subdued.the film benefits from glossy production values, and lau makes good use of the amsterdam scenery, playing on the contrast between the grey, almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue skies and flowery fields of the countryside. unfortunately, he tends to overuse slow motion for some of the emotional scenes, which when coupled with some of the picture postcard visuals gives the film the feel at times of a perfume advert. there are a few scenes of surprisingly violent action, though these are few and far between, and whilst well staged, seem to have been thrown in as an afterthought and do little more than briefly raising the pulse.despite its flaws, "daisy" makes for engaging viewing, and the story grips almost in spite of itself, mainly out of a morbid fascination to see not which of the men hye young will end up with, but to see who will lie dying in her arms. the self indulgent melodrama works well enough to tick all the right boxes for the genre, and the film functions perfectly well as an enjoyably glossy, weepy romance.it is worth noting that the dvd features the director's cut of the film, which for once indicates that it is substantially different from the theatrical version, which not only adds 25 minutes, but reorders some of the scenes, making the narrative less linear. although this new version is perhaps too long, it is surely superior, as without these changes, the film would surely have been even more conventional and would have suffered from even murkier character development.wai keung lau (director) / jae-young kwak (screenplay) cast: woo-sung jung . park yi sung-jae lee . jeong woo david chiang . cho ho-jin jeon . detective jang ji-hyun jun . hye-young dion lam . yun joon-ha

a young korean artist lives in amsterdam. she is a bit of a loner and has never had a serious relationship, insisting that she is "waiting" for the right person. she works in the public square, drawing portraits for passersby but, for herself, she also indulges in painting her favorite flowers, daisies. but, all of a sudden, she has a secret admirer. flowers are delivered to her residence every day at 4:15, usually daisies, yet she can not catch the sender in the act. this is because, unknown to her, her beau is a korean hit-man, and he wishes to remain hidden, for now. one day in the square, however, another attractive korean man sits for the artist and happens to be carrying a pot of daisies. she concludes that he is her shy hero and, also, the man she has been waiting to find. this second gentleman, too, has a secret; he is an interpol agent. the assassin can see everything that transpires in the square, due to having an apartment close by. naturally, he is disturbed that another man has entered the young girl's life. how will this shadowy love triangle play out? this is a beautiful picture to watch. the setting in amsterdam and the surrounding countryside is very, very lovely. add in three most attractive young korean actors and, visually, any viewer has a stunning panorama in front of them. the story is quite nice, too, being a mixture of drama and action, with a dash of the unexpected. costumes are very fetching and the production values, high. in short, anyone searching for a quality foreign film with a compelling story and great scenery would find this movie a wonderful choice for a diverting evening. should you have someone's hand to hold during the view, so much the better.

i saw the korean version of daisy first. it came across as a simple love story that flowed nicely from start to finish. i saw it 3 times as i waited for my copy of the director's cut to arrive.then i got the dc and watched it. wow! i think this is the first real director's cut i've ever seen. amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions! the dc is laid out like a hardcore thriller, with the love story in the background. it moves at a slower pace than the korean version.the variations between both versions are so drastic, it seems like two totally different movies. i thought i would be worn out watching the movie again, toughing it out just to look for the added scenes. that wasn't the case. it really felt like i was watching a whole new movie.while the dc is 20 minutes longer than the korean version, you'll be hard-pressed to pinpoint where or what has been changed. 2 seconds chopped off here. a second added there. an entire scene added here. another erased there. in both versions, scenes have been added, omitted or chopped up and reordered. in some scenes, entire lines of dialogue were replaced or reordered - while the scene itself was untouched. even simple sound effects were added/omitted from each version - having a major impact on the mood of the film, and sometimes even changing the outcome of a scene. what comes across as a tender moment in the korean version is a sad, somber one in the dc. the endings of both versions leave room for interpretation. as far as i can tell, both versions end a lot different, and were intended that way.i'm assuming most people will be acquiring the director's cut of the film, and will find the movie pretty decent, but a little long and boring. if that's the case, look for the korean version. same movie, but different feel. i think there's a deluxe 3-dvd version that contains both cuts of the film - not sure.the versions compliment each other so well that as a pair, i'll watch daisy more often than i do any of my other favorite korean movies. alone, i'd say the korean version is a nice love story that i'd watch once in awhile. the director's cut, i'll watch maybe once or twice, then never again, as i find the pacing dull. but they just go so well together! for what i consider the best experience, i'd say watch the korean version first. then watch the director's cut to help fill in the gaps of the story that you were curious about.the editing is the real star of the film.

flowers! if it's one thing you'll take away from this movie, it's gonna be the flowers. they feature so prominently and are used as plot devices, you'll become an expert in identifying with daisies and black tulips by the time the movie ends.set in amsterdam, daisy tells the frustrating love triangle story between 1 girl and the 2 men in her life. one a professional hit-man eking out a living, the other an interpol agent. featuring a pan-asian cast (korean, hong kong) and crew (director andrew lau from hong kong, writer from korea, and a thai post production team), i could imagine the headaches in coordination.park yi (jung woo-sung) is a hit-man who found a soft spot for painter hye-young (played by the pretty jeon ji-hyun). it's love at first sight in the meadows of daisies, where her clumsiness caught his attention. however, being shy and ever mindful of the dangers of his professional career, he can only admire her from afar, do little (or perhaps big) things for her in an anonymous fashion, but the one that takes the cake is sending her potted daisies everyday without fail at 4:15pm. he becomes her guardian angel from afar, shielding her and keeping her safe from harm.hye-young is in love with this mysterious stranger. she is constantly waiting for him to appear, but i really wonder how difficult could that be given the almost punctual daisy delivery. nonetheless, she's terribly moved, and touched by this sole act. however, as the stars would have it, interpol detective jeong woo (lee sung-jae) chances upon hye-young at a town square during one of his undercover missions, and he too is captivated by her. in a similar fashion, because of his profession, he is doubtful if he should make the first move.which is where the audience would find it frustrating. the lady obviously would fall for the wrong guy (then again, it's the "good" guy), park yi being infuriated by jeong woo's pursuit, but yet still refuses to step out and identify himself, and jeong woo being the opportunist in grabbing the free anonymous identity unwittingly. it's almost as if you wanna give everyone a slap to wake them all up.that aside, it is precisely this tension that keeps you intrigued. and it is wickedly fun to watch the two male leads finding it tough to fall in love without jeopardizing their careers, or their loved one. but fret not action fans, there are enough cat-and-mouse revelations and unsaid camaraderie in the mould of infernal affairs, as well as ample gunfights, although i felt the ending could have been scripted tighter.what rocks is the clever editing. telling the story in a non-linear timeline (no worries, it ain't that bad, you'll still be able to follow the narrative) from the points of view of all the leads, keeping you in suspense, and culminating in a three way split screen showcasing all their emotions in a single converging event, which i thought was extremely well-done.it's a beautiful film in terms of landscapes of lush meadows and busy city squares, with plenty of classical music to sooth the soul. as with romance movies, all the leads are eye candy - the girls will have a field day with the two handsome male leads, while the guys have to make do with a somewhat pudgy-faced (argh! ok lah, at certain angles) jeon ji-hyun.if you're into a romance movie with an equal balance in the action/tension department, then daisy would be your choice. if you prefer a more conventional weepy, then the other korean movie making its debut here at the same time, you are my sunshine, would be your alternative. and yes, i totally dig the ending scene, which i thought only the koreans do it best? kinda reminded me of the jsa one.

good to see i'm not the only person who remembers this great film. i have very fond memories of this movie - seem to vaguely remember back to when i was about 8 and i'd watch the kids tv shows after school (broom cupboard anyone?). this was the first and last film to scare me - and the images of the boy surrounded by mist on a hill will stay with me forever! like most films of this era, it has a happy ending - aimed at children, but with a definite ability to capture an adults attention. the lovely cornish scenery really sets the film up to feel isolated - and the "ghostly" scenes are simple but very, very effective! i'd love to try and find this movie again - see if it still hits home!

i saw this film early one morning in the early 90s when i was about 12.i have been trying to find what it was and finally today i did!i remember enjoying it and being a little bit freaked out at the ending when it showed the gravestone of the young boy and his ghostly face!please could anybody let me no if i can get a copy of this as i would love to see it again.i remember the kid getting stuck down a cornish tin mine and then befriending a boy.cant remember that the kids were stuck there with miners but must have been.the boy helps them out of the mine and turns out to be the ghost of a boy who had died while working down there i think.

this film has "haunted" me since i saw it when i was about 8 years old. i didn't know what it was called so am so pleased to have tracked it down finally. i remember being quite scared, because i'd just been to a tin mine in cornwall when i watched it, so could imagine it all. fortunately i didn't see any ghosts of dead children there, but i found this film really quite disturbing and scary when i was much younger. i've certainly never forgotten it, even though i couldn't find it anywhere. i seem to remember the children's film foundation films being generally good, but they don't show them at all any more. i also remember programmes like the children of green knowe in the same era on bbc - equally unsettling in its own way.

i remember watching this as a child as part of the children;s film foundations friday film specials on cbbc and have recently happened upon a copy.in the twenty or so years since my last viewing this film has lost nothing.it is an atmospheric tale which entices with cornish folklore and adds elements of truly creepy imagery of the ghost of the young miner billy.shot in the wonderfully scenic port loe area of cornwall the film utilises the mixture of rugged coastline and abandoned tin mines to make the setting truly believable.there is much packed into this cff drama, something long since lost from children's television today and well worth a look if you can track down a copy.

so after years and years i finally track this film down! i was dying to see how it lived up to my memories. i distinctly remembered the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine, then waiting behind two planks of wood crossed in the mineshaft, just staring out with a pale white face. this single shot was probably the most chilling shot of my childhood, i remember chills running down my spine. watching it now, its obviously nowhere near as scary, but quite subconsciously strange to see the same images again. if anyone wants a copy, private message me.the story itself is fairly standard bcff stuff. its strange though that the message is pretty unclear this time around - there is no real moral as such (except that 'ghosts are here to help us?' or 'don't be prejudiced against ghosts!') there wasn't even a greed/capitalist angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine. however, a massive act of irresponsibility from the captain, encouraging the two kids to actually follow the vague implications of a ghost not only into a mine, but into a new mine hole, which is totally dangerous. the captain then encourages the children to climb down a huge ladder, deep into the mines, simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too. its also a bit odd that the ghost chooses the boy to help the trapped adults, and not just help the trapped adults direct. oh well.

being cornish and brought up with the history of tin mining, this film is quite special to me. filmed in and around various locations in cornwall, it depicts the story of two your children who get trapped down a mine with a group of miners.the 'haunters' of the title refers to the 'spriggins' - ghosts of child miners who reside in the mine and are said to bring evil to all that mine there. events take place with an american wanting to invest in local tin mining, but when the young local kid josh is plagued by sightings of the ghost of a young boy, he and his american 'girlfriend' set out to unravel the mystery behind his death, climaxing in the rescue of themselves and several miners from almost certain death when a new shaft is opened and the spiggins save them.top film, albeit low budget and short, but worth a look if you're from cornwall and/or into tin mining!

this film is one of those that can't be regarded by its outwardness. indeed, at a first sight, it seems that the story simply focus the desire of have more money. but..let's take a look on the other side...what do you see? you see that the money is only a metaphor for the ambiguous feelings the human being have:should i do the right thing, or should't i? and... what's the "right thing"? le's make a deeper analyses... -what does it mean a little town in the border? - it means that sometimes we can go too close to the border of doing something we thought we couldn't... - what does it mean the arid soil shown in this picture? - it means the dryness that sometimes take possession ot our offensed hearts... - what does it mean the phrase of the character (kristen) :"now i belong to him"? - it means the loss of our free will, due to our unpremeditated deeds. in my opinion that's the writer of the story and the director tried to "tell" us. by the way...do you remember what another character (jack barnes)said:"nothing is so simple..."

i first saw this movie in the night program of one of my favourite tv channels.... i was hooked from the very first minute. nothing is as it first seems, lots of suspense, great acting from mr. van dien, and i did not mind the "heat" in it one bit ;-) ... and, best of all: you are in for a surprise ending!!!

this film starts out with all the moody promise of a great contemporary noir western - after the ill-conceived opening flashback sequence anyway. the scenery is beautifully desolate, the characters achingly isolated. while some of the acting is less than believable, the plot ultimately delivers enough tension and twists to make this movie worth a look.

this movie moves and inspire you, it's like you are one of the family. just to see and witness life during the depression era, makes you feel humble and grateful. jonathan silverman delivered well, so convincing and very witty! a must see for teens!

blythe danner and judith ivey deliver wonderful performances here as jonathan silverman, as eugene, recounts his life in 1937's brighton beach.what makes the film so good is the relationships among the characters with a backdrop of extremely wonderful family values.bob dishy had a marvelous opportunity here as the father of the clan. he gives a restrained but compelling performance as the patriarch of the family.his sons played by jonathan silverman and brian dillinger are fabulous. there are certain scenes when silverman is skating or hopping where i'm reminded of jerry lewis.as for danner and ivey, they too are wonderful. their mannerisms, intonation and idealism of the jewish culture are beautifully realized by them.the cinematography is just wonderful. beautiful brighton in 1937! even as the inevitability of war loomed, the film is rich with many of the typical problems faced by families in that period. in a sense, you don't have to be jewish to experience what the family is going through.a must see for nostalgic buffs, and those of us who believe so strongly in family values.

it opens with your cliche overly long ship flying through space. all i could think at this point was "spaceballs" and hoping there'd be a sticker on back that said "we break for nobody." the movie then shows some cryogenic freezers with vin diesel's narration. i've always thought his voice sounded cool ever since i saw fast and the furious. from when i found out he was as criminal, i thought the movie was going to be cliche. it was. it was very cliche and fate seemed to be against them at every turn. black out every 22 years. lucky them, they land on that day. aliens can only be in the darkness, hey it's a solar eclipse. as much as i thought it was too easy and just a cliche, the movie pulled through and kicked major @ss. i even went out and bought a copy of pitch black after seeing it. i really can't wait for chronicles of riddick.

i saw "into pitch black" on t.v. and so i had to see this. i must say, i was very impressed.not only has david twohy's style improved since he wrote "critters 2", this film brought to my attention vin diesel. sure, he was there in "into pitch black", but here he was ferocious, scary, and intense. i haven't seen charisma like that since schwarzenegger in the 80's.the story is simple enough, but it is the characters that make this film interesting. then there was what happens with the female lead. unexpected. the dark humor helps the film move along, the effects aren't grand, but when riddick fights the alien... it blew all of my complaints out.diesel hasn't done a whole lot since this film that i would care about, but i am eagerly looking forward to the sequel.

i enjoyed the movie and kellie martins performance immensely. it's the kind of movie i can show my family and has an example of a young woman placed in extraordinary circumstances finding the courage to do the right thing in the face of extreme danger.

this is the underrated kellie martin's best role. based on a true story, it tells the story of fusia's attempt to save the members of the diamant family and other jews she meets over time. one of my all-time favorite movie scenes involves an heroic act by fusia's little sister. all children should see this scene-role models like this are very few and far between. the movie is well written and acted. i am a movie lover and this movie i rate a 10 on imbd's rating system. it is on my top 25 movies of all time and should be put out on video.mike porter

on june 22nd, 1941, the city of przemysl, poland is divided between german and russian. when the german invades the city, the nazis send the jews to a ghetto. the young catholic fusia podgorska (kellie martin), alone with her young sister, lodges and hides many jews in the attic of her house along two and half years until the end of the war. "hidden in silence" is another good story of human sympathy in world war ii. this film looks like "rescuers: stories of courage", and is also based on a true story. unfortunately, the actress kellie martin performs a strong and powerful lead character, but she is very weak for such a role. in many dramatic situations, the expression of her face is not convincing. i have noted that many imdb users liked her performance, but i am not sure whether they like her wonderful character or her performance indeed. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "ocultos no medo" ("hidden in fear")

how important is the director, anyway? in this film, made in the politically tumultuous times of the late 60s where questions of social organization were prime conflicts, asks that question by making a movie that turns the camera away from the action and only begs to reveal the director, william greaves. it is an important work, as it shows like no other movie shows the difficulties in blocking, organizing, and setting the scene; it reveals the role of the crew, something most directors frankly would like to disappear completely and that the invisibility of is essential for suspending disbelief; and it also puts into consideration the role of performance and scripting and how they match/don't match reality and what that has to say about how the director ultimately influences reality (if at all).the documentary, or pseudo-documentary, or fictional narrative (whichever you prefer, via your interpretations of the themes) has its brain in the over-educated, over-intellectual crew, its guts in the lost performers struggling to understand the vague and ambiguous directions, and its heart in the director, who stands in as the desire to portray, to represent, to express without any idea how to do any of those things or why he wants to do it. it's a film that purposefully repeats banalities just to see if they can become more than banalities. it's a film that sometimes shows the multiple shots simultaneously, just to leave the editing to the audience and also reveal how disturbingly different shots change perspective.it's an important work, and something that everyone interested in the industry and process of film-making should watch and understand. it, like many experimental films, has no real mass-audience appeal--it's not for them. it's for the industry, and its for the 60s, asking what to do with a group-effort medium that still relies on a single "voice" and "author".--polarisdib

this is a documentary unlike any other. it has so many layers and shows us so much that trying to analyze it all at once is nearly impossible. documentarian william greaves shows us the process of film-making from a different perspective. we see the struggles of the actors, the director, the sound crew, and everybody else trying to hang in there and make this film successful. if this was just about a movie being made it would be ordinary. what greaves does is make it more complex by having a crew film the actors, and then this will be filmed by another crew, only to have another crew film the whole thing. three cameras, each with a different goal. it has an almost dizzying affect on you but at the same time is exciting. i like the parts where the crew organizes together and discusses what is going on. even they are somewhat in the dark as to what greaves is trying to do. half see this as an experiment while the other half sees it as a chaotic and confusing failure. no matter what side you choose, you can't argue that greaves doesn't get you involved in this process.

in 1968 when, "symbiopsychotaxiplasm: take one", was released, it came from out of nowhere, and struck like a psychedelic thunder bolt. afro-american actor and film maker, william greaves, aimed to forever alter the 'news-reel' style of documentary film-making, and to this day, there has never been anything quite like it. the movie is a film about 'the making of a film', and intentionally written and directed so as to create as much controversy and contradiction as possible. set in new york's central park, the action and scant dialog concern a couple who fight and bicker about homosexuality and abortion. the woman wants out of the relationship, and the man wants an explanation. near the end of this interaction, a drunk homeless man interrupts the proceedings and offers his commentary, and personal back-story. then, after the principle footage has been shot, the film crew add their own views of the film-maker and what they feel is his inept handling of the movie. and during the entire film, multiple cameras are employed to record the action within the scene, and extraneous commentary by cast, crew, and onlookers. i would certainly recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in avant garde film makers such as andy warhol, john cassavetes, or jim jarmusch. william greaves attempts to show that a thing cannot be truly observed and understood because the viewing itself would alter the reality. "symbiopsychotaxiplasm: take one" can be seen as a cinematic representation or application of the uncertainty principle. this is only one possible explanation, and greave's true intent is certainly open for speculation. above all else, this film seeks to confound, confront. and stimulate, and without a doubt, succeeds admirably.

a film of high intelligence and activity. as well as being a strong capsule of the time and persona that was the 60's, the film is also truly a surprise in its forward-thinking themes and the unique presentation of the system of power in a group. william greaves appoints himself to the authoritative role in the group. he asks his crew members to film and film and keep filming. first the two actors, then the crew filming the actors, then the entire set including bystanders, policemen, and finally a homeless man whose been living in bushes in central park for 9 weeks.greaves edits the film (thousands of feet) together and surprisingly makes a strong narrative with an interesting arc and motivations. don't expect to be bored by this film. each of crew make for engaging conversationalists and often times are voicing the thoughts that the observer has watching this film. greaves does well at integrating the multiple camera takes using synchronized three-in-one pictures and other attention shifting methods.in the end, the film will really only be effective if it's what you're looking for: if you're looking for some abstract arty film that feeds your own self-indulgent ego while never having a point, look elsewhere. if you're looking for a film that will have you talking and thinking long afterward about the desire for honesty and sincerity in documented "reality" and the inevitable transparency that comes of it, then this is the perfect film.

the second film about the adventures of the gaulois pair asterix & obelix is 10 times better than the first. the humor is great (and irreverant) and the script is well executed taken from the original 1965 comic book by goscinny & uderzo. i fell asleep with the first film (although i am a great fan of asterix) and was reluctant to see this sequel, but i am glad this movie proved me wrong. excellent comedy for everyone. highly recommended!

you cannot be seeing the same movie if you didn't grow up in france (or spent at least 10 years there, like me). i don't know if it will ever make it outside french cultural borders (i include belgium and luxembourg here). you cannot translate its kind of fun - every name is joke (how many people outside paris would understand the pun in "couloirdebus", the name of one of the roman legionnaires ?). however monica bel(l?)ucci is so beautiful, i almost forgot to breathe when i saw her.

wow! i picked this off the rental shelf because i loved robert carlyle and jonny lee miller in 'trainspotting.' this is a phenomenal movie; it has action, romance, suspense, intrigue and wit. when i wasn't laughing, i was at the edge of my seat. this is definitely a film i would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the 18th century. this film has everything to keep me happy!

** here be spoilers ** recap: macleane (miller) witnesses a robbery by plunkett (carlyle) that goes wrong. plunkett's partner get shot (and killed) but not until after he has swallowed a great ruby. plunkett and macleane then meet at the cemetery when both try to get hold of the ruby. unfortunately they are caught as grave robbers and sent to jail, but not until plunkett has swallowed the ruby. the ruby is their key to freedom, and once they're free, they form a partnership in robbery. macleane is to pose as a gentleman and find out who is worth robbing, and then simply they rob him (and rob them in style). but macleane falls in love with the niece/daughter (?) of their first victim, lady rebecca gibson (tyler). and a mr chance (stott) is out to catch them, and his methods are not very nice...comments: a good action flavoured by comedy and adventure. carlyle and miller form a good team, with a lot of friction and friendship. and then there is the relationship between macleane and rebecca gibson. the scene with the ball is very good, especially the (anachronistic) use of the music. in addition to these interesting characters cumming play the best of them all, lord rochester. both the character and the acting are stellar and among the best in the movie. in total, the movie works very well, a nice balance between story and special effects, action and comedy. very entertaining.8/10

ah, how refreshing to see a vision of 18th century england complete with mud, the pox and gibbets... and accompanied by a delightful techno soundtrack to boot. this is the story of downtrodden highwayman plunkett (robert carlisle) and gentleman-fallen-on-hard-times captain macleane (jonny lee miller), and how they get together and rob the aristo pigs. plunkett is a hard nut, but macleane is far too polite for that, and thus becomes 'the gentleman highwayman'. he falls in love with lady rebecca (liv tyler), (who to be frank is the only weak part of the whole shebang) and wants to impress her. the costumes are fantastic. big, colourful, historically innacurate beautiful togs. alan cummings gets all the best threads, and the best lines as lord rochester, sporting a very non-18th century eyebrow piercing. the music shifts between swooping glorious choirs and thumping bass-laden techno, which doesn't jarr as you think it should do in a historical film. the script is fast-moving and peppered with modern-day colloquialisms; merchant ivory, this is not. there are hilarious parts, disgusting parts, sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat-and-nibble-your-fingernails parts, but the whole thing chugs along and is wonderfully entertaining throughout. this is cheer-in-the-cinema stuff. unmissable.

this movie is one of the best and moving i have ever seen, because of the terrible good performance of the main actress jennifer rubin as jamie harris, who really makes you feel with her. also the music by mark snow is wonderful.

i haven't seen this film for over 20 years, but it had such an impact on me that i remember sitting through the credits and for several minutes after in complete awe. this is one of the most underrated films of the entire decade in which it was originally released. i just ordered a copy of it on dvd and paid for overnight shipping and can't wait for it to arrive. it is uplifting at times, and also very dark and somewhat disturbing. it's a story of a close-knit band of regular kids growing up in the inner city and makes one feel as though they are actually sitting on the sidelines, rather than watching on a movie screen or television. hard to explain, but it is something that must be experienced. the story starts at childhood and tracks the lives of the four main characters through high school and as they embark on their separate journeys in life. the entire cast did an incredible job and it's by far the best work of jodi thelen's career. i'm hoping that the dvd lives up to my memory and plan on watching it this friday with a good friend.

what a great movie!! it's a touching story about four high-school friends who grow up in the 1960s. throughout the decade, the friends are somewhat separated, but they mnnage to see each other occasionally. there are many tragedies, but there are also a lot of happy moments that make you laugh and smile. it's a heart-filled tale of life, love and friendship. definitely a must see for drama fans.

this is one of the best presentations of the 60's put on film. arthur penn, director of bonnie and clyde and little big man, saw that steve tesich's outstanding script rang with truth, and from these two talents comes solid cinema. jodi thelin's georgia miles gives male viewers a hit of pained nostalgia for the archetypal beauty who is almost within our grasps, but, always just out of reach. just see it, or you cinematic education will be incomplete.

behind the nostalgic music, we see a young boy get off a train. he is arriving from yugoslavia to meet his father, a man he has not seen in a decade. at the train station, we meet the man. he never smiles.thus, we begin our journey into "four friends", arthur penn's powerful and amazing film. you may ask why i began my review that way. well, that is the way the video box describes the film. you may have figured out that the film will be the story of the boy trying to get along with this emotionless man and eventually, he will peel away at his cover and expose the kindness.well, if you bought that, i've got a bridge i want to sell you. you see, modern hollywood would make that film. penn has always been an outsider and has never resorted to typical cliched storytelling. he always tells interesting stories about people (his credits include "bonnie and clyde", "the chase", "alice's restaurant" and the underrated "mickey one") and "four friends" is no exception.a typical hollywood film would focus on the boy who is named danilo. but steve tesich's script only focuses on that for about 4 minutes and then abandons him. we meet the adult danilo, played by craig wasson (whom you may recognize from "body double" and "nightmare on elm street 3") and his friends, tom, david and the passionate georgia. the movie takes us throughout the sixties. now in a lesser film, the events would receive the attention. but in "four friends", these events happen, but penn and tesich is more concerned with character study than plot and i think the film is better that way. we know the events; we don't need to dwell on them again.i know i haven't described much of the plot, but i don't know if you can describe "four friends". it's not one of those "high-concept" films that can be described in a single sentence. it's a film of many moods and textures. it's also a genuinely emotional experience. the final twenty minutes of this film moved me to tears. i'm not ashamed to admit it. rarely does a film have such power that it can reduce me to tears. the acting is first rate, especially by craig wasson, who seems to be one of the most underused actors working today. this is such a difficult, emotional performance and wasson pulls it off. he should have received an oscar for this. another great performance is by jodi thelen, who has an even more difficult role than wasson. but she handles it extremely well and gives georgia a certain dignity most hollywood actresses wouldn't (they'd be too scared to even try; they'd be more concerned with image rather than giving a great performance; that's not what acting is about). she also deserved an oscar."four friends" didn't receive much of a push in 1981. maybe people just didn't have the emotional capacity to handle it. and clueless executives couldn't push it as another "american graffiti" (it lacks the wallop of "four friends"). so they let it die. too bad, for this is one of the very best films of the 1980s, a decade where more and more slick trash was created and great art like this was without a home. i ask you to give this film a chance.**** out of 4 stars

someone definitely has it in for the wind and i cannot believe that what i saw on the screen has much to do with it. this is a better and more solid movie than most of the independents i watch all year long. the cinematography displays a genuine love and mastery of the craft and the casting was just fine. i would love to see more of these folks, especially zeke rippy.as far as the story and script, i'm not so sure that the negative comments preceding this post were written with the intent of informing anybody else about the movie. the long drawn out nit-picky bashing posts that must have taken hours to compose and are the only comments ever left for any movie on this site by the reviewer, are obvious slander directed at the producers of the film. i don't know the inside story, but it would probably make a good movie. what i do know from being around this biz, is, productions that try to make everybody happy usually end up being awful and when the filmmaker has the guts, drive and common sense to "kill the babies", someone always ends up with hurt feelings. that's part of the biz too, and one of the finest learning tools available to those truly dedicated to making it in the movie business. of course, the failures have nothing better to do than to sit at home and write false reviews on the internet as a form of vendetta against those that snubbed them (read: were honest and truthful with them). and that is my best guess to explain the nasty, nasty reviews. in as much as there is a grain of truth behind everything, there is a point to be made, but these exaggerations of the grains are so over the top that they become obviously fictitious.it's not a slasher blood bath if that's what you're looking for, it's more the psychological suspense thriller, which typically is not appreciated by the lowest common denominators out there. the best way to see this movie is to try to expunge any pre-conceived notions, pop it in and let it unfold - seriously, characters are defined by their actions and words and when you see what these people do and what they say, i don't think you can come away with the conclusion that these characters were poorly developed. poorly understood perhaps.overall, i do agree that this is a nicely done, compelling movie. perhaps i would not have given it a 9 under normal circumstances, but the severe negative comments actually attracted me to the picture (i have a secret love for really bad cinema). to me, the ratings below 5 should be reserved for the shlocky, inept, poorly acted and stupidly written movies. none of that applies here - it is quality movie making with some real talent in there. i gave it the nine to to tip the scales back in the correct direction. watch the movie and tell me i am wrong.

hell to pay is a bit bloody for my taste, even though it is no worse than many films. nevertheless, i did enjoy the parade of seasoned stars and the western scenery & all; but, the story-line was very weak and i couldn't really see the point of it all. however, the music that accompanies the movie more than makes up for the lackluster film.where did the guys -nate & noah cryns- who wrote this music come from? they are awesome!! from the moment the music begins, it is by far, better than anything i've heard in years. i think it may be the best i've ever heard! even though i wasn't thrilled with the action taking place on the film, the music evoked the exact emotion that was needed for each scene. i was transported in time to the old west during the opening credits and really felt like i was re-living those old days through the music.this movie is definitely worth a purchase and a viewing for the beautiful music and a trip down memory lane to see the old western stars once again.

this is an excellent movie and i would recommend it to everyone. mr. drury's acting is top notch as it always is and he blends well with the other actors in the movie. can't give away any of the suspense or drama found in the movie. hell to pay is a must see movie!!! the plot was very suspenseful. i would watch this movie over and over again because it has all the elements of a great western movie. it was very authentic in how they displayed the components dealing with this movie which includes the guns, horses, and clothing. the soundtrack is enjoyable and adds flavor to the movie. james drury has the right touch when picking out a movie to be involved with. this is a another winner for the western genre. !!!!!

although never say never again (nsna) has a weak sound track, it is far superior to its competition at the time, "octopussy." never say never again is an updated and improved version of thunderball (connery's least popular bond flick). nsna is rich with clever dialogue, wit, smarts, sex appeal, and one of the best and most convincing bad guys in the entire bond series. in addition, nsna features a very talented young and beautiful kim basinger. british comedy fans will also recognize the actor (attwood), known as, "mr. bean." i wouldn't trade any of the moore pictures for this one. however the earlier connery/bond efforts (with the exception of "thunderball,") are superior.

people criticize nsna because it is a low-point in bond god sean connery's career, and because it is unofficial. ***may contain spoilers* first of all, this movie is better then any other bond film featuring any other actor then connery, all sub par wannabes in my book. sean connery is the only real bond, no one comes even close to his toughness, good looks and sex appeal. yes, this movie is a low point in connery's bond career, but it is still the definet best bond film of the 80's. sean connery is the only bond actor who is good at an older age. he did not become a baggy mess like moore, but kept his good looks and toughness, but gaining some gray hair. so what? hes still the only real 007, and he is as cool, and tough as ever. sean connery is the one and only 007. and this movie is definitly worth seeing, no matter what anyone says. no gun-barrel opening, but you can't have everything, can you? great theme song, though.

let me depart from many comments i've read here, and say that this film ranks as one of the five best bonds, along with on her majesty's secret service, from russia with love, licence to kill, and for your eyes only (the only time roger moore actually played the role of bond, instead of futzing around). of course, sean connery pulls the whole thing together -- as co-writer, co-producer, and in his best performance since from russia with love. he is fit, energetic, and obviously enjoying himself. his acting is mature, confident, and laced with the right amount of humour. this is in contrast to his mechanical performance in thunderball, his sleepwalking through you only live twice, and his jowly, paunchy romp through that cartoon known as diamonds are forever!this is an imaginative reworking of thunderball, without having the sets and machines overwhelming the characters and plot. this cast is far superior, as well. klaus maria brandauer brings his unique style to the role of largo, without relying on an eyepatch, spectre ring or a boring uniform. kim basinger is athletic and lovely, barbara carrera is dynamic, and for once, we have a great felix leiter in bernie casey. the depictions of m and q are original, and the addition of the bumbling agent small-fawcett is fun without lapsing into slapstick.director irvin kershner makes good use of his locations (the bahamas and the french riviera) without losing sight of his actors. although close inspection reveals some mediocre special effects and lapses in continuity, kershner keeps the film moving at a good pace, unlike thunderball (which even its director, terence young, did not like). obviously fans will miss the gun-barrel trademark and the 007 theme music, but they are, after all, owned by eon productions.michel legrand may not have composed the most memorable score, but it captures the atmosphere of the locations without being overly intrusive. not surprisingly, his best moments are in the south of france, with his french love song (at the health spa) being particularly attractive. and tell me, how many really remember the music for moonraker? i personally would rather forget man with the golden gun and a view to a kill!the eon folks can sneer at this film if they like. (yes, octopussy made more money.) at least connery's mature 007 didn't swing through the jungle emitting a tarzan yell. he did not frolic with a bengal tiger, nor did he fight off "indian" snake charmers with a tennis racket. despite eon's desperate efforts to stop this production, kevin mcclory and the late jack schwartzman put together a fine film, one that i think ian fleming would have appreciated.if, however, you would rather see james bond get kicked in the shins by a dwarf, engage in another tiresome struggle with "jaws", jump into bed with grace jones, or lead a slapstick firetruck chase through san francisco, this is not the film for you!

i like tom hanks, and he is one of few actors who will draw me into the theatre regardless of any misgivings i may have concerning the film. i worried about mr. hanks return to "light comedy" as this is the arena where he made the transition from tv to film- remember "big"? well, "charlie wilson's war" is not light comedy. it is political satire, and extremely well-written political satire at that. the script is the star of this film, and the word-smithing by aaron sorkin is some of the best on offer this year.mike nicols holds the entire escapade together, delivering a film that zips along in a very quick 90 minutes (timing is everything in comedy, and nothing is ever funny if it drags). nicols' choice in sets and lighting are also very reminiscent of '70's and '80's tv, a move used deliberately to root the piece in period.the return to the use of model work and stock photography over digital special effects also enhances the retro look and believability. note to the production designers in your choice of stock footage: i know the difference between an f-16 and a mig, and a bell and a hind. but that may have been part of the joke, too.i saw this film in philadelphia. it was interesting to watch and listen to the audience not get the historical references to their own history. history tends to repeat because the recidivists have forgotten what happened the first time around.kudos to both mr. hanks and that chameleon phillip seymore hoffman. sorkin's script is brought to life by these actors, and the entire production team is on the top of their game.heartily recommended.

told in flashback, the film opens in 1989 with charlie being given award for his role in the defeat of communism. i must admit my heart sank as at the thought of have to endure yet another earnest, somewhat boring and overlong life story. how wrong was i, because that short scene is as close as the film ever gets to boring.the film is full of entertaining & amusing set ups and cracking dialogue in some of the most unexpected places. the next scene after the awards ceremony is charlie in a hot-tub with some naked women and a guy trying to get him to invest in a tv programme. another rather amusing scene is about 3 quarters into the film comprises charlie, a group of his rather sexy secretaries, phillip seymour hoffmans cia man and a bottle of whisky. as to dialogue what about this for a line, "the senator says, he can teach us to type but can't teach us to grow tits.". ok, school-boyish i know but the film is laced with great lines.as to performances well phillip seymour hoffman as usual steals every scene he's in. hanks is ok but surprisingly to me anyway was julia roberts who is very good in the role of a rather eccentric texas oil millionairess.charlie wilson's war is one of the best non musician bio-pics in a long while as well as being that rare thing a film that entertains, amuses as well as informs all in equal measure.

it doesn't happen very often, but occasionally one man can make a difference -- a big difference.george crile's 2003 best seller, charlie wilson's war, is a fascinating and eye-opening account of the most unlikely "difference maker" imaginable. a relatively obscure congressman from the second district of texas, "good time charlie" was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation. likable and licentious (even for a politician), charlie wilson served his constituency well since the good folks of lufkin only really wanted two things, their guns and to be left alone. it's easy street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known, appropriately enough, as charlie's angels.when asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive, young aides his response is a classic, "you can teach 'em to type, but you can't teach 'em to grow tits." no argument there.but even the most rakish rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath, and for charlie wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter, humiliating defeat of the russian military and, possibly, to even help hasten the end of the cold war as a result. fat chance, huh?under the skillful direction of mike nichols and a smart, snappy screenplay by adam sorkin, charlie wilson's war is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind-the- scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising "charlie's team."the on-screen "team," is composed of three marvelous actors with four (4) academy awards and nine (9) nominations between them. charlie is beautifully portrayed by tom hanks in a solid, slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years. he's aided, abetted and abedded by joanne herring, a wealthy houston socialite played by the still-slinky julia roberts. hey, why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this? by all accounts ms. roberts looks good and holds her own, but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why kabul and country is so important to her character. maybe the two afghan hounds usually by her side know -- but we as an audience never do. as for the third member of the "team," philip seymour hoffman steals every scene he appears in as gust aurakotos, a smart, street- wise (i.e. non ivy league graduate) cia malcontent who knows the score -- both in the agency's boardroom and in wilson's bedroom.for the mujahideen to succeed, the most important assistance the u.s. can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded mi-21 helicopter gunships which rule the skies. this takes money, lots of money, and eventually "charlie's team" covertly coerces those in congress to fund the effort to the tune of $1 billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the afghan rebels. this includes top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices. nasty, nasty stuff.that this kind of multi-billion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind congressional doors is truly alarming. every american should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business-as-usual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government. oh momma, i wish it weren't so...even though the initial outcome for "team charlie" was an unqualified success, the unimaginable, unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the taliban and others. since the funding was entirely "covert," the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of soviet oppression and the end to russian barbarity was the direct result of american intervention. yes, once the russkies left, so did our aid -- zip for schools, zip for infrastructure, zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the afghan people. as a result, the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster -- it's like the forerunner to "mission accomplished."as nichol's film so pointedly points out, "the ball you've set in motion can keep bouncing even after you've lost interest in it." mike krzyzewski knows this, eva longoria parker knows this, little lateesha in lafayette knows this, but the typical american politician doesn't. so we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn't let the world know we were the good guys. talk about a catch-22 (another mike nichols film).perhaps charlie wilson said it best, "we f&%ked up the end game."again.

mike nichols in finest form. i was not a fan of "closer", so it's refreshing to see him again right back on top with this comedy set in the darkest of circumstances. just one slip in tone could have wrecked this compelling picture but nichols and his very strong a-list cast never put a foot wrong in this biopic of a deeply flawed but utterly compelling congressman.philip seymour hoffman as usual is scintillating and brilliant - here playing a damaged but ultra-smart cia manipulator, and it is in the exchanges between hanks and hoffman's characters where the comedy soars. rarely is movie humour laugh-out loud and also smart... this hits the spot time after time with a biting satirical edge that makes you both laugh and weep at the state of the world (often simultaneously).one other major plus is the length of the picture. the film is based on george crile's fat book of the same title. the temptation for screenwriter aaron sorkin (his claim to fame is "the west wing") must have been to make a fat movie, but what we get is a breath-taking 90 odd minutes of great story with sweeping implications.this film deserves to be seen and to be recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest of dark subject matter and the lightness of touch of it's sparkling witty script - even if it does flunk the obvious link between the help that herring and wilson provide and the ultimate consequences (9/11).

this film grabs you from the opening scenes and never lets go. you watch indulgently upon viewing janos szaby's excitement over coming to america. he's a likable fellow. you cannot help being fond of him even when his eagerness is replaced by bitterness as his fortunes turn. you know that in his circumstances,you would be forced to make the same choices he does to survive. this movie comments on society's worship of beauty and all things superficial and is only more true in the culture of the twenty-first century. janos himself becomes victim to this philosophy when he tells his blind girlfriend "you're young and beautiful; if you could see, you would have the world." and like many a modern gangster movie, when her safety is threatened, he extracts a powerful revenge. his innocence is not altogether lost however for he demands an equally high price of himself, knowing he deserves his fate.peter lorre is in fine form in this starring role. only a few actors could convincingly accomplish this character's transformation from innocent to embittered criminal in sixty nine minutes. lorre is well supported by all the cast making this a real ensemble picture and not just a vehicle for one star. with a bit less preachy dialogue, this movie would be a 10. highly recommended.

this film stars peter lorre as an exceptionally nice guy who immigrates to america. unfortunately, shortly after his arrival, he's in a horrible fire and his face is horribly burned. because he looks so awful, no one wants to hire him and out of sheer desperation, he resorts to a life of crime in order to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his ugliness. where exactly the film goes from there, you'll just need to see for yourself.i scored this movie an 8 because, for the money spent to make it, it's a heck of a good film with a lot of good twists in the plot to keep it interesting. the film could have degenerated into a simple horror or crime film, but it goes far beyond this an offers some genuine surprises. in addition, the excellent acting by lorre shows that he was capable of more than just supporting roles. this is an excellent film and delivers more than most "a-pictures" of the day.

peter lorre turns in one of his finest performances as a hungarian watchmaker coming to the united staes to make a new life for himself and someday bring his girl across the big pond to be with him. lorre's infectious optimism and bright outlook come off very effectively which makes the performance all the better when he has his face hideously burned in a hotel fire and, when no one will give him a chance to work, turns reluctantly to a life of crime. lorre's range as an actor is seldom as apparent as in this movie with his jovial, good-natured immigrant, to his depressing, melancholic, disfigured self searching for the truth behind what he believed america afforded him, to his suave, intelligent, better-than-your-average hood, to his sympathetic dealings with a blind woman with whom he falls in love. the story is well-paced, has some interesting twists, and gives lorre many opportunities to shine. director robert florey does a quality job behind the lens, and all of the supporting cast help aid the film with evelyn keyes giving a particularly good turn as the blind girl. i loved the ending - and the truth - that was shone to exist in lorre's character despite all the negative things society had done toward him. for a little b picture, the man behind the mask is good movie-making for its time.

i caught this a few times on tv in the late 1970s. it only played late at night (past midnight).peter lorre plays a kind, happy man whose face is disfigured in a fire. he is rejected by his girlfriend and left alone and filled with despair. he turns to a life of crime and eventually becomes very successful. he makes a mask to hide his disfigured features and falls in love with a beautiful girl (evelyn keyes)...who is blind! he tries to go straight for her...but he can't escape his life of crime or his hatred of his own scarred face.a no budget b film. very short (runs only a little over an hour) but well made and superbly acted by lorre. this has a lot more depth than you would expect from a quickie b picture. ankers especially takes the thankless "girl" role and makes her character fresh and appealing. this has sadly disappeared from tv and was never put on video or dvd (as far as i know). tcm did show it recently and it was great to see the movie still holds up.highly recommended.

this movie starts off as a college t'n'a flick, but turns pretty ugly after the main character's sister is gang raped by a biker gang driving a van. it has a pretty good pace, and james van patten does a pretty good job in this cannon tax write-off movie. this was the first movie i ever saw at the parkway drive-in, here in toronto. the main feature was "alphabet city", and "young warriors was the added feature. out of the 2 movies, "young warriors" was by far more entertaining and memorable. if you are a fan of blow 'em up, excessively violent movies, this one would make a great addition to any collection.

young warriors (1983) while this is a deeply flawed (and in some ways idiotic) movie, the way it continually defies expectations makes it decent viewing for the adventurous sleaze fan.meet yuppie college student kevin and his gang of lovable frat boy buddies. in what starts out as a particularly egregious teen sex comedy, we follow this bunch of jerk-offs and their antics, which involve, among other things, making pledges tie bricks to their genitals. the movie abruptly shifts gears when kevin's high school freshman sister is brutally raped and beaten into a coma by a gang of bikers who apparently have nothing better to do. when she dies in the hospital, kevin vows revenge, much to the chagrin of his detective father.so far, we've gone from porky's-lite, through last house on the left territory, into what is apparently shaping up to be your typical urban vigilante revenge flick. however, kevin and his gang's portrayal goes from vaguely sympathetic until they become kill-crazed lunatics. it's to the film's credit that it doesn't glamorize the fascist anti-crime rhetoric that kevin continually spouts, while still making it understandable that he would feel the way he does.the mood goes from lighthearted to grimy and downbeat very quickly, and by the end it's so over the top and exploitative that it'll leave you incredulous. and that's the strength of this film. you never know what to expect next.at over 100 minutes, it's a little lengthy for this kind of fare, but you won't get bored. poorly acted for the most part, with cardboard cutouts for characters and some particularly ludicrous situations and rather stupid dialogue, this won't be topping anyone's list of forgotten classics anytime soon. i got a kick out of it though, and i'm sure anyone reading this knows if they're up for it.

now, i realize that most people on here trash young warriors or hail it as "so bad it's funny" type entertainment, but let me make something clear: it's actually a quality piece of low rent action, if you're willing to watch such cinema without a critical eye. in fact, it's a good deal more entertaining and thought provoking than the bulk of the action films of the 80s.the key is in the film's subject matter. i'm always a sucker for movies that tackle the subject of vigilantism, especially when they ambitiously probe into the psyches of the characters involved. young warriors may not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first death wish film (and yes, i do think the first one had both of those elements), but it's trying to be different from the run-of-the-mill cannon films of the period in that it's genuinely unique.the plot is simple (don't worry, there won't be spoilers): a group of college student pranksters change their ways when one of their family members is assaulted by a tough street gang. the students take to the streets in an effort to combat general street crime, being that they don't know who the gang responsible is. they eventually acquire some heavy artillery (machine guns and grenades) and prowl the night fully armed. however, these are not schwarzenegger types; they're vulnerable, inexperienced novices who make sizable blunders nearly each time they set out to clean up the city (usually with their frat mascot dog in tow). they finally figure out who the gang is and go after them, but by then you won't be expecting a standard climax in which the good guys walk away unscathed.one thing about the film that struck me as strange yet effective is that the bulk of the first act offers no indication that we'll be seeing any action or violence later on as it's treated like a goofy frat comedy you'd see on usa's up all night (where i believe this was actually shown at one point). the comedy set-up actually lulled me into forgetting that the vhs cover showed a guy riding a motorcycle with a machine gun strapped to his back. then, when the violence finally arrives, it's not fun or cute at all... it's shockingly disturbing. from that point on the film becomes a full blooded, uncompromising action yarn containing some startling gunfights and gore.the acting, while nothing special, is far more impassioned than i anticipated. james van patten, who plays the protagonist, gives his all and his performance is surprisingly good for this type of movie. the rest of the cast is equally invested, including the always dependable ernest borgnine as the hero's cop father. the cinematography is also above par and the action scenes are handled with a level of severity that i personally wasn't expecting.i can understand why some people thought this movie was worthless as much of it is extremely dated, but those facets struck me as nothing short of cool in and of themselves. van patten's character is studying animation and his patently early 80s style work that's on display in several scenes is a retro film lover's psychedelic wet dream. i'm sure most contemporary viewers would cite those very moments as low points in the movie, but i disagree. also, joe walsh's soundtrack - which sounds like it could have only been recorded in '83 - seemed particularly fitting and enjoyable, regardless of how "old" it seems today.young warriors is one of my favorite action films of the 80s and i highly urge anyone interested in the genre to take a look. sadly, however, it's only been released on vhs as of this writing, and it isn't being shown on tv these days. a nice dvd presentation would make me moon-walk around my living room with such intensity that i'm sure my ankles would swell. in the meantime, i implore you all to go on ebay or amazon and cough up the ten bucks or whatever for the old big-box tape. it really is a remarkable staple of ambitious trash cinema.

like most sports movies, it's not surprising that people who know something about the sport can find flaws in it. as a soccer referee, i have yet to see a movie or tv show get it right when depicting a match. "forever" has good actors, but i found sean astin to be a bit young to be an administrator in a juvenile jail. i was very thankful that the plot did not involve the lead character turning his fellow inmates into rugby players and taking on flagstaff as well as highland. which gets to credulity: a police squad car just happens to pull up at precisely the time the flagstaff baddies are hazing rick penning. even though rugby is not a sanctioned high school sport nationally, the team is a school-based club sport -- much like rodeo. that said, i find it hard to believe that high school officials would allow students to play with open wounds: that just isn't done in this day of aids and hepatitis. i don't care what the tradition and macho image is. despite that, it was a cool movie in that teens were expected to act like adults (and sometimes actually did). sadly, far too many coaches are like flagstaff's -- or worse.

the movie forever strong will never be nominated for an oscar, it will never be nominated for best acting, for best motion picture. but this movie does have things that other movies don't. in a nation with so much scandal, so many problems, movies being poured out with little thought to the morals of society, at least this movie promotes good. what is wrong with standing behind something that promotes happiness? we should support movies that tell our american teens that there is more to life than sex drugs and alcohol. as for this haka debate as previously stated, the hakka is not exclusive to the new zealand all blacks, various utah high school football teams and colleges perform this ritual before games. including hawaii, byu, etc.

i am huge movie enthusiast and also an active rugby player who believes that rugby is the greatest game ever played. forever strong is a mix of coach carter and sloppy rugby. this movie is full of great acting, well developed characters and in action shots that will have you ducking and dodging in your seat, but with more arm tackles than pee wee football and almost every shot cuts away as soon as a player touches the ground its filmed to almost seem like football. if you want to bring your kids to see a movie that will build character from within and could inspire a blind man to see again i can easily give it 9 out of 10, if you want to see a great rugby movie that truly shows the sport your going to have to wait for the next one because forever strong is mostly practice, running, and a one ruck film, for this i give it a 7.75 out of 10.

i wonder how someone could diss on this movie. it is based on an actual story. it is not necessarily about "rugby" itself so to the one that posted on here that they need to make a "real" rugby movie, you missed the point. this is not another typical sports movie where a team sucks, they hire emilio estevez and turn the team around and win the championship and give everyone the warm and fuzzies. it focuses on a story. it shows how someone can change his or her life for the better. the movies now days are all about sex, drugs, partying etc. that is hollywood. i am a big fan of movies, but i have to say this was an inspirational movie with a great message. if you consider yourself a "tough guy" don't watch the movie, it won't live up to your standards. if you want to watch a good, inspirational movie, this is a good one.

i wanted to see this movie ever since the previews came out. i don't understand why everyone is so hard on this film. it may not all be technically true to the sport of rugby, but this film is not mainly about the sport. it's about a rugby team that is taught how to be more than the world expects of them. they are taught to become men, and not temporally vain boys. hollywood is never 100% correct in their productions. they are there to make a product that sells. something entertaining. the story of coach gelwix and what he has taught over the years is simply amazing. he teaches about service, honor, integrity, and moral cleanliness. how many other movies are teaching that to our youth these days? i was proud to see such an amazing story that taught reverence and respect.

my family truly enjoyed this movie. as far as what this movie will do for rugby in the usa...well i am sure that will be debatable. but as for me and others around me, i know that we were more curious about the sport after seeing the movie and i personally gained more respect for the game. you may wonder how this possible, especially since the movie does not dive in and explain rugby. but the simple fact is it drew you into the players and emotion of the game and life. the film was inspirational as well as entertaining. it made us laugh and cry. the chemistry between sean astin, big budah and sean faris worked well. some may think the movie is a little cliché, but i seriously wish hollywood made more movies like this. i couldn't help drawing analogies of the game and life's struggles. at the end of it i found myself examining my own life to see what i needed to do better, in order to be the best person i could be. honestly i was grateful this movie taught morals, values and teamwork, there is so much to the contrary. after watching this i really hope my kids are coached by someone who has a philosophy like coach gelwix.

a very positive message for our youth is shown in this movie. through the sport of rugby as a mean, a high school rugby coach leads his players in their behavior and lifestyle, on and off the field. the acting and directing are good. the rugby shots are just ok if you know some rugby or really cool if don't know much about it.i recommend this movie, worth watching, especially at a point in time when this sport is gaining more and more adepts every day.the plot is based on a true story taking place in utah. the coach portrayed in this movie has been at the helm of the highlanders for over 30 years (and loosing only game every 3 years). enjoy!

another masterpiece that needs a dvd release but some libraries have the vhs and well worth seeking out. just a brilliant play about many things, foremost being euthanasia, "respectability", religion, and fundamental human relationships. the script effectively uses intelligent humor not only to cope with an issue like a severely disabled child, but to bind the parents in their love for "jo" and each other. as the couple, alan bates and janet suzman are perfectly matched both in acting virtuosity and in bringing their deep, intelligent characters to life.i've recently seen bates' brilliant performance in "butley" which was released as a film a couple years after "joe egg" and he plays a teacher in both, cynical, intellectual, and funny, although butley is much darker than his character of bry here. if you throw in such great performances in "the go-between", "women in love", "whistle down the wind", "the caretaker" and "georgy girl," not to mention the more obvious "king of hearts" and "zorba the greek", and i'd say that alan bates had a career comparable to peter o'toole, albert finney, and the other great british actors of his era.director peter medak also had one of my all-time favorites "the ruling class" released the same year (1972) as "joe egg", which comprises a career year in anybody's book. he's had kind of a spotty filmography("the krays" was another highlight), but these two gems will mark him as a great director.

long before terri schiavo brought the issue of living as a "vegetable" to the public view, "a day in the death of joe egg" dealt with it. alan bates plays bri, a schoolteacher whose daughter is almost completely brindled. he and his wife sheila (janet suzman) try all sorts of dark humor to try and get on with their lives, but they can't escape the facts. at one point, they even consider euthanasia. the question circling them and their friends is: what will ever become of this predicament? with this movie, alan bates continued his streak of really good movies, preceded by "zorba the greek", "the king of hearts" and "the fixer". we can safely say that he will be sadly missed.

its such a shame that an important film like this is virtually unknown.i don't think alan bates has done a better film than this.its never shown on television. the only time i can recall it being shown on british tv was in the summer of 1998. i have it on tape but sadly the quality isn't great due to a dodgy aerial at the time...i remember wanting to see this film for some time before it appeared on tv. it was shown on channel 4 in the early hours of the morning, thereby ensuring that it still remained unseen except for a very small audience.i was living in bristol at the time and it was ironic that, when i finally saw the film, i realised that i had walked past the very house where it was filmed several times before!! the film treads a fine line; a married couple attempting to make light of their tragic predicament of coping with their severely mentally handicapped daughter by laughing about it and even involving the child in their jokes.the direction and the acting are so superb that the film is always compassionate and moving and is never in danger of lapsing into bad taste.a couple of years ago i saw a clip of the filmed theatre production with eddie izzard in the role of bri and victoria hamilton playing sheila.it showed izzard improvising and larking about and hamilton jokingly telling the audience to ignore him when he's being like this.i maybe taking this out of context as i only saw a brief clip but having read the play and seen the film this is clearly such a delicate subject that such an approach is both insensitive and disrespectful.izzard was praised for his performance but i felt uncomfortable with what i saw.it is perhaps surprising that such a successful play failed to find an audience when it was finally filmed.this is one of the best british films of the 70s and hopefully it will be released on dvd one day.

ok, so i admit that it often seems like most of the sylvester/tweety pairings have exactly the same plot: sylvester tries to get tweety, but repeatedly fails and always gets maimed in the process, often with the help of a bulldog. i guess that it's sort of like wile e. coyote chasing road runner (in other words, mammals should never go after birds). "all a bir-r-r-rd" has the same plot and sets it on a train. in a way, the best part of these cartoons is seeing what sorts of schemes sylvester comes up with to try and go after tweety. we know that he's going to fail miserably, but it's also funny to watch tweety turn into a bad-ass (if you've seen his really early cartoons, you'll see that he was not "cute" at all, but in fact had a cruel streak). this one mainly works as a way to pass time.by the way, i thought that i saw - i mean, i taut i taw - sylvester pass a piece of baggage with the name friz freleng on it.

friz freleng's 'all abir-r-r-d' is one of the best sylvester and tweety cartoons. unlike the many repetitive cartoons in the series which simply transplant the same tired gags to a new setting, 'all abir-r-r-d' makes the most of its concept. tweety and sylvester are domestic pets who are being sent unattended across country by train. with both a watchful official and a vicious bulldog to deal with, sylvester has his work cut out. the sylvester and tweety cartoons always benefited from some extra participants and 'all abir-r-r-d' is a good example of how much these additional characters help. although they are not especially memorable creations, they throw some more obstacles in sylvester's path and make for a more interesting battle. this early sylvester and tweety short presses many of the right buttons and, while tweety is often particularly irritating with his forced cuteness, there's some deliciously violent antics between sylvester and the dog, culminating in a surprisingly brutal climax which is unfortunately marred by a final unfunny non-quip by tweety.

i always enjoy watching this cartoon, with sylvester trying to catch tweety on a train, rather than at grandma's house. it's actually a standard fare, but entertaining, especially when tweety pulls the emergency stop cord. one of my complaints about this is how sloppy the animators were with the train. when you watch this over and over, like my little boy did (who loves trains, which is why he liked it so much), you begin to notice some things.throughout this short, the position of the baggage car changes on the train, either 3rd, 4th or 5th, and in long shots not at all. the engine has either the number 651 or 814, or none at all. the coal tender has either the number 99, or the letters "s.p. & q.r." on it, or no number or letters at all. the coaches carry the "s.p.q.r." without the "&" in long shots, and then in closeups it has the words "southeast and western."all of this doesn't interfere with the story, but the production details were obviously not looked into very carefully. still this cartoon is among my favorites with sylvester and tweety.

tiny tweet and sly the sneak are locked up in cages for a train ride to who knows where. swinging tweety begins belting out an insufferable song as soon as the train leaves the station, so lets hope that puddy tad gets him this time. sly tries out a couple of funny hand tricks but spoil sport conductor man puts the bird in a safer place amongst the baggage. the cat's next attempt has him ending up in the coal oven of the steam engine. and the chase is on. of course there's a bulldog too, and silly sly just cant keep his big mouth shut.next up the persistent pussy tries the old-stacking-of-the suitcases-bit (twice) producing a payoff tex avery would be proud of. unfortunately for sylvester, that bulldog seems to be everywhere. he even displays a talent for shape shifting and producing enormous clubs from his back-pocket. not even sylvesters ability to outrun a speeding train can save him when he is thrown off, silver streak style, several times in a row. arriving at granny's new place, (gower gulch, population 86) the cat's final attempt involves cross-dressing. but you know what happens to men in dresses, they always get more attention than they bargained for.7 out of 10

tweety is sent in his cage on a train by his old-lady owner. in the same baggage car, also in a cage, is sylvester. in no time, sylvester has grabbed tweety but a trainman comes back and slaps the "sneakin' feline," as he calls him, back in his cage. he puts tweety "in a safer place," up high and tells the cat, "now, remember: no tricks!" sylvester puts his halo on and looks innocent. yeah, right.i found the funniest stuff, however, didn't involve sylvester versus tweety but the "viscious dog" that is in another cage next to sylvester. the cat gets mouthy with him, and pays a big price in an extremely funny manner. sylvester just doesn't learn, but that's one reason we love him! (i know a number of imdb reviewers don't like tweety but i like both main characters - they both crack me up!)also, the train, and the passing scenery, is beautifully illustrated in here - really nice visuals.

ok...time for a bit of a rant i think. it's been 2 flamin' years since i submitted my original comments praising this top-rated footy comedy.....and the damn thing still hasn't made it to video or dvd (or for that matter even been repeated on the telly !!) !!!!!does anyone out there know why not ? has there been a bbc-style error whereby the original copy has been deleted/mislaid/wiped ??listen up you lot in charge of itv - whack this on to dvd now !!! do you even realise how funny this programme was ? it makes "mike bassett" look as bad as the current pants spurs team.rant over. for the moment.

i'm like the rest of the fans who love this comedy,i've been waiting for it on dvd. i've got it on vhs and got so fed up waiting for a release and worrying that my vhs copy would ruin i got the equipment to get it onto dvd. the picture and sound are excellent to my utter surprise. if anyone else want's a copy drop me a line atstone_stew@yahoo.co.uk and for £7.00 i'll put it onto a dvd,print the dvd and get it in the post to you. £7.00 just covers my costs & recorded delivery etc with maybe a little over so i'm not after making money out of it,i'd just like the world to see this ignored gem of a comedy.i recently saw a copy of ebay got for over £26,amazing. how can they not release this classic. email me for payment details like cheque or paypal etc etc

.....whoops - looks like it's gonna cost you a whopping £198.00 to buy a copy (either dvd or video format)from itv direct.ouch.sorry about this, but imdb won't let me submit this comment unless it has at least 10 lines, so...........blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah blahblah !!

to anyone who is interested, i have managed to get this on dvd from ebay (haven't received it yet - any day now).i have been desperate to get this even if it is a vhs quality put on a dvd i don't mind. so to anyone interested get in touch with me and maybe i can help you out.to be honest it's ridiculous that i've had to wait nearly 7 years to see this again but boy it will be worth it.all my mates at work are desperate to see it too.anyway i'll post later regarding the quality.just do a search on ebay if u want it guys. it's there to buy

i think this tv film was first aired the same week that manchester utd played in the champions league final (1999), they run a lot of football related items that week and this one was an absolute standout.it played on all the clichés that are churned out every season during the fa cup ie, plucky underdogs, lucky clothing/mascots, name on the cup etc and turned out to be brilliantly funny.i'm surprised it has never been repeated prior to other big football occasions, even now with the world cup just getting underway. a few previous posts from non-football fans have said they still love it, but a football fan will find it hilarious imho.

i have it on vhs but its not a great copy as i have watched it 2 or 3 times per year since 1999. i am also in fear that 'her indoors' will throw it out in the annual vhs purge.my brother and i (late 30' still laugh at the carry on in this fantastic show.tim healys lucky cup hat and telling the apprentice you can do none of that (shooting, passing etc) and he turns out to be peter beardsley.as a leeds fan i have to laugh at the empty dossier on bostock before the cup final (or did it say s**t ?)the reason i came on line today was that my bro wants it for christmas so itv please bring it out on dvd come on the underfelt men !!

as a reviewer has already commented, this made for tv comedy is up there amongst the best football parodies ever. but....having failed to video it when it was first aired, i now find that it isn't around in any format. ok, so this has only polled 17 votes to date, but a 9+ average does seem to suggest something special. basically, i suppose it's a case of tough luck if you missed it 'cos it's no longer available to view !! aaaaaaaargh.

i caught this filmshow about the most unlikely, success? ,from a lower league, football team. the plot is thick and roles out some great tenuous twists and turns. intercut with shots and commentary from the 70's .i was taken aback by its shear footy fun.a great cast includes the excellent tim healy as the crazed(drunk) manager , bumbling along hanging on to anything that will make his team win...? i keep remembering bits such as the stolen secret file that don revie( super leeds united and england manager-loved by the fans hated by everyone else)has on bostock united ( the underfelt men) which in its detailed report of their opposition, bostock united, in this the fa cup final, merely says "sh-te".lots of other footy gags a long time before the fantastic feature length "mike basset - football manager" starring ricky tomlinson.up there with the, gung ho english beating germans, at football. well morally.although the score lines says different , of "escape to victory" ( i still cheer when england score )and the thankless eternal grind of following a really bad team in micheal palins "golden gordon" from "ripping yarns" series ( with terry jones)the team were called bostonworth united ,in case your interested.i've looked high and low for a copy of bostock's cup-even nick hancock's biography doesn't list it ( probably someone -not mr hancocks- error)play it again or sell me a copy- please....

this is a true gem of a tv film. based on a completely untrue story, it follows the course of the down-and-out football league club through their course in the english fa cup, where mayhem ensues and the players all sport seventies styles. the ending is unexpected, the performances are great, and nick hancock shows that he can do something other than host sports shows. my only regret is that i didn't tape it.

this was a fantastically funny footie film. why won't they show it again? tim healy was superb, as were all the players. direction was inspired, and some of the gags were matchless. the sloping pitch had me on the floor. show it again, itv, so i can video it!!!

i am not a footie fan by any means but watched this with a friend as there wasn't anything else on the box at the time.(thank goodness). not only did we laugh from start to finish but about a week later in the pub, when we started discussing it, we made a right spectacle of ourselves with uncontrollable laughter. does that sloping pitch actually exist??? i have released my e-mail here so if anyone hears about it's future availability or a repeat on the telly please let me know. definitely the funniest thing i've seen on television!!! king leek was good too!! another tim healy classic

can't believe that bostock's cup isn't available on a proper video or dvd yet. i've only seen it once, on a dodgy copy taken off the tv and despite not being a footy fan (at all,) thought it was one of the funniest things i've ever seen.the famous sloping pitch of wherever it was, the clueless coach driver ("ponty-this, ponty-that", "i'll take the next exit"), the pointless plot; it all added up to aching sides.being stuck in the us i'm desperate for some good british humour but not quite enough to spend the amount that the production company are asking for. c'mon, get it out on kosher dvd pronto.

i can't add much to what has been said already, except i'm going to have to because of the 10 lines minimum policy.i've actually got this on a vhs-to-dvd copy, but the quality is quite poor and i desperately need for it to be officially released.i can just imagine what extras i would like to see (tim healy's character swearing his way through one of those 'football bloopers' type programmes would be great!). you can imagine it now, can't you? but of course, it looks like most people will have to carry on dreaming about a dvd release.surely to god there must be someone in the dvd releases department at itv who also knows something about british culture, is web savvy and has enough about them to look at imdb now and again? oh, well.

airplane apart, i don't think i've ever laughed at a film so much in all my life.i love football like mad, but i tend to hate almost any song or film about football as they tend to be unrealistic. this wasn't.i watched it once, it was over 2 years ago & it was brilliant. everyone i know loved it. i remember the gay physio, the sloping pitch at about a 45 degree angle and 'shoes' (a player so named because he once turned up for training in a new pair of shoes). brilliant, that's what goes on in park football.a definite 10/10. if anyone from the tv industry is reading this, considering all the crap you repeat on english tele, please have the sense to show this again (and the muppets while you're at it). also does anyone know if this was shown on bbc or itv. i think it was itv, so it's worth asking them if they plan to show it again. they should do.

.... could it be that itv wouldn't want to release this absolute classic because it would show up their current series of mike bassett for what it is? when discussing mike bassett with some work colleagues i mentioned bostock's cup as being a far superior offering and was surprised to find that i seem to be the only person in my entire office that has actually seen it. this can't be right for a film that has got to be the funniest thing i have ever seen.let's face it, itv don't have the greatest recent record for producing comedy so you would think that they would jump at the chance of at least repeating something which is genuinely funny. perhaps if it could be combined with a lucrative telephone competition of where we think the coach driver will go next then they might be interested.come on itv, there are still some of us out there who would like to watch original, quality comedy/drama. do the decent thing thing. repeat it then get it out on dvd.

as you can see i've submitted 2 comments about this show since 1991....and no, itv have still not made it available for general release.however, i recently contacted itv to see if there was any way of getting hold of a copy, and this was their reply......."unfortunately there are no plans for this programme to be released on dvd/video. you can however, purchase copies from our viewers requests dept. their email address is: viewers.requests@itv.com ".hope you all now get the chance to enjoy this classic short comedy again.

my teacher did this movie. it's a new beginning. watch it, and you won't notice that it is a romanian movie. the old boring style has gone. now it's something else. a post-revolutionary movie. it is using the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists. they are unique. you won't even know that you're watching, you will be simply transferred beyond the screen and you'll feel every frame. don't miss it, pay attention to the plot but don't ignore the details. they make the difference between this movie and the others romanian movies. you will hear some music at some point. it's representative for a part of us, but it does not represent us. please, just keep your head straight and leave your body free.

i have to say that i haven't expected that this movie to be this good. usually, the eastern cinema presents the communist past in 90% of the films. however, this film surpasses the romanian cinema, being worthy of some more advertisement. the acting is truthfully and not exaggerated, the plot is simple yet complex as it presents the life in the romanian suburbia, the sound amazed me, the directing was good and what more can i say... this "crash" of eastern europe was drawn me into the film living each moment of it. i have even felt a desire coming out of me, a desire for adventure after seeing it.watch it! you will definitely enjoy it!7/10

the movie has an excellent screenplay (the situation is credible, the action has pace), first-class direction and acting (especially the 3 leading actors but the others as well -including the mobster, who does not seem to be a professional actor).i wish the movie, the director and the actors success.

is not a bad movie but the acting and the screenplay can be better. i like this movie because i have a life that is in good part like the one in the movie. is hard for a lost generation to get a life in romania, and 90 percent of us choose something else, and that something else includes dealing with people with "bad habits" if you understand me but that comes with the territory. this movie represent me and i like it. i have a rage in me that i barley talk with people, i live in a messed up society and i can't fit in and i don't want to,and that's the story of movie also, if you r like me you can understand the true movie, if not you will find it easy and cheap.

now we know radu munteans movies, the excellent paper will be blue and boogie, but its worth to see again (or at last) this first furia, which shows perfectly clear his initial qualities. its very interesting to see how his beginners talent developed into confirming him as one of the best romanian contemporary directors.of course, the movie itself is excellent - intelligent and professional script, sure-handed direction, stylish photography. definitely, one of the best - in the most serious and competent sense! also, munteans storytelling sense is compelling and gripping - and he actors... well, they simply rock!

looking backwards to that year 2002 when "furia" was made, one can easily recognize the heralding sings of today's new generation in romania.the main qualities of "furia" stand in a very solid script, with a substantial dramatic core and a really professional developing, plus a cast of excellent actors. all four leading roles are admirably performed, both with depth and casualness: dragos bucur and andy vasluianu confirmed, since then, being two of our best performers today, dorina chiriac follows them closely, and adrian tuli, a non-professional (in real life, a graveyard manager!) cast as gabonu, was a genuine revelation! further, radu muntean's directing is skilled and expressive, creating in a very compelling style that feeling of "a fateful night" and inescapable destiny. one can easily pass over the few awkward and even failed moments, since time proved them to be only the uncertainties inherent to a debut, never repeated in his subsequent movies: "hârtia va fi albasträ" and "boogie".

i sympathized with the plight of the first man, schmitter, we see killed in this episode. he reminded me of the trepidation associated with being a lone security guard at night somewhere - the type of work i did briefly about 20 years ago. of course, i was never in danger of being burned to a crisp, as the colony chief (lynch) is fond of describing. the monster in the dark here, murdering members of a deep mining colony, creates a scary impression in the first act. we don't really see it in the early scenes and, as many of us realize, the best monsters are sometimes left to the imagination. 'big and shaggy' is one voiced description, but it actually turns out to resemble a big, lumpy pepperoni pizza, skittering along the ground like a silicon centipede - a limitation of the show's budget, unfortunately. this also shows in the latest matte painting, famous to trek fans, the only way to convey a long shot of the mining operations.but, the whole theme of this episode is about what's on the inside, rather than outward appearances, anyway. sure, this horta, a newly-discovered silicon-based life-form, looks like a mindless monster at first glance. thanks to spock's telepathic ability (probably the best use of a vulcan mind meld for plot purposes), we learn it's a highly intelligent, even sophisticated creature. besides spock's instrumental use of his talent, mccoy gets to supersede his usual medical routine - healing a creature resembling rocks or asbestos. he also gets to utter one of his most famous lines, "i'm a doctor, not a bricklayer!" i found it very true-to-life in his scene where he exults in his success, though he's unable to get kirk to share in his enthusiasm - kirk's too busy organizing results. the episode throws unexpected turns in character & motivation at the audience as the story progresses; spock champions the need to possibly preserve this discovered life as kirk takes his usual stand on preventing the deaths of any red-shirts (no half measures, as in "the man trap"). but later, it's kirk who, for some reason, holds back on firing a killing blast, as if the heat of the hunt had worn off and he'd had time to reflect on spock's point (i believe it was during this episode's filming that shatner learned his father had died). uncharacteristic for most of the first season, this has a happy ending. the conflict stems from the needs of basic capitalism, such as meeting standard quotas, versus protecting the natural environment and its inhabitants - a space age version of protecting owls from the tractors of modern advancement. somehow, despite many killings and a sense that everything could go to hell at any moment with one raised phaser, kirk and spock manage to broker an agreement which satisfies everyone. i guess people and silicates are more reasonable in the 23rd century.

"the devil in the dark" is william shatner's favorite episode. it is also one of my favorite episodes. the program is pure star trek because it deals with one of the series' main themes: the respect for other life forms. i do not think one could get a clearer example of one of the show's most interesting ideas. in this episode, kirk and his crew have to confront a monster that is killing miners on a distant planet. the story is an excuse to explore the right that humans have to destroy creatures that are a vital part of the environment. today's concerns with environmental causes make the show more relevant now than ever before. it is extremely well written and performed with gusto by our beloved cast. one memorable sequence involves spock joining with the mind of the monster. plenty of tension between spock and kirk (they want to solve the problem using different methods) adds to the fun. shatner and leonard nimoy do some of their best work here.

i rank opera as one of the better argento films. plot holes and inconsistencies? sure, but i don't think they impair this film as much as many other reviewers seem to. a lot of elements that are in many of argento's films are kinda "off-the-wall", but that's part of the draw of his films...short story: psycho stalks the opera's new leading lady. the typical argento twists and turns ensue, leading up to a decent payoff of a climax. not argento's best, but i still pull this one out from time to time. definitely worth a look if you like his other stuff - just don't get this one mixed up with the abysmal phantom of the opera remake that argento did, that one is truly awful... 8/10

the murders in opera are not actual murders as much as they are symbols of past events and parts of betty's own fractured personality. in fact, betty is the same person (a male) that suzy bannion is in suspiria, only a decade later in life (suzy was a boy of ten who befriended another boy of ten with a more mild version of his own background).it helps to think of betty's luxury apartment as a military barracks bay; she spends most of her time in her bedroom in bed next to her stereo it seems, and other parts of her apartment seem foreign to her somehow, as though other people live in those other rooms.dario argento's movies sync with a wide array of rock music, as well as funk (dario starts the syncs right at the beginning of his films, the flash of the eye in opera, and the start of a drum roll in suspiria). there are also standard movies that opera (and suspiria) sync with. for example, opera syncs with with a record album by judas priest called priest ... live (as does suspiria), and suspiria syncs very well with a kiss record album entitled kiss alive ii. movies like rosemary's baby, the exorcist, the image, and the vampire happening are sync movies argento uses which deal with the same subject matter as argento's films. these syncs, along with many others reveal betty to be a male who suffered sexual torture at the hands of his father since birth (even in the womb according to a certain anne rice novel entitled lasher).anyway, large budget films are occult works which relay spy information collected by occult means, all in synchronized symbolic/alchemical fashion. usually, the sync point in a film is the beginning of the sound score, or it is the first image of the film beyond any film company lead-in. sometimes it is more creative. the heavy metal music used in opera and phenomena are simply music syncs that were deciphered out of other films that argento's movies sync with, an intellectual game of sorts among the elite within the industry.so, betty doesn't respond normally to the murders she witnesses because she didn't ever witness a murder of any real person. "she herself" simply suffers soul murder; she witnesses her own "murder;" this individual's father almost dropped him down an abandoned mine shaft in arizon at age 4, in 1970; he was on the verge of falling off a wood plank his father balance him on before dad changed his mind and grabbed him and yanked him back off it; the kid felt nothing consciously. memories of sexual torture are lost to this individual via extreme sexual repression, and the vague memories which remain are of the big, square, deep hole in the desert and no significance is placed on this memory because of the lack of conscious trauma (the "loss of trauma," also a "buried trait," is portrayed in the 1975 film entitled the image). those sausages up in the attic in suspiria are each individual memories of the first three or so years of a life (toys in the attic).the reason betty (or suzy) is a female character is because the individual christina marsillach's character mirrors is a male who has been trained into a female role of sorts since birth (all of the dvd's of the simpsons cartoon sync with suspiria), with his very nature having been molded along "queen" lines (the x-files episodes sync with opera). this has even altered his body to be "beautiful" in the way a woman's is. behavior alters genetics. a more recent movie entitled death proof deals with the same ideas and the same individual.virtually the entire life of this person is mirrored on large budget films, record albums, and books made since 1966, and father prior to 1966 and after. the scorpions album entitled virgin killer is a suspiria sync album, the original album cover acting as a symbolic mirror image of the fall through the skylight.

if you don't like italian horror, you won't like this film. on that note..."overall... it was a terrible experience... many things happened. vanessa redgrave was scheduled to be in the film, and she pulled out. one of the actors was crushed by a car. i was engaged to be married, but by the end of the picture that was finished. my father died during the shooting... all kinds of things." -dario argento on the making of "opera"i was truly impressed with argento and the film he made here-- especially against such harrowing circumstances. the whole mystique of "macbeth" and its curse on those who attempt to stage the play adds untold volumes to "opera."throughout the film, argento imploys some of his most clever (and audience directed) tricks. a young opera singer, christina, is stalked by a violent psychopath who forces her to watch a series of brutal murders. by taping several sharp blades to christina's eyelids the killer makes it impossible for her to close her eyes, "take a good look. if you try to close your eyes, you'll tear them apart. so you'll just have to watch everything!"it is clear that argento put great care into constructing the faux "macbeth" opera on-screen, and his hard work pays off. add to this several unforgettably brutal murders, an incredibly tense chase sequence, and the genius use of pov to portray a certain character (the role vanessa redgrave pulled out on, thank god) and you've got one of the best italian horror films ever created.that said-- it's still italian horror. why christina never seems to tell anyone about this brutal murders is beyond anyone's comprehension. some scenes might be difficult for certain viewers to stomach, but personally i felt more tension towards christina and her eyes than any of the brutal slayings in the film. the finale to "tenebrae" had my stomach churning more than anything in "opera," but that's probably just me.and the last five minutes... argento wanted it, he filmed it, and he's fought to keep it in the film. absolutely no one likes it, myself included, but it's not enough to ruin the rest of the film for me. it remains one of argento's best films to date.9/10

title: opera (1987) director: dario argento cast: cristina masillach, ian charleson, urbano barberini, daria nicolodi review: the only other argento movie i had seen was suspiria and that one blew me away with its style, colors and spooky story line. i next decided to go with opera as i had been told it was one of his best. man, i think i'm discovering what will ultimately be one of my favorite horror directors.opera is about a young opera singer who gets her big break when the main star of a creepy modern opera take on mc beth gets hit by a car. betty is the understudy so she gets to do the part herself. too bad for her there's a psycho after her who makes her watch the brutal murders of her friends and co-workers.wow, id heard good things about this here flick, but i wasn't prepared for the level of greatness to which this film would take me. yeah the movie has its shortcomings to which ill get to later. but for the most part the movie blew me away.first off, this movie is not as filled with lots of colors as suspiria. i was expecting it to be a bit like suspiria in that department, but no, to my surprise it had its own look and feel. the film is somehow devoid of color. it does have lots in colors in certain scenes (like the masterful kitchen/living room sequence) where argento fills the screen with lush greens and blues, but for the most part the film has a grayish, black tone to it all through out and i liked that it had its own distinctive look.the real stars of this show are the incredibly well orchestrated death sequences. wow. every death scene was like a work of art. beauty in destruction. these are not just your typical hack and slash death sequences, these deaths were carefully constructed to shock and get the most out of its situations. loved every second of them, there's plenty of blood and mayhem here, but with style. not gonna spoil em though.then there's the direction. man, there's some really original and beautiful shots on this one. i loved the inventive use of the camera on this one. you thought that tarantinos shot in kill bill vol. 1 where we see the bullet coming out of the chamber of the gun was original? well this is the movie he lifted it from! i honestly believe that tarantino was heavily influenced by this specific movie with certain scenes in kill bill vol. 1. heck in the making of feature he mentions that the whole scene with beatrix in the hospital and elle driver coming to kill her was influenced by italian giallos, and here my friends is the proof of that. anyhows, tarantino references aside, this movie has some amazing camera shots, like those scenes of the crows flying through the crowd in the opera house...great stuff. and a main reason why argentos becoming one of my favorites.the acting from most of the cast was alright, but the best by far was cristina marsillach as the tortured young opera singer betty. the looks in her eyes as the murders were being committed were great. the rest of the cast was a little wooden and stiff, but nothing that would deter your enjoyment of the film.there were very few things i didn't like about this movie. first off logic was thrown out the window in certain scenes. specially those involving bettys reactions after shes seen the murders. it seem to me that for the longest time, she just went on about her business, not telling anyone about the whole thing. not even the police. i mean if you see someone brutally murder a loved one in front of your eyes...you don't just walk away from the murder scene and continue with your life. someone would have connected her to the murders. she might have even become a suspect herself...but no. also the ending is a bit anti climactic. you'll have to see this to understand, but it seemed a bit unnecessary the way the film ended, it felt like it could have ended earlier. it would not have felt so redundant. but thats about it, not real big problems for me really since i was enjoying the rest of this beautiful film.i've still got a lot of argento territory to cover...but i'm devouring every step of the way like if i was eating a plate of the most expensive caviar. this guys really good. i think of his films as works of art, and i've only seen two of em! cant wait to discover the rest of his films. argento, you the man! rating: 41/2 out of 5

opera opens with a very close-up shot of a bird's ever-watching eye and thus begins one of argento's most bizarre, and enjoyable, features (my second favorite in fact, behind deep red). granted, at times, the movie is pretty absurd (the lack of real concern after murders, the bird attack, the burnt dummy, that ending) but this is argento's fantastical world and once you come to terms with that, you'll find that it works. i do not mean to completely dismiss these faults though, rather that the artistry of the film more than makes up for them. for example, the aforementioned bird attack is completely over-the-top in theory, yet look at the wonderful execution of it; crows flying in chaos, adding their enraged squawking to the driving rock beat, the crowd in panic as seen through the circling, bird's-eye view camera-work, and then the focused attack; aria of terror indeed. argento's amazing, flowing cinematography is on full display in opera, and clearly one of the film's highlights. i also enjoyed the soundtrack of operatic themes and rock music, a nice contrast of music with each used effectively (the rock kicks in with the murders in perfect timing and gives the scenes a very frenzied feel). the sound effects deserve a nod too, stabs, scissors, beaks, and all.inspector alan santini: "i've seen a lot of your movies. yes, you're really an expert in this field. i'd be very interested to know your opinion."marco: "i think it's unwise to use movies as a guide for reality, don't you inspector?"inspector alan santini: "depends what you mean by reality."being that this is a giallo, stylish murders are a must and dario does not disappoint (the "bullet through the door" scene is quite possibly one of the greatest deaths ever shot, if you'll forgive the pun). the black-gloved, deep-voiced, pulsating brained (cool shots!) killer is cold and brutal, and having him tape pins under our heroine's eyes so that she was forced to watch the murders was a nice touch. that all said, as a giallo, opera doesn't quite have as good of a mystery as it should. the killer is kept secret from the audience well enough but there's little effort in the film devoted to actually solving the murders. this, and the strange ending, could've used more work. despite these problems though, opera still manages to be a worthwhile and satisfying horror film.one final note: it was nice to see a movie, for once, show the correct view through binoculars (just a circle, not two circles together)! nice eye for detail, dario!

opera was filmed in synchronization with a variety of other mass media productions (start point for opera is the initial appearance of the raven eye):the wizard of oz (synch start points are third mgm lion roar, dorothy's third knock on tin man's chest in the orchard, and dorothy's third heel click; synchs with gone with the wind)prince of darkness (synch start point is the music score start point)electric ladyland (original release version songs and sequence only)rocka rolla (original release version songs only)sad wings of destiny (original release ...)sin after sin (original release ...)stained class (original release ...)hell bent for leather (original release ...)point of entry (original release ...)screaming for vengeance (original release ...)defenders of the faith (original release ...)turbo (original release ...)

this is standard fare from a director who as long been amongst my favourites.even though its very flat in comparison to a lot of his other work but its argento and this may be biased but i'm gonna be giving it a good review anyway.it does contain a lot of good ideas. the subtle voyeuristic element. the needles under the eyes. the gory and disturbing deaths. and the argento cliché flashback.downsides include the heavy metal soundtrack, acting and the ending.all the film is made worth it for the birds in the theatre sequence near the end.a fairly good film from argento but he as done better. a lot better!
