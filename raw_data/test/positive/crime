i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film. while i am not at all a fan of british drama, i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made. i was in tears by the end of the film. every scene was mesmerizing. the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive.i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character.*******spolier alert******** i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance! ****end spoiler*****keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was sienna miller's performance that was truly oscar worthy.i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards.

i saw this film on september 1st, 2005 in indianapolis. i am one of the judges for the heartland film festival that screens films for their truly moving picture award. a truly moving picture "...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life." heartland gave that award to this film.this is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century. at that time, it was the game of upper class and rich "gentlemen", and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs. with this backdrop, this based-on-a-true-story unfolds with a young, working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world, harry vardon.and the story is inspirational. against all odds, francis ouimet (played by shia labeouf of "holes") gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the u.s. and great britain at the 1913 u.s. open. francis is ill-prepared, and has a child for a caddy. (the caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in.) but despite these handicaps, francis displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event.and, we learn a lot about the early years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the layout of the short holes, the manual scoreboard, the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths, the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways, and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain.this film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing. and with no big movie stars, the story is somehow more believable.this adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of "miracle" and "remember the titans."fyi - there is a truly moving pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years.

maybe i'm reading into this too much, but i wonder how much of a hand hongsheng had in developing the film. i mean, when a story is told casting the main character as himself, i would think he would be a heavy hand in writing, documenting, etc. and that would make it a little biased.but...his family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about hongsheng's life. i think the best view would have been told from hongsheng's family and friends' perspectives. they saw his transformation and weren't so messed up on drugs that they remember everything.as for hongsheng being full of himself, the consistencies of the jesus christ pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, he's obviously still alive as he was cast as himself) for his family's happiness. huh?the viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex. he lies on the grass coming down from (during?) a high by himself and with his father, he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window, he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all while outstretching his arms, his head cocked to the side.it's fabulous that he's off of drugs now, but he's no hero. he went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middle.this same device is used in ted demme's "blow" where the audience empathizes with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero.however, "quitting" ("zuotian") is a film that is recommended, mostly for its haunting soundtrack, superb acting, and landscapes. but, the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of jia hongsheng is actually a stage setting for a play. it makes the viewer feel as if hongsheng's life was merely a play told in many difficult parts.

i felt this film did have many good qualities. the cinematography was certainly different exposing the stage aspect of the set and story. the original characters as actors was certainly an achievement and i felt most played quite convincingly, of course they are playing themselves, but definitely unique. the cultural aspects may leave many disappointed as a familiarity with the chinese and oriental culture will answer a lot of questions regarding parent/child relationships and the stigma that goes with any drug use. i found the jia hongsheng story interesting. on a down note, the story is in beijing and some of the fashion and music reek of early 90s even though this was made in 2001, so it's really cheesy sometimes (the beatles crap, etc). whatever, not a top ten or twenty but if it's on the television, check it out.

this movie is amazing because the fact that the real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job it's like they're almost living the past over again. jia hongsheng plays himself an actor who quit everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and searching for the meaning of life while being angry at everyone especially the people who care for him most. there's moments in the movie that will make you wanna cry because the family especially the father did such a good job. however, this movie is not for everyone. many people who suffer from depression will understand hongsheng's problem and why he does the things he does for example keep himself shut in a dark room or go for walks or bike rides by himself. others might see the movie as boring because it's just so real that its almost like a documentary. overall this movie is great and hongsheng deserved an oscar for this movie so did his dad.

"quitting" may be as much about exiting a pre-ordained identity as about drug withdrawal. as a rural guy coming to beijing, class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents' acting success. troubles arise, however, when the new man is too new, when it demands too big a departure from family, history, nature, and personal identity. the ensuing splits, and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other. hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim.but what an exceptionally convincing particularity, honesty, and sensuousness director zhang yang, and his actors, bring to this journey. no clich√©s, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no requisite sex, romance or violence scenes, no requisite street language and, to boot, no assumed money to float character acts and whims. hongshen jia is in his mid-twenties. he's a talented actor, impressionable, vain, idealistic, and perhaps emotionally starved. the perfect recipe for his enablers. soon he's the "cool" actor, idolized by youth. "he was hot in the early nineties." "he always had to be the most fashionable." he needs extremes, and goes in for heavy metal, adopts earrings and a scarf. his acting means the arts, friends--and roles, but not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input. and his self-criticism, dulled by the immediacy of success, opens the doors to an irrational self-doubt, self-hatred-- "i didn't know how to act" "i felt like a phony"--and to readily available drugs to counter them. he says "i had to get high to do what director wanted." so, his shallow identity as an actor becomes, via drugs, an escape from identity. hongshen's disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual, intermittent--and doggedly his own. solitude, space, meditative thinking, speech refusal, replace therapy. the abstract is out. and a great deal of his change occurs outdoors---not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways, bridges, and high-rises of beijing. the physicality is almost romantic, but is not. the bike rides to ritan park, the long spontaneous walks, the drenching sun and rain, grassy picnics, the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific. he drifts in order to arrive, all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity. "i started to open up" he says of this period in retrospect. and the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancer's positioning (clumsy, graceful, humorous, telling) in a current circumstance. if mind or spirit is lacking, his legs can compel him to walk all night. central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles. to punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity, he smashes his videos and tv, and bangs his head till bloody against his "john lennon forever" poster. he has let down his iconic anti-establishment artist---but he's the only viable guide he knows. he even imagines himself as john's son (yoko ono), and adopts his "mother mary" as an intercessor in his "hour of darkness" and "time of trouble." (the wrenching, shaking pain in the park--hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals) "music is so much more real than acting" he says. and speaks of lennon's influence as "showing me a new way." in the mental institute, the life-saving apples (resistance, nourishment) reflect lennon's presence, as does hongshen's need to re-hang his hero's poster in his redecorated room.if lennon's influence is spiriting, hongshen's father's influence is grounding. although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drink), it is fegsen's differences from his son that underwrites his change. for the father is more secure in himself: he accepts that he's chinese, a peasant in a line of peasants, a rural theater director. and he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions. it's this recognizable identity that drives hongshen to treat him like a sounding board, sometimes with anger and rage, sometimes with humor (the blue jeans, beatles) and passivity. in his most crazed, and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar, and a fake, he exposes more of himself than his father: "all the acts i acted before were bullshit... life is bullshit." and to hongshen's emphatic "you are not my father," he softly replies, "why can't a peasant be your father?" under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother, sister, friends, inmates at the rehab inst., he makes some tangible connection to a real (not whole) self. as the long term drug effects recede, so does his old identity. indebtedness replaces pride, trust distrust. integrity banishes his black cloud. all his edges soften. "you are just a human being" he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap-down incurred for refusing medicine. back home, lard peasant soap is fine with him now. and his once "rare and true friendships" begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back-to-back fence scene with his musician buddy. hongshen says of this movie: "it's a good chance to think about my life." and i might add, become a new actor, one bound to art and life. like lennon, he has gained success without a loss of identity.

i loved this movie from beginning to end.i am a musician and i let drugs get in the way of my some of the things i used to love(skateboarding,drawing) but my friends were always there for me.music was like my rehab,life support,and my drug.it changed my life.i can totally relate to this movie and i wish there was more i could say.this movie left me speechless to be honest.i just saw it on the ifc channel.i usually hate having satellite but this was a perk of having satellite.the ifc channel shows some really great movies and without it i never would have found this movie.im not a big fan of the international films because i find that a lot of the don't do a very good job on translating lines.i mean the obvious language barrier leaves you to just believe thats what they are saying but its not that big of a deal i guess.i almost never got to see this amazing movie.good thing i stayed up for it instead of going to bed..well earlier than usual.lol.i hope you all enjoy the hell of this movie and love this movie just as much as i did.i wish i could type this all in caps but its again the rules i guess thats shouting but it would really show my excitement for the film.i give it three thumbs way up!this movie blew me away!

despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war, this film isn't too sticky and pink, because love is as a rose: with thorns, that is. the four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down-to-earth. the music and lyrics of the cabaret/chanson-esquire songs (sung b keira knightley herself) drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film, from one place to another, between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love. some people may find it too much a biopic, but it √≠s mostly a romantic story, even though it consequently follows the life of dylan thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy. london gets visualized from another angle for once, the bohemian life of dylan during the bombings of the germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms, pubs and bars. the independent women, the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger. maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film, but all in all this is a great romantic story.

i first saw this movie on ifc. which is a great network by the way to see underground films. i watched this movie and was thinking it was going to be pure drama and a story line that doesn't hold water. but it really was a worth while watch. the main character is in such rough shape, and you hate to see him deny help, but no matter what you just can't hate him. his devotion to the beatles and john lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels. the atmosphere of the film is also great. at times, you feel like you can see what he sees, feel what he feels in some situations. this movie does not leave you wanting to know more, or disliking a loophole in the plot. there are no loopholes (in my opinion). i have always been a fan of foreign films, especially now with movies being made so poorly in america. i really enjoy the foreign settings because i feel it can take you on a trip, and sometimes understand a different culture. this movie did all those things to me and more. please watch this movie and if you're new to foreign films, this is a great start.

i must say, every time i see this movie, i am deeply touched, not only by the most painful four years of hongsheng's life, but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction. it is also true that getting addicted to anything, such as drugs, alcohol, or pornography, cannot only hurt you, but also hurt your most important people in the world: your family. since family is the #1 priority in the asian culture, it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves him/her. this is actually the first chinese movie that i actually enjoy, not for the fun of it, but the elements surrounding it (superb acting, touching story, great direction) make this movie worth watching. what stands out the most is that hongsheng and his family act out the story themselves instead of having some b-movie actor trying to imitate the real person. it shows the genuineness of the movie.

my wife is a mental health therapist and we watched it from beginning to end. i am the typical man and can not stand chick flicks, but this movie is unbelievable. if you want to see what it is like for someone who is going through these type of struggles, this is the movie for you. as i watched it i found myself feeling sorry for him and others like him. ***spoiler*** plus the fact that all the individuals in the movie including the people in the mental institution were the actual people in real life made it that more real.a must see for someone in the mental health profession!

i saw this film at the rotterdam international film festival 2002. this seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival, however, as it turned out, all the more interesting.the story, of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction, is based on actual facts. moreover, the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again, this time for the film, which is partly set up as a stage play. not only do they all happen to be good actors, jia hongsheng's parents are actors in real life as well, the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards jia are very effective.jia hongsheng is the actor of some chinese action films late eighties start nineties. later you can see him in great films such as frozen and suzhou river. in between these two career paths jia becomes a drug addict and looses all drive to act or even do anything productive, except for making somewhat futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso.i like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after withdrawal more than on the horror of drugs. we really feel the pain and struggle jia is in. at the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him.the film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern jia seems to be caught in, dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him. because there are personal 'interviews' with the characters we feel like we are getting to know jia not only through himself but through others as well.the film has a heavy feel, but scenes of jia cycling through bejing and partying with his friends lighten the tone. so does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film. the music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after. this is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and modern chinese film this is a strong recommendation.

"night of the hunted" stars french porn star brigitte lahaie.in fact,many of the cast members in this slow-moving production were porn actors at the time of its frantic filming.this film is certainly different than rollin's usual lesbian vampire flicks,but it's not as memorable as for example "lips of blood" or "fascination".lahaie plays an amnesiac hitchhiker who can't remember who she is or where she came from.most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex,where lahaie is being held by some kind of medical group that's treating a number of people with a similar condition.anyway,she escapes from the monolithic office tower where the affected people are held.on a highway outside of town,she meets a young man,who stops and picks her up."night of the hunted" offers plenty of nudity,unfortunately the pace is extremely slow.the atmosphere is horribly sad and the relationship between brigitte lahaie and another asylum inmate dominique journet is well-developed.still "night of the hunted" is too dull to be completely enjoyable.give it a look only if you are a fan of jean rollin's works.7 out of 10 and that's being kind.

even if you're a fan of jean rollin's idiosyncratic body of work, you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory. for once, there's not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight ! true to tradition, the budget proved way too tight to realize the director's vision entirely. yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema, dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity. jean-claude couty's atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and philippe br√©jean (a/k/a "gary sandeur") contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesn't resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcore.shot in and around a paris office block before and after working hours, the film was largely cast with porn regulars rollin was already quite familiar with from his "michel gentil" cash-gathering xxx efforts, most notably french f*ck film royalty brigitte lahaie in the demanding lead. playing elisabeth (rather well, i might add), she's picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by robert (vincent gard√®re), driving home at the end of a long work day. barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there, elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur, even forgetting robert's name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment. prior to making love, she rightfully describes herself as a virgin (further credit to brigitte's thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly, being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the '70s) because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his. because of this nifty bit of context, the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other "commercial" interludes rollin has had to include in other works to assure funding.when robert leaves for work, he's inevitably erased from elisabeth's feeble mind. a mysterious doctor (comedian bernard papineau effectively cast against type) and his menacing assistant solange (striking porn starlet rachel mhas) move in on her during her protector's absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from. here we get one of the movie's strongest scenes as she's re-introduced to her roommate catherine (the late cath√©rine greiner a/k/a hardcore performer "cathy stewart" in a quietly devastating turn), both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared "memories" for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate. that deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and catherine's unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup. it's also catherine who gets to voice the filmmaker's compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted them.several rather explicit - if not quite hardcore - sex scenes make up the movie's mid-section and french porn aficionados should recognize the likes of alain plumey (a/k/a "cyril val"), jacques gateau and elodie delage, along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess marilyn jess whose rape at the hands, mouth and member of plumey was only present in the film's rarely screened xxx version filles traquees. the pivotal part of v√©ronique, a girl elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with, is beautifully handled by the exquisite dominique journet - in her unforgettable debut - who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in franco zeffirelli's la traviata. the six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill, the quarantined "patients" ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell, unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace. the final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of chaplin's modern times as elisabeth, approaching complete meltdown by now, and a wounded robert stumble along the railroad bridge, clumsily clasping each other's outstretched hands.

i was surprised how much i enjoyed this. sure it is a bit slow moving in parts, but what else would one expect from rollin? also there is plenty of nudity, nothing wrong with that, particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous, brigitte lahaie. there are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead, bit more dodgey, perhaps, but most effective. there is also a sci-fi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end, but i wouldn't bother too much with that. no, here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still 'alive' without memory. my dvd sleeve mentions david cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films, there is some similarity here, particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space. as i have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller, it is a captivating, nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations, including a stunning railway setting at the end.

i went into "night of the hunted" not knowing what to expect at all. i was really impressed.it is essentially a mystery/thriller where this girl who can't remember anything gets 'rescued' by a guy who happens to be driving past. the two become fast friends and lovers and together, they try to figure out what is going on with her. through some vague flashbacks and grim memories, they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool.i really liked the setting of this one: a desolate, post-modern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings. very metropolitan. groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity.surprising it was made in 1980; seems somewhat ahead of it's time.8 out of 10, kids.

i have certainly not seen all of jean rollin's films, but they mostly seem to be bloody vampire naked women fests, which if you like that sort of thing is not bad, but this is a major departure and could almost be cronenberg minus the bio-mechanical nightmarish stuff. except it's in french with subtitles of course. a man driving on the road at night comes across a woman that is in her slippers and bathrobe and picks her up, while in the background yet another woman lingers, wearing nothing. as they drive along it's obvious that there is something not right about the woman, in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen. still though, that doesn't prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to paris & his apartment. the man leaves for work and some strangers show up at his place and take the woman away to this 'tower block', a huge apartment building referred to as the black tower, where others of her kind (for whom the 'no memory' things seems to be the least of their problems) are being held for some reason. time and events march by in the movie, which involve mostly trying to find what's going on and get out of the building for this woman, and she does manage to call robert, the guy that picked her up in the first place, to come rescue her. the revelation as to what's going on comes in the last few moments of the movie, which has a rather strange yet touching end to it. in avoiding what seemed to be his "typical" formula, rollin created, in this, what i feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film. i like this one a lot, check it out. 8 out of 10.

since this cartoon was made in the old days, felix talks using cartoon bubbles and the animation style is very crude when compared to today. however, compared to its contemporaries, it's a pretty good cartoon and still holds up well. that's because despite its age, the cartoon is very creative and funny.felix meets a guy whose shoe business is folding because he can't sell any shoes. well, felix needs money so he can go to hollywood, so he tells the guy at the shop he'll get every shoe sold. felix spreads chewing gum all over town and soon people are stuck and leave their shoes--rushing to buy new ones from the shoe store. in gratitude, the guy gives felix $500! however, felix's owner wants to take the money and go alone, so felix figures out a way to sneak along.once there, felix barges into a studio and makes a bit of a nuisance of himself. along the way, he meets cartoon versions of comics ben turpin and charlie chaplin. in the end, though, through luck, felix is discovered and offered a movie contract. hurray!

i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film. while i am not at all a fan of british drama, i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made. i was in tears by the end of the film. every scene was mesmerizing. the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive.i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character.*******spolier alert******** i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance! ****end spoiler*****keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was sienna miller's performance that was truly oscar worthy.i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards.

so keira knightly is in it...so automatically we compare this film to attonement. aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning, these films are totally different.the actors work well, i think one good thing is there is no memorable person, they are a team.if you want a film where things happen, then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physche's damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined.this film have genuine interaction, perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath. no its not exciting, but it is gripping if you can empathise with these characters. at moments i wondered if this film may have been better as a theatrical play rather than a movie. we expect a lot from movies as everything is possible, and yet with theatre we allow for interaction and rely on belief.there are things wrong with it if your looking for a blockbuster, if you look for nothing and allow the film to take you in, move you, allow yourself to forget these stars, and not to judge them as actors but let them become people, you will truly ind yourself moved.go on!! give it a go!

can you capture the moment? when first you hear rain on a roof? some things are beyond the sum of their parts, expressing the poetry of life. the things that matter.poet dylan thomas captured the seemingly inexpressible "a good poem helps to . . . extend everyone's knowledge, of himself and the world around him." (bob dylan named himself after him). so why has it taken so long to make a film of the great dylan thomas? a simple biopic could have missed the point. writer sharman macdonald has taken a different, better approach.in the edge of love, she creates the world of passions and complexities that fill the poems so we can swim in them. the lives of four friends. dylan, who lusts and loves to the full. wife caitlin (sienna miller), his feisty support. war-hero william (cillian murphy), who saves him from a street brawl. and then there's his childhood sweetheart. vera. dear vera. take your breath away vera. she's caitlin's closest friend. william's wife. and, like a muse, the 'star' in dylan's dark sky.it all kicks off in the 1940 london blitz, with bomb shelters in the underground. enter vera (an impressive keira knightley) under makeshift stage spotlights. she meets dylan for the first time again in years, her heart is flushed. their eyes shine through the smoke of the room. the purity of their former passion. dylan (native welsh-speaker, matthew rhys) is no sanctified, sanitised poet. master of his vices he must experience them all fully. he introduces his beloved wife then continues to woo vera.the edge of love is a visual treat. the soundtrack leaves you wanting for more. performances are possibly the best by these actors in their careers. as a lush love story it's pretty good. as an insight into dylan thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives, not bad at all. and as a tribute to a great man, inspiring.the production has been at pains to project the spirit of dylan thomas without compromising historical accuracy too much. dramatic tension involves a pull between artistic freedom and conventional morality. audiences looking for an experience based on the latter may be disappointed. and it will play less well to audiences whose boundaries are those of albert square.sharman macdonald seemed aware of the headstrong nature of artistic freedom and its limits when she spoke to producer rebekah gilbertson (granddaughter of the real william and vera). "think of all the things that you don't want me to write about," she said," because i have to have carte blanche." for macdonald, the limits were if she should cause offence to dylan's memory. but for many artists, especially men, the limits are those which wife and family could set on them. a woman is not going to let lofty ideals interfere with practical common sense issues, and will even put her children's interests before her own (this occasionally happens the other way round, as when towering genius virginia woolf refused to let loving leonard bring her down to earth - in the hours).in spite of the tension between caitlin and vera, these two women become closest buddies. it is one of the main (and very beautiful) themes of the film.the film's colours tell a story in themselves. in a drab, wartime britain, caitlin and vera are vivid highlights in an ocean of grey. shortly after meeting vera's lit-up-in-lights stage persona, we encounter caitlin through her searing blue eyes, sparkling in a darkened railway carriage. her dramatic red coat cuts a dash through streets of colourless homogeneity, triumphing on a beautiful staircase as she reunites with dylan. but vera's lipstick red brightness is less enduring. for her, marriage is second-best, even when she has become possessed with genuine love for her husband.outstanding cinematography extends to using montage to juxtapose images, in a manner similar to poetry's juxtaposition of unrelated words to create further meaning. horrific war scenes in thessaly are intercut with screams of vera in pregnancy. giving birth or is it abortion? we are not told immediately. pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present day.constant echoes of dylan's poetry throughout the film lead us beyond earthly opposites. it reminds me of marlon brando reading ts eliot in apocalypse now. a light beyond the horrors of the world. a different way of seeing things. "i'll take you back to a time when no bombs fell from the sky and no-one died ¬ñ ever," says dylan to vera as they walk along the beach. elsewhere, caitlin recalls childhood with vera: "we're still innocent in dylan," she says.there's a time to leave your knickers at home or share a universal cigarette. (not literally, perhaps.) a time to be inspired. enjoy what is possibly the best british film of the year.

i first saw this film two years ago in the cinema, and fell in love with this dark tale of two brooding teenage sisters coping at home in their large country house with their father and step-mother. their relationship with their step-mother is strained to say the least, with the step-mother appearing to be increasingly becoming unstable in her battles with the younger girls. the film though slants with oriental style ghost effects and horror, which adds a strange and unsettling aspect to the story that on first viewing is not clear, but is all the more intriguing.the direction is incredibly good, and the acting is stunning, with the step-mother in particular incredibly good swinging from one mood style to another in the film. the large house adds eeriness, and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat. this film to me clearly shows why korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment. you simply don't get anything like this in the western world, sadly,and really i can see it being influential on film makers around the world in the next decade.highly recommended viewing in my opinion, a real joy and scare...

i just saw "a tale of two sisters" last night and really enjoyed it. i've been a big fan of asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from south korea. there aren't many jump out at you scares as in the usual american horror film, but the director does maintain the off-kilter and foreboding mood very well, especially in the awkward character interactions with each other. most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone's "there's something under the bed" fears from when they were a child, but in this case, it's the closet and the sink. i also liked how the director was able to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together. he's also good at revealing people's inner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make-up in the mirror or her sitting in front of the flickering tv. i think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hanging over you.major spoilers ahead (do not read any further if you do not want the twists of the movie revealed) i was following the story pretty well, but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part. however, i think the flashback at the end definitely tied everything together. the film is very much like "the machinist" in the way two of the character's joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions.here's my interpretation of the film. the su-yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of su-mi or the actual ghost of su-yeon that only su-mi can see and interact with. the initial stepmother that we see is, in my opinion a delusion of su-mi. there is a real stepmother, however, and she first appears in the film when she's wearing the gray pantsuit. i believe it's the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she doesn't appear until he pick her up and brings her to the house. the stepmother before that point is imagined by su-mi (perhaps part of her split personality?) that explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like she's crazy and doesn't remember anything that she recounts. i think it was su-mi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality. the film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her make-up in the mirror, which is revealed later to actually be su-mi wiping her make-up in the mirror.i think the ghosts in the house aren't entirely imagined by su-mi, and are either of su-yeon or the mother or both. in the final flashback, it is revealed the su-yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. this is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink. also, it's the hairpin that su-yeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink.the real stepmother, in the end, gets punished by the ghost of su-yeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like the ring. after that, the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death, while su-mi unintentionally played a supporting role.i wonder if the "mother" that su-yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry, in the flashback, is a ghost already. perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet. that's left ambiguous.other things that are suggested, but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother, at some point, was a nurse, perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too. it's not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself. it's also suggested that the mother had mental issues too, requiring a nurse. the stepmother alludes to this when she tells su-mi, you're beginning to take after your mother. i don't think she meant just physically.also, if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually su-mi, then there's the suggestion of incest too, since the father sleeps with her. is that why su-mi freaks out and shouts, "don't touch me" each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes? is that the "filthy things that you've done" that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father? this film is interesting in it's capacity for different interpretations. a few of the scenes, however, were kind of derivative, such as the woman in the black crawling around scene, which reminded me of the herky-jerky movements of kayako in the ju-on/the grudge films. also, the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of the ring. furthermore, just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from "the sixth sense" or "the others".overall, i enjoyed it, however, and it will be interesting to see how the hollywood remake (that's already in production) turns out. i have to be honest, i liked both "the ring" and "the grudge", so i'm not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can't be good too. one remake that i'm really excited about is "dark water" coming out this summer. i haven't seen the original japanese version yet, but both films are definitely on my to-see list.

this review is long overdue, since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made. i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making. it's practically perfect in all of them ¬ñ a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces." the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema. i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute. quite literally, ji-woon kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels. a seemingly insignificant object may be shown ¬ñ a rack of dresses, two diaries, a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack, a bottle of pills, etc. ¬ñ but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more ¬ñ a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene (or perhaps the movie in total), which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer's intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront. such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie, but in a tale of two sisters such events occur in such a rapid-fire, relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of alertness, lest they miss something important. in other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films. how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this? it's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.the most commonly cited criticism of a tale of two sisters is nicely summarized by zaphod b goode, who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent, unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions. he posits that ji-woon kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that. in reality, however, nothing could be further from the truth. a tale of two sisters provides a series of unassailably objective facts that help the viewer to identify the exact occurrences of each and every scene of the film. if our good friend zaphod had been paying attention, he would have noticed ¬ñ for example ¬ñ the series of obvious flashbacks which provide enough factual information to make sense of the film. these flashbacks convincingly contradict zaphod's assertion of complete subjectivity. the objective elements of a tale of two sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only call into question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to put forth even the slightest effort whatsoever to see them. can ji-woon kim really be faulted for the impatience of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film? i think not.please note that i will not insult the intelligence of critics such as zaphod that cannot "get" a tale of two sisters, because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of persistence. the movie spells itself out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort on the part of the viewer. yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture. you need only put them together. remember, the screenplay was written by someone with the picture already in mind ¬ñ he simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully throughout for the purpose of providing a magnificent cerebral exercise that ¬ñ when completed ¬ñ bestows an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe.don't misunderstand me. there are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design. spider forest (2004), perfect blue (1998) and donnie darko (2001) are perfect examples of this. a tale of two sisters is not. it's ironic that zaphod claims darko to be more masterfully constructed than a tale of two sisters, especially considering that darko not only provides almost no objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential deus ex machina clich√© that could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence. i'm ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence, but the contrast is an important one. although it does perplex me that zaphod would cite a movie that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that only becomes discernible thru a significant application of intellectual effort. he apparently likes his "intelligent" films in the most superficial form possible. this is evident when he makes 17 consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself. just read the threads by opiemar within the imdb a tale of two sisters discussion forum. anyone who carefully reads those threads and still asserts a lack of an objective solution to this film may as well stop watching intelligent films altogether because the answers are so damned obvious.i'd like to say more, but i've come to my 1,000 word limit. all that has been said here needed to be said. so be it now said!

i love horror films, but i think they work way better when they hide a dramatic impact behind (the devil's backbone, the exorcist, for example). this is that kind of film, and it's not only eerie and terrifying when it has to be, it is also really beautiful. a tale of two sisters starts really slow, so if you're in a hurry to see ghosts in the first 20 minutes you will be disappointed. actually this is not a ghost story ¬ñthough there are some. it's something more complex, and it's done in such a way that it beats ringu and the grudge out of the ring no sweat. a tale¬Ö is a way more clever film than those huge cultural hits, because it really cares for its characters, and the direction is flawless. every detail in this film will leave you breathless if you're the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie. the acting is superb, specially from the stepmother and the main girl. those two are worth the price of the ticket alone. do yourself a favor and watch this awesome film.

perhaps i'm one of the only avid horror fans who thinks that the recent overload of asian shockers is so over-hyped! films like "ringu" or the "the eye" ¬ñ which are praised all over the world ¬ñ simply didn't convince me and they looked more boring than frightening. well, this blunt opinion doesn't go for the south korean gem "a tale of two sisters". this is a stylish and utterly complex psychological terror-tale that really gets under your skin! the plot, based on a local folklore tale, might be a little too confusing to get this film listed among the all-time greatest genre achievements, but the atmosphere and tension-building surely provokes feelings of great respect. this is one of those few films that are impossible to label: the events in "two sisters" qualify as mind-bending horror as well as intense family drama and a deeply psychological portrait. besides a mesmerizing story, "a tale of two sisters" also has all the great elements that i feel are usually missing in asian horror films like compelling music, good acting and innovative camera-work. the mansion were the family events take place is brilliantly illustrated like a truly creepy place where secrets and danger lurk behind every door. several sequences (like the dinner with relatives or the nightly appearance in the girls' room) are pretty much the ultimate in eeriness. they really made me feel uncomfortable and i do like to believe that i've seen my share of spooky horror. "a tale of two sisters" is a terrific movie-adventure and a definite must see for asian film fanatics. a little warning for people with a short attention-span, though: this movie forces you to have your eyes and ears focused at at all time. it's also a film that requires repeated viewing, even though no one will never really "get it" for a full 100%.

the beauty. the terror. the poetry. the horror. the innocence. the guilt.maybe that's just about all i should write in this comment for a tale of two sisters. the best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it. i myself didn't even know one single thing about the history of the two girls when i went into this movie. i just took a look at the nice cover-art, didn't even read the synopsis on the back and popped it into dvd-player. i only knew that it won several prices on festivals around the world and that it came highly recommended.the dvd-cover read "the most frightening film since the ring, the grudge and dark water". though the frightening-part might be right, you can forget about the rest, because the only thing a tale of two sisters has in common with those movie is... a ghostly apparition with long black hair. it's even a bit unfair to compare it with those famous japanese movies, because this korean movie has a lot more to offer and is in fact a bit more complicated and intelligent than those others.this movie simply is a small masterpiece, and here are some reasons (without telling anything about the plot): the movie itself caught me off guard at least two times with clever surprise-twists. and just when you think you've had the conclusion (whether you get it or not, that's irrelevant for the moment) and you think the movie will end... this movie goes on a bit longer. the cinematography is amazing, using bright colors during the day and dark shades at night. the camera-work is excellent with the director sometimes choosing impressive, if not, innovating angles. some shots are pure poetry (e.g. the top-shot with the two sisters at the lake). it all looks very stylish. there are only four main characters, but the intrigue surrounding them is intense. the story itself starts a bit slow, but there's a lot of variety in tone and emotions to keep it interesting. there was even one scene (when the girls took off towards the lake) that suddenly had me remembering peter jackson's heavenly creatures. but when the horror kicks in, it's quite effective. there are also a few successful surprise-scares in it. damn, i jumped right up from my sofa. the musical score is great, and at times when it's not supposed to be scary, i couldn't help but noticing that it had sort of an italian feeling to it. a bit strange for a korean movie. but nevertheless, a great score. so much care went into every detail of this film, including a perfectly balanced surround sound.i also think that calling a tale of two sisters just a horror movie is giving it not enough credit. it's more a mysterious horror-drama that works both on a psychological and supernatural level. no matter how you look at it, this is asian horror that ranks way up there amongst the finest. it might not be gory, but it gets pretty scary at times and the subject matter is pretty disturbed. so if you haven't seen it yet, then find a copy, pop it into your dvd-player, go with the flow and make sure you give this movie your full attention for it's 110 minutes running time.there, i hope i did a good job praising it without spoiling anything.

"a tale of two sisters" is a brilliant south korean psychological horror that left me speechless.the film offers some delicious moments of ghastly horror and is extremely creepy.the small cast of actors is truly excellent,with lead im soo-jung being especially memorable in the lead role.the direction by kim ji-woon is well-handled and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous.the plot is slightly confusing,but some scenes are wonderfully eerie.the action is rather slow,but i was not bored in the slightest;i was extremely curious and intrigued.the house,where the film takes place looks incredibly menacing and isolated."a tale of two sisters" is along with "ringu" and "kairo" one of the most original asian horror films i have ever seen.watch this masterpiece as soon as possible.my rating:10 out of 10.

having read the unemployed critic's, review, i went to a screening of "radio" not knowing what to expect. thankfully, the unemployed critic now appears, to me anyway, a frustrated film director/movie critic. his review is callous and totally uncalled for!this is a movie that will make you laugh, it will make you cry and in the end it will give you a moment of pause!to paraphrase a line delivered by actor ed harris in the final barbershop scene "...and all this time that we thought we were teaching radio, truth is...he was teaching us. he treats us all the time, like we wish we treated each other, some of the time!"yes the movie tugs at the heartstrings. yes it is emotionally manipulative and yes cuba gooding jr. (in an oscar worthy performance) is a little over the top at times (see the christmas day dance scene) but you know what? so what! every once in awhile the community of america needs to be reminded what tolerance can do for our great country. we need to be reminded how great we can be.this is a solid cast. i was particularly pleased to see s. epatha merkerson, portraying radio's mother, do something outside of law and order. i always wondered, is ms. merkerson a great actor or is it the quality of writing delivered buy a strong cast on law and order. after watching this movie, it is easy to see that she is indeed a very fine actor.also joining the cast in small but important and powerful roles is alfre woodard as the principal, debra winger in a career-resurrecting role of coach jones's wife and chris mulkey as protagonist, frank clay.we cannot over look ed harris's performance as coach harold jones. after reflecting on this movie and having grown up in the deep south my self, it is hard to truly appreciate mr. harris and his contribution to this film. as coach jones, ed delivers a quiet, rock solid performance, that of a man on a mission. coach harris will not let the town or circumstances divert him from what he knows in his heart, is the right thing to do.if you see this movie, make sure you hang around for the end credits. you will be in for a treat as the real james robert 'radio' kennedy, now in his mid 50's, is shown, still leading the t.l. hanna football team on to the field every friday night.one final note. if you were a teen in the mid to late 70's, this movie is worth the price of admission, for the sound track alone!

cuba gooding jr. is back on top! jesus, he did a great job in this film! i loved this movie. its one of those feel good movies that makes you want to run out and volunteer at a mission or something. anyway, i would recommend seeing this movie in a heartbeat! well worth the price of admission. and as for cuba gooding jr., just give him his next oscar right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i just got home from seeing "radio." i've not seen such an inspiring story in a long time. my kids are ages 8 and 5 and i would like to take them so that they may "feel" the message as i did - you should seek to find the best in people and love them for who they are, not judge them for their differences. cuba gooding, jr. and ed harris both deserve academy awards for this movie. i don't know why we can't have more movies like this, rather than the junk that is served up at theatres on a daily basis.

this is a very moving movie about life itself. the challenges a handicapped person must face in a land that expects perfection is brought to the forefront for all to see and hopefully understand. it should teach the bigots of society that we are all humans, and while some of us are gifted with a mind, heart and sound body, there are decent human beings that exist in the world that are not as lucky, or maybe, we're the unlucky ones. we don't always see the beauty in the world because we're wrapped up in our 'blind' ambitions, and see it only in one light "what can this world do for me!!!". maybe we all wish we were like radio, a loving happy individual...who loves everyone.

as one who frequently goes to the movies, i have to say that this has been one of the most impressive movies i have seen this year. ed harris and cuba gooding jr. gave outstanding performances allowing viewers to get lost in the various emotions and really feel for the characters. it is nice to occasionally see a movie that does not depend entirely upon special effects but allows the characters of the story to touch the human psyche on many levels. i wish hollywood would produce more movies of this calibre.

cuba gooding,jr. will win the oscar for best actor in 2003.and ed harris will win for best supporting actor. what a beautiful and poignant film it is but be sure to bring along a box of tissues because if this film doesn't get to you, then you have ice water in your veins.it was 1976. the setting was in south carolina and the civil rights act was about ten years old. we have a white high school football coach and teacher, ed harris. then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow, cuba gooding, whose greatest possessions, including a radio, are piled into a shopping cart which is also used as his bicycle.ed harris takes a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained much later on in the film. he gives cuba the nickname "radio" and what follows is an absoutely riveting, engrossing, poignant exploration of the human soul.the movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.

inspired by true events, radio is one of the best acted, heart felt dramas i seen widely released in sometime. it definitely is one of the year's best films of 2003. radio stars ed harris, who is oscar worthy nonetheless in this film, as football coach harold jones. coach jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game. however coach jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by debra winger and sarah drew. one day radio, played by cuba gooding jr., in his best performance since men of honor, comes by the football field while the coach's team is practicing for the game. some members of the team, then tie up radio and throw him into a building. they then bang on the building and finally coach jones suspects something is wrong. he comes over and helps radio, who is frightened, and from that point on coach jones and radio shares a very special bond. radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in the football games and at school events. he also becomes coach jones's main interest in life over football which at first was his main priority before both his family and radio.the movie deals with all sorts of real life problems including what your priorities are life, accepting people for who they are even if they are different, death, and family relationships. the movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director michael tollin should be very proud of this film. the thing i liked most about radio was how real it felt. the performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes. radio had a great mix of comedy and drama. some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad. in conclusion, i feel that radio was very overlooked by critics only getting average reviews. they must have there heads up there butts because its amazing how this film can only get 2 star reviews and something like school of rock can get 3 or 4 stars it doesn't make any sense to me. also the performances as i mentioned before are top-notch and oscar worthy. in my opinion, both ed harris, who i think is underrated as an actor, and cuba gooding jr. should both get some kind on nomination for this movie. radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big hollywood movies. my final rating for radio is a 9/10.

cuba gooding jr. and ed harris are touching. this movie is really surprising. it was enjoyable from start to finish.the story is about mentally challenged man who helps out with a football team.

this is a movie you'll either love or hate. i loved it. if you are looking for suspense, great special effects, action, sophistication, cynicism, etc. you won't find it in this movie. it is a feel good movie, sentimental, positive, uplifting. the heroes of the movie are coach jones (played by ed harris), a man of strength and integrity, and radio (cuba gooding, jr.) a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world. i guess i didn't find this movie to be "sentimental hogwash" as so many did, because it felt very real to me. i know people like these. i've seen jocks who think it's fun to pick on the vulnerable. i've seen men of integrity stand up for the vulnerable. i've seen people who think high school football is serious business. i've seen people who know what really is important in life. any of these people could have been people i knew. i did laugh; i did cry. i left the movie feeling good, remembering that there are people like coach jones and radio in my world. if there aren't people like them in yours, you might not like the movie. if you don't like a movie that shows the better side of human nature, you'll hate it.

fun story of a regular guy with big dreams, this low budget film really hits home showing what it is like trying to become an acting success. great performances by lou myers and brian's neighbor, alex. i giggled alot and even cried a little.

i thought this was a really cute movie - inspiring (makes me want to try acting)- i love kelly ripa and it's nice that i can watch this in addition to all my children - i've already watched it 3 times! of course i also loved seeing joe barbara - especially since another world went off the air!

this movie was so heart warming. a true testament to an actors real life everyday ups and downs.it was truly a wonderful experience to share the passion of the actor on film and respect for what it must have taken off screen. this film is a reminder to everyone to go for there dreams!never give up!hurray for the stand -in!!!

a superman cartoona huge shipment of gold is being sent across country by train. using ultra-modern techniques, a sophisticated gang of hooded thieves try to waylay the gold. with intrepid reporter lois lane as the only passenger on board, it's superman to the rescue. but now that it's become a runaway train, can even he stop the billion dollar limited?this was another in the series of excellent cartoons max fleischer produced for paramount studio. they feature great animation and taut, fast-moving plots. meant to be shown in movie theaters, they are miles ahead of their saturday morning counterparts.

millions in gold is traveling by train to the us treasury. traveling along is lois lane to report on it. along the way the train is attacked by masked thieves. they detach the car with the armed guards in it and attack the remaining ones. this leads to a vicious fight between the remaining guards and the thieves. the thieves overpower them but then lois lane jumps in. she beats the thieves off the train (at one point using a gun) but the train starts to careen out of control. lois can't stop it and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold. good thing superman is on the way!fast, exciting, non-stop action. probably one of the best of all the cartoons. just great.

this movie is an evolutionary piece - from terminator to robocop .stan winston did the spfx !in this film, a scientist working in a sinister robotics company with a really creepy boss(they always are) gets is killed by them in a horrible lab explosion and has his brain placed inside an indestructible robot body .the rest of this movie goes on with a romance angle as this cyborg/man regains consciousness and wreaks havoc while trying to communicate with his wife, played by the gorgeous(back then in 1986) terri austin . (he tries to reconnect with his old life, like in that scene in robocop)the rest of this movie is about breaking things, while trying to defeat the evil his evil boss from recapturing him for some ill-defined 'turn humans into cyborgs' project .this film pays homage to previous movies like the day the earth stood still - - as the cyborg breaks free like the giant robot gort does .except for the 'frankenstein suite' designed by stan winston, this movie's production values are typically canadian: sleazy ! ! pam grier stars in this film as an hired killer-commando, a cheap role of the likes she was doing so much of during the 80's .as for a sci-fi horror b movie, out of 4 stars, this film ranks about a <3

the combination of amazing special effects and oscar worthy acting makes the vindicator one of the most important sci-fi films of recent years. for some reason still unknown to me this gem was found in a bargain bin, why some worthless human thought it right to dirty a modern classic by relagating to a bargain bin is beyond me. i have never been so terrified by a man in tin foil and random bursts of fire. forget terminator, robocop, aliens, and other films that blaintly ripped off this masterpiece, the vindicator is an unstoppable force.

ascending to power in 1933, hitler and his "national socialist german workers party", which of course we all know as the nazis, tightened their grip on the country more and more as the time went by. early in their rough-shod trampling of the german people, they called any and all artists, newspaper men and film makers into their nazi hq in order that the may be informed of just what the newly declared "third reich" (aka 'empire') expected of them.when the master director from the german cinema's silent impressionist and expressionist era, mr. fritz lang, was called in to meet with herr goebels; he listened attentively and said nothing. immediately after leaving the minister of propaganda's office, herr lang went directly to the train station and took a passenger directly to paris. not even going back to his residence, fritz lang did not return to germany (at least not until many years later. he remained in france; eventually immigrating to the united states of america.* mr. lang went right to work in america; creating a variety of most enjoyable, solid and substantially literate upper echelon movies for many a year. included in this sm√∂rg√•sbord of titles is today's lucky subject, western union (20th century-fox, 1941).typically a film about the old west and pioneer days needed both quality as well as quantity of cast. western union qualified on both requisites. we are treated to a fine array of starring talent as well as a supporting cast which makes just about every minute and each scene a delight to our senses.heading up the playbill are robert young, randolph scott, dean jagger and virginia gilmore. others prominently displayed are folks like john carradine (playing not a vampire or other scary guy, but a physician), george "slim" summerville (veteran character actor, silent film veteran and graduate of mack sennett's keystone comedies), chill wills (always dependable supporting player and former singer in "the avalon boys") and burly bad guy barton maclane. added to this mix, we have names like russell hicks, victor killian, minor watson, george chandler, addison richards, irving bacon, james flavin, francis ford, frank mcgrath and kermit maynard (ken maynard's bro).prominent in those american indians featured are: chief big tree, chief thundercloud and mr. jay silverheels. also featured is that one great representative of the aboriginal peoples of north america is that great, singularly impressive and memorable example of the red man, the louisiana native, iron eyes cody (born espera decorti of sicilian immigrant parents).the filming of the fine outdoor scenes was done on location in arizona and utah and rendered in the highest grade of technigolour available. (there is no monument valley; but then, that's the province of mr. john ford.) in some respects this film is a far more amazing accomplishment than we might think; for it took a sort of pulp magazine story, adapted it to the tastes and idioms of the pre-war america of the late thirties and early forties. all of this being done by a german born director who was only had been in hollywood and america for the shortest length of time.in its final analysis, western union, while it may not be the most historically accurate example of the western genre; we just don't care. it scores in all of the necessary categories needed for a great night at the movies! so, who really cares about little details such as "accuracy"? we give mr. lang and 20th century-fox a rating of ****!note: * we just saw a special on pbs station wttw, here in chicago that was all about all of the film actors, directors and other artisans whom the nazi rise to power caused to take refuge in america and hollywood. (it seems that movie folks and scientists were the biggest export for germany at this particular time; being that the scientists who built the atomic bomb, as well as the future nasa people, came from europe at this time.) poodle schnitz!!

clive barker of hellraiser fame has written and produced a fantasy horror film that is funny and exciting.the make-up done by bob keen and geoffrey portass was fantastic. it took quite an imagination to come up with these mutants that lived underground. it was really a treat to see the quality of work.it wasn't particularly horrible, as the worst creature was actually a human serial killer.i just saw craig sheffer in shadow of doubt the other day and he did a good job in this film also. nothing spectacular, but fair. this was only anne bobby's third film, and she was good also.the ending was spectacular and the rednecks got their just desserts, as did david cronenberg. ha!

this movie is masterly directed by clive barker, he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters. i think there is a sequel missing for this one, barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring lord of illusions, that is one i think was a real garbage. but i also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel nbreed has become a dark cult classic of horror films.

the film 'nightbreed' is one of the best horror films i have ever seen. overall, i'm not a big fan of horror films, but there is something about this film that is more atmospheric and different from any other horror film i have ever seen. many horror films i've seen i've enjoyed watching, however, as they are based on horror, i know that the stories are unreal, as they are fictional, therefore i can't take them all seriously. nightbeed, on the other hand, is a unique horror genre as it has a feel of realism that i've seen in very few other horror films.this films story on how a man gets murdered and ends up living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with undead monsters is the kind of story a person would get from a dreaming nightmare as its a very unique and original storyline. most horror films i've seen are all quite fake, but because nightbreed was so incredibly sophisticated and geniously directed with superb acting, especially by craig sheffer (aaron boone) amazing special effects, great lighting and fantastic dialogue, i found this film to have a sense of depth and maturity with no silly fake horror parody, whatsoever, that many other horror films have. nightbreed, as well as being horror has elements of thriller, romance and action all rapped in one. if you haven't seen this film, i recommend you watch it, as i rate it a 10/10.

shameless screen entertainment is a relatively new and british (i think) dvd-label, specializing in smutty and excessively violent cult movies ¬ñ mostly italian ones - from the glorious eras when everything was possible, namely from the late 60's up until the mid-80's. the label's selection feels like a crossover between the oeuvres of "mondo macabro" and "no shame" (they probably even borrowed the name of the latter) and they already released some really rare sick italian puppies like "ratman", "my dear killer", "killer nun", "phantom of death" and "torso". "the frightened woman" was completely unknown to me, but since fellow reviewers from around here, whose opinions i hugely value, described it as one of the greatest and most mesmerizing psychedelic euro-sexploitation movies of its era, i didn't hesitate to pick it up. this is a very weird film and probably not suitable for about 99% of the average cinema-loving audiences. if you're part of that remaining 1%, however, you're in for a really unique treat. the style, atmosphere and content are similar to jess franco's "succubus" and massimo dallamano's "venus in furs", yet they're both widely considered as classics whereas "the frightened woman" is virtually unknown. it's all a matter of profiling and good marketing, i guess. the story revolves on a literally filthy rich doctor (he lives in a gigantic secluded mansion, owns multiple old-timer cars and has a very impressive collection of artsy relics including a life-size mannequin doll replica of himself) with a bizarre and slightly offbeat attitude towards women. he considers them a threat for the survival of the male race and thus spends his days kidnapping, humiliating and sexually abusing random he picks up from the street. dr. sayer then abducts the ambitious journalist maria with the intention to completely crush her female spirit, but he slowly falls for her. just he starts to believe in actual love, she strikes back with a vengeance. this really isn't for everyone, but if you can appreciate moody & sinisterly sexy ambiances, bizarre scenery toys and psychedelic touches that seem utterly implausible and surreal, you can consider this one a top recommendation. it's slow, stylishly sleazy and totally bonkers¬Ö shameless entertainment, all right!

dr. sayer(philippe leroy), a wealthy physician with psychological issues regarding the opposite sex, kidnaps an employee, maria(dagmar lassander), a free-thinking liberal woman who believes men must be the ones "fixed" instead of females. sayer retreats to his palatial estate, running maria through a humiliating series of mind games, threatening to molest and kill her. sayer's desire, it seems, is to dominate her body, mind and soul, making her his sexual slave, obeying his commands, adhering to his every wish and whim. after resistance, at first, maria slowly teeters towards his objective, but has plans of her own..she says she wishes to help sayer relinquish his sadistic behavior towards women, so that he could love and not feel such yearning desires to harm. it seems that sayer has her under his grip, agreeing to certain rather embarrassing scenarios(..such as lotioning his toes, "making love" to a blow-up doll which is a recreation of himself, often spending time topless, and even getting hosed down when she slaps him hard across the face bringing blood from his nose)which almost break her, but something happens as the troubled doctor slowly falls in love with maria..and through what appears to be a desperate attempt to end the madness, maria gains an upper hand, toying with sayer's lust for her body.more of a battle of wills, a kind of sexual warfare where it seems one is in charge when in fact the other truly has the upper hand. through a great deal of the film, sayer mistreats maria, forcing her(..it seems)to submit to his series of psychological games of a sexual nature. her attempts to escape fail because his home is such a well designed fortress..it's a typical european art deco kind of palace, fashioned and orchestrated by a man who has kept to this weekend retreat of his for quite a spell(..it features walls and doors opening at his command, with an area quarantined off for his "victims"). but, once maria seemingly downs a bottle of pills as a result of her anguish at his hands, the tables are turned and she has him where she wants him. he finds that he actually craves her and maria uses this to her advantage, playing hard to get when sayer wishes to embrace and ravage her(..and, i could understand his frustration because she has this allure that can drive a man crazy)i felt the film works, ultimately, as a war cry for women, their empowerment and uprising against men who have the notion that they should always have control, sexually and mentally. the "twist" finalizes this ideal. i couldn't swallow sayer's fate because of his rigorous cardiovascular activity and exercise regimen..we see how he develops his toned athletic figure, and how this regimen is part of the normal routine every weekend before the true mind games with his victim begin. if he is so well fit, and spends such time developing himself for the extracurricular activities which follow his regimen, how could he suffer the fate which follows his finalizing the deal with maria at the end when she stops resisting his advances? maria, he would later admit, is the first he's actually kidnapped; others from the past, call-girls, were paid for their services so that sayer could feel the power of dominating a woman, even if it's all a fictitious charade brought about by a deeply troubled individual with an inability to connect with the opposite sex. the spontaneous decision to do so, to take a leap from the norm, costs him more than he could ever know.all this psycho-sexual sub-text is rather fascinating to see unravel, but dagmar lassander, such a yummy sex kitten, was my reason for enjoying it so..without her, i couldn't have liked it as much because she's vital as a victim worth striving to obtain. perhaps the film's highlight, the delicious dance as lassander, clothed in gauze(!), unravels the wardrobe exposing her breasts to a jazzy score..it's the kind of sexually seductive moment that makes your mouth water and forehead sweat. dagmar lassander must've been a joy for fashion designers because she wears those clothes so well..she has this kind of cool, a sophistication and screen presence along with her beauty and seductive powers, dagmar transcends the part to create an iconic character which would define her career..even if the film isn't well known(..i found about through word of mouth). the provocative nature of the script and risqu√© subject matter might not appeal to certain crowds as it deals with sex(..and pain) in many different forms, the dialogue quite illustrative and elaborative. at times, i couldn't help but chuckle at sayer's comments towards an imprisoned maria, regarding how he enjoys making women suffer, and the thrill he gets at forcing them into a type of slavery(..in an attempt to make the words poetic, it all feels rather hokey). but, dagmar is the real reason to see it, and the film, to me, works at it's best as a fetish film, a possible male fantasy with this seemingly prim and proper idealist, captured and held against her will, forced into a precarious situation, her fate possibly at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist. her submission, and how she reacts towards his aggressive behavior with her(..there are times where she unfolds to a wavering desire to embrace him, unveiling a possible attraction towards him which, in itself, might startle some who watch it)are among the most fascinating highlights of this exploitation feature. my other favorite scene, besides the dance, is the piano concerto with sayer fondling maria as she plays a soothing melody.

if you need that instant buzz that only late 60s/early 70s euro sex movies can give off, then look no further for you have just stumbled across the mother lode ! subsequent tv director schivazappa's exercise in psychedelic porn (of the soft core variety) may not generally be considered as a classic of its kind but it knocks many better known titles from the likes of tinto brass, jess franco and joe d'amato for a loop. radley metzger sure was hip to this way before anyone else when he picked up this marvelously twisted little number for us distribution through his company audubon. gorgeous cinematography (favouring symmetrical compositions) may elicit cries of 'pretentiousness' from those who swear by shoddy skin flicks shot in someone's backyard. hey, as far as i'm concerned, it's their loss for this is one thrill ride of a movie with twists so, well, twisted that you may not even believe them after you have actually witnessed them on screen ! dagmar lassander (immortalized as the gone to seed landlady from lucio fulci's house by the cemetery) has never looked more exquisite than she does here, subtly portraying the innocent (?) researcher held hostage by mad medic philippe leroy (with all the art-house favorites to his name, you wonder whether he has the good humor to mention this one on his c.v.) as their initially violent 'relationship' turns to s&m-tinged love story. nothing is what it seems however in this sick and imaginative gem of a movie with several truly erotic moments achieved with surprisingly minimal nudity. i for one was completely baffled and enchanted by the way schivazappa chose to suggest oral sex during one scene (i'll let you find that one out for yourselves...) and lassander's gauze-clad boogie to an impossibly groovy 60s tune should have become iconic in a way similar to the image of sylvia kristel reclining in that wicker chair in her emmanuelle days. you may not know this film just yet, but trust me, once seen you'll never forget it !!!

it could not have come from a different country nor from a different time. this movie simply oozes psychedelia influenced late 60s italian cinema. so, pseudo serious and sexually free. sumptuous settings and dreamy music make this a visual and aural delight. plus we get the lovely dagmar lassander, surely at her very best looking. the kinky goings on make for a wild ride and if the romps amidst the mimosa towards the end seem overlong it is but another rather charming trait of the time. you were probably expected to split those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and it does of course herald a twist in the proceedings. it might have been better if philippe leroy didn't look quite so odd with his fraying red hair and twisted facial expression. he does well though and has many silent moments where dagmar is cavorting and he has to show a mixture of love and hate. not an ordinary narrative film by any means but for those who like that something different, this is certainly that.

i had a great time watching femina ridens a couple of mornings back, somewhat hungover. for most of the film its pretty much a two hander, showing the games and weird relationship of crazy doctor philipe leroy and stunning dagmar lassander. i'd seen her before in a couple of fulci films dying gruesome deaths, but here she is young hip and beautiful. the film is pretty predictable and certainly mild on the exploitation front, but entertaining throughout owing too its marvellous colourful kitsch feel. the set design, music, lighting and cinematography are all classic late sixties italian style, a surreal feast for the eyes and ears and though the general thread of the plot is not too difficult to foresee there are more than enough unusual events and memorably bizarre sights and sounds to keep things interesting throughout. both leads are pretty good, and it bears repeating that dagmar lassander is really, really fine. the music, by stelvo cipriani is gnarly too, perfectly suited to the images. director pierro schivazappa has come up with quite a cracker here, but its not perfect. though very alluring, there's little substance here and the exploitation elements are about as mild as can be. i guess this gives it a sort of charm and innocence but i can't help thinking that the subject matter could have done with more sleaze, more threat, that sorta thing, especially since its pretty simple to figure whats going to happen. this is i suspect a bit pointless for stronger exploitation fans and certainly not for people wanting sex or much nudity. its more of a light, fun pop art affair, lovable but insubstantial, like bubble bath. recommended mainly for those fond of the 60's, dagmar lassander, or sweet set designs.

as with footprints (1975), i became aware of this one purely by accident: it was mentioned in a review of the libertine (1969), which i researched when that film turned up on late-night italian tv, as being in a similar vein; incidentally, i missed out on that screening of the libertine (though i acquired it via the same channel later on) but did manage to watch the film by way of a rental of the english-dubbed r1 dvd during my sojourn in hollywood in late 2005/early 2006. actually, in view of the enthusiastic reviews for it, i was let down by the libertine ‚Äì being too light-hearted in nature for what was essentially a serious theme (the sado-masochistic relationship between a young couple)!; to be honest, for much of the time, i was afraid that the frightened woman would go the exact same route‚Ä¶but was subsequently amply redeemed by a wicked (if not exactly unpredictable) final twist.the film concerns the freethinking social attitudes and dazzling creative arts prevalent in this era: an eminent philanthropist (philippe leroy) invites a female journalist (dagmar lassander) at his fashionable home for the week-end; however, it transpires that he‚Äôs a misogynist who distrusts all members of the opposite sex and would rather dominate (or even kill) them! therefore, for the first half of the narrative, we see the heroine enduring pain and humiliation at leroy‚Äôs hands (including being forced to make love to a dummy in his own image!)‚Ä¶until the tables are subtly, but unsurprisingly, turned: she not only emancipates herself from his control, but teaches him that man and woman can co-exist harmoniously ‚Äì except that lassander‚Äôs following her own personal agenda as well!! the leads are perfectly cast, and the film itself often darkly comic for those in the mood; furthermore, it‚Äôs greatly abetted by a typically effervescent ‚Äúeuro-cult‚Äù score (from the ever-reliable stelvio cipriani) and the imaginative ‚Äì even outr√© ‚Äì look (the giant structure depicting the lower section of the female form, with a steel-trap where its sexual organ should be, seems to emanate from freud: incidentally, this prop figured prominently in stills i‚Äôd seen previously from the frightened woman‚Ä¶but it barely registers in the film proper!). other bizarre touches include the preposterous radio program ‚Äúsexual aberrations and the stars‚Äù, and an idyll at a castle belonging to leroy‚Äôs family complete with secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarfish manservant. one of the highlights, then, is easily lassander‚Äôs erotic dance virtually in the nude ‚Äì an episode which actually spearheads the ‚Äòhumanization‚Äô of leroy; eventually, the two characters have a ‚Äòshowdown‚Äô in the latter‚Äôs pool ‚Äì amusingly set to a spaghetti western-type theme! in the long run, for all its stylishness, the film emerges as inferior to the similar but much more extreme contemporaneous japanese masterpiece by yasuzo masumura blind beast (1969). finally, it‚Äôs worth noting that the frightened woman was distributed in the u.s. by film-maker radley metzger‚Äôs company audubon films; he would even employ its production designer (enrico sabbatini) for his own camille 2000 (1969)! to get to the edition i watched: apart from the usual shortcomings in the english-dubbing department, the presentation here was further marred by a rather washed-out appearance and brief instances of distracting extraneous noise on the soundtrack! by the way, there seems to be some confusion with respect to the film‚Äôs running-time: its length given on various sources ranges anywhere from 84 to 108 minutes ‚Äì all i can say, however, is that the copy i own ran for 87 minutes!

from today's point of view it is quite ridiculous to rate this film 18 (or x in the us). the film has a sexual, yet sublime erotic story to tell, but the pictures are rather innocent. throughout the movie you feel and see the spirit of the late 60s and early 70s in the fashion, the dialogues and the typical experimental cinematography and lighting. and this is exactly the part that makes it worth seeing.

one year after 'love thy neighbour' made its i.t.v. debut, it followed the route taken by 'on the buses' and 'steptoe & son' by graduating onto the big screen, in a picture made by hammer films. it opens with a stirring patriotic speech lauding the virtues of england's green and pleasant land, then cuts to a shot of eddie and bill walking up a street, arguing furiously. this escalates into a strange sequence of white and black neighbours vandalising their each other's homes. at least the original theme tune is retained ( even if it is sung by someone other than stuart gillies ).the local paper - 'the gazette' - is holding a contest to find the best neighbours, the winners landing a mediterranean cruise. barbie suggests to joan that they should enter. the thing is, can bill and eddie stay friends long enough to win it? that's the main part of the plot. the film is by and large episodic. one chunk is lifted directly from season 1, namely bill and eddie going to the club pretending to be on 'union business'. in reality they're going to see a stripper ( not meeting two girls ). another portion of the movie has bill, along with other black factory workers ( in the series he was the only one ), breaking a strike eddie has helped bring about by various ploys ( including being smuggled in through the gates in beer barrels ). while another ( seemingly inspired by powell and driver's 'for the love of ada' ) sees eddie's talkative mother ( the magnificent patricia hayes ) getting friendly with bill's father ( charles hyatt ).the climax to episode 1 season 1 reappears in an expanded form. bill once more puts on paint and a towel to terrify eddie, but his friends join him, and they dance round a drum containing a naked booth, so that they can pretend to cook and eat him. eddie then has to make his way home in the nude ( surprisingly, there is less nudity here than there was in episode 2 season 2 ).the film ends with the reynolds and the booths winning the 'love thy neighbour' contest, and taking the cruise together, but there's an unexpected twist involving joan's sex-mad brother cyril ( james beck - 'private walker' of 'dad's army' ), who is working as a steward.this is your typical '70's sitcom-into-movie, with all the faults usually prevalent in such films. the laughs are scattered about, and interest wanes after about half an hour. the cast is augmented by familiar faces such as melvyn hayes ( cast as 'terry', a character from episode 2 season 1, played on that occasion by leslie meadows ), bill fraser ( as the factory manager ), anna dawson, andria lawrence ( who seems to have been in every '70's british comedy film, mostly cast as nymphomaniacs ), and arthur english. the director, john robins, was also responsible for the 'man about the house' movie.funniest moment - while eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory, bill paints his face black. the first he knows of it is when the manager's secretary screams in terror. the tables have been turned!

this is a great comedy, highlighting what it was like to live next door to racist bigot. but also shows that both main characters are actually as bad as each other. based on the hit itv comedy, this is very politically incorrect. and its all the better for it, comedy after all is to entertain. the movies only real drawback is there isnt much of a plot. however the cast are as great as usual. jack smethurst and rudolph walker make one hell of a team, playing off each other in a oneupmanship kind of way.it's been many years since i saw this movie and last week was finally able to buy it on dvd. the fact that the movie still contains genuine laugh out loud moments, means that i can recommend this movie, just like i would of back in the 1970's.

a slick production which holds the interest from the very first scene where max is choosing a ring in a jeweller's shop. much of what follows reminds us of shakespeare's "a mid-summer night's dream" in which demetrius and lysander fall in love with each other's girl-friends. here max and lucien both prone to love at first sight get mixed up with lisa and alice, and alice complicates things when she calls herself lisa. on top of the merry mix-up, max is inclined to get involved in incidents which bring back memories of two years ago. and because max has a lot of these dreamy episodes we are subjected to one flashback after another,too many in my opinion because at first viewing of the film , i wasn't quite sure if i was in the present or the past.there is much running down corridors, stairways, through doorways, into elevators etc. i accept all that in a fast-paced film but do we have to have so many people colliding with each other? after four collisions it ceases to have any impact, if you'll excuse the pun. high marks for art design! the apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor, but i do ask myself how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in paris. saving a person intent on suicide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it is in this film too when max almost exits at the same time. however a kiss or two soon makes him feel better. if you can manage to find your way through all the flashbacks, you'll finally find yourself at the airport where max's devoted sister gives him a most affectionate kiss. it can be said it is she who resolves the complications of love, like puck in a "mid-summer night's dream".

a movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot. the film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actor's innermost feeling. max, who has lived in new york for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there, comes back to paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend. non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well. the three women max has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations. his fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see. she gives him also no love but only stability. true love also cannot be found in his relation with the ex-girlfriend. merely a fantasy for him to escape - many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems amenable. the one who really animates max's life in fact is her best friend. the equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because max has understand much more about his innermost feeling. the nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated. not equally ingenious as "pulp fiction" but things seem much more natural in "the apartment". max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to romane bohringer. the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful. a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing. 

this is easily my favourite film. a tragic romance intertwined with a complex mystery whose threads are all but invisible until they all unravel at the end in one fantastic rush. sheer brilliance.i'd love to see some more of gilles mimouni's work, but at least according to imdb, he hasn't made any other features. has the high quality of this work made producing another too daunting a task? has he moved (back) into some other sphere of creative endeavour? i certainly hope this won't be his final feature but i can't really blame him if he decides to stop with this gem as his only contribution to the world of feature films.

so here's a bit of background on how i came to see this movie. as you probably know, this is the original french film, that was then remade (quelle surprise) by hollywood as wicker park. well i avoided that movie like the plague when it was first released, simply because, a) i knew it had absolutely nothing to do with wicker park, and living in chicago, i didn't see why they called it that - it was filmed in fricking canada for a start! - b) i have a very hard time bothering with pointless remakes, done purely because hollywood thinks we're too bone idle to read a few subtitles (i am dreading the remake of infernal affairs by the way) and c) i can't stand josh hartnett, 'nuff said there. however, i came across wp on tv the other day, probably about half an hour in, and i have to say initially, it made no sense at all, until about half an hour from the end, when it started coming together. by the end, i was really surprised to find myself really into it, and then the ending just seemed so good - a perfect combination of story, passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices i've ever seen (heard??).since then i've heard a lot about the l'appartement vs. wicker park argument and looking at wp, i still say it has bugger all to do with chicago, but there seemed something about it that i liked, so when it was on again, i watched it again - unfortunately, still missing the first chunk (i've still yet to see it!), and i still thought it was pretty good. heck, even josh hartnett seemed good! but i was curious about l'appartement and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. so i waited and waited to catch l'appartement somewhere somehow. netflix let me down, so i ended up getting a copy from some website in ireland. and i've just watched it. it's really kind of weird, but a good weird. a classic french film. great acting, romane bohringer is an absolute gem - sorry, but she acts monica bellucci off the screen in every scene. vincent cassel was a weird choice for the lead but by the end he works. and i've seen jean-philippe ecoffey in a lot of movies and i just love him - the scene where alice dumps him in the restaurant and he just looks like someone's told him his puppy's been run over was excruciating! but, i can honestly say, having seen wp and pretty much expecting that to have been a scene for scene copy (as about 75% of the rest of the movie had been - maybe in a different order, but come on, the scene with the coffee in the glasses?? word for word!!), you can imagine my surprise when i watched the ending of l'appartement!! i can literally say i was blown away - hmm, a bit like poor old lucien was through the cafe window really! so, be prepared, if you've seen wicker park and you fancy taking a look at the original like i did, do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie, because you'll either be disappointed, or exhilarated at a piece of french movie history - a prime example of how you can watch a movie, think you're going to watch a pithy happy ending, and get whiplash from the total spin in the opposite direction right at the end. definitely catch this movie. oh and while you're at, maybe not too near the same time, but down the road, take a look at wicker park, it'll surprise you too.

gilles mamouni is playing with the audience with the story of max (vincent cassel) in search of his biggest lost love (monica bellucci) just before to get engaged to another woman. mamouni uses many flashbacks sequences without warning so the best way to know where we are in the story is to watch for the actor's haircut. oherwise it can get very confusing... still a strong film debut for mamouni, beautifully photographed by thierry arbogast (the 5th element, the messenger), and monica bellucci is a darling to watch ... i felt a little disappointed near the end so i gave it 9 out of 10.

i loved this. it starts out as a fairly normal, slightly ponderous french art movie and then all of a sudden, halfway through it's turned on it's head. this part is brilliant as you realise you have been watching 2 plots not one. sadly, the ending doesn't make much sense, which is a great shame. oh yes, and it's brilliantly filmed.

this is a wonderful thriller i watched many times and never can get enough of.it's all about the obsessive love 5 people have for eachother in paris, (un)lucky coincidences, false identities.the music makes it really gripping.there are hardly any flaws in the characters,just the end is not very credible,but a definite "must-see" still.

a very enjoyable french film. this film has many twists and turns in the plot and is superb. i have found that when i lend this dvd out to a friend it seems to do the rounds before getting back to me!! it is really all about a man making sure he finds the right girl to settle down with.

several years ago i saw this film, without subtitles, on television, and despite me not understanding a word of what the characters were saying i still got the general idea, and the mood of the film fascinated me no ends.at long last i saw it again a few weeks ago. my heart skipped when i saw the picture in the television guide, and for 8 days until the film was really shown i told everybody i knew to go and see it. the story reminded me a bit of alfred hitchcock's vertigo. a slow, brooding film about a guy who one day believes he sees the girlfriend that disappeared years before. what follows is a wild rollercoaster ride of flashbacks, changing perspectives and really inventive twists in the plot, and at the end of the film i was left breathless. i had definitely not got what i had expected (and i had actually already seen the film!). be prepared to be confused.9 out of 10

not all movies should have that predictable ending that we are all so use to, and it's great to see movies with really unusual twists. however with that said, i was really disappointed in l'apartment's ending. in my opinion the ending didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie and it basically destroyed the story that was being told.you spend the whole movie discovering everyone and their feelings but the events in the final 2 minutes of the movie would have impacted majorly on everyones character but the movie ends and leaves it all too wide open.overall though this movie was very well made, and unlike similar movies such as serendipity all the scenes were believable and didn't go over the top.

magnificent, original, beautiful movie. the acting is great, the settings en decors are superb (paris at its best- but then the real paris, not the famous settings) and the music will do also. a brilliant storie, very detailed, which i just very much love.the best french movie i've seen (and french cinema is very good)!

i think the film makes a subtile reference to rouge of kieslowski, as the whole atmosphere gives me a feeling of red. it seems to be that a lot of the backgrounds contain red, think of the tea-room f.e. i also think this is one of the greatest movies of the last years.

l'appartement is, i think, a very purposeful hitchcockian film. the plot was rife with symbolism (ie the white and red roses) and plot twists which wrapped themselves up neatly. the look was very parisian and pulled you closer to the story. i saw it in london and very much regret that it is not out on video in the states

an obsessive love story, where the characters have been extremely convincing. i think this film highlights the talent of professional actors. specially for vincent cassel who wouldn't (at the time it was filmed) be the first character you think of for such a role. and yes he did succeed to seduce the beautiful monica belluci, beyond the film, during this creation. i can only say, that this film should have been released at it is in the usa, instead of thinking of doing a remake. it is simply so french, almost perverted....and yet so true...this film should stay untouched...a director that should definitely get more projects as this kind of subject requires the right amount of ingredients to not make it a flop..

in this tense and character-driven romantic tragi-comedy, we are given an insight into the intertwining lives of four thirtysomething parisians. at the centre is vinz cassell's portrayal of max. a starry-eyed romeo, he falls head over heels for beautiful stranger lisa (bellucci). encouraged by his put-upon best friend lucien (√©coffey, in an understated but effective performance), he wins her heart and they live happily ever after... that is, until the scheming, neurotic and obsessive alice (the versatile romane bohringer) becomes very involved in the lives and loves of the other three.the rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological jumble, and the movie emerges as an intricate jigsaw, the eye-candy of picture-postcard paris at the heart of it all. the use of colour does not go unnoticed, particularly in lisa's spectacular apartment (presumably accounting for the film's title), where the reds and yellows provoke the fires of passion and lust.the audience can relate to max: he truly wears his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by irony and circumstance for it. in one memorable scene, our fated lovers (agonisingly separated by a 'choreographed' misunderstanding) narrowly miss out on the chance meeting that would surely reunite them. independent of one another, they travel to the same destination: her on the metro, him in a taxi, practically t√™te-√†-t√™te. yet fate seems to have it in for them, and the audience is captivatingly teased.the performances in this film are really what make l'appartement stand out. i still cannot understand why vincent cassell is not a big star outside france. he has presence and diversity in abundance. monica bellucci (cassell's real-life spouse at the time of writing) has recently found fame in the anglophone film industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - true, she is divinely beautiful, but behind that is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in classic 'leading-lady' style, which many british and american actresses dismiss in favour of the all-too-easy 'subtle' approach.all in all, watch this film! i doubt you'll be disappointed. it is gripping, satisfying, amusing, sad, lavish, and a lesson in artistic film-making.

...means "take up and read", which is precisely what i felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film.von ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of tobias wolff's 1995 new yorker article of the same name. the incredible performance by tom noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired. the nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle, clever, and make the film cinematically more dynamic. it's lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again.watch out for this young director...he's going places.

after the funeral was absolutely superb, and by far the best episode of the season. i was disappointed with cards on the table, that started off so well but let down considerably by the last half hour, and i didn't know what to think of taken after the flood, though i do remember being confused at the end. after the funeral as i've said is one of my all time favourite poirot episodes, up there with five little pigs, sad cypress and the abc murders. i was afraid that they would ruin the story, but instead it is very faithful to the book. now i will say i don't mind changes to books, and try not to compare movies and tv adaptations to their sources, except when the book is a masterpiece and the adaptation doesn't do it justice. that's why i disliked some of the marples like nemesis and sleeping murder, and so far out of the poirots the murder of roger ackroyd, taken at the flood and cards on the table are the only ones that really did disappoint. everything else ranges from good to outstanding, even the recent appointment with death, despite the many deviations from the book, which i admit isn't a favourite, was surprisingly good, thanks to the marvellous production values, stellar ensemble performances and outstanding music score. back to after the funeral, the production values are fantastic. it has a really cinematic feel to it, and the stunning photography and splendid scenery and costumes made it a visual feast for the eyes. the music was very stirring and even haunting, and the entire cast give wonderful performances. david suchet is impeccable as always as poirot, and geraldine james and anna calder marshall are just as terrific. but for me, the standout was monica dolan as mrs gilchrist, she is up there with donald sumpter and polly walker as the best supporting actor/actress in a poirot episode, that's how good her performance was. all in all, a must see, one of the best poirot episodes by far, and one of the more faithful ones too. 10/10 bethany cox

for those of you still in the dark, i will not spoil this christie, as it is definitely one of her finest works, and i stress that you should see it whenever you next have free time! if any of the adaptations are to be watched before (or in lieu of) reading the book, i would suggest "after the funeral" for the following reasons.i wanted to praise the performance by monica dolan (miss gilchrist), whose employer-companion cora is brutally murdered at the outset of the film. her portrayal of a shocked, nervous, insignificant woman is actually moving, especially when she has a moment of personal connection with poirot, another person who travels alone in "the journey of life." and when the murderer is being revealed in typical poirot denouement fashion, dolan's reactions to the revelation are acting at its finest: you feel as angry at the murderer as you do sympathetic to miss gilchrist... something uncommon in christie lore.although there are a couple of discrepancies between novel and film adaptation, as per usual (the business of the will perhaps making less sense in the film), the unbelievably lavish recreation of post-war england, thoroughly high calibre of acting and directing, and preservation (if not heightening) of christie's mystery and intrigue render these discrepancies insignificant.bravo suchet, dolan and the whole team for crafting this masterpiece of murder mystery theatre, and the producers who gave it the green light! encore!

aunt cora had always been tactless, and her well-bred family ignored the remark she made after her brother richard's funeral: "he was murdered, wasn't he?". they remembered it the next day, when cora was found brutally murdered with a hatchet...for some reason, the poirot movies this year have been far from faithful to the original book. i was disappointed about the changes made in cards on the table-- my favourite poirot book. after the funeral is my 2nd favourite poirot book, and i was scared the story would be destroyed. it wasn't! the movie was nearly page-for-page faithful throughout, right down to the killer's motive! all the actors were wonderful, but my favourite has got to be monica dolan, who gives a great performance as miss gilchrist, the companion to the late aunt cora. without a doubt the best poirot movie ever!

david suchet is agatha christie's mustached detective hercule poirot in "after the funeral," produced in 2005. anyone who has heard david suchet speak with his own british accent knows what a shock it is, because his accent as poirot is so perfect and organic to the character. suchet is the poirot of agatha christie's books, and although i confess a love for peter ustinov in the role, his portrayal doesn't have that much to do with what christie wrote.in this episode, poirot is asked by a solicitor friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients. enroute on the train, the solicitor recounts the events after the death - a strange will disinheriting the expected heir and the pronouncement of the man's sister that he was murdered. when poirot meets the family, he discovers adultery, lots of secrets, another will and murder.the story is excellent with rich production values and a wonderful, detailed depiction of the time period. all of the acting is superb, particularly from monica dolan, who plays miss gilchrist. poirot here is without hastings, his beautiful office, or miss lemon but he's effective nonetheless.i had the privilege of seeing david suchet on broadway in "amadeus." breathtaking. what an actor - when he's playing poirot, all i see is poirot.

i was surprised that i liked this movie. but it reminded me of a 2004 version of the first friday the 13th. there were a number of cheesy elements, yet at the same time there were many cool ones. the story line was good--predictable if you have seen more than one or two horror movies, but full of one-liners to make it worthwhile. there are some memorable scenes worth watching. a few issues i had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters. for instance in the opening scene the scarecrows (which were humans on stakes, whose blood was drained to grow the crops), looked very real, but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue colored masks. there were more than several gaps in the plot, and the acting was mediocre, but at least it sounded like how real people talk, unlike hollywood movies where the dialogue is really fake sounding when you think about it. the culmination of the last scene, when the main character says "i'm not a baker, i'm a connell!" and lops the head off of the scarecrow is satisfying, as his friends have for the most part been killed off by these creatures at that point.

this movie was to me a fairly enjoyable watch, i mean it wasn't great but it was one of the better horror movies of late. it seems to have been low, almost state benefit budget size but it has it's charms like the lovely ladies in it. the atmosphere was good also (which is what is missing froma hell of a lot of horror movies these days). the acting was your typical 80's low budget affair, that being in case you don't know is that it is "dud" acting. but that is what lucio fulci's movies were full of, they like this movie had atmosphere what they were lacking in storyline and money etc. they more than made up for in the horror & gore & atmosphere for the movie it's self.it is just a typical low budget horror movie that is watchable, i watched it all the way and i love horror movies. i've seen movies where i just turn off within 10 to 20 minutes or sit and fast forward it if it's on video, or skip scene's on the dvd. this movie didn't make me want to do that, i sat and watched it all the way to the end, without wanting to skip parts.i would have liked it however if the zombie type folk in this were a little more scarier as they were about as scary as having freddy kreuger as your babysitter, not. but seriously though if they were a little better it would have been low budget perfection, maybe.the music in this movie was top notch stuff, ideal horror music so it was. i've seen horror movies where the music is good or average but it could have been better, thank goodness though this movie didn't have nay of the metal music in it.i've been a die-hard metal fan since 1990 but in horror movies metal music spoils it, the movie looses atmosphere a lot when any type of music other than a score is playing. so i'm glad there was no music in this movie other than just your typical score which was rather creepy, well done.it could have use "profane grace - epitaph of shattered dreams" on it though. as it is keyboard music no guitars no nothing except "really" creepy keyboard tracks. like track one "forever sleep" you hear the wind blowing all the way through it and some goose bump inducing keyboard music that follows it. ever track on that cd is the same, ideal horror music at it's best, it would have suited this movie perfectly.the only unattractive chick in the movie to me was the one who got chibbed/killed (or so we are led to believe) and hung up as a scarecrow, only to get free and try to escape later. every other woman in the movie was lovely indeed, a big 9 out of 10 for them all except the one i mentioned above.i wish that hollywood (mainstream side of things) would give money to romero and the guy who made this movie. as giving it to them for movies is way better a decision made than giving it to a goon muppet called paul anderson of the "resident evil" mince.well done guys, it is not bad, not bad at all, i loved the part at the end credits when they kept showing you clips of them making the movie (behind the scene's) not many movies do this kind of thing, which i thought added a little to the movie, as it also showed you some outtakes of sorts and that's always a good thing if you ask me.rating for this movie 8/10, rating for the lovely ladies in the movie 9/10, rating for the atmosphere in the movie 9/10, rating for the score for the film 9.5/10.

do not expect a classic military comedy, which claims to make fun of the military while only enhancing a militaristic outlook. instead it deconstructs the elements that make the military such a murderous machine. kind of east german version of "buffalo soldiers"."nva" works on a meta-level that it sympathizes with its heroes' attempts to escape from army drill any which way they can. it's not about loud laughs but about long lasting smiles. utopian, of course (in one scene you will be shown the harsh reality), but very thoughtful.just to fill the required 10 lines: do not go into that movie if you have been an army officer and liked your job.

her excellency madam shabana azmi has worked in countless movies over life time. i think best is yet to come.fire is ok.but still good days are yet to come.hopefully, in water i will be able see her better.thanks and regards.ps: india doesn't have a director to make best use of her.

this movie embodies the soul of modern "elite" foodculture, even though the movie is 17 years old. the standing principle in the movie is: food is more than just nourishing matter. it is also a powerful symbol and a medium for culture itself. the main characters literally get drunk on the finest wine and food, become inspired by idealistic thoughts and culture, as they let go of their puritanism and passion-denying table manners. karen blixens shortstory makes use of the difference between north europe and south europe, to point out their inherently different approaches to food. as the strict and and rather dull scandinavians get infused with "eros" from south, the party gets going. so what are you waiting for? go watch it.....again!

this movie is almost unknown, but it is very good. in a lonely danish town, two old sisters live remembering a far youths, when, due to a strict puritan education, they had to reject happiness. lonely, then, the live in a dignified austerity, until babette, who flies from paris, frightened by the horror of the war, arrives. in few time, she will be able to turn the goodness and love she received when she arrived. a good lottery prize lets her organize a great banquet, following the best rules of french gastronomy. all neighbourhoods are invited (all fanatically puritans). they accept, but they pact to not show any trace of pleasure or enjoyment, as it would be a sin. however, the seductive force of the delicious meal they eat, that they become seduced by the sensuality of french gastronomy. the banquet end in a very felt, though quietly, happiness. the love between humans has awaken. the miracle of rise the human kindness due to the pleasure of the sense has begun. the movie is surprisingly good, but it is not for all tastes. during most of the movie, nothing happens, all is so quiet and so peaceful, that during many minutes, you can only see the life of the inhabitants of the town. but, as the movie develops, it becomes more precious, when babette wins the lottery prize (after 30min movie), the show begins. the author is able, with a perfect directing, to show us how babette prepares the banquet, how she mixes all the ingredients with the most wonderful one (love), all told in a quiet delicious way, with a perfect knowledge of photography and acting. then, as the banquet goes by, the quality in showing us how the mood of all eaters changes due to the meal, only with first shots, with impressively filmed scenes one after another is simply astonishing. in addition, the tact with the colours and the photography is also superb, almost every scene of the movie is like a picture, so work is involved there. if you are able to admire good cinema and are able to realize that sometimes the way on telling you something rather than what is told is more important, this is your movie. if you happen to like good meals and just love the good gastronomy, probably, you'll feel amused, as most feelings of the movie will be familiar to you. an oscar totally deserved. the only problem is its slowness at setting up the story, but, i can forgive it (i hope everyone too)

if not the best movie ever made, "babette's feast" is certainly among the most loving. this is a wonderful exploration of the meaning of artistry, generosity, loyalty, and grace. humor is mixed with tender longing; characters are treated with searching honesty but also deep respect. there are meditations here on memory, fate, old age and faithfulness. marvellous camera work by cinematographer henning kristiansen: seldom have wrinkled faces looked so luminous in the candle-light. the meal is accompanied by delicious period music, brahms, mozart and simple folk hymns. enjoy this feast for the eyes and the spirit, for as the general says: "mercy and truth have met together, and righteousness and bliss shall kiss one another."

"babette's feast" and "the horse's mouth" are the two most insightful, accurate films on what it is to be a real artist. the key lines in "babette's feast" are not, as some other commentators here have said, "an artist is never poor," but two lines that come before and after it:"i was able to make them happy when i gave of my very best. ... throughout the world sounds one long cry from the heart of the artist: give me the chance to do my very best." i spent nine years producing experimental multi-media music theater in san francisco, raising money for productions that involved dozens of singers, actors, designers, etc., and the artists i supported stretched every penny in their effort to do their very best. they were just like babette: they were desperate to get every dollar necessary to do their very best work. babette's art is fine french cooking, and for her to perform her art at its very best costs 10,000 francs. when, after years in political exile from france, isolated with two caring spinsters on a bleak scandinavian coast, she suddenly gets a windfall of 10,000 francs, she does what every real artist would do: she sees that she unexpectedly has the chance to do her very best, and so she does it. she spends all the money so that she can do her very best work as an artist. the twist in the movie is that we don't know she is such an artist, until she is actually cooking and serving the meal. up until then, she appears to be just a working-class french lady who haggles a bit with the tradesmen, and is very serious (her husband and son were murdered in paris violence in 1871). to such an artist, it is secondary whether there is an audience for the art that is competent to appreciate it. that is why the author set this dinner in a community of people who could not possibly have any understanding of what they are receiving. babette did not cook this meal as a gift to the two spinsters, or to the religious community. it was not her goal to achieve a reconciliation or spirit of good feelings among the members of the little religious sect. indeed, she never once leaves the kitchen to speak to any of them. after the meal, she is sitting alone, sipping some wine, not paying the slightest attention to how the guests reacted. she is basking in the satisfaction of finally having the chance to have done her best as an artist. that is why it is so satisfying, and so important to the story, that the general unexpectedly shows up -- for, as babette knows instantly, a general will know what she has placed before him, and will appreciate it. for there is a sort of tragedy in a great work of art being shown to an audience that lacks even one person competent to appreciate it. she is glad, very glad, he came, in fact he is the only guest she ever mentions during the entire dinner, the only one she singles out for special treatment -- not either of the spinsters. but she did not plan the meal knowing that such a person would come to receive it. to anyone who has had the chance to enjoy a real first-class parisian dinner, as i have (my father was naval attache to paris in the 1980s, and i had my honeymoon in france), this dinner, and babette's satisfaction in making it, and the pleasure it brings to the diners, is absolutely convincing. if any art has the power to suffuse the recipient with a sense of joy, it is a fine french meal cooked and served in france. this movie makes a claim about the transformative effects of great art on the recipients. before the dinner, the members of the little religious sect are quarrelsome, dredging up old resentments. the old hymns fail to restore good fellowship; people ignore them, talk over them. but the shared experience of sensual great art -- for the people can enjoy the tastes of the foods and wines even if they have no conception that they are experiencing great art -- contents the people, puts them in a forgiving mood, reconciles them, and by making them happy, encourages them to love each other, and thus has a god-like sacred effect of bringing peace. this is the claim found in the modern art movement today -- that art can supplant the traditional religions in making mankind more peaceful. thus, contrary to those commentators here who say that this film speaks for the power of christian belief, it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that christian ritual cannot. after all my years in the art world, i have to say that this claim -- that art brings peace that religion cannot -- is overblown and invalid. but it is a pretty conceit and it is the second main theme of this beautiful film.one last note: at babette's arrival at the spinsters' home, a particular french general, galliffet, is named as the person who in 1871 executed babette's husband and son, and imposed a military rule that she had to flee. at the end of the film, as the general tells the story of the magnificent meal he enjoyed in paris many years before (before 1871), at the conclusion of some military maneuvers, it turns out that this same galliffet was his host at the meal. as the general tells the story, french general galliffet praised the chef of that meal as the greatest woman, the only woman he would risk his life for. of course, that woman was babette. thus, ironically, the same french general who said he honored babette above all other women was responsible for driving her away from france forever.

if you find the first 30 minutes of this film to be so slow that you wonder why you're watching it, don't give up. also, hearing the danish language is a bit new to most north americans, who don't see and hear a lot of danish films. anyway, as the film progressed it got better and better and the viewer is rewarded for his/her patience.being a fan of the movie, "out of africa," this film piqued my interest because it's based on a short novel by isak dinesen (karen blixen), the major character in that film.the meal - babette's feast - was amazing. i'm no chef, but i was impressed! how one interprets the story, too, varies, i suppose depending on how much you read into this, and where you stand religion-wise. if the latter, how you look at the definition of "legalism" can affect how you interpret this story.in any case, it's a fine film, but don't watch this if you're dieting.

this movie came aside as a shock in the eighties.far from trends,that is to say in the heart of sincere creativity,babettes gaestebud stands as one of the finest movies of its time.stephane audran,the wonderful actress of her ex-husband claude chabrol's greatest achievements (le boucher,la rupture,les noces rouges,all unqualified musts for movie buffs)gave a lifetime performance.to see her prepare with love and affection her meal is a feast for the eyes.all the people who saw this masterpiece actually tasted,ate babette's culinary triumph. but the most moving part of the story is its conclusion:babette was a great french chef,she was famous,now she found a new homeland but her heyday is behind her and she won't never be allowed to come back to her dear france.so the two old sisters do comfort her:in heaven,there will be huge kitchens where she cooks for eternity.while sharing her fortune with her new friends,babette changed their life,she gave them pleasure and a magic evening they would remember forever.in this simple but extraordinary screenplay,human warmth is everywhere,and i wish everybody a babette's feast,would it be only for one starry night...

the dead spots and picture-postcard superficiality of "out of africa" just about buried any interest i might have had to read isak dinesen. so when my brother bought me "babette's feast," and knowing it was based on a dinesen story, i didn't exactly race to the vcr. but as the titles rolled, it became clear that this was no ordinary movie. jutland (where it's set) is not africa; the chill mist that collects on the camera shots is not inviting. the cold, forbidding sea; the heavy, gray clouds; the pale, icy green cliffs--translate to hardships that show on the faces over which director gabriel axel draws the curtain. the craggiest is bodil kjer's as philippa; amid the myriad merits of this movie, the most memorable is that face. it stands like a map laying before us the cherished wonder of her minister father's apostolate; like a maze of long-overlooked fjords where the complications of her congregation's perseverance and commitment hang like gleaming escutcheons.i gather it's dinesen's point how the world is drawn inexplicably to christian dedication, when philippa is rejected by her only serious suitor (because he fears he'll never measure up to the rules and rigors of her small religious clique), and he returns to find her mistress of whom he regards as the greatest chef on the continent. i figure it's also her point that christ answers the doubts and regrets of those who give up worldly success (philippa's sister martina rebuffs efforts by a visiting baritone (jean-philippe lafont whose jolliness creates an uplifting counterpoint to the sparsity of spirit that surrounds his discovery) to turn her into an opera star; the title character leaves france and an enviable reputation and seeks sanctuary as the servant of two spinster sisters) to pursue artistic triumphs for only god and those closest to him to witness. but it's axel who weaves the asperity of these people's lives with the richness of martina's voice and babette hersant's table and effects a sumptuousness you'd never expect from a movie about sacrifice, faith, and religious conviction.what sets this movie apart from other religious movies is its sly humor. "babette's feast," that is, the banquet itself--a posthumous commemoration of the minister's 100th birthday--is a beautifully orchestrated clash of sensibilities that delivers comic moments by an ensemble of actors that are unparalleled in their subtlety. it's just this deft comedy that enriches the solemn sentiments at closing. together they do something pious movies seldom do. they leave a believer tremulously hopeful and unexpectedly resolute and humbled.

stephane audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small danish community towards the end of the last century. two beautiful and musically talented sisters give-up their own prospects of happiness and marriage in order to look-after their ageing father. one day, a french woman, babette, comes to work for them. after some years she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who have taken her in. her solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast, which changes the lives of all those invited. this is a film about human and cultural interaction, reflected in the changing language of the dialogue from danish to french, and especially between the dutiful sobriety of protestant northern europe and the sensuousness of the catholic south. it is also about human needs, and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses. a profoundly uplifting film.

sublime--perfect--profound--a true lesson on the idealized meaning of life. we get completely caught up in the life journeys of martina and phillipa andbabette. their yearnings, desires, sacrifices resonant long after the movie has ended. seeing it years ago--as it was gaining a great deal of notoriety at the audaciousness of its subject matter--half the movie being a single dinner--the audience was "oohing and aahing" as some of the courses took their finalglorious shape, laughing at the reaction of the diners, as they became totally seduced by the gustatorial pleasures being introduced to them by babette, and being totally surprised at the turn of events at the end of the film. subsequently seeing the film years later after my own twists and turns of life, i realized just how profound the film is. on this viewing tears flowed freely. the film'smeditation on the passage of time and the way it uses a seemingly simple story to comment on life and love and art and generosity is truly something tocherish.

flawlessly directed, written, performed, and filmed, this quiet and unpretentious danish film is an example of cinema at its best, and if a person exists who can watch babette's feast without being touched at a very fundamental level, they are a person i do not care to know.the story is quite simple. in the 1800s, two elderly maiden ladies (birgitte federspiel and bodil kjer) reside in remote jutland, where they have sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities, and personal happiness in order to continue their long-dead father's religious ministry to the small flock he served. one of the women's youthful admirers sends to them a frenchwoman, babette (st√©phane audran), whose husband and son have been killed in france and who has fled her homeland lest she meet the same fate. although they do not really require her services, the sisters engage her as maid and cook--and as the years pass her cleverness and tireless efforts on their behalf enables the aging congregation to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined; indeed, the entire village admires and depends upon her.one day, however, babette receives a letter: she has won a lottery and is now, by village standards, a wealthy woman. knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to france, the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly french meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation. the meal and the evening it is served is indeed a night to remember--but not for reasons that might be expected, for babette's feast proves to be food for both body and soul, and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her.the film is extraordinary in every way, meticulous in detail yet not overpowering in its presentation of them. as the film progresses, we come to love the characters in both their simple devotion to god and their all-too-human frailties, and the scenes in which babette prepares her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful, beautiful, and incredibly memorable. there have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love, but none approach the simple artistry and beauty of babette's feast, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and which proves food for both body and soul. highly, highly recommended.gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

babette's feast, for me, is about healing: mending the schism between spirit and body in orthodox christianity. this puritanical community in remote denmark is missing an adequate appreciation of all of god's gifts in creation. they have taken the dualism of st. paul to an extreme, and stress the life of the "spirit," not the life of the "flesh." both elderly sisters, in their youth, were frightened by the lure of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village. they, and their parishioners, cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader, and the sisters' father. the aging congregation has become testy and quarrelsome, and the sisters don't know what to do. enter babette, a french stranger, and someone to whom they can show kindness. they have no way of knowing that she will ultimately return their kindness and give fertile soil to their dry, dusty theology. babette will give everything she has, and in the process, will teach the sisters and their flock about grace, about sacrifice, about how sensual experience (as in the bread and wine of the eucharist) can change lives, and about why true art moves us so deeply. when they can forgive each other, and themselves, they can focus on god's love that unfolds before them in a concrete way in the present. as a minister, and an artist, i can't recommend a movie more highly. true art and true grace!!

price of honor aka price of power is an ambitious western melodrama, light on the action, which seeks to tell an old west version of the jfk assassination. in 1881, the president travels to dallas and is shot from a window while parading thru town in his carriage. corrupt officials have carried out the murder and have a humble slave take the rap. our hero, the earnest but bland giuliano gemma, aims to unravel the conspiracy. an engaging story, audacious for its subject matter, but entertaining despite the paucity of shoot-em-up action. the film is a 7 out of 10, despite the poor presentation of the dvd, which is overly dark with poor sound. look for a good copy.

i was unfamiliar with this film, until i saw it included in a list of the top 20 spaghetti westerns i recently came across (following the marathon i made these last few weeks of films from the subgenre); it was auspicious, then, that the film had to turn up almost immediately on late-night italian tv (for the first time, i'm pretty sure, in a good number of years)! unfortunately, the cable reception of the channel on which it was broadcast hasn't been great lately: i recorded the film on vhs but i decided not to keep it due to this factor; as it happened, the very next day i watched the film, i found out that it was available on a region 2 dvd from italy (featuring an interview with uncredited scriptwriter ernesto gastaldi) - and, having been sufficiently impressed, i decided to order it there and then, even if i knew that i wouldn't be getting to the dvd for quite a while as i like to allow some time between one viewing of a film and the next! a brief parenthesis here: when i recently purchased a spate of spaghetti westerns on italian dvd, i opted not to order sergio sollima's face to face (1967), since i was under the impression that it was a bare-bones affair; however, i've just learned that the disc actually contains an interview with the director (as had been the case with the big gundown [1966], which i bought). it did seem baffling to me that sollima wouldn't offer similar contribution to that film's dvd edition when he actually considered face to face as his favorite work (as per the director's talent bio included on the blue underground region 1 disc of yet another sollima spaghetti western - run, man, run [1968]); the trouble is that i loved the big gundown so much that i followed it with a viewing of face to face via the recording i owned made off italian tv! i did order the dvd of that film now - especially since it's still discounted - but as i said with respect to a second look at the price of power (although i may still check out sollima's interview when the disc arrives)... o.k., rant over: the film under review is quite an unusual spaghetti western and a very interesting, indeed ambitious one at that, being a transposition of the jfk assassination case to an old west setting! actually, it's reminiscent of anthony mann's terse black-and-white thriller the tall target (1951) - which dealt with an assassination attempt on the life of then-u.s. president abraham lincoln. it features one of the most popular italian stars from this subgenre, giuliano gemma, in what is perhaps his most impressive western role (many of his other films tended to have a light-hearted bent). the supporting cast includes at least two other notables: van johnson (in one of his few and mainly unremarkable italian films) as the american president killed in post-civil war dallas and fernando rey as the head of a conspiracy of southerners - who not only plots his assassination but also conveniently maneuvers the new acting u.s. leader, johnson's vice-president, by means of blackmail! benito stefanelli also makes a good impression as a corrupt sheriff who pursues gemma all through the picture, and with whom he's engaged a couple of times in a 'duel in the dark' - with the guns resting on the floor rather than in their respective holsters and the only light in the room provided by the end of the cowboys' cigars! also involved is ray saunders as gemma's black sidekick whom the narrative eventually turns into the doomed "lee harvey oswald" figure. stelvio massi - who later cut his teeth, as director, on a number of poliziotteschi - is behind the film's luminous cinematography; similarly, luis enrique bacalov supplies yet another great "euro-cult" score - which is different enough from the style of ennio morricone as to be equally distinguishable. valerii's direction here may mot be as imposing as that in other spaghetti westerns but he handles the proceedings efficiently enough (the final gunfight is especially nicely done); the film is certainly one of the more underrated entries in the subgenre and, for those so inclined, the novelty of the plot line alone should make it one to look out for...

tonino valerii's "il prezzo del potere" aka. "the price of power" is an excellent and enthralling spaghetti western that mirrors the kennedy assassination. a great leading performance by giuliano gemma and an excellent score by luis bacalof are just two of the many reasons to watch this movie.in 1881 texas is divided into those who appreciate the abolition of slavery and just want to live in peace, and those who, after 16 years, still want to reinstall the confederacy. in spite of warnings, president james garfield, who wants to establish a new policy of equality, decides to visit dallas, where corrupt law enforcement officials are planning his assassination. bill willer (giuliano gemma) and two of his friends, a black man named jack donovan (ray shaunders), and a crippled guy named nick (manuel zarzo) are determined to prevent the president's murder. since james garfield was not assassinated by racists, who wanted to reinstall the confederacy in texas, but in washington dc by mentally unstable charles guiteau, the storyline of "price of power" is, of course, historical nonsense. since the movie, however, doesn't claim historical accuracy, but tries to allude to the 1963 kennedy assassination in dallas, the fact that the story is fictitious is legitimate. giuliano gemma delivers an excellent performance as the main character bill willer, benito stefanelli is great as the villainous and corrupt sheriff jefferson. some other good performances are those of ray shaunders as bill's black friend jack, warren vanders as arthur mcdonald, the president's adviser, and fernando rey as pinkerton, a villainous rich businessman. the score by luis enr√≠quez bacalov is great, the cinematography and locations are great and (such as in valerii's earlier "day of anger") remind a lot of sergio leone, for whom valerii used to work as an assistant director for "a fistful of dollars" and "for a few dollars more". all said, "il prezzo del potere" is, after "day of anger", another excellent spaghetti western that shows both the great talent of giuliano gemma as an actor and tonino valerii as a director. "the price of power" is a must-see for spaghetti western fans, and i also highly recommend it to everybody else. 8/10

this is a gripping story that borrows elements from the kennedy assassination, and uses them successfully to create an excellent western tale.the movie has a good music score, though it relies on repeating the title theme a little too much. giuliano gemma and the rest of the cast are superb. this is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti western that relies more on story than action, and it succeeds because the story is excellent. this is not to say that there is no action in the movie. there is plenty, and it is very well crafted. this movie pulls you in right away, and keeps you absorbed til the end. you'll always be wondering what's in those documents everyone's after. it also has some biting commentary on american politics.this movie shows why valerii, in my opinion, is in a three way tie with sollima and corbucci for second place in the rankings of spaghetti western directors.

in post civil war america the president, (van johnson), travels to dallas and is assassinated by corrupt officials and businessman interested in installing the vice president whom they can blackmail due to incriminating documents. a gunman (guiliano gemma) convinced that his black friend is wrongly accused of the assassination aims to uncover the truth. tonino valeri directed this fascinating, if flawed film which obviously is an allegory for the kennedy assassination. the film may wrongly present blacks as slaves working on plantations in texas but the film is nonetheless enjoyable and presents an interesting interpretation - that kennedy's death was the result of a coup de tat- which many americans could not accept at the time. oswald's murder is replayed here as the black accused of the assassination is murdered by the men responsible, on route to fort worth prison. this moment in the film is more melodramatic than oswald's death with his various escorts shot down before his over the top death scene. nonetheless this is definitely one of the more interesting and worthwhile spaghetti westerns. worth a look!

out of the 600 or so spaghetti westerns made this has got to be in the top twenty somewhere. can not believe this hasn't received any reviews! gemma is excellent in this. van johnson is good too though his dubbed voice is a little off killter but that's the charm of the italian style. beautiful photography and some excellently staged action. all the supporting characters are well played. the severity of the racist streak in the bad guys is pretty tough even by todays standards which creates an emotional depth to gemmas character in some of the situations that take place. absolutely fantastic score by luis bacalov. see this is in the wonderful wide screen dvd from japan. a spaghetti must have.

i first saw this film on hbo around 1983 and i loved it! i scoured all of the auction web sites to buy the vhs copy. this is a very good suspense movie with a few twists that make it more interesting. i don't want to say too much else because if you ever get a chance to see it, you'll be glad i didn't say too much!

i must admit, when i first began watching this film i had no clue what was going on. so the beginning was a bit confusing for me. however, that did not diminish my enjoyment of the movie. the characters reveal themselves to be more complex than they may first appear, and that is what makes this a memorable film. at first i heard this was a real "hollywood" movie. although it obviously lacks the stereotypical "guns and fists" element, the convincing performances of talented actors such as martin sheen and sam neill more than make up for it. i'd rather see a film with more substance than shooting any day.

this was the film that first indicated to me what a great actor martin sheen really is. he modestly claims that charlie is a better actor, charlie can't hold a candle to him.i found it suspenseful and thoroughly enjoyed the intertwining of the love story with the main plot (and i usually hate love stories). there's a great plot twist at the end that struck me as being fully credible, particularly in the early 80's time period, and probably now also.the final scene had me on the edge of my seat. this film roundly illustrates that treachery is often doled out by those we trust, while declared enemies have more in common than they suspect, and finally, that human compassion can be found where we least expect it.irenerose

enigma is a computer part which scrambles russian messages, so that america can't understand them. they can only be read by the intended recipient. the americans know that the russians are going to transmit a message revealing the plans of five political assassinations they want to carry out.so they send in former defector holbeck (martin sheen) to grab the scrambler and substitute a false part, so they'll be able to decode the message, and block the assassination attempts.however, as we listen in on the americans heads of the spy organisation, we find that they already have the scrambler, and they want holbeck to try to steal enigma, only to convince the russians that they don't already have it. they don't expect holbeck to succeed. that way the russians, who had stopped transmitting with enigma, just in case, will begin transmitting again.enigma is in the computer in the office of dimitri vasilikov. somehow holbeck must gain access, and in order to do that, he must find out when vasilikov will be out. he sends in his former girlfriend karen (brigitte fossey) to seduce vasilikov, so that she can look through his papers and find out his scheduled movements. karen is glad to do it, as they tortured her father, a university professor, to death.because we know that it's better for the americans if holbeck fails, the movie becomes even more intense as a spy thriller. we find ourselves hoping he can survive against the odds, especially as he uses ingenious methods to beat the russians at every turn.but what's this? are karen and vasilikov falling in love? will holbeck win karen back, or will she actually end up with vasilikov? the romantic twist lifts this spy thriller, already worthy of a ten, even higher, for its originality. the writing, the direction, and the acting all combine to make this new and fascinating twist a compellingly realistic one.you find yourself at the edge of your seat, gripping your armchair, not only for the excitement of the spy story but for the intensely beautiful romantic love story as well. the two themes are interwoven perfectly, right up to the end. you really want both sides to win. so who does win, in the end? you'll have to see the movie and find out, won't you!

i thought this to be a pretty good example of a better soft core erotica film. it has a reasonable plot about the madame of a bordello caught up in a police scheme to nab a wealthy crook.hardcore porn star chloe nichole again shows her genuine acting ability. she will occasionally appear in soft core such as "body of love" and "lady chatterly's stories. nicole hilbig, on the other hand, leaves something to be desired in her role as the female cop.

for a moment, let's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie, even if it is a very important side of it, and let's look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story. two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation, caused by two selfish husbands. they have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope. if each one of these two women had been alone, imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept. they found each other and they fell in love. that this love was against all the social, religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant. they loved each other, found relief in each other, that was sufficient. the reaction of the individuals around them is but a small fact that they have to accept, suffer even, and then they can go on with their lives, their life. very nice.

this movie kicks ass, bar none. bam and his crue have out done themselves with this film. since i got the dvd (4 days ago) i have watched it three times and it gets better every time i watch it. i can't wait for grind to come out in theaters. if its anything like haggard it will be worth the wait.thanks, jtcellphone

if your expecting jackass look somewhere else this an actual movie and for the budget well done the acting isnt top noth neither is the writing but the directing was there and so was the story definetly worth the rent and possibly the buy if you really enjoy it like i did. but for the person who just likes jackass rent it first.

yes, i felt like i had been gutted after first seeing it. but not until the next day did i begin to see the true brilliance of this creation. i won't repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film, but there is one new area i want to touch on... **spoilers** why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in the student's pocket? most reviewers have noted that it only reflected her cruelty and reaction to an unsatisfactory performance. i must disagree. watch the scene again. huppert is moved to tears as she watches her student playing on stage. the student is quite an expressive girl (crying & vocalizing her fears)- just the opposite of huppert's character. there is a scene later in the film, after the girl is injured, when huppert discusses the accident with the girl's mother. the mother, visibly upset, states "we gave up everything so she could study piano" and huppert immediately snaps "you mean she gave up everything, don't you."so it was my thought that huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from her own destiny. she didn't want the girl to end up like her, repressed & hardened, condemned to a life of recitals...gradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection. maybe she saw herself on the stage years ago, before things grew bad. maybe she wished she had escaped when she was that age. is she ruining the student's life, or simply freeing her?for me, that realization made all the difference in what i experienced through this film. brilliant.

this movies made me suffer and i loved it! loved it! it haunted me for days. i think erika is the kind of character you simultaneously loathe and lament. the most terrifying sex scene ever caught on film. this is the best of haneke's work so far. he is the only living director to redefine pace since kubrick. the violence in this film is gorgeous. in a word, the film is about self-hatred. in a sentence, the film is about trying to find love in order to stop hating yourself and finding that that is a hopeless hope.

reading through the comments, there seems to be a lot of nonsense about the emotional banality of la pianiste. i find this hard to comprehend given the outstanding performance by isabelle huppert. huppert is gripping - she manages to convey perfectly the woman on the edge, full of self-hate and delusion.the film is wonderfully paced and judged. it would be so easy to portray the lead as a ridiculous figure - consider the scene in the porn store for instance. somehow, huppert is able to carry it off, partly because of her brilliant performance but also because the director makes her surreal life real and identifiable.don't ignore this film. it is one of the most startling and engaging films (and performances) i have seen.trust boris!

if it is true that sadomasochism is a two-sided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites, then the cinematic portrait of erika kohut has its reality. professor kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself. her outward expression projects her desire. that is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse.along comes talented, charming, handsome young walter klemmer (benoit magimel) who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity. he wants to become her student so as to be close to her. she rejects him out of hand, but because of his talent the vienna conservatory votes him in. he falls in love with her. again she pushes him away, but he will not take no for an answer, and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of self-respect.the question the viewer might ask at this point is, who is in control? the sadist or the masochist? indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist? it is hard to tell. is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically, who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment, or is it the person who is rushing out the door, sated, giving the order that no one is to know what happened.but erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak. she is a sex extreme freak. she wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability. actually that isn't even true. she says she doesn't care what others think. she doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love. love, she calls it. for her sex and love are one and the same.at one point walter tells her that love isn't everything. how ironic such a superfluity is to her. how gratuitous the comment.the movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by michael haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified (as in the bathroom when walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find erika within). he also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another. this is particularly important in the scene in which erika, like a blood-drained corpse caught in stark white and black light, lies under her lover, rigid as stone. here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery. we don't need to see any more.the part of erika kohut is perfect for isabelle huppert who is not afraid of extremes; indeed she excels in them. i have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul. like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense. what matters to her is the performance and the challenge. no part is too demanding. no character too depraved. it's as if huppert wants to experience all of humanity, and wants us to watch her as she does. she is always fascinating and nearly flawless. she is not merely a leading light of the french cinema; she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work.i think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in the lacemaker (la dentelli√®re) from 1977 when she was 22 years old. there she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing pomme, a parisian apprentice hairdresser. her character was shy about sex and modest--just an ordinary french girl who hoped one day to be a beautician. here she is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and entirely depraved.huppert is fortunate in being an actress in france where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets. (hollywood could never make a movie like this.) in the american cinema, only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty. huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range, but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles, here and also in la c√©r√©monie (1995) in which she plays a vile, spiteful murderess.do see this for isabelle huppert. you won't forget her or the character she brings to life.

overall i found this film good: exceptional acting with disturbing scenes (some essential, some useless) and weak second half. contains spoilers the film is divided in 2 parts. i thought the first half of the pianist was terrific. we meet erika kohut (wonderful isabelle huppert), a piano teacher, and get introduced to her world. she is single, struggling to find her space against an over-protective and borderline tyrannic mother. we understand that she has lost or has seldom experienced love as a physical+emotional chemistry: she protects herself by being sharp and offensive to people, releases her sexual tensions in sex-shops, as a voyeur, or in sadistic self-mutilations ... this first half is very clinical and builds an incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable.then comes walter, a young, handsome and outgoing man (played superbly by benoit magimel). though he gets to feel erika's coldness in the beginning, he seduces her and slowly wreaks erika's fortress. he loves her deeply but she needs him to fulfil her sadistic desires. then when she is about to fall for him, he is disgusted by her world and in the end we discover that erika is unable to love or feel at all (especially since walter is portrayed as someone impossible not to love). this is the second half of the film, very touching as we see erika's inability/inexperience to love lead her to self-destruction. this second half seemed less mastered by haneke, and sometimes had non-credible (ie. too shocking) scenes which paradoxically lessened the drama.of course, this is a crude film at least in the french version: you see porn sequences from the sex shop, daring mutilation and sex scenes. the much talked-about fellatio scene between magimel and huppert was quite good i thought, and is central to understand erika's sick relation to love. as to the actors, huppert is marvelous all through the film, magimel gets better and better up to perfection, and girardot (the mother) is excellent.

first of all, i must say that i love this film.it was the first film that i saw from director micheal haneke and i was impressed that how good the direction was good !haneke surely knows how to direct actors. what i found intresting is also haneke's scenario. at first, you saw a woman who is very straight and seems to be a good piano teacher and very well loved and respected from everybody in her entourage. then you realise that she has a mother who is a controle freak and is too much present in her life. now you know that she is deranged, that she has emotional problems, but you don't know exactly what. and then you fall into her dark side, but her dark side is only reveal when a student sendenly fall in love with her. she can't controled herself anymore.the roles are very complexed and difficult to play, but isabelle huppert is marvellous in her role and she deserves the recognition she had at cannes festival. benoit maginel is very solid too, but a little bit eclipse by huppert's performance.there is one thing that i found strange in the scenario is how the character played by magimel is not very credible. he is too talented! it is rare that a person is a piano virtuoso, but pass the most of the his time to play hockey and study... it think that it is a weak point, but only a minor flaw.i just saw the movie once, so i can't do a very complete critic, because i didn't analysed the movie. i like what i saw ! so i give the film a 8.5/10oh yeah... as for the end, haneke showed that he really wanted to shock his audience. a motivation that don't think is necessary to make movies, but haneke does it with style and precision, that is why his film is better than baise-moi for example.vince

i totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me who bashed the film. having read the book, being impressed by it although this is a kind of literature that you cannot really like (similar to hubert selby's writing) i expected being shocked but the effect was more subtle than this. isabelle hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi-layered character. there are many scenes that totally focus on her and her subtle changes and i can imagine few actresses who would do so well, with so much disregard for their own reputation or image. there is this coldness, distance, cruelty and at the same time there's this helplessness, hurt and pain. there's a person who's in control and controlled at the same time. maybe this is not realistic - although when you read the newspaper you'll read about much worse than this - but there's a truth to it that is very difficult to bear. i think it's an excellent film but i did not enjoy watching it.it's not boring but there are times when i wished it would end. btw, her male counterpart is very well acted as well (and i think well chosen, too).

isabelle huppert portrays a talented female piano teacher who is staid, unfriendly and distant in public, and bitter towards her students. privately, she seethes with violence and frustration, and her sexual life is solitary and perverse. she lives with her overbearing mother, who obsessively drives her to become noticed (and so advance in life) as a talented pianist. the key to the characters of both mother and daughter is 'obsession.' these characters cannot change their impulses anymore than a rabbit caught in headlights can avoid death.the piano teacher meets a young, attractive, talented pianist who from the beginning is attracted to her. they start a relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the outset she makes perverse and violent terms that he must perform on her, which sickens him enough to want to terminate the relationship before it has really begun.the film ties itself to the female lead. isabelle huppert amazes with a brutal, completely convincing performance as the piano teacher. she cleverly shows a woman who is drawn to beauty and perversion, but her violence is fed by her perverted impulses. as a film that is so character driven, you know it would not work half as well, had she acted poorly.this is powerful, intelligently acted, and intelligently and sensitively adapted from the novel. the camera work also suits the film. there are what i can only think to call, framing shots where the director holds a scene and forces the eye to dart about. this is done extremely effectively against a blank bathroom wall, and is a further testament to the director's mastery.expect to be disturbed and sickened by this film. but, be brave - have the guts to go and see it. this is a very private look into essentially one person's life, but do not expect to be entertained in the hollywood sense....there are no car chases in this film!

at the end of my review of cache, i wrote that i was intrigued with haneke as a film maker. this is what led me to get the dvd for la pianiste, which i just finished watching about a half hour ago.it's all been expressed, here at imdb and in many of the external reviews - the gruesomely twisted pathology that would 'create' an individual like huppert's erika, who is still trying, after years and years, to please her mother, at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life, beginning with her self. she's repressed everything that would free her from her self-imposed bondage, including, of course, her sexuality, which has literally imploded, to the point of madness, to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving impulse would feel like.this is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple, one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult. i think this subject relates to all of us - we're all striving for autonomy, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even on the conscious level. it also deals brilliantly with the contrast between what one fantasizes about, sexually, and the reality of those fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another human being. huppert's character gets what she asks for in the course of the film, and it is hardly the emancipating experience she had imagined it to be. regarding the much-discussed scene in the bathroom: i really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge (for the viewer, i mean) sucked out of it because of the prior scene, where she put the glass in the girl's pocket. by the time she's acting out her let's-see-if-this-guy-is-worthy scenario in the bathroom, we've already found out that she's dangerously disturbed and so it's not a turn on, her little domination session with our poor unsuspecting dupe.i think another incredible achievement of this movie is how, about halfway through it, i completely forgot that it was not in english and that i was reading sub-titles. that has never happened before, in any foreign movie, and i've seen quite a few. in this film, like cache, the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow, but unlike cache, we do at least get some sense of finality, despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether huppert's character is alive or dead. after experiencing la pianiste, when it comes to michael haneke, i am, needless to say, more than a trifle intrigued.

i did something a little daring tonight when i watched this movie. i attempted to wean myself from silent movie scores. sure, when this film originally was distributed, a piano score was probably played with it. oftentimes, the director would choose the score himself (charlie chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films). but most of the music you hear on vhs tapes over silent films is in no way the same music that was supposed to be played when the film was first released. and, then again, there were plenty of silent films that were played without a score. i do not know the history of potemkin's score, so i decided to watch it for the medium this piece of art was produced within - film. soon after i turned the music off, unaided (or should i say unimpeded) by the musical interpretation of the emotions on screen, i became utterly attached to the film. visually, it is easily one of the most stunning of all films. eisenstein was a master of composition. the editing, possibly the cinematic technique eisenstein is most famous for (montage), is extraordinary. the mood of this film is anger, and it stirred my passions violently. it takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent film, especially a drama, but films like battleship potemkin prove that this effort is entirely worth it. come on! you owe it to yourself to watch this film! your education is incomplete without it.

there are only a handful of movies that were made on such a grand scale and made such a difference in the art of movie making."bronenosets potyomkin" is one of these movies, and it should be on anyone's list looking to learn more about the history of cinema. grigori aleksandrov & sergei m. eisenstein directed this groundbreaking film that documents the horrors taking place on a russian battleship. when the sailors finally retaliate against their superiors, the locals embrace the them, and support them. things get ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to take care of business. what follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema. anyone who has seen "the untouchables", and "bronenosets potyomkin" knows exactly what i mean.overall i think this movie raised the bar for film making just as "intolerance" did a few years earlier. if you do not mind silent films, do yourself a favor, and see "bronenosets potyomkin". if you don't like silent films..... watch "bronenosets potyomkin" anyway. 

the battleship potemkin is now the oldest film i've seen and it is also the first silent film i've seen. i heard a lot of good things about this movie so i got the tape out at home and i watched it. when it ended i just thought that this was a classic masterpiece. the story is based on the real-life russian battleship potemkin. you wouldn't think it but some of it was sad and disgusting. sad being that the mother dies and the pram rolls down the stairway and disgusting being they have to eat rotten meat with maggots in it.today it is still considered to be one of the best silent and russian films ever made. i think that everyone should see it (if they can find it.) you will be presently surprised at how good it is. it's a must see classic. 5/5.

on june 14 1905, during the russian revolution of that year, sailors aboard the russian battleship potemkin rebelled against their oppressive officers. frustrated with the second-rate treatment they receive, and most particularly the maggot-infested meat that they are forced to eat, the ship's crew, led by the inspirational bolshevik sailor grigory vakulinchuk (aleksandr antonov), decide that the time is ripe for a revolution. and so begins sergei m. eisenstein's rousing classic of russian propaganda, 'bronenosets potyomkin / the battleship potemkin.'the film itself is brimming with shining examples of stunning visual imagery: the spectacles of an overthrown ship captain dangle delicately from the side rope over which he had been tossed; the body of a deceased mutineer lies peaceful upon the shore, the sign on his chest reading "killed for a bowl of soup;" close-up shots of the clenching fists of the hundreds of spectators who are finally fed up with the tsarist regime; a wayward baby carriage careers down the odessa steps as desperate onlookers watch on with bated breath (this scene was memorably "borrowed" by brian de palma for a particularly suspenseful scene in his 'the untouchables'); the barrels of numerous canons are ominously leveled towards the vastly-outnumbered battleship potemkin.however, the film itself is best analysed ¬ñ not as a fragmented selection of memorable scenes ¬ñ but as a single film, and, indeed, every scene is hugely memorable. though divided into five fairly-distinct chapters, the entire film flows forwards wonderfully; at no point do we find ourselves losing interest, and we are absolutely never in doubt of whose side we should be sympathetic towards.the film is often referred to as "propaganda," and that is exactly what it is, but this need not carry a negative connotation. 'the battleship potemkin' was produced by eisenstein with a specific purpose in mind, and it accomplishes this perfectly in every way. planned by the soviet central committee to coincide with the 20th century celebrations of the unsuccessful 1905 revolution, 'potemkin' was predicted to be a popular film in its home country, symbolising the revitalization of russian arts after the revolution. it is somewhat unfortunate, then, that eisenstein's film failed to perform well at the russian box-office, reportedly beaten by allan dwan's 1922 'robin hood' film in its opening week and running for just four short weeks. luckily, despite being banned on various occasions in various countries, 'the battleship potemkin' fared more admirably overseas.the film also proved a successful vehicle for eisenstein to test his theories of "montage." through quick-cut editing, and distant shots of the multitudes of extras, the audience is not allowed to sympathise with any individual characters, but with the revolutionary population in general. eisenstein does briefly break this mould, however, in a scene where vakulinchuk flees the ship officer who is trying to kill him, and, of course, during the renowned odessa steps sequence, as our hearts beat in horror for the life of the unfortunate child in the tumbling baby carriage. the accompanying soundtrack to the version i watched, largely featuring the orchestral works of dmitri shostakovich, served wonderfully to heighten the emotional impact of such scenes.one of the greatest films of the silent era, 'the battleship potemkin' is a triumph of phenomenal film-making, and is a significant slice of cinematic history. the highly-exaggerated events of the film (among other things, there was never actually any violent massacre on the odessa steps) have so completely engrained themselves in the memory, that we're often uncertain of the true history behind the depicted events. this is a grand achievement.

the battleship potemkin was said to have been a favourite of charlie chaplin. it presents a dramatised version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the russian battleship potemkin rebelled against their officers of the tsarist regime.the film is a textbook cinema classic, and a masterpiece of creative editing, especially in the famous odessa steps sequence in which innocent civilians are mown down in the bloodshed; the happenings of a minute are drawn into five by frenzied cross-cutting. the film contains 1,300 separate shots, and in 1948 and 1958 was judged the best film ever made by a panel of international critics. the battleship potemkin is in the public domain, in some parts of the world.

the silent film masterpiece battleship potemkin (1925) was commissioned by the soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905 and to establish the event as an heroic foreshadowing of the october revolution of 1917. ironically the film's director, sergei eisenstein, was one of the earliest and most influential advocates of a formalistic approach to film art. subsequently, eisenstein's formalism and suspect politics would cause innumerable conflicts with government agencies insisting on "socialist realism." influenced by the russian film theoretician, lev kuleshov, and through him by d. w. griffith's intolerance (smuggled into russia in 1919), eisenstein constructed his films from a "collision" of rapidly edited images, a montage of shots varied in length, motion, content, lighting, and camera angle. without question the most memorable illustration of eisenstein's stylistic approach - and probably the single most cited and studied sequence in world cinema history - is the "odessa steps" sequence in potemkin.in structure potemkin is a "five reeler" divided into five narrative parts, an organization clearly derived from the five-act arrangement of western drama. in "men and maggots," eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and discontent of the battleship's working class sailors as the situation inevitably builds to mutiny. even before the sailors and their upper class officers/masters are visually introduced, eisenstein establishes revolutionary conditions symbolically by the collision editing of waves breaking violently and ominously at sea. onboard ship we witness crowded, unsanitary conditions. eisenstein emphasizes the sailors' dehumanization with shots of arbitrary lashings, harsh labor, and - most memorably - the maggot infested meat intended for the evening's meal. the ship's nearsighted physician is brought forward by the other officers to declare the meat perfectly suitable to be served with the dark soup, boiling like the sailors' rage. in accordance with marxist maxims, the church also fails the men, and we see one of them smashing a plate inscribed with words from the lord's prayer from two different camera angles (in perhaps the first deliberate "jump cut" in cinema history).identified by inter-titles as "drama on the quarterdeck" and "an appeal from the dead," potemkin's second and third parts depict the actual mutiny and the onshore funeral of its leader and first hero of the revolution, vakulinchuk. united by vakulinchuk's appeals to brotherhood, the initial mutineers are joined by the entire crew in an attack on the officers. a chaotic scene ensues whose violent passion is served well by eisenstein's editing techniques. the officers' quarters are trampled and symbols of their privilege are destroyed. the ship's doctor is thrown overboard, accompanied by dramatic crosscuts to the maggot-ridden meat and his eyeglasses metonymically dangling in the rigging. tragically, vakolinchuk's death is the price paid for the revolt (no omelet without breaking eggs) and he is laid out with dignity on an odessa pier. hundreds of ordinary odessa citizens gather with the sailors to honor him and to pledge "death to the oppressors." shots of fists clenching and unclenching signal the birth of revolutionary consciousness.the complex and unforgettable odessa steps sequence constitutes the film's fourth act. it begins with uplifting music and a series of close-ups and medium shots on the elated faces of diverse people on the shore and selected objects (parasol, eyeglasses, baby carriage). suddenly (as exclaims a title card in huge letters) the music stops and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps. here eisenstein releases the full force of collision editing as nearly a hundred shots are pieced together to contrast the panicked mayhem and victimization of the citizenry with the relentless assault of the soldiers driving the citizens down to the trampling horses and flying sabers of the waiting cossacks below. the mise-en-scene is framed by a statue of caesar at the top of the stairs and a church at the bottom, symbolic metonyms for russia's oppressive institutions: tsarist monarchy and the orthodox christian church.punctuating the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children. in the first, a mother and young boy who had been introduced among the joyous faces in the crowd are among the slaughter's first victims. the boy is shot, but the mother continues running until close-ups of her face convey her horrified gaze at the son's fallen body being trampled by the crowd. with a much slowed editing pace, the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of her child up the stairs to confront the soldiers (shown only in a diagonal shadow line). they summarily shoot her dead. after this lull, the carnage continues for another several dozen cuts until a second mother is shot through the stomach (the womb of mother russia?) as she tries to shield her baby in its carriage. in a scene famously imitated in the untouchables, the carriage incongruously slips down the staircase. horrified faces of huddled citizens watch the slow progress to its doom. when the carriage reaches the bottom there is a cut to a cossack wielding a sword and a classic kuleshov effect suggests what we do not actually see: the slaughtering of this pure and symbolic innocent. the final series of shots in the odessa sequence is of three stone lions, one in repose, one sitting up, and one roaring. the editing animates them into a visual metaphor of the people's awakened rage.somewhat anticlimactically, the fifth act returns us to the battleship as the mutinous sailors flee on the high seas and await an encounter with other ships from the fleet. they and the viewer expect retribution, but when the meeting occurs no shots are fired and instead all the sailors wave and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of comradeship. eisenstein was rewriting history at this point since the revolution was not successfully launched for another twelve years. but that quibble aside, battleship potemkin stands as one of the seminal works of the silent film era, and it retains extraordinary cinematic power.

eisenstein created the russian montage theory, and this film is his finest example. it took years before someone could utilize his ideas and make them work (the limey, 1999). nonetheless, the baby carriage scene really demonstrates the discombobulated nature of rmt. granted, like most movies, it gets long in some parts, the beauty of the film is amazing. one of the best silent films i have ever seen.

sergei eisenstein's most famous movie has truly withstood the test of time. the story of a mutiny aboard a warship in 1905 does have the feeling of soviet propaganda, but does a good job showing the conditions that led to the revolt. the scene on the odessa steps should remain seared into anyone's mind.okay, so "the battleship potemkin" wasn't actually the first movie to use montage, but they did a great job with it here. certainly any film history class should show this movie. it's a great historical drama (although i will admit that i don't know how accurate it is). a 10/10.oh, and we should have learned by now that "potemkin" should be transliterated as "potyomkin".

originally supposed to be just a part of a huge epic the year 1905 depicting the revolution of 1905, potemkin is the story of the mutiny of the crew of the potemkin in odessa harbor. the film opens with the crew protesting maggoty meat and the captain ordering the execution of the dissidents. an uprising takes place during which the revolutionary leader is killed. this crewman is taken to the shore to lie in state. when the townspeople gather on a huge flight of steps overlooking the harbor, czarist troops appear and march down the steps breaking up the crowd. a naval squadron is sent to retake the potemkin but at the moment when the ships come into range, their crews allow the mutineers to pass through. eisenstein's non-historically accurate ending is open-ended thus indicating that this was the seed of the later bolshevik revolution that would bloom in russia. the film is broken into five parts: men and maggots, drama on the quarterdeck, an appeal from the dead, the odessa steps, and meeting the squadron.eisenstein was a revolutionary artist, but at the genius level. not wanting to make a historical drama, eisenstein used visual texture to give the film a newsreel-look so that the viewer feels he is eavesdropping on a thrilling and politically revolutionary story. this technique is used by pontecorvo's the battle of algiers.unlike pontecorvo, eisenstein relied on typage, or the casting of non-professionals who had striking physical appearances. the extraordinary faces of the cast are what one remembers from potemkin. this technique is later used by frank capra in mr. deeds goes to town and meet john doe. but in potemkin, no one individual is cast as a hero or heroine. the story is told through a series of scenes that are combined in a special effect known as montage--the editing and selection of short segments to produce a desired effect on the viewer. d.w. griffith also used the montage, but no one mastered it so well as eisenstein.the artistic filming of the crew sleeping in their hammocks is complemented by the graceful swinging of tables suspended from chains in the galley. in contrast the confrontation between the crew and their officers is charged with electricity and the clenched fists of the masses demonstrate their rage with injustice.eisenstein introduced the technique of showing an action and repeating it again but from a slightly different angle to demonstrate intensity. the breaking of a plate bearing the words "give us this day our daily bread" signifies the beginning of the end. this technique is used in last year at marienbad. also, when the ship's surgeon is tossed over the side, his pince-nez dangles from the rigging. it was these glasses that the officer used to inspect and pass the maggot-infested meat. this sequence ties the punishment to the corruption of the czarist-era.the most noted sequence in the film, and perhaps in all of film history, is the odessa steps. the broad expanse of the steps are filled with hundreds of extras. rapid and dramatic violence is always suggested and not explicit yet the visual images of the deaths of a few will last in the minds of the viewer forever.the angular shots of marching boots and legs descending the steps are cleverly accentuated with long menacing shadows from a sun at the top of the steps. the pace of the sequence is deliberately varied between the marching soldiers and a few civilians who summon up courage to beg them to stop. a close up of a woman's face frozen in horror after being struck by a soldier's sword is the direct antecedent of the bank teller in bonnie in clyde and gives a lasting impression of the horror of the czarist regime.the death of a young mother leads to a baby carriage careening down the steps in a sequence that has been copied by hitchcock in foreign correspondent, by terry gilliam in brazil, and brian depalma in the untouchables. this sequence is shown repeatedly from various angles thus drawing out what probably was only a five second event.potemkin is a film that immortalizes the revolutionary spirit, celebrates it for those already committed, and propagandizes it for the unconverted. it seethes of fire and roars with the senseless injustices of the decadent czarist regime. its greatest impact has been on film students who have borrowed and only slightly improved on techniques invented in russia several generations ago.

"journey to the far side of the sun" (aka "doppelganger") is an entertaining, twilight zone-style sci-fi offering from gerry and sylvia anderson (the team behind space: 1999, ufo, thunderbirds, fireball xl-5 and others). in the film, roy thinnes (of the "invaders" tv show) and ian hendry star as astronauts sent on a flight to a planet which shares an exact orbit of the earth, but on the opposite side of the sun; hence previously hidden from view. a pushy european space flight director (over-acted by the late patrick wymark) gets the flight fast-tracked and after rigorous training , the astronauts are good to go. thus begins the best sequences in the film, the launch, flight and landing on the 'other' earth. dazzling rocket miniature work (by derek meddings) and a dream-like, elegant spaceflight (somewhat reminiscent of the best moments of "2001: a space odyssey") are easy highlights of the movie. the landing on the "doppelganger" earth is both exciting and eerie. after this, the twilight zone aspect of the film kicks in; with a plot lifted almost whole from the classic tz episode, "the parallel." that aside, the film is still solid sci-fi, with some intriguing 'mirror-world' stuff to chew on (backwards writing and left-handed handshakes, for example). less successful are the scenes depicting a mid-21st century earth; where all the men wear turtlenecks and nehru jackets and all the women wear mini-skirts. some of the relationships with women in the film are very 'non-pc' by today's standards as well. and (in the most consistent failing of most 20th century sci-fi) the computers, telephones and other hardware are all big, colorful and clunky (right out of patrick mcgoohan's "the prisoner"). no one foresaw the digital microprocessor age! if one can accept these failings in foresight, the movie is very interesting, with a solid lead performance by thinnes as the troubled astronaut. and with a nice, 1960s/early '70s style nihilistic ending! for fans of retro sci-fi (like myself) this is a "journey" worth taking!

'doppleganger', ( or 'journey to the far side of the sun' as it is more commonly known ) was written ( with input by the late donald james ) and produced by gerry and sylvia anderson, best known for their 'supermarionation' television shows such as 'thunderbirds'.the international space agency eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun, and proposes a manned flight be sent there. the committee balk at the exhorbitant cost, and shelve the project. but when a security leak at the agency is discovered, fearing that the russians might get there first, the project gets the green light.american astronaut glenn ross ( roy thinnes ) is teamed with british scientist john kane ( ian hendry ). after weeks of gruelling training, the phoenix blasts off, heading for the unknown.three weeks later, their ship crashes in what appears to be a bleak, mountainous landscape. ross survives, but kane is badly injured. a light is seen moving towards them...i will leave the synopsis here. until this point, the film has been gripping, with excellent special effects ( by derek meddings ) and music by anderson's resident composer barry gray ( why it has not been issued on c.d. is a mystery ). but when ross and kane crash land, and we discover the secret of the alien world - it is a duplicate of our own, everyone on it is the same, the only major difference is that things are reversed - it becomes less interesting, and ends with a shattering anti-climax. i think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea, in fact gerry & sylvia later did something similar on their 'space: 1999' show. ross risks ( and ultimately loses ) his life in an effort to return to earth - his earth. but why? the new earth is so similar he might as well not have bothered.roy thinnes had recently done 'the invaders' television series, and gives a competent performance ( pity there weren't more scenes like the one where he rows with his wife ). ian hendry is good as 'kane', but vanishes from the story too soon. several actors went on to appear in the andersons' 'u.f.o.' such as ed bishop and george sewell. blink and you will miss nicholas courtney ( 'the brigadier' from 'dr.who' in a tiny role ). but the acting honours go to the late patrick wymark as 'jason webb', head of eurosec. the character is not far removed from 'sir john wilder', the one he played in a.t.v.'s 'the power game'. webb is such a devious character he is marvellous to watch. herbert lom's contribution ( as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye ) amounts to little more than a cameo.like i said, the special effects are marvellous, as are the sets. so the film is worth watching, but do not expect very much to happen once the action moves to the mirror planet. with a stronger script, this could have been another 'planet of the apes' or - dare i say it - '2001: a space odyssey'.in anderson's productions, he made the future seem like a great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, everyone had swank cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women, and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world. we are in the future now and people are still watching 'coronation street' every other night. how disappointing. if a mirror earth really exists somewhere, one hopes that is a better place than this one. if all the women there look like lynn loring or loni von friedl, i will be on the next flight!

this is an excellent anderson production worth comparing with the best episodes of ufo or space 1999 (first series). of course it isn't some sfx extravaganza or star wars pseudo-mystic tripe fest, but a subtle movie that has a slow pace, yet it conveys the creepy, eerie and uncanny atmosphere of the best anderson productions: for lovers of 'cerebral' sci-fi. lynn loring's voice is absolutely awful. sfx are good for this kind of product and acting is good as well. two astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun but crash land home instead...or do they? ah, videophones! every now and then peddled as the next 'everyone's gadget next decade' but still to happen 40 years later. the device of earth's twin planet on the opposite side of the sun also returns in gamera tai daiakuju giron (1969), so who copied whom?

i saw this movie in the early 70's when i was about 10 yrs. old on tv. it was on after school, and as i watched, i was so drawn into the whole idea of the two astronauts going on a mission to another undiscovered planet, that i asked my mom if i could get the cassette recorder out. she let me. so i wrapped the cord of the mic around the channel knob, so the mic was hanging in front of the speaker. this movie is the first one i ever paid enough attention to - and cared enough about to record. (just the audio - there were no vcrs at the time.) the plot will have you hanging onto every word.. every minute of this film.. the ending will blow your mind. after watching the journey to the far side of the sun.. you will have flash-backs in your mind about it for a long time. i did replay the audio recording for many years... and "saw" it over and over in my mind. then - maybe 15 years later.. when vcr's were common, and they sold tapes in stores.. i always looked for it.. but never found it. but when the internet came along one day i searched for it and purchased it in a second. so.. after about 30 years after seeing it for the first time - i got to see it again. wow!~~ it was spectacular! just for reference.. i must have watched it 50 times since.

in this film, the astronauts sent to explore a newly-discovered planet must deal with several dilemmas, and they do so intelligently. the film approaches it's main plot theme in a unique way, and unfolds it gradually, though it can be guessed beforehand.the acting is very good, though sometimes stiff, as some late-60s acting can be. it can also be somewhat wordy and even melodramatic, especially after the plot theme reveals itself. visually, it has a scene that resembles one in the previous year's "2001: a space odyssey", and that tends to date the movie. some of the actors went on to star in the 1970 tv show "ufo," which is delightfully campy and worth checking out on dvd.despite these small points, the space flight itself is realistic, and considering this was 1969, the scenes inside the cockpit of the spacecraft also had a realistic look. (look for some 1990s/2000s video technology in use, too!) one thing: i suspect a love scene has been cut, but i can't prove it! it would have been a distraction anyway.unlike most sci-fi films, this film will make you think about the plot, and that's well worth a look. i'm pleased to have this film in my video library.

this is the question that astronauts roy thinnes and ian hendry ask themselves when they discover a parallel world of earth always hidden on the far side of the sun in this 1969 cult science fiction melodrama, released here in america as journey to the far side of the sun. the plot of the film was devised by british writers gerry and sylvia anderson, the creators of such tv shows as "ufo", "the thunderbirds" and "space 1999". it is exceedingly weird at times, betraying the influence of "the twilight zone" and even stanley kubrick's classic 2001: a space odyssey. the visual effects work of derek meddings, who would also later work on superman: the movie, holds up surprisingly well under the last three decades of special effects advancements; and while they are not really on the same exalted level of the kubrick film, they are very superb. if you don't anticipate a star wars-type of a film and can overcome the occasionally trite dialogue, doppelganger is a good film; it was good enough for me to rank it a '7' and consider it an undiscovered sci-fi gem.

i had never seen this movie before it aired on a local cable sci-fi network. it reminded me of the irwin allen tv series of the late 60's (time tunnel etc). excellent effects (they beat star trek 5 done 20 years later, but then that wasn't very hard to accomplish).i found the script very intriguing and mature for this type of production. they would have needed a few touch ups to tie some loose ends on the characters' level, but for a kid movie its surprisingly interesting (especially the the glimpse at futuristic euro- politics, surprisingly similar to today's european union!)the plot is indeed reminiscent of twilight zone in general (as other users have pointed), but in this case it's a compliment.great sets, by the way!7/10

this movie is surprisingly good. the ninja fighting sequences were unbelievable. i haven't see all sho kosugi's films but this is probably the best of those i've seen. probably the most impressive fighting sequence was at the beginning when ninja killed about 20 people, that was one of the most impressive ninja fighting sequences i've ever seen. another good fighting sequence was at a cops funeral where the ninja provide more people to bury. the last fight was also very impressive. also i kinda liked the soundtrack of this movie. the story was good enough for a ninja-movie, actually it was kinda different from other ninja-movies. so if you are a fan of ninja-movies, you'll probably like this one.

this is probably the only female ninja movie ever made. it's great as a b film and the action sequences are a lot of fun to watch. this movie is just so deliciously 80's. you'll never see another film like it. check it out for some 80's retro fun.

for many and many years, gaijin have visited japan for learning martial arts, instead of acquiring any knowledge on it, gainjin have been told only nihonjin could achieve the excelent performance required to show some techniques in a "public" performance such as a movie...this one special movie, made by sho kosugi, not only shows all of those techniques and skills, but also teaches many and many lessons on how to achieve them, and one can verify that by seeing a lucinda dickey performing fantastic and unforgettable acting skills in ninjutsu...i strongly recommend watching this movie more than thrice, because three times is not enough to seek out hints and tips given so easily by sho kosugi to those who really seek knowledge itself, the gnosis...

wow. i've never seen nor heard of this film. it just came on tv (2:00 am) and i am in complete awe. setup: a bunch of rich fat cats are out golfing. one knocks a ball into the rough. it lands by a ninja!!!! a tuxedoed man walks over to pick the ball up. the ninja grabs it. crushes it in his hand. man pulls gun. ninja pulls blowgun. ninja blows dart into gun barrel. gun explodes!!!! this is just the beginning of the greatness, people. everyone must see this movie. 10 big ol fat stars from trusty.

there are few movies that have the massive amount of non stop ninja action as ninja iii: the domination. this is a story of love, redemption and revenge, however, this is mainly a story about flipping out and killing people for no reason at all. if you've been searching for a movie where a ninja goes absolutely nuts and takes all kinds of people to their graves just because he's a ninja and he can do it, this is the movie for you. i can't think of any movies to compare this to, because no movie is this awesome. wait, oh, have you ever seen the thing with two heads? there is a part in that where the titular thing is riding around on a motorcycle and about a million cop cars are chasing it/them around, but they keep crashing and what not because you can't catch the thing with two heads!!! well, that is kind of what ninja iii is like. i highly recommend this film especially if you like the following things: ninjas, swords, lucinda dickie from breakin' and breakin' 2: electric boogaloo, video games about being a bouncer in a bar, ambiguous and underdeveloped love stories or "good" ninjas.

this is an action packed film that makes me feel very peaceful and relaxed every time i see it. the film (short of its conclusion) demonstrates that in the face of extreme odds, it is still possible to prevail.this film is very refreshing, and likely to be banned at any moment. get a copy of it before the thought police burn every copy they can find. they don't want you to have hope for the future, or to think you have a chance.on the other hand, should political correctness fail to supress it, this would be an excellent movie to release on dvd. such a release could contain interviews with the writer and director, and related goodies. i'm sure it would sell some copies, and i would be one of the first to buy it.- mincka

excellent plot line makes this movie one of the classic, cult ninja flicks of all time. the plot being that this woman's soul is possessed by an evil ninja spirit. i mean to be honest if i could obtain ninja ability through possession i would. furthermore, for being in the 80's and such the fact that the ninja aspect was far greater in this particular decade is evident and despite all that, ninja 3 the domination manages to keep it original from the american ninja cookie cutter molds that plagued the 80's for so long. this chick is definitely michael dudikoff on steroids.... i mean the first american ninja was great but let's get real folks it has nothing on ninja 3

after seeing this movie, i have no choice but to write a review in the hopes that there are others like me out there who were blown away by the rocket fueled ninja action and white hot sexual titillation that is ninja iii: the domination.we all know that sho kosugi rocks. that is a given, but how about jordan bennett's ultra macho interpretation of his character police officer "billy secord"? bravo mr. bennett, bravo. you prove early on, while trying to seduce the buxom christie (played to perfection by one miss lucinda dickey of breakin' fame)that you are not afraid to take chances on your craft. i particularly enjoyed how you do not feel the need to step in and attempt to help her as 4 thugs try to rape her outside her gym. oh you could have helped sure, but by standing there and watching you let her know who was boss. secord will wear the pants in this relationship. i also enjoyed how mr. bennett was not afraid to repeatedly take off his shirt or wear the wife-beater tank top despite his gorilla like shoulders and back. back and shoulder hair are hot and secord knows it. and how about lucinda dickey? all i can say is "kaboom" - i see a sex bomb getting ready to explode. she's got all the right moves as both a temptress and a martial arts whiz. the chemistry behind dickey and bennett is what makes this movie tick. you'd think she would hate him because he's kind of a cheesy jerk, but no my friends. the animal magnetism is too strong to resist, and they bond like crazy glue. sho kasugi is not as prominent as you might think, though still a main character, which is fine by me because all i wanted was more bennett and dickey. he does seem to wear a lot of eye makeup which was nice to see. the special effects? wow. that is all i can say. i will not give away the ending but let's just say it will not disappoint. i love ninja iii: the domination, and can only hope that there is a ninja 4. i give it a 5 out of 5 throwing stars. disappoint.

this film is the greatest ninja film ever made in my opinion and if you haven't seen it then its worth watching. i would rate this film a 10/10 if you want to see more then check out http://uk.geocities.com/ninja3thedomination the opening sequence where the evil ninja is killing everyone in his way is excellent his character is the best. he then has to possesses ayoung woman who finds him dying. she then has to take revenge on the cops that killed him which means there's more killing and action. but only a ninja can destroy a ninja so she and her boyfriend who is also one of her targets enlist the help of yamad(sho kosugi) to release the evil ninjas spirit and destroy him.

i've always been fascinated by ninjistsu, who would know that it will go further than beyond. in "ninja iii", it's fun creepy and intriguing. a ninja gets shot up by the police, and uses his spirit for revenge. the victim, a lovely young woman named christie(lucinda dickey). she falls for the cop who was involved in the shooting. the love scene where she pours the v8 on her body knocked me out! the ninja's death gets the attention of another in japan named yamada(sho kosugi) he comes to america not only to save christie, but to put the ninja back to the grave. simply because he put out yamada's left eye with a shuriken(throwing star). the fight scenes were excellent. i liked the part when the plywood falls on yamada, and he splits it with his foot. and when he was caught, he tells the officer christie was involved with that everything will be fine. rule of thumb: never under estimate a ninja. he took out the other cops without killing them. and he did his thing without worry. of course, chirstie did her best trying to put the ninja in his place for using her a tool for revenge. it was a good movie, great for martial arts buffs. 3 out of 5 stars!

this is a pretty silly film, including what may well be the least erotic come-on ever to make it to the big screen (the heroine pours v-8 all over herself and invites the hero to lick it off -- yuck!). and yet it also features the resplendent lucinda dickey in what is far and away her most erotic performance. in those long ago days, women -- even action heroines -- with real muscles were a rarity, and i can still remember the way my jaw dropped when dickey took off her shirt, revealing the most powerfully built female back and biceps i'd ever seen. dickey's beauty and vitality carry the film: she could have been a female schwarzenegger if anybody had had the vision to promote her.

this might be my favorite so bad it's awesome film of all time. like many pre-teen children of the 80's repeat viewing of revenge of ninja spawned a ninja phase of my childhood. man i thought sho k. was badass back then. jet li could wup him with both legs in a cast! this movie has insane crossovers that include flashdance,the exorcist and the lee van cleef ninja tv show. ugh. but as a friend of mine says anyone can get a good movie made it takes true genius to make a film that starts with a ninja surviving 17 shotgun blasts long enough to take over the body of arobics instructor to get revenge. wow. while previous commentors have metioned the sword flying out of the closet on the string no one has yet metioned the powerful love scene. where the sexy leading man cop takes off his shirt to reveal a mane of backhair. the fun never ends. rent this!!!!!!

sam firstenberg's "ninja 3:the domination" mixes martial arts with "the exorcist" like horror.the horror elements thrown on screen are simply laughable,but the film works as a mindless action/martial arts flick.the fight scenes are well-choreographed and exciting,and the film is never boring.so forget stupid dialogue,lame acting and annoying soundtrack-grab some beer and check this one out!highly recommended!

canadian film-maker ron switzer delivers a solid, non-stop thrill ride of relentless horror with the superb 1991 sci-fi film "science crazed". a hideous monster takes revenge on his mother, a police officer and tenants of an apartment building. brilliant practical make-up and special effects designs create a truly terrifying monster, especially when lurking through the atmospheric shadows and smoke of the gloomy apartment settings. the characters are developed beautifully with outstanding and surprisingly touching performances from an ensemble cast. produced by donna switzer, newcomer ron switzer also penned the film's face-paced script, weaving together an engaging roller-coaster ride of twists, turns, and terror that keeps you guessing until the last frame. science crazed will no doubt leave you haunted long after the shocking conclusion. highly recommended!

for those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures, let me give you a little lesson in american film-making.documentaries rely heavily on casting. you pick and choose characters you think will enhance the drama and entertainment value of your film.after you have shot a ton of footage, you splice it together to make a film with ups and downs, turning points, climaxes, etc. if you have trouble with existing footage, you either shoot some more that makes sense, find some stock footage, or be clever with your narration.the allegation that the filmmakers used footage of locales not part of the movie (favelas next to beautiful beaches) does not detract from the value of the film as a dramatic piece and the particular image is one that resonates enough to justify its not-quite-truthful inclusion. at any rate, you use the footage you can. so they didn't happen to have police violence footage for that particular neighborhood. does this mean not include it and just talk about it or maybe put in some cartoon animation so the audience isn't "duped"? um, no.as for the hopeful ending, why not? yes, americans made it. yes, americans are optimistic bastards. but why end on a down note? just because it's set in a foreign country and foreign films by and large end on a down note? let foreigners portray the dismal outlook of life.let us americans think there may be a happy ending looming in the future. there just may be one.

unlike the previous poster, i liked the celluloid treatment. it looked good, and made the movie that much more enjoyable to watch. to me, it didn't detract at all from the power of the documentary's content. in fact, i felt the slickness of the look allowed me to just lose myself that much more in the content. the previous poster was fair to liken the style to a nike commercial; it definitely has that look. but for my tastes, it worked really well (and i am far from a fan of nike commercials).in my opinion, this is how documentary film-making should be done. i can't wait to see the next installments from these promising filmmakers.

the producer, matt mochary, stumbled upon the film's subject, anderson sa (leader of the afroreggae music movement), when on a hewlett foundation trip to rio de janeiro. mochary was so moved by sa's story that he called his friend, nyc filmmaker jim zimbalist, who quit his job and joined mochary in brazil to work on a documentary on sa, rio's favelas, and the culture of violence.the first part of the film shows you the culture of violence in rio's favelas (shantytowns where the poor live) via footage of police raids and assaults on the residents. the footage is graphic and shocking.rising from the negativity of the favelas is the charismatic anderson sa, who overcame a possible career in drug dealing to start the afroreggae movement, which combines elements of afro-brazilian culture, reggae, ska, and other elements into a fast-paced, percussion heavy style of music which has since spread to other parts of the world. you can't help but be carried away by the music, especially when you see the local children get involved in sa's school, which he founded to keep kids out of drug gangs. the rest of the film follows sa's meteoric rise and his positivity changes many of the children's lives to seek a life beyond drug running. spoiler: just when the filmmakers thought they had wrapped filming, an unbelievable life changing event occurs of which the resolution has to be seen to be believed. the film then continues and you are gripped in your seat until the end.this film is a response to "city of god," and a worthy one at that. the bleak situation portrayed in that movie is countered by a real example of how favela dwellers can overcome the dire situation they are in and use their resources to constructive ends. you can't help not liking and rooting for anderson sa to succeed.this film is terrifically shot, fast-paced, and is quite absorbing. judging by the overwhelming response of the audience at last night's silverdocs screening, the film should get domestic distribution in the us and the thumping soundtrack should be released as well. keep an eye for this superlative documentary--it is excellent!

scintillating documentary about how a small group of idealistic young men have used music, art and dance to unify and heal the community of vigario geral, one of the most violent slum neighborhoods in rio ("favela" means neighborhood in portuguese), offering to its young people a positive alternative to the lethal gangster world of drug traffickers.in their feature film-making debut, zimbalist and mochary have crafted a movie that is breathtaking because it works on so many different levels. as social document, it gives the facts we need to know to have a context for understanding the significance of the particular story told here. the story itself is well developed, with a strong narrative arc, and, for added measure, it is shot through with keen suspense. there's an arresting, charismatic central protagonist, anderson sa: he's a savvy natural leader, articulate, courageous, spiritually evolved, a talented performer, a visionary who walks his talk.there's also plenty of music and dancing to entertain. there are talking heads ¬ñ mainly sa and his closest associate, jose junior - but they are presented with imaginative cinematic brilliance. the editing nicely mixes footage of differing themes, punctuated only occasionally by a few fact-filled still texts. the pace is as lively as the music. a lot gets accomplished in 78 minutes.grupo afro reggae, the neighborhood social club that anderson, junior and a few others formed in 1993, deploy music and dance as the weapons to go up against the drug lords and the duplicitous police. they teach percussion skills to any kid who wants to join a class, along with dance, martial arts, a community newspaper. the only requirement for kids to belong is no smoking, no drinking, no drugs. there is a subtle, soft sell spiritual fabric running through the movement, loosely based on the hindu god shiva, the destroyer of old habits.jeff zimbalist, who also was the lead cinematographer and the editor, is a modern culture and media student at brown university. he burnished his chops editing feature documentaries for pbs and others, and he teaches film at the new york film academy and elsewhere. matt mochary, like andrew jarecki ("capturing the friedmans") did a few years ago, recently came to film from the business world.zimbalist and mochary together won the award for best new filmmakers at the 2005 tribbeca film festival, and "favela rising" was tied for the best film of the year in awards made for 2005 by the international documentary association. i could go on for pages about afro reggae, sa, and this movie. a way better idea is simply for you to go see it! my grade: a 10/10

for once a story of hope highlighted over the tragic reality our youth face. favela rising draws one into a scary, unsafe and unfair world and shows through beautiful color and moving music how one man and his dedicated friends choose not to accept that world and change it through action and art. an entertaining, interesting, emotional, aesthetically beautiful film. i showed this film to numerous high school students as well who all live in neighborhoods with poverty and and gun violence and they were enamored with anderson, the protagonist. i recommend this film to all ages over 13 (due to subtitles and some images of death) from all backgrounds.

i'm surprised with the questions and issues this documentary has brought up in the reviews here, specially because they're indeed interesting questions. surely, the ones who could best address it would be the makers of the film themselves. nevertheless, i think i can shed some light upon something that i think has been overlooked, which is, in my opinion, the purpose of the film, what it is about and what it's trying to convey. what's its message after all? at the risk of pointing out the very obvious, i'll start saying the filmmakers have an intention. they're trying to tell a story, extract meaning out of it and get a point across. with this in mind, we can shoot down many of the criticized points, particularly the ones involving what people expected in contrast with what the filmmakers were really trying to show. causes and consequences of violence? the film is not about that. it's not "enlightening non-brazilian audiences" about the brazilian favelas' issue? well, who wanted to do that? is afroreggae this or that and supported by whom? it doesn't matter in this context. not enough women in the film for your tastes? it's not about equality or the feminist cause. every little detail about anderson's life, mother, son, family and all the aspects and the workings of the afroreggae movement? well, don't be so picky because it doesn't matter. there's just so much length a story can have before it can't become a film anymore. if the authors were to show everything everyone is expecting, they'd have to make a 6 months tv series instead. if you are expecting all that, you approach the film the wrong way.the film is actually about two individuals who started a movement. two individuals full of ideals. two individuals who thirst for change. two individuals trying to do something about all the wrongdoing going around them. individuals who went rock bottom and wanted to get up again. it's all about finding purpose in life, drawing inspiration from misery, changing the destiny and becoming something else than what they were destined to be -- criminals and drug dealers for that matter. it's about achievement and hope and not about the cruel reality of violence in rio de janeiro, though it's an integral part of the film given that's what the characters are constantly surrounded by. unexpectedly and not without a reason, the film ends up centered much more on anderson's course through difficulties in life. this is because they were faced with anderson's accident while they were shooting the film. i'm not sure about this, but they may have even seriously considered ending the filming right there, leaving behind all effort spent. but anderson wanted to keep going. and so they did, risking to lose in having a film with a bit of an identity crisis, considering the sudden change of course, but gaining in showing someone overcoming such a devastating happening. it's very evident for who watches it that the film begins about afroreggae and winds up about anderson. it's very unique in this sense (the shift of the story line). maybe their only sin is not making it evident upfront, which may initially rise expectations that will go unfulfilled.as for the importance or ordinariness of anderson, i'd say not everybody wants to change the whole world, end all violence, feed all the hungry, be like mahatma ghandi, be as known as mother teresa or whoever other known personalities there are. it's much easier to relate to and draw inspiration from someone who is, such as everybody else in fact, trying to transform his or her own harsh life, raising problematic kids, coping with permanent injuries or diseases and even managing to pay the bills by the end of the month. to understand the movie you have to see that's about leaving behind a past of involvement with drugs and crime, making up for it, and trying to persuade others not to go down the same troublesome path. though you can criticize if the way they chose to do it is effective and doubt the ideology of the method, you cannot deny their intentions.also, the perception that anderson is special or a chosen one may have partially something to do with the fact that the filmmakers became very involved in the lives of the characters they were depicting. as much as becoming friends with them. there's no way it wouldn't tint the whole movie with a more favorable light over anderson. if a dear friend becomes paralyzed in an accident, it's not just a fact, you make a big deal out of it. and this is not necessarily bad. it's not much that they treat him like "a chosen one" as much as they go to great lengths trying to show him as a seed for transformation and source of inspiration.in conclusion, don't watch this documentary for the scenes of the reality of poverty and crime it contains, watch it for what it is much more, an inspirational story.nike-ad-like? seems just damn good and professionally made to me and doesn't affect or detract from the intentions of the film. romanticized? speculate on its credential as a documentary if you will, but why not when it's supposed to cause reaction and inspire? isn't trying to better people's lives through music and dance -- the essence of what the subjects are trying to do -- romanticizing the very own reality? pardon me, but showing just the plain facts is what reporters do and you can watch it on tv every night.if i wanted to become a filmmaker, i wish my first film would also be this great.

favela rising is a documentary about the slums of rio, the favelas, specifically the most violent one, vig√°rio geral. according to this film, a lot more kids have died violently in rio's favelas over the last decade or so than in israel/palestine during the same period -- a fact astonishing if true, which shows how under-recognized this social problem is in the rest of the world. this is an important topic, especially for those who see hope in grassroots efforts to marshal the neediest and most at risk through a vibrant cultural program. this is a compelling documentary, if occasionally marred by a somewhat too personality-based version of events and by grainy digital video and film that sometimes may make you think you need to have your eyes examined.drug lords rule in the favelas and gun-toting teenage boys are the main drug dealers, like in parts of colombia. fernando meirelles' movie city of god/cidade de deus has been accused of celebrating violence (cidade de deus is another of rio's many favelas). but the early section of favela rising shows that in fact favela boys do celebrate violence and want to deal drugs where the money and the action are. it's cool to carry a gun there, cool to work as a drug trafficker: it's fifty times more profitable than the earnings available by other means.mochary first discovered the afroreggae movement and its leaders anderson s√° and jos√© junior while visiting rio for a conference and quickly persuaded his friend and mentor zimbalist to quit his job and come down to help make a film with his own promise to fund it. s√°'s eloquence and charisma and a startling twist in his life make him the center of the film and its chief narrator, but like the favelas themselves the film teems with other people. no doubt about the fact that s√° is a remarkable leader, organizer, and artist.vig√°rio geral is compared to bosnia: shooting there was very dangerous. anderson s√°'s friendship and protection and caution and diplomacy in the shooting enabled the filmmakers to gain access and shoot detailed footage of their subject matters while (mostly: there were close calls) avoiding any serious confrontations with drug lords or drug-dealing cops. they also trained boys to use cameras and left them there on trips home. that resulted in 10% of the footage, including rare shots of violent incidents including police beatings. it's hard for an outsider to keep track of police massacres in rio. there was one in the early 1990's that looms over the story and inspired s√°, who ended his own early involvement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement. the cops are all over the drug trade and if anybody doesn't like that the ill trained police paramilitaries come in (often wearing black ski masks) and shoot up a neighborhood, killing a lot of innocents.this is pretty much the picture we get in meirelles' city of god, except that this time s√°, junior, and the other guys come in, starting in vig√°rio geral but spreading out eventually to a number of other favelas to give percussion classes that attract dozens of youth -- girls as well as boys. their afroreggae (grupo cultural afroreggae or gcar) program, formed in 1993, is a new alternative way of life for young black men in the rio ghettos. it leads them to leave behind smoking, alcohol, and drugs (that's the rule) to explode into rap, song, percussion, and gymnastics in expressive, galvanic performances. eventually the best of the performers led by s√° wind up appearing before big local audiences with local producers, and their banda afroreggae has an international recording contract.other centers and groups have been created by or through the gcar over the years in vig√°rio geral and other favelas to seek the betterment of youth by providing training and staging performances of music, capoeira, theater, hiphop and dance at gcar centers.the performance arts aren't everything, just the focal point. gcar is also a movement for broader social change gathering public awareness through such performances, the centers also provide training in information (newspaper, radio, internet, e-mail links), hygiene and sex education, to seek to bridge gaps between rich and poor, black and white, and to offer workshops in audio-visual work, including production of documentaries. the program is currently active in four other favelas.there are many scenes of favela street and home life in favela rising and they look very much like the images in city of god with the important difference that the focus and outcome are very, very much more positive. not that it isn't an uphill battle. and the corruption of the police, the inequities of the social system, and the indifference of the general population of brazil are not directly addressed by any of this. but there's a scene where s√° talks to some young kids in another favela, cynical boys not enthusiastic about afroreggae and determined to work in the drug trade as s√° himself did as a boy. s√° doesn't seem to be convincing any of them despite pointing out that traffickers don't make it to the age of fifty. but we learn that the most negative boy in this group, richard morales, joined the movement five months later. there's also the account of a freak accident that disabled s√°, but with a positive outcome.it would be great if the images were sharper and clearer and if the story were edited down a little, but this is vibrant, inspiring material and represents committed, risk-taking documentary film-making and it's nice that favela rising has been included in seven film festivals and won a number of awards, including best new documentary filmmaker at the tribeca film festival. it's currently being shown at the institute of contemporary arts (ica) in london. however, a wide art house audience in the us seems somewhat unlikely.included in the sfiff 2006.

i attended a screening of "fierce people" at the 2006 woodstock film festival. i hesitate to label it a "premiere" of any sort, since it was shot in the spring of 2004 and had its world premiere at tribeca in 2005. it played several festivals that year. release seemed imminent, then it disappeared. poof. vanished. or so it appeared to the film-going public. rumors of a theatrical or dvd release have popped up now and then, but all proved unfounded. then this screening was announced. perhaps one can call it a "re-premiere?" it certainly felt as if i was witness to a buried treasure. and what a treasure it was.i suppose one could characterize "fierce people" as a coming-of-age drama. but it also has elements of comedy and tragedy, as well as mystery. and a bit of farce thrown in. in short, real life. that makes it hard to pigeonhole, which puts it more into the category of an indie as opposed to a hollywood movie. but its high production values, big budget feel, and star caliber cast seem at odds with the indie label. so let's call it a hybrid. and, perhaps, that's why it's been "lost." it defies categorization.meet finn earl (anton yelchin), 15, whose father is absent. in fact, finn has never known him. but he sees him and hears him via the collection of home movies sent from south america. dad is a renowned anthropologist, and has made a name for himself by setting up shop with the yanomani, the tribe of "fierce people" who live to kill and, well, procreate. all their activities are built around those two "tasks," and finn is captivated by it. mom liz (diane lane) is also somewhat absent. although present physically, she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol. so finn becomes an adult in his little solitary world with his reels of film.one summer, mom decides to drag finn along with her into the wilds of new jersey. a massage therapist, mom has catered to a wealthy client, ogden c. osborne (donald sutherland, in a tour de force performance) and he has invited her for an extended house call at his palatial estate. osborne's "tribe" includes an assortment of eccentric rich kids, servants, and village idiots among whom finn will find himself part of his own anthropological study. will his experience with dad's films help him survive life as a visitor to this tribe? will he be accepted? or will he be seen as an outsider, concurrently struggling with his own identity as an adolescent? such is the stuff of fairy tales, and i suppose this would be if not for the dark underbelly which director griffin dunne and writer dirk wittenborn have infused into this magnificent story.with anton yelchin's voice-over, intercutting pieces of dad's home movies, finn must learn to go back to being the teenager he never really had a chance to be, stop being the parent to his mom, allow newly-sober mom to be parent to him, and learn responsibility on the way to adulthood the way it should have taken place all along. yet he needs to make this transformation in a dangerous, dark world where playing with fire is folly to this fractured family.this is, first and foremost, a story-driven film and griffin dunne emphasized as much in the intro to the film. he bought the rights to wittenborn's novel even as it was being written, and wittenborn's own screenplay comes to life in the hands of the masterful dunne in a way that's a work of wonder.this is also largely a character-driven film, and sutherland has never been better. his star turn as osborne stunned those around me and will likely leave you amazed as well. diane lane's character ultimately exhibits so many personalities that it's hard to imagine another actor pulling it off so well. she is breathtaking. but more than anything, "fierce people" is anton yelchin's film. he has a long resume as a child actor but preciously little as a teen. other than the little-known "house of d" (also a gem), he is best known as byrd on tv's "huff." in january, he will be seen in "alpha dog" (also sitting on the shelf since 2004, a film i saw at sundance this year and in which he is the "heart and soul"). his performance here goes far beyond what one would expect from someone so young, and is nothing short of spectacular.this complex, quirky film has remained out of sight long enough. "fierce people" is a treasure filled with light and shadow, comedy and tragedy, joy and pathos, but mostly wonder.

in the 2nd of his historical martial arts films, chiba portrays his real life sensei mas oyama. the film even recreates oyama's incredible feat of killing a raging bull with his bare hands (oyama did this feat over 50 times in real life). dynamic fight choreography featuring authentic kyokushinkai techniques. ironically this is one of the rare sonny chiba films in which he doesn't tear out or rip off body parts of opponents. a must see for sonny chiba fans definitely one of his top 5 films

oddly enough, the independent film channel showed this film a week after it showed karate bear fighter--even though the bear film was the second in the trilogy and this film was the first!!! what were they thinking?! while all three of these films are supposedly based on the life of this great kyokushin karate master, you can't help but think that they must have embellished the story quite a bit--especially in this first film. sure, the guy evidently did fight and kill a bull and later a bear (in fact, he fought and killed many bulls during his career), but in this film set in the early 50s, at the end of the film, the hero actually fights about 60 guys and kills many of them brutally. i just can't imagine that this really occurred. so i did some checking and found that while many of the details are correct, some of this film is pure bunk! yes, he did kill a man in self-defense and yes he did follow the widow and her son and spent a year working for them--trying to get them to forgive him. but the end of the film is great to watch but hogwash. seeing one of his opponents get a staff thrust through his head and all the other gory details couldn't have happened or else the japanese government would have locked oyama up to protect society! the film is entertaining and the fighting is excellent. there are no complaints about the action or acting. the only minor complaint is the camera work--which is a tad sloppy during some of the fight scenes. despite this minor complaint, this is a most enjoyable film. in many ways, the wandering karate master theme is pretty reminiscent of the zatoichi films--which are also lots of fun to watch but many of the exploits are truly impossible.fyi--there is an englished dubbed version of this film entitled "champion of death" and i just saw it as well. it's not a bad dubbing and it was letter boxed (a big plus), but still i prefer the subtitled version.

mas oyama was the most successful karate master of the late 20th century. he rejected the "training" of the karate clubs of the time focusing on an intense no holds form of training. he eventually built his system into a huge business empire with hundreds of schools across the world, without compromising his teachings. the testing in the kyokushin schools are still some of the most physically challenging tests any martial art school requires. one non- physical hardship oyama faced was prejudice due to his korean ancestry and he spent time proving that loyalties were to japan and japanese karate. this movie series was part of that effort although anyone who had the chance to meet oyama (i did) would never question his allegiance to japan. in this series, oyama's most famous student, sonny chiba, is called upon to portray his master.oyama arrives from the countryside where he has been training alone. he challenges and makes short work of the established karate schools he encounters. disgusted by the state of karate, oyama returns to his lone training. he eventually picks up a student, falls in love and gets in the way of gangsters who are allied with the established karate schools. in the middle of this is the legendary bullfight with a mad bull. how much of the film is true is questionable.that oyama could kill a bull with his bare hands is true. he was called on to repeat this feat numerous times. there are filmed instances of oyama actually doing this, although sometimes the bulls seemed to be tethered as oyama was getting on in years. sonny chiba portrays his master with conviction and the karate is quite good. chiba may not have been the best karate practitioner but, at this point in time, he was certainly above average. as a whole the movie is good, much better then most martial art films in the drama department. i always wondered why it's not more well known. possibly it the very realistic depictions of martial arts. people are shown getting tired and hurt unlike 99% of action film where the hero is a limitless fountain of energy and each blow instantly dispatches an opponent to death. chiba seems so exhausted at one point that it hurts to watch. perhaps viewers rather not have their entertainment reflect reality so closely.recommended especially for martial artists.

sonny chiba, as everyone knows, is the man. in this film, he portrays mas oyama (1923-1994), a real martial artist who fought over 50 bulls with his bare hands¬Öand won (interesting guy¬Ölook him up). anyway, chiba only kills one bull in the film but it's a memorable scene and as the liner notes say, right up there with the zombie vs. shark scene in zombi! the film also offers up loads of hand-to-hand combat and a decent plot to boot, though i don't believe all of it is true. this film is the first of the oyama trilogy chiba made and is recommended for fans of martial arts action. finally, three neat little tidbits; part of the opening theme was used in kill bill volume 1, oyama himself appears in the opening sequences, and that is because he trained chiba in real life for five years!

when it comes to movies, i don't easily discriminate between crap, pure crap and masterpieces. i believe this movie is an absolute masterpiece and it's hard to keep me entertained for more than 90 minutes. this movie ran slower than mystic river and harry potter 3 combined and i still managed to stay riveted to my seat. for me, it was the passion that eric bogosian put into his performance. it's extremely difficult to pull off such a stunt and manage to garner any positive effect from it. bogosian probably nailed one of the toughest single-man performances in modern cinema. i didn't have any respect for bogosian until the end of the film. the entire monologue minutes before the inexorable climax was the turning point, it was the key that turned me around. this man hit a point so low that he knew he could never recover from it. the corporate boys congratulated him on the performance. his blistering prose made even the slimiest one in the cavalcade shake his head in awe. it made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy don't matter in the world of talk radio, even in the corporate world for that matter. stone may have been pushing some uber-liberal agenda but it was the actual movie and production that got my attention. oliver stone is a minor master of the moody. the final third of the film had probably the best lighting and cinematography i have seen in any film. stone artfully makes the dj booth feel like five-by-seven cell in a nineteenth century prison. visually speaking, it appears that bogosian's only friend is the black foam that absorbs his routine vitriol. he speaks and it doesn't speak back. it's a sad metaphor considering the way he treats the people who handed him his success. stone and bogosian carved out a stunning film of a man who is trapped in both a prison of walls and a prison of self. this man is confined to his own volition and he can never escape it. the scene that made me realize his conundrum was when he was unwilling to his ex-wife back. he preferred his own prison instead of the world on the outside. every story has a conflict and it came down to the simplest of all conflicts: man versus himself. 'talk radio' presents this conflict in an intelligent, gripping, and artful fashion. there are no hidden messages in this film and the progression of events should be expected by any astute viewer. i just leaned back and let my mind be grasped by this film and i loved it. it's unheralded, unseen, and it will never receive its due recognition. let's hope it stays that way because gems deserve to be found and then hidden again. it's a gem because i found it in the discount dvd bin at my local wal-mart store. for $5.50, it was worth the half-hour i spent digging trying to find it. i did and i got more than my money's worth. this is one of the best movies ever made and that is worth ten reasons alone. ten reasons give a score of ten.here ends my rant!

oliver stone, always ready to make politically-themed movies, makes another one here. "talk radio" is loosely based on the career of alan berg, a radio talk show host in denver who was murdered by white supremacists. in this case, the character is barry champlain (eric bogosian), an outspoken talk show host in dallas who loves nothing more than to irk the people who call in. as it is, most of the people who call in are a bunch of pigheaded racists. and things may be heating up more than anyone realizes.bogosian's performance brings a light comical tone to an otherwise serious movie. i really liked the scene where he jabs at a redneck who calls in. granted, i wouldn't call this oliver stone's greatest movie ever, but it's a good reference in an era when media gets more and more concentrated. good performances by ellen greene and alec baldwin also help.

for every fan of coming of age tales, this 3 hour adaptation of thesarah waters novel is pure fun. cinematic nods to baz luhrman'skinetic style, as well as to all those prim and proper period piecesever present on the bbc (where you're likely to have seen almostevery prominent member of this cast). it's rather bawdy and overthe top in spots, but that's just what the novel called for. the castis appealing and, in the cases of anna chancellor and hughbonneville, perfect. in the case of rachel sterling, as our heroinenan, you simply must overlook the fact that she's far too pretty toever be mistaken for a boy and run with it. it's a fantasy, after all. some fans of the novel may be put out by the various changes incharacter (particularly that of jodhi may's character, florence), butthe changes all work toward the greater good of this teleplay andprovide an overall high quality entertainment value.

i think andrew davies did an admirable job of taking a magnificent book which emulated the pace and styling of a victorian novel and turning it into a moving and entertaining film. i'm glad i read (twice) the book first which is usually the case for me. i know that one must view a novel and a film as different media and judge them accordingly. but, still, it's often hard to read the original material after a film gives away the best parts.i realize that davies is a very good adapter, but i wish the producers had chosen a woman to write the screenplay. davies, as he admits in the commentary that accompanies the film on dvd, wanted particularly to emphasis the more scatological bits in the book. i certainly enjoyed those, on film as in the book. but davies missed a half-dozen moments that are so excruciatingly, painfully tender which he could have incorporated if his sensibility were more feminine. i also would take issue with his use of the book's primary symbol, the rose.as the screenplay was plotted by davies, the denouement was inevitable and appropriate. but i really think that author waters' final nod to the rose symbol was much more interesting. and i preferred way the novel let nan "come of age" than the way davies chose.one quick comment about the four actors who essay the primary roles. they are all wonderfully talented -- well, except for the singing and dancing, perhaps -- and, moreover, their physical presences are so much what the mind's eye sees when reading the novel before seeing the film. i thought they were all terrific.i recommend that any lesbian and anyone who loves good fiction, add both the book and the dvd of tipping the velvet to their bookshelves.

it is surprising that a production like this gets made these days, especially for television. considering the strong sexual themes and explicit lovemaking scenes, not to mention lesbianism, this has been given superb treatment and direction.the sets and costumes are flawless, the direction is stylish and the characters are likeable. there is a fair amount of humor but it has surprisingly dark interludes. the protagonist is really a tragic figure, but not devoid of happiness. also, this production avoids the mistake most films/shows make when dealing with homosexuality/lesbianism. the characters are very human. it seems that to allow people to be comfortable with watching gays and lesbians on tv and movies most shows fill it full of cliches and make the characters obsessed with being gay. not so with this. in tipping the velvet, the protagonist is hardly aware of what being lesbian means!the bbc have made some wonderful productions in the past, and this adventurous period piece only confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts.

i have nothing but praise for this mini series. it's only about a year and a half old but i have seen it twice already; with greater enjoyment the second time than the first. i'm seriously thinking of watching it again soon since i find it spiritually uplifting.it is a very tender romantic drama with such beautiful performances, sets, costumes, music and scenes that it has a resonance which places it almost in a league of its own among mini series.some others have commented on the difficulties of living as a lesbian in britain in the 1890s. nothing especially difficult about that; it was only male homosexuality that was against the law as poor oscar wilde experienced to his great cost and as a great loss to the literary world. anyway, i digress.in my view, this is essential television. it is perhaps one of the greatest tragic romantic dramas since romeo and juliet, although not in the conventional sense.10 out of 10 from me.jmv

i'm glad i read the sarah waters novel first, since i had my own pictures of the characters in my head at the time. the ones cast for this production, however, were not at all disappointing - in fact, after i got used to rachael stirling as nan, i think nina gold did a damn fine job in the casting department. (can keeley hawes be more delicious?!)the bbc has done it again: this is a wonderful production of a very good book, and they have done it up in style. if you can get your hands on this (vhs, dvd) be sure to get the 181-minute version (the uncensored one.) it is a marvelous journey, albeit a bit rocky at times, that you won't regret taking.

this wonderful 3 part bbc production is one of the sweetest love stories that i have seen in a while. the actresses display a very high level of talent, especially rachael stirling as nan astley. she is funny, seductive and cute. the love making scenes and the close up kisses are very erotic regardless of one's sexual preference. the characters are well defined and very believable. i guess this is a by-product of a good adaptation from a well written novel.a truly remarkable well paced drama that picks up speed quickly after a couple of boring (but necessary) scenes in the beginning.my vote: 9/10

tipping the velvet has just three weeks ago been released in the uk and already i watch as countless letters flood to the national papers and tv guides, claiming that it possesses a thin plot, weak performances and an even weaker script.you find me incensed. this is heresy.i would really like to dispel all doubt by first congratulating andrew davies on enabling geoffrey sax to create this wonderful dramatization of sarah waters' novel by cushioning him with such a fantastic script. kudos. but i fear i must now change tack.i saw one of the premiere tv guides here in the uk (which shall remain nameless) relentlessly describing tipping the velvet as a "lesbian love story". if they are, and i assume they are, trying to promote interest in the film, then this is completely the wrong way to go about it (aside from the phrase being a disappointingly inaccurate description). by saying such a thing, they are either a) turning away those who would instinctively be repelled by "that" subject matter or b) attracting a class of people who will only watch to see some "serious girl-on-girl action". buy a video! through this display of serious inconsideration, this and other magazines are cheapening what is a brilliant adaptation of one of recent literature's greatest works. tipping the velvet is a story of love, of passion, of moving on, of loss, and of heartbreak. it's not a lesbian love story. no siree.the end result is a stylish affair, with excellent performances all round (particularly from stirling, hawes, chancellor and may). direction-wise, it's intoxicating and immersive - sometimes, fast-paced, sometimes not - but it never ceases to be anything less than compelling. as a whole, it's polished and well delivered, the sex is undertaken with tenderness and delicacy - and although many will not class it as a real "film", it will remain among my favourites for some time to come.

labeling this film a "lesbian love story" is about as accurate as calling pride & prejudice a "straight love story." there's just so much more to it than that.yes, the main character is a lesbian, but her story is classic bildungsroman, a journey from childhood to adulthood, from sexual innocence into maturity, from personal blindness to self- discovery. there is a stylistic element of camp to the film's direction, but it is not a hindrance; rather it serves to underscore the staged and dramatic parts of the main character's life.those who know anna chancellor from the bbc version of pride and prejudice will certainly be amazed with her here. rachael stirling is stellar as the main character nan, and keeley hawes is all wide-eyed goodness as her lover kitty butler. chancellor might have the stand out role, that is aside from sally hawkins who plays zena butler. this film is not for the faint of heart, but it's not a piece of pro-gay advertising either. it's a real story, with real comedy and drama, an engaging story with compelling characters, and well worth watching.

i started watching this expecting the worst, i was happy to find that the film turned out to be enjoyable, slightly confusing in parts, like when they all justs started singing. it gave me a chance to see daniel wu in action for the first time, he is a better actor than i thought, at times he seemed a bit out of place. i thought purple storm deserves its hong kong legends release, as it is different to most other hk films, it is about a mans emotional struggles when confronted with memory loss, it may sound corny but when he eventually pieces out what and who he actually is it really makes the film a lot more interesting. once you get into the film you will find it keeps you gripped to it, as if you miss one bit then a lot of the film wil make sense, for example i missed a bit at the start and i recommend to anyone that watches this that they do not miss any of it. so i can say that this film was worth watching and a grateful surprise for me, that i enjoyed it.

here we've got an intelligent mixture of typical hongkongmovieshootouts, worlddestructionthemes and intelligent filmmaking. not that the script has not its big holes and a few specialeffects are a bit cheaplooking. but the cinematography is a optical treat and the soundtrack is first rate. the blend of fast actionsequences and colorful slow, sometimes nearly poetic parts, has no comparison in its kind of movie, so a classification is rather hard. the closest genre is a disaster or terroristmovie with deeper human and political notes than usual. well worth to be seen worldwide in cinemas. but i am hoping this for so many other (mostly asian) movies before and nobody seems to believe me. unfortunately.

this movie gives daniel wu his chance to do a great action movie, but i really find emil chow's character really great, gutsy but determined to righting wrongs. plus the main terrorist, it gets me wondering his revolution, makes me wonder if he is doing this for good or bad.a movie that tells us about todd, an amnesiac terrorist being tricked as an undercover until he learns who he really is. the consequences that he makes from his terrorist family, gives him a the choice of redemption.purple storm was one of the best ones that i have seen this year. the movie really stands out when it is filled with tremendous action scenes set-up by stephen tung wai, which won the best action sequences in the hong kong awards. (9/10)

i found it charming! nobody else but kiarostami can do so little and, yet, get so much. you might think i'm weird, but i was so charmed that i couldn't speak during the movie. while during other movies i comment a lot. the short movie made by him for lumiere et companie, the one with the eggs, that one is unbeatable in my heart, but this is wonderful, too. i liked it better than ten. kiarostami is, maybe, the best director in my opinion, because he can see things! he doesn't need to use a lot of stuff "brought from home" to illustrate his images, he simply grabs a camera. not many can do that.. maybe i don't know to much about movies but i don't care about complicate stuff, all someone has to do is touch my soul. kiarostami does.

i learned a thing: you have to take this film like a funny period comedy, if you don't want to be disappointed. the film's enjoyable because it's a delicious comedy. i think the over-hype damaged it: the too much glorified monica bellucci appears in few scenes and isn't so good as they wanted to let you believe. she sounds unnatural, false: the best actress in this film is sabrina impacciatore, who speaks with a perfect tuscan accent and shines together with massimo ceccherini. elio germano is very, very good: the most promising young italian actor, according to me. daniel auteuil looks like napoleon, but i preferred other actors. so, the most hyped performances were also the worst.costumes and production design are okay: sure, american period movies are more accurate about these things because have bigger budgets, but the italian ability rewards the lack of money. a nice period comedy, in short, with a first-rate casting (except for bellucci and auteuil).

screened this morning for the press at roma film festival, "n - io e napoleone" is easy to love. first of all it can count on great production values, as very few italian films nowadays can, with wonderful settings and costumes. the cast is great too. director virz√¨ constantly speaks of the young lead elio germano as "a young de niro". now, of course he is going a way too far, but sure the boy can act. i loved his performance, and he did a great job with the (tuscan) accent. daniel auteuil is a great actor and did very well as bonaparte. it's really great to see him acting in italian, i hope to see him working in italy again very soon. the supporting cast worked well too - people like valerio mastrandrea or sabrina impacciatore may seem unlikely choices, but they all gave fine performances. even massimo ceccherini, best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy tv reality shows, fitted in well and was actually funny. the low point of the cast was the "diva" monica bellucci. sure, she was slightly better than usual, but she managed to look (and sound) utterly unnatural even in the part of baronessa emilia, in which, with a good dose of self irony, she used her own umbro accent. the script, by veteran furio scarpelli and virz√¨ himself is clever, with lots of laugh out loud lines, and a few very emotional moments too. sure, the ending left me puzzled. the message is kind of ambiguous: the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate, but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes pathetic, so that suddenly it's difficult to hate him; then, in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning. personally, i dislike very much this notion. "io e napoleone" is still a pleasant film, the best presented at the festival so far (the other being fur and the hoax). my rating is 8/10

martino, a young teacher in the island of elba, has been formed by maestro fontanelli, an excellent educator, to be his own man and to say whatever he thinks, something that gets him in trouble at the school where we first meet him because he is teaching revolutionary ideals. the island is in a frenzy because of the arrival of one of the most influential men in european history of the 19th century. napoleon is coming to his exile, not exactly a high point in his life.with surprise, martino is chosen to accompany napoleon who is writing his memoirs and is in need of help for his own project. the young man comes from a sea merchant family. his brother and sister want him to go on an commercial expedition, but martino has decided his place belongs in elba because he will try to assassinate napoleon. little deters him after his mentor fontanelli is tried for treason and condemned to be shot by a firing squad.martino finds his consolation with the much older baroness emilia, a beautiful woman. in his own interaction with the deposed emperor, a different kind of man emerges. napoleon is seen as a more human person who really enjoys the company of martino, not suspecting with the plans the young man's own plans for him. unfortunately, martino is not able to put his design into action because napoleon has other plans in mind.paolo virzi, the director of "caterina va in citta", shows why his early promise is still there. mr. virzi also collaborated with the screenplay, which is based on a novel by ernesto ferrero. the director shows he is as good in intimate drama as well as with this type of spectacle. alessandro pesci, the cinematographer, does an excellent job with the images he was able to get.elio germano, a young italian actor is the best thing in the movie. he is playing against more experienced players, yet he manages to convince us he is the idealist youth trying to get justice to what he perceives is a noble cause. the great daniel auteuil is a more subdued napoleon than one would expect from anyone's interpretation of this larger than life man. monica belucci is the love interest of martino, but she has little to do. omero antonutti plays fontanelli.

would you like to know why french and italians love/hate each others? would you like to have a glimpse of history that drives our lifetime? so, go to watch virzi's film (in original language, of course) and you can look at a wonderful monica bellucci who finally speaks her native language from citt√† di castello (umbria, just at the border with tuscany). and the rest of the characters speaking livornese (lovely sabrina impacciatore and all the others). daniel auteuil definitely in his shoes with napoleon. a lot of fun, a real fresco of the elba island landscape, and a picture about the political reasons to kill or leave alive a tyrant (good for all times).

debbie vickers (nell schofield) and sue knight (jad capelja) want to become one of the cool girls in their high school. uncool and ugly girls had two options, be a mole or a prude! debbie and sue imitate them by using their cheating practices in an exam. two of the cool boys, garry (goeff rhoe) and danny (tony hughes) ask them for their answers and they all get busted. after a bawling out from the headmaster (bud tingwell) the cool girls meet them outside in the playground and confronted them about whether they "dobbed" on them all. as debbie and sue hadn't the cool girls invited them to the "dunnies" for a smoke. they then start to hang with them on weekends at the beach, watching all the boys surf. sue ends up going out with danny and debbie with garry. a lot of usual teenage action takes place including sex, drugs and rock and roll. garry has an eventual overdose of heroin which makes debbie face the inequalities of life and she decides to learn to surf instead of just watching the boys. they are not happy but watch her, calling names, and eventually debbie masters the board. a cool early 80s aussie film.

a fantastic movie, and very overlooked. gary has never been more handsome, and ingrid is more beautiful than in any other film. if you don't believe, just watch the movie. every cast member is wonderful; the love scenes between gary and ingrid will make your pulse race! the story is great, the script is oscar caliber. don't miss this film!!

ingrid bergman (cleo dulaine) has never been so beautiful. gary cooper as "cleent" so perfectly cast as a laconic texan who knows this gal is up to no good. when the two lock eyes at the french market, we know this match will be full of sparks. when they stroll in her garden in her restored french quarter house and the love theme plays it is a dream for all us romantics.the costumes are lovely; the set decoration makes you wish the "quarter" was just that way. and that saratoga still had that hotel with the wide veranda with all the old biddies gossiping.from edna ferbers novel, the story is of revenge for old wrongs and the fights over who would run the railroads in the early days of that industry.in the saratoga scenes, florence bates as a grand dame steals every scene.but it is the scene of cleo taking on the little lawyer her new orleans relatives have sent to buy her off that is a magic movie moment. after cleo has bested him in the negotiations, he looks at her with longing and says "may i say - you are very-beautiful". and cleo with a happy, wicked smile says "yes, isn't it lucky." you want to shout "yes"!!!one of my all time favorite romantic films.

this film is pretty good, it actually is like a good wine, it gets better the more you watch it. the pace is pretty slow for such a high octane topic, but the cinematography is beautiful and surreal. there is a cool blue tint that "rides" the whole film. there is also one great performance in gabriel casseus' performance of the character "midget". he is terrific. why doesn't this guy work more. if the film got better support, he probably would have.

i thought nick gomez's look at the gritty streets of new jersey, where car-jackings are at an all-time high, was both thought-provoking and entertaining. this is just as good as movies like boyz n the hood or menace ii society or above the rim. i thought the actors and the scenarios were suitable, it had a gritty realistic feel to it and was very atmospheric, whether on purpose or by raw coincidence. i liked this movie a lot, an underrated gem i found on tv and glad i caught it. go watch this movie if you get a shot. if they don't have a dvd, they should release one. well done nick gomez. imdb rating: 5.9. my rating: 9/10

wow i love this movie. this is definitely added to my list of ghetto movies.juice - starring tupac 'i don't giva f***' menace ii society - o-dawg 'i'll smoke anybody, i just don't giva f****' new jersey drive - hey they steal cars in broad daylight they obviously don't giva f***new jersey drive is the best hood movie ever. it is at the top of the list, menace ii society is second, and juice is third, clockers is really stupid.the soundtrack for new jersey drive is pwnage too mac mall & young lay - all about my fetti is heard through out the movie.lords of the underground - burn rubber, another good song, and so is ill & al scratch - don't shut down on a playerif your a fan of gta-sa you'll freaking love this movie, and the amazing soundtrack. the soundtrack is basically rap about stealing cars ^_^ sweetttt movie!

i lived in that area (hoboken and jersey city)for about ten years. this film certainly captures the feel of that time and place. the dialogue is very good, the music is right and scenarios realistic. as another poster said, it looks almost like a documentary.i like the way it humanizes these kids, who probably would have rather have been born in westchester, but fall into what kids fall into. it just so happens that area is pretty rough.they over-demonize the cops quite a bit, but that's to be expected. i'd say the acting is good all-around, too.it gives the viewer some sense of how this idiocy is caused and gets blown out-of-proportion. hopefully, the new mayor of newark is making progress.

this movie brings to mind "boys 'n the hood," "menace to society," "south central" and others of its ilk and even shares actors with some of them. the film's "us vs. the law" mentality is underscored by the all-black neighborhood vs. the nearly all-white police force. here the cops are so bad they seem like caricatures and in one scene they even ambush the boys as they drive by in a car they've just "liberated" from its owner. it's like a bushwhacking from an old western, but the contemporary setting makes it look all too real.the story centers on young jason petty and his buddies, to whom school is just an inconvenience that takes time away from their "real occupation" of boosting cars. this happens to be newark, n.j., a rust-belt city low on jobs but notoriously high on crime. in fact the problem is so severe that the cops all have "car theft" written on their backs, to show that an entire unit must be devoted to this particular crime.the boys use a "slim jim" to gleefully break into cars and go joy-riding, as if it's no big deal. they only run into real trouble when the police ambush them. the vicious, nazi-like lt. has a vendetta against the boys, seeing them not as human beings who might be worthy of redemption, but as human targets. in fact, he's a little reminiscent of that sadistic nazi officer of the warsaw ghetto, who shot down jews for pleasure in the film "schindler's list." when the boys steal a police car in retribution for the ambush, things predictably go downhill fast. they are severely beaten by the cops and jason finally ends up in prison. clearly these are "bad boys," who'd steal your car in a minute, but the film wants us to see them as anti-heroes, showing jason protecting his sister and his friend taking care of his own grandmother. the film left us wondering whose side to take and who to feel sadder for: the boys whose lives are going down the drain, the honest citizens whose cars are being stolen left and right and who could be caught in the crossfire of a shootout at any moment or the city of newark itself, the spirit of whose law is being betrayed by brutal, soul-dead cops.in spite of the over-the-top portrayal of the latter, the film offers a realistic-looking rendering of the ghetto, of the protagonists and their families and of the culture of car theft in a city where there appears to be only 2 career paths - law enforcement and crime. strangely, the entire subject of drugs is never mentioned.the filmmakers (including producer spike lee) are obviously biased against the newark police, who, we hope, are not as bad they are portrayed here. nevertheless, they've given us yet another a strong, affecting story about the inner city and black youth gone awry and sharron corley is fine as jason.

this is a very realistic movie. it's the most realistic i've seen on urban youth. the actors were great. i will look out for more films by gomez. i had never heard of the film until someone mentioned it recently. i bought it on dvd. i was impressed. i haven't seen anything come close to life as i know it in philadelphia. this comes real close - in fact, one scene where there is an accident (i won't spoil and give details), reminded me of a nearly identical situation in philadelphia. at first i thought gomez took the scene from that real-life event, but then i realized that he made the film a few years before that situation. i also agree with the point that this film didn't try to broaden its appeal by putting in hollywood crap. gomez also directed "laws of gravity" - i am eager to see it.

being from eastern pa, right on the border of northern new jersey, i still get a feeling like this was a documentary more so than a movie. i have friends from new york and new jersey and this film represents the kind of lifestyle that "still" exists today in lower income area's outside of the "big city" lifestyle. if you have not seen this movie and ever wondered what really goes on in the urban jungle, check this movie out. no really big name actors, its as if they just pulled these guys off the street and said act, which adds to the realism of the movie, the performances are fantastic none the less! see this film!

i just wanted to inform anyone who may be interested that the the movie "new jersey drive" was my personal favorite off alltime. i admire the work nick gomez and spike lee put into this masterpiece of a movie. this movie made quite an impression on me because of its realness and its appreciation of detail of life in urban new jersey. it struck a chord with me, personally, because i grew up with friends like those depicted in the movie. it further made an impression with me because i used to spend time in teaneck several years ago, so some of the characters were kept "real". at times, this movie seemed like a documentary because you didn't know whether or not these were real events taking place. although movies like "boys in the hood" and "menace ii society" grab more attention, i personally feel these movies were somewhat "enhanced" to appeal to a broader audience. "new jersey drive" was an uncompromising piece of "in your face" reality. lee and gomez covered every detail in this urban drama from the music, clothing, slang, and location.unlike some of the movies i mentioned earlier, the actors performed as if they weren't "actors". nothing was compromised in order to make good "theater". the only misfortune to come from this movie was the fact that many people "slept" on it. i look forward to more works of art from nick and spike in the hopefully near future.

i am not one to like those anime cartoons (eg.pokemon,dragonball z,naruto), but zatch bell is different in my opinion.zatch bell is more exciting, has better characters, and doesn't focus so much on a sort of weapon or mamodo as much as the episodes i've seen,such as it the episodes "big brother kanchome", "zatch vs. kiyo".zatch bell really focuses on the life of the strange zatch,the smart kiyo,the clueless suzy,and the weird ponygon.zatch bell is probably my fav cartoon for now,but i encourage others to watch 1 episode of it, you'll most likely will like it!-robbie h.

this anime recounts the tale of the battle for mamodo king. every 1,000 years, 100 mamado children are sent to earth to fight to determine who will be their next king (in the original japanese, the creatures are mamono, which literally means magic/evil object). each mamado is paired with a human partner, and given a magic spellbook. the human can use this book to unleash incredible powers in the mamodo, and when a mamodo is defeated, their spellbook is engulfed in flames (alternately, a mamdodo's book can be captured and burned directly). after that the mamodo returns to the mamodo world.the titular character is zatch (gash in japan), a 6-year old mamodo with electric powers. he is paired with kiyomaru takamini, and 14-year old genius. zatch is initially reluctant to fight, but learning that some mamodo are evil and deciding the battle for king is wrong, he decided to fight to become a 'kind king'.zatch bell has drawn comparison to pokemon, but a better comparison is to digimon. like digimon, the mamodo and human have a one to one, symbiotic relationship. also unlike pokemon, both shows have an actual plot.zatch bell features character growth and evolving relationships, and some fairly adult story lines (like love vs racism; slavery; mind control; etc.). it even has some decent plot twists and mysteries.

take a young liberal idealist christopher boyce (timothy hutton) put in a top secret classification in a government front company because of his father's position team him up with a no'count drug dealer daulton lee (sean penn) who is wanted by the police and needs a new source of income and you have a recipe for espionage. sean penn played the part of the punk drug dealer with a certain sang froid probably out of particular verisimilitude with such raunchy types. the gall penn carries with him in every situation is unique; he even suggests the soviets run drugs for him.i've seen the movie over and over again and each time i see something new. it seems to me that a major problem with us spy organizations is its inbreeding which leads to the hiring of an obviously unsuitable candidate by reason of temperament and inclination for a government front company.i do recall when the falconeer escaped from prison and led the authorities on a wild goose chase. i see that despite the escape he is now released. a pity the soviets are no longer around to accept the wretch! a cheery cherio!

the falcon and the snowman is based on a true story. christopher boyce, and andrew daulton lee, (the titular traitors,) played by timothy hutton and sean penn, received their code- names from the kgb. why? boyce was an avid falconer and lee was a coke head. the movie is based on a true story. it's based on the book of the same name. another reviewer asked what was their motivation? disillusionment it ain't. ideology it ain't. (pardon my bad grammar,) but i'm making a point here. what was it if it wasn't disillusionment or ideology? in a word, greed. by the time of the boyce-lee case, money became the great motivator and not ideology. don't believe me? then look at the walker family spy ring which was broken in the late '80s. three spies did the worst damage to our national security in the '70s and '80s. john walker, who began his career as a spy in the '60s, christopher boyce, and andrew daulton lee. all three sold out this country for thirty pieces of silver. if you aren't familiar with that phrase, i suggest you read the bible.

... sings david bovie in this movie. but it is!!! it's all about america, so don't be ashamed to watch it. just think, if you can, to prevent more damage... you know, you're just the same regular guy next door, so, be careful! one of the best critics of "common" mind and friendship. still don't care? go for it for the music - it's worth a try, just close your eyes and pat metheny and david bowie will touch you so deep you'll start to scream! and while watching, if you'll dare to open your eyes, please don't do the popcorn&stuff, you're gonna miss quite a lot. you may think that it's not worth, but, think twice - and don't look at your neighbours lawn - you never know what to find there... is it worth? try it! just don't die or gloat over it...

"the falcon and the snowman" is the story of two young men, a cia employee and a drug dealer, who become disenchanted with united states foreign policy and sell state secrets to the soviet union. the events of the film are based on a true story.timothy hutton and sean penn are convincing in the lead parts and develop interesting characterizations. the supporting cast also performs well, notably with a performance from david suchet of hercule poirot fame as a seasoned soviet agent.the film is generally effective at setting out its premise and developing it and giving a sense of two boys caught in something they did not properly understand going in. however, it does seem overlong and cumbersome at points in the middle. the ending, however, is tense, stunning and effective. there are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack, but also unfortunately a repeated mellow synthesizer track that doesn't fit with a spy story. there are other spy films more worth seeking out than "the falcon and the snowman", but it is a decent film none the less.

director john schlesinger's tense and frantic film tells the true story of christopher boyce and andrew daulton lee, two young men who sold united states government secrets to the soviet union in the early 1970's.timothy hutton plays christopher boyce very competently. he is a young man very disillusioned by the cia's underhanded activities in allied australia. sean penn, as the doped-up, drug running andrew daulton lee, is outstanding.the competent and professional direction of schlesinger, along with some very good acting, make "the falcon and the snowman" an espionage thriller not to be missed.tuesday, february 4, 1992 - video

"the belief in the big other as an invisible power structure which exists in the real is the most succinct definition of paranoia." ¬ñ slavoj zizek this is a review of "marathon man" and "the falcon and the snowman", two films by director john schlesinger.though hitchcock and lang brought the "conspiracy thriller" to hollywood, the genre only blossomed in the late 60s and 70s, with films like "the parallax view", "z", "marathon man", "capricorn one", "the manchurian candidate", "three days of the condor" and "all the president's men". this was the age of vietnam and watergate, the public deeply suspicious of all political leaders.the genre remained quiet in the 80s and early 90s, until the "x files" tv series sprung to life. with taglines such as "the truth is out there" and "trust no one", the series posited a world of vast conspiracies and government plots, the common man at the mercy of all manners of ridiculously elaborate schemes. the only way out of the maze? "fight the future!" as the tagline of the series' final season proclaimed. it was apparently our duty to trawl through the labyrinth of information, discovering some elusive "truth" that ensured our own freedom.this trend ended with the boom of the internet, conspiracy thrillers now giving way to "conspiracy documentaries". the internet generation lapped up such independent documentaries as "loose change" and "zeitgeist", whilst in the mainstream michael moore titillated his audience with stuff like "fahrenheit 9/11". all these documentaries believed in a "secret order", a cabal of wealthy politicians and businessmen who conspire to reduce human rights and enslave the world. they struggle to create a mono-myth, linking various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single, all encompassing narrative that explains the purpose and point and future of everything.this need to "streamline narratives", to make them more "efficient", is reflected in the scientific community, who battle to create a "grand unification theory" and ultimately a "theory of everything", merging everything from quantum mechanics to special relativity into one giant all encompassing formula.so ultimately, the "conspiracy thriller" is rooted in man's desire to have control. the modern subject is one who displays outright cynicism towards official institutions, yet at the same time believes in the existence of conspiracies (an unseen other pulling the strings). this apparently contradictory coupling of cynicism and belief is strictly related to the demise of the big other. its disappearance causes us to construct an other of the other (conspiracy) in order to escape the unbearable freedom its loss causes. conversely, there is no need to take the big other seriously if we believe in an other of the other. we're therefore allowed to display cynicism and belief in equal measures. man thus seeks to assert control over a wayward universe, to create a kind of paternal babysitter (be it god, a mathematical formula, a conspiracy theory, an explanation for violence/conspiracies/murder/war etc) who provides meaning and symbolic order. the big other provides reassurances to the believer. it's a "lifestyle choice", akin to religion, in which his place in the world is dependent on sheer irrationality. the problem with most "conspiracy thrillers", from the innocent days of hitchcock's "topaz" all the way up to modern fare like "the da vinci code", are two fold. firstly, they are not incorrect in suggesting that something is "wrong" amongst the "elite" or "best people", but they are incorrect in individualizing and personalizing processes that are social, collective and systemic, an approach which implies that it is just a question of personal morality rather than social structures. secondly, and most importantly, these "conspiracies" ignore the fact that the big other simply doesn't exist. there is no symbolic order pulling the strings.some modern "conspiracy thrillers" ("eyes wide shut", "existenz" etc) acknowledge this, with their untangleable webs of lies, accidents, truths and half truths, nothing ever adding up, nothing ever making sense, the real and the hyperreal, the truth and the desire, all blurred, without any identifiable ground zero, but these are mostly films by intellectual directors.compared to these modern "conspiracy thrillers", "marathon man" and "the falcon and the snowman" are positively archaic. "marathon man" is a about a grad student (dustin hoffman) who gets embroiled in his big brother's business (roy scheider), which unfortunately has to do with spies, guns, double agents, diamonds and evil nazi dentists. scheider is suave, hoffman is excellent and schlesinger hits us with some neat visuals (the reveal of the eiffel tower is stunning), but what's most interesting about the film is the way that its various plot lines don't intersect until the 1 hour mark. even then, it takes a further half hour for things to start making sense. unfortunately, the film ends with a clich√©d showdown between the villain and the good guy, everything neatly resolved and explained."the falcon and the snowman" is a bit more ambitious. sean penn and timothy hutton play two friends who sell government secrets to the soviet union. hutton works at a civil defence contractor and smuggles information out of his office and into the hands of penn, a small time drug dealer who has no qualms selling to the kgb. penn does this strictly for the money, whilst hutton is disillusioned with the american government (particularly its attempt to depose the leader of australia) and so sells the secrets strictly because he hates how his country conducts crimes and games of espionage. in other words, the film is about a conspiracy undertaken as a response to conspiracies."marathon man" ¬ñ 7.9/10 "the falcon and the snowman" ¬ñ 8/10 aside from an oddly slapstick car crash and its clich√©d ending, "marathon man" is an effective thriller, with several neat scenes. "the falcon and the snowman" is even better, penn turning in a memorable performance.

this movie is one of my all-time favorites. i think that sean penn did a great job acting. it is one of the few true stories that made it to film that i really like. it is in my top 10 films of all-time. i watch it over and over and never get tired of it. great movie!

based on the true story about christopher boyce (hutton) and daulton lee (penn), and their involvement in selling american secret government documents to the soviets during the 1970s. boyce works for the government, and his job is to guard these particular documents, which ultimately disillusions him about his country's affairs and practices. he then enlists his drug-dealer friend, daulton lee, who has become a wanted man, to be the courier for these sensitive documents. lee infiltrates the russian embassy in mexico, and makes contact with alex (suchet), and they both begin to play the espionage game.lee's interest is purely about money whilst boyce is acting out of anger towards the system he is involved in. alex believes lee to be the inside man in the american government. things start to become array when lee's drug addiction and reckless behaviour in handling the courier position offsets both alex and boyce. lee becomes more paranoid, and the initial espionage game becomes more deadly and consequential for everyone involved.this is a true spy thriller without the cheesy action. the character motives and analysis of real-life subjects is sympathetic but very well written, and the film cleverly interweaves the real-life events with underlying political themes about human predatory behaviour. where a bigger nation uses their political power to control the smaller nations. well directed, and intense in parts, especially where the protagonists become immensely in over their heads in the spy game. timothy hutton and sean penn give amazingly riveting performances in a film that questions authority and yet there is no simple answer to the political message or the complexity of that system. the plight of the protagonists becomes the underlying message within 'the falcon and the snowman', and makes it a clever political thriller with a poignant element about society, human relationships, and the american system. great film!****1/2 out of *****!

"the falcon & the snowman" offers some of the best acting from its two leads. hutton, in a brilliantly understated role, calmly portrays the confusion and angst of a man who seemingly turns traitor for no other reason than as rebellion against his father. penn, as the co-conspirator basically just along for the ride and drug-money, explosively turns in one of the strongest performances of his multi-talented career.

in the movie, "the falcon and the snowman", when they were showing christopher boyce around the complex, the satellite in the background was the actual ryholite satellite that is now in space. trw allowed interior shots. trw also allowed both interior and exterior shots for one of the original star trek tv series. (the episode is the one where spock goes blind when a string of satellite lights are activated to kill the aliens). christopher escaped jail (lompock) and was featured on america's most wanted. he was drinking in a bar when the show aired. he said, "hey, that's me". needless to say, he was captured and transfered to a maximum security jail.

this movie is based on the true story of christopher boyce and his friend daunton lee. this fascinating story takes place around the time of the whitlam dismissal, in which during his time as a clerk for trw, christopher was privy to classified correspondence which admitted the cia's involvement in australian political and union circles. the movie shows several scenes involving gough whitlam (transmitted over us tv), where events take place which confirm the classified documents that christopher had read previously. the removal of gough whitlam was an organized cia coup. elsewhere in the film, it was mentioned that most people have no idea about the level of deception that goes on, ultimately to ensure that the us is used as a vehicle to promote certain policies at the behest of everyone else. in the current age, nothing has changed.christopher's life was profoundly affected, read shocked, by his knowledge of what and how the cia shapes foreign democracies, including the democracies of allied nations to the united states. christopher reacted, probably not in the best way at the time, by selling top secret information to the soviet union with daunton lee acting as his exchange. eventually christopher and daunton were captured and convicted of treason.on 23rd may 1982, whilst serving time in us prison, christopher boyce agreed to a one and only interview with ray martin of 60 minutes australia because it was the australian connection that profoundly affected him. it caused a furore in the australian media for about a week, then it went hushed.i liked the movie's symbolism of the falcon, and in it chris was called the falcon, and daunton the snowman (drug connection), but in reality the title "falcon" was not something that was used by chris.christopher boyce: criminal or man of conscience? you decide.resources: http://www.playitforwardoz.com/boyce.html

the falcon and the snowman is a superb example of an anti-80s film. while many other films of the decade in general lacked substance, this film is pure substance. there's nothing stylish or fake or superfluous about it. it boasts two superb performances: timothy hutton and sean penn as lifelong friends christopher boyce and daulton lee, respectively. hutton, penn, and tom cruise were a triumvirate of early 80s actors who all looked headed to much bigger and better things (all 3 starred in taps). while penn and cruise's popularity soared, hutton has been largely forgotten about, and that's a shame. actually, hutton is the first of the 3 to win an oscar for supporting role in ordinary people in 1980, but i think his performance in this movie is even more outstanding.hutton really captures the post-vietnam war rebelliousness in his character chris boyce. a failed seminary school student, chris has a love-hate relationship with his father, well played by the great character actor pat hingle. the scene where chris quotes the poem his father thought he'd long forgotten is a particularly powerful one.chris gets job at dept. of defense and uses his hatred of u.s. gov't and its foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the soviets. he gets his buddy daulton, a hyper drug-dealing self-server, in on it to be the courier of the project plans on microfilm. while chris is doing it based on his beliefs, daulton is doing it strictly for the money. the soviet liaison is excellently played by david suchet. penn and suchet have a real quirky chemistry and it's a kind of funny set of exchanges between them. but, make no mistake, this film is anything but that. it is a serious character study about pessimism, malaise, paranoia and mistrust.again, the leads make this film. hutton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as chris, a rather smart young man who had so much potential. penn, as usual, does a tremendous characterization as daulton, a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks, and most of the time doesn't think at all. the ending of this fact-based film is very saddening on several levels. a truly powerful character study.

if you're interested in learning about the 'real' side of spying, this movie is for you. unlike 007 movies, this shows how things really go down in the world of espionage. timothy hutton and sean penn both give outstanding performances in this not-so-well-known film. certainly worth watching.

the falcon and the snowman is the true story of two college-age rich kids from l.a. who become spies for the soviet union. one, played by penn, is already a drug smuggler up to his eyeballs in trouble. the other, played by hutton, lands a position at an aerospace firm where his job is to man a top-secret cable facility. there he learns of some of the dirty tricks employed by the cia on foreigners that america doesn't like. don't forget that the movie is set the early 70s, the time of vietnam and watergate. appalled at what he's learned, the hutton character decides to betray his country and convinces his buddy to join him. neither of them is long on brains, it is not long before they're way in over their heads with no way out.this is not a thriller, and is rather slowly paced. if this is not a problem for you, then it is well worth the rental.

a great film in its genre, the direction, acting, most especially the casting of the film makes it even more powerful. a must see.

set in the 1970s los angeles, christopher boyce has just dropped out of seminary school and returned back home were his father gets him a job where he monitors intelligence documents. his old friend daulton lee is a ratty cock drug-dealer, and gets caught in a set-up and must choose between becoming a narc or facing a long stint in prison. when up on bail, he jumps and heads to mexico city. chris offers lee in a partnership to be his messenger to sell secret papers to the soviet union embassy in mexico city, because of the disgrace he feels about the us government's control over weaker countries to their own gain. but over time the two begin to clash with their motivations and find themselves in something bigger then they had originally intended.director john schlesinger has spun out such films like the respectable "midnight cowboy", "marathon man", "sunday bloody sunday" and "day of the locust". while "the falcon and the snowman" might not be held up that high, there's no question that this sombre espionage drama (inspired by a true incident) is an unjustly overlooked character portrait. everything about it, is quite a subdued affair with no real grandeur qualities hitting a massive mark. the driving factor of the film has got to be the admirably versatile lead performances of timothy hutton and sean penn as the two ambitious young lads chris and daulton. penn is especially good with his uneasy intensity, which works well off hutton's superbly cool-and-collected turn. what starts off as easy, we watch the situation gradually crumble, as the two amateurs find themselves really out of their league. the strongly detailed and symbolic (predatory behaviour) plot mainly centres on the pair's relationship and that of their reasoning's for their actions, which eventually shows us the knotty developments that led to their downfall. the plan opens up like a wound to never properly heal, due to daulton's drug addiction, which really makes him go off the rails and leaves chris to pick up all the slack. the searing political aspect is there, but it focus on the themes of idealism (boyce) and greed (lee) to get its point across. both don't mix and results show. suspense is justified through its stimulating pot-boiling script and character interactions then that of any visual gimmicks. action is very little, but still there's a pressure induced style to schlesinger's assured and realistically dark 'n' gritty direction. pacing is mostly well handled, although some sequences do seem to wallow on for too long, but however it grips you as it plays on its authentically paranoid tone to slowly build up to an exploding tight latter end. adeptly fleshed into the technical production is an airily harrowing music score and professionally poignant cinematography. the supporting cast are exceptionally fine with pat hingle, lori singer, david suchet, boris leskin, jerry hardin and joyce van patten. also look out for michael ironside in a tiny part as a fbi agent.a mostly outstanding spy-film that benefits largely from talented lead performances and by not playing the usual stakes. it's more an emotional ride, then a complex one of twists. recommended.

john schelesinger's career as a film director was extraordinary. we had watched this film when it first came out, but wanted to see it again when it showed on cable recently. the film has a faded look, as one watches it today, but still, it is interesting because of the intense performances of the two principals.if you haven't seen it, please don't read any further.chris and daulton were two childhood friends that came from upper middle class backgrounds. chris went to enter a seminary to be a priest, but gives up. daulton became a small time drug user and trafficker. the two lives seem to run parallel as the pair become involved in an illegal activity that will prove their short sightedness. in fact, it shows how both young men miscalculate in their attempt to fool the cia and the soviet union. these two, in a way, were so naive in thinking they could pull something that bigger, and better equipped people couldn't even imagine could be done.chris' motivation is legitimate, as he feels outraged in discovering the underhanded role of the agency for which he works in dealing with other nations, in this case australia, something he finds by sheer coincidence. when he involves daulton, we know the whole thing is doomed because no one into drugs, as he is, will ever amount to anything. in fact, chris and daulton had no conception of the scope of what they are trying to do, or its consequences.timothy hutton was at this period of his career, an actor that was going places. he had proved he had talent with his work in other films, so it was a natural choice for mr. schlesinger to select him, a choice that pays off well. sean penn, also was a young actor who showed an intensity, like one hadn't seen before. in fact, at times, mr. penn, reminded us of a young robert mitchum in the making. both actors' contribution to the film is incredible. one can't think who could have played this duo but them."the falcon and the snowman", while not up to the par with other great john schlesinger's movies, is an interesting look to our not too distant past.

this movie does an excellent job of taking us all the way through the dark tunnel of espionage, from the inception through the ultimate reckoning. the movie's impact is made even deeper with the realization that it is based on a true story. timothy hutton provides us with a quality, understated performance and sean penn demonstrates why he is one of america's finest living actors. as with "midnight express," this movie should make us all think twice about doing something we shouldn't be doing in a foreign country.

there is something about true stories that makes them so much more interesting than fiction. i guess it is the fact that truth has always been stranger than fiction. the falcon and the snowman tells the true story about christopher boyce and his buddy daulton lee. boyce (hutton) is a former alter boy and intellectual, trying to find an occupation that can support and entertain him. his fbi father is able to pull some strings and get his idealist son a job working in the defense department. boyce has few responsibilities and seems to be complacent drinking and goofing around with his co-workers. however, as time goes on, boyce starts to learn top secret information that causes him to doubt the morality of his government. the idealist boyce soon sees the illegal operations that the cia is carrying out in above all places, australia. boyce eventually decides that he will leak some of the top secret info he is privy to, to the kgb. of course, boyce's mistake is the assumption that because the usa is doing bad things, the ussr is the good guy. over time, boyce and his drug-dealing buddy lee (penn), start to sell their top secret information to the kgb. what was once idealism, turns into capitalism and espionage. the strength of this movie is the incredible performances by hutton and penn. although one of them starts off with the best intentions, they will both soon find themselves in an unending downward spiral. great direction, music, everything. not only a great film, but one of my all-time favorites.

excellent drama about 2 alienated, spoiled punks who go afoul of the federal government, each for his own reasons. one, a druggie, just wants to score some bucks for his next fix, but the other has a far more sinister agenda fueled in part by a resentment of his father. good performances and a hot script makes this a winner.

for the 1980s, this is a very dark movie. at this point, filmmakers were beginning to operate under the assumption that all films require smarmy comic relief (which, of course, is taken to the extreme today), flashy action scenes (even more overdone today), or steamy sex scenes.hutton and penn are stupendous in their roles as childhood friends turned soviet spies. penn in particular is brilliant as hapless drug dealer daulton lee.what you have here is a true thriller/drama. there is no eye candy to speak of, but the story is so compelling and the acting so superb that (hopefully) most people wouldn't miss it. there are a couple amusing scenes, in particular the one where penn tries to get his soviet benefactors involved in a major drugrunning deal.well worth watching.

late night on bbc1, was on my way to bed but curiosity piqued at a contemporary-set irish film so i stayed to watch for a few minutes and then stayed to the end. i have to admit that the main attraction was the only english actress, kelly reilly, who is stunning to look at.this is billed as a black comedy, which is one of the hardest things to pull off. it should be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laughs so that in the end you don't know why you're laughing - for me martin scorsese's after hours (1985) is the best example. dead bodies is more black than comedy but the plot rattles along and spirals down towards further blackness. i didn't spot the final twists in the tale as some other posters here did so i was suitably surprised.as a snapshot of the irish film industry in 2003, it all seems rather worthy; it doesn't look like they spent too much on the making of it so it had a chance to make its money back. the script could've been a whole lot sharper but the acting was on the whole pretty good. i'm glad i watched it, flaws and all, tho i don't think i learnt much about ireland today, especially their policing methods!

when it comes to those eerie and uncanny little crime films, the sorts that revolve around characters that are bordering on scum and inhabit equally scummy surroundings, and additionally carry that wavering and bleak feel thanks to some pretty grotty cinematography and some very black comedy; dead bodies is the sort of film paul mcguigan wishes he could make. alas, the maddening and sporadic gangster no. 1 as well as the equally all over the shop, but interesting exercise in surrealism mixed with realism, effort entitled the acid house are the only ones of his we've got to go on so far. dead bodies is robert quinn's piece based on a derek landy script, a film that straddles the line between psychological horror and neo-noir; intermingling elements of crime and terror with themes linked to morality and unnatural, obsessive disorders.mcguigan's british based crime efforts carry that wavy and distorted feel, like witnessing somebody's nightmare and having front row seats in the process. his films are able to disgust is some areas and amuse in others what with their outlandish and all-over-the-place approach. they carry a very dream-like sensibility despite being grounded in a very realistic, down-trodden, grimy looking world ¬ñ the real world with as much-an emphasis on the horror and the terror of the situations his characters spawn than anything else. dead bodies is a film that tackles both some pretty harrowing character driven situations as well as a brief inclusion of a study of a delicate psychological mindset, only here, the film balances both the eccentricity of its characters; the terror of the scenarios they find themselves in and the questions of morality that arise much better.dead bodies is effective and rather simplistic without ever feeling like manipulative. its suggestive and knowing tendency to want to hammer home exactly what people are thinking and feeling does not detract from the experience. early on, we meet tommy mcgann (scott), a young lad whose girlfriend jean (davis) dominates him, his life and the screen whenever she's on for the brief time that she is. the point as to the fact his situation of living in a less-than desirable house; with a job stacking shelves and a partner he doesn't get on with at all well is put across in a distinct manner. as is the manner in which the audience are given distinct permission to dislike jean what with the bratty, spoilt and expectant attitudes she so clearly possesses. later on the film will linger, rather obviously, on a police officer's face as suspicions and tensions rise in what is clearly a cheap and easy way to tell the watching audience that our hero is not quite out of trouble just yet.but compare this to gangster no. 1, in which such is the episodic and misguided approach mcguigan applies to the material; that a vital, vital plot point arises when a character is spotted leaving a building by someone else out on a 'random drive' in a scene set several months after the previous one. the feeling isn't as grounded nor fulfilling. dead bodies' set up is dominated by kay davis' jean; a would-be femme fatale just itching to pick a fight of some sort but just not really being able to find one. she has lead tommy jumping through rings; going there, doing this and that without tommy ever really reacting in the manner he could, principally because he is controlled by her promises of sex. the beginning builds a certain amount of tension because of tommy's underplayed reaction to what's going on and it culminates in a distinct release when the initial incident happens, and jean dies.if the set up is simple enough then that's one thing, but the pinch of the project is the manner in which tommy decides to rid jean of his hands by burying her without informing anyone of her death bar a best friend. things tighten when it transpires there was a second dead body in the exact same place tommy buried jean, with suspicions, denials and general trouble the all round ingredients of the day. it is at this point the film blurs the lines between noir and horror; indeed tommy inhabits rather-a large, ominous, spooky and even gothic house which he shares with an elder relative whom inhabits the upper areas of said house. this evokes memories of hitchcock's 1960 film psycho and bates' set up that he has with his mother, and where she's positioned. it is additionally no coincidence this would-be place of horror is the setting for jean's unfortunate demise.the placing of a dead body right in the hands of the hapless, male lead in order for it to act as the initial incident is a classic set up for any noir; from ulmer's 1945 film detour right up to a more recent, and more contemporary compared to dead bodies, 2006 film entitled big nothing. what this film unfolds into, is a twisted; rather unpredictable and quite frightening tale of genre hybridity and mind games told under a palette of distinctly drained visuals. the voice-overs and the treading on the fine line that the lead does for most of the film between right and wrong aid in pushing it into a realm of the neo-noir; if we consider the fact that the lead is, essentially, innocent and his murder charges are unfair then that's one thing, but his attitudes towards jean initially saw him act without thought and his covering up of her death is the anti-thesis for dropping the murder charges. dead bodies is taught; entertaining to watch without ever feeling exploitative and provides a consistent tone for the rather nasty physical and psychological content being explored.

i truly fell in love with the characters. they were very down to earth but each and every one of them had a hidden dark side. sort of a mystery. david graysmark, himself, was an enigma. the secret fears and just secrets in general that he had. there was a whole side of him that the other characters knew nothing about and it left the audience either wondering or assuming. there was always a part of this man that he would keep hidden away, yet he'd share a little of himself too. he was the strong male lead character and i admire that type of character. billy moses himself is an incredible actor who could do just about any type of part! he's an amazing talent and a good man. his fans love, respect, and support him endlessly.since this show he's gone onto many other projects and has stretched his acting ability quite a bit more and quite well. kudos to him and all the other actors from this show for doing such an excellent job! i wish them all well. i wish the series would've continued on! it's such a shame it didn't!

i had always wanted to see this film and the first three-fourths proved i hadn't waited in vain. but what the hell happened in the end? i mean, don't get me wrong, i liked the film. it definitely made me nostalgic of the realistic, unique nyc of the 80s that we have lost thanks to giuliani. but it's missing another half hour!

fame, i think, was the best movie that i have ever seen. in ways it was funny and dramatic, but that is what makes a movie. true, it has a few loose ends, actually a lot, but i still think that it is a terrific movie. some of the funny things happen in the audition at the beginning of the movie. i think it is hilarious when the girl tries to act out o.j. simpson in "the towering inferno" and raul/ralph goes around to every art department saying that his father was great at every one. he says that his dad danced with the rockets and left ralph his tap shoes. the rockets, as far as i know, are made up of women. and the tap shoes were just regular shoes with bottle caps on the bottom. also the guy who read the lines of juliet in the romeo and juliet play was funny. one thing about the movie that just turns me on is the music. i have never heard anything like it!!! my favorite song is "i sing the body electric" and my second is the theme song itself "fame". irene cara has a great voice and is a great actress. i like the way the movie focused on many ethnic groups. it showed all of the kinds of people there actually are in what is now called "la guardia school of the performing arts". this movie showed the triumphs and trials of many young performers, including angelo, doris, bruno, coco, montgomery, ralph, leroy, hilary, and liza. they all had a hard time, but made it their own way. this movie could have added on about another 30-45 minutes (before the graduation), but it is still my favorite movie no matter what!!!!

great cast, great acting, great music. each character in this movie had their own stories and personalities and it's vivid. a great movie not to be missed.

well,i am a dancer so automatically i liked this film. the only thing i didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as i thought there would be. but i have to say the it was a good dance film. i think there should be more songs too. but it was a good film as i said before! my rating 9/10!

"fame" had been one of my favorite movies for years! it is not just an 80's musical movie of "that" high school in nyc, it is legendary- people no longer refer to the high school of performing arts but "the fame school"!!the characters are real, they are not "hollywood" and their stories are real. the film follows them through the four years of school, starting with a powerful monologue by one student at auditions and finishing with a spectacular graduation show.apparently some find the broadway show better, however it is my opinion that you should definitely see this movie anyway, and then have your own view. for anyone who enjoys movie watching and would like to have the "classics" down, this is surely one of them. it is an example of one of those movies that was really great, with actors that we loved for those 2 hours, and then never saw them again... they are classic "fame students".make fame live forever.

although at first glance this movie looks like the story of your parent's high school life (and many people will try to tell you that this movie is way outdated)... and i admit that that was my first impression.... but honestly,the 'lessons' that are learned by the heroes/heroines are def. not outdated. who doesn't want to be famous? and who doesn't want do be accepted my their peers? and the homosexual guy-isn't there a whole controversy today about gay marriage, blah, blah? this movie, though released in the 80's still addresses some of the biggest issues in today's world. this movie does have a little too much profanity and nudity for my taste, though. (thus the 8/10 rating)

i expected fame to be an uplifting film but it ended up the opposite. the overall plot which follows the lives of several determined students attending a performing arts school has strong potential. however, fame builds its characters up beautifully and then leaves us with so many questions when its over. i was very surprised when the graduation scene pops up -- we thought the dvd had skipped or something. all of the characters have internal and external conflicts of some sort and virtually none of them are resolved when the movie ends! you might think there are too many characters, but its probably too many scenes. its evident the film was cut up and shortened because its sometimes lacks transition. i think laura dean as lisa monroe is my favorite character. i really connected with her character's ambition and following her heart. boyd gaines as michael, the stereotypical poor student who can't read but is a divine dancer, is also very good. i didn't especially like irene cara's character of coco, but this is not cara's fault since her script is weak and her character is not fleshed out. her voice is beautiful and hearing her songs warrants watching the whole film. in summary, the film could use many improvements, but the quality actors and great music earn its place in film history.

this movie has become an iconic stand-in for what is great about america. fame is famous for its music and performances. there are several standout actors, singers, and dancers, including irene cara, paul mccrae, anne meara*, and the superb gene anthony ray. the plot is not the movie. it follows an interesting format ... but, it all really ends in a kind of mush.where parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into periodic overdrive - with the extremely poignant, sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score & performances.the film's climax is a song-dance fest of musicians,dancers, & score by christopher gore. a wonderment to behold. * an interesting note about the magnificent and superbly talented anne meara ... sometimes talent must reside in the genes ... ms. meara is married to one jerry stiller and is the mother of ben stiller ...

this movie and its subsequent tv series followup has become the iconic stand-in for what is great about america. fame is famous for its music and performances. there are several standouts including irene cara, paul mccrae, anne meara*, and the superb gene anthony ray. the latter who plays a walk-on dancer with no academic or other than "street" credentials is an amazing personality and is worth watching for what is essentially a portrayal of himself. a wonderment to behold, as one king was apt to say.the plot follows an interesting format - chronological at times, genre at other times, personalities in some cases ... but, it all really ends in a kind of mush.where parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into periodic overdrive - with the extremely poignant and sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score that matches the performers step for step.the climax of the film is a climax for all times. and this climatic complete cast of many many talented musicians and dancers and music is thankfully repeated throughout the credits. these are one set of credits that are well worth sitting through ... an achievement for the ages. the music by christopher gore is a gift to behold.

this movie tells the story of nine ambitious teens trying to follow their dream at the infamous new york high school for performing arts: coco, the singer, bruno, the modern mozart, lisa, leroy, and hilary, the struggling dancers, ralph, the comedian, and doris and montgomery, the actors. while they all think they have what it takes to really reach their goals, they are going to need a lot more than just their talent. they will have to deal with rejection, heartbreak, education, pain, and love in order to achieve their fame."fame" is one of the most entertaining, classic, and inspirational movies of all time. it has everything a teen drama/musical should have: extremely catchy, entertaining, oscar-winning songs performed by the amazing irene cara, stunning dance numbers, a very attractive cast that makes you believe in the characters, and a great story, including the heartbreaking scene when coco meets the video camera.like i said, the cast is awesome. irene cara can really act, and it's not only her singing that makes her shine here as coco. lee curreri is very good as bruno. barry miller brings a lot of humor to ralph. maureen teefy is great as the outcast doris, and look closely, and you'll see paul mccrane of "er" as montgomery.this is truly an amazing film. "fame" really touched me and inspired me to keep following my dreams as an actor and singer. any movie that moves me this much is a winner in my book. a must-see! the film really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer.

fame was released in the u.s. a year before i was born; i was too young to ever remember the original version of fame- and yet i heard and read numerous things about it. such as the fact that it spawned a tv series and that its soundtrack was led by the irene cara, giogio moroder hit, 'fame'.fame was arguably the first of its kind to portray and showcase the world of performing arts in the form of a feature length film. the lives, the struggles, the hurdles the students and some of the teachers undergo themselves were under the eye of the viewers.the performances were great, yet one which caught my eye in particular was gene anthony ray, who played the troublesome yet promising leroy. angry, frustrated and at first rude, his character later became less angry and frustrated and more committed to his studies- not just with the practical in the performing but in the theoretical too. irene cara was good as coco- the scene with her taking her blouse off while some pervy director was filming her was rather discomforting to watch-, as well as paul mccrane for his amazing portrayal of a vulnerable but closeted homosexual trying to cope with life and enrolling on a performing arts school in new york, after he had been kicked out of the military when he told them he was gay. ralph played by barry miller was interesting but at times, his character did grate on my nerves.the choreography was excellent, there were some good dance numbers involved and the 'hot lunch' scene in the cafeteria was worth watching. another scene that was great was when the 'fame' song was played and all the kids started rushing out into the streets of new york and danced wildly and without a care in the world. it was a street jam like no other.the only star to ever truly benefit from this in the long run was and is debbie allen- she later became a producer, director and star- though she mostly worked behind the scenes on shows such as everybody hates chris and the fresh prince of bel air. paul mccrane later went on to star alongside peter weller in the movie, 'robocop', where he played a villain and e.r. as the judgemental, obnoxious doctor romano.british director alan parker shot this really well- he allowed the performers to dance, act, sing to their hearts content without wanting to interfere with and affect their styles.throughout the duration of the movie, we see the various stages the students encounter during their 4 years- from their auditions to freshman year, all the way up to graduation in new york's high school for the arts.fame is one of those movies which caters for or is aimed at a particular audience that isn't necessarily the general mainstream movie loving community- it is definitely not for everyone.i for one enjoyed it because i have an interest in the arts- not technically in terms of being a performer because i am not one but as someone who appreciates that creativity and artistic expression can be channelled through hard work, commitment and passion towards what one does with their talents. therefore, if you are an aspiring dancer, actor- or just someone who is creative, you might be interested in a movie such as this- though whether the events in fame are anything like what it is in a performing arts college/school in real life, then that is a completely different matter altogether.the 2009 remake of this movie was released recently and frankly, it virtually pales by comparison. as for the original fame, almost 30 years on though yes it is a bit dated but it is still a great movie, nonetheless.it's not an outright classic but as a 80s cult classic, in line with other 80s dance hit movies, such as footloose and flashdance, fame hits the spot. isn't it a coincidence that all those dance movies begin with the letter 'f'? gritty, moving and intriguing, this one is worth a watch.

film follows a bunch of students in the nyc high school of the performing arts. there's coco (irene cara) a black singer who will make it to the top despite everything. she's helped by bruno (lee curren) a white musician. then there's doris (maureen teefy) who wants to be an actress--but she's shy and scared. she becomes friends with motgomery (paul mccrane)--purportedly the only gay student in the school and is romanced by raul (barry miller). then there's leroy (gene anthony ray--who sadly died in 2003) who's homeless and a great dancer--but can't read. then there's various teachers (albert hague, anne meara stand out) trying to teach the kids.the songs are great (the title tune and "out here on my own" were nominated for best song--"fame" won), the dances are energetic and the young cast shows plenty of ambition and talent. but this film misses the boat in the drama department. many plot lines are brought up and completely left open-ended by the end of the movie. why did coco do a porno? did doris and raul remain together afterwords? did either make it? how about montgomery--what happened to him? and did leroy ever graduate--and how? there are too many long speeches (raul has two) and moments that just lead to nothing. i'm assuming there were cuts in the script--i can't believe the movie just left all this open. still, it's worth seeing for the acting and, again, the music. there's basically not one bad song and the dances go full force (and at one point stop traffic--literally!). my favorites are "fame", "out here..." and "i sing the body electric" which is a great closing song. so i recommend it but can only give it a 7--the script really needed to tie up loose ends--and it didn't.trivia: they wanted to shot this film at the actual school for performing arts but couldn't get permission. the dean of the school read the script and said there was way too much swearing in the film. that is true--there is a lot of foul language but that's how high school kids talk. avoid the tv version which abysmally overdubs it.

i saw fame when it first came out. it deals with the high school class of 1980, which was coincidentally my year of graduation. i saw the movie in the summer between high school and college and, being a performer myself, it holds a special place in my heart.the biggest criticisms of fame usually have to do with continuity, and there are definitely some story lines that either are not completed or don't make sense. however, those problems are more than made up for by the passion and emotion of the characters and the incredible music.i saw it again recently and was surprised that i still loved it as much as i did the first time. fame is often compared to flashdance, which i don't think is fair. although flashdance has some great music and jennifer beals is gorgeous, i think fame is vastly superior in the development of its characters and the complexity of its stories. for anyone who truly loves the arts, this is a must-see movie.

fame is one of the best movies i've seen about the performing arts. the music and the acting are excellent. the screenplay and set design are also excellent. my favorite part is when all the students start dancing and making music in the canteen. i can see this movie any number of times, and never get bored. i give it 8 1/2 on 10.

we enjoy a film like "fame" because we imagine we are there ourselves - music, dance and drama students, enjoying our self expression. this film had humour, entertainment and must be an inspiration to young people to have a go at the performing arts. bravo "fame". certainly worth 8 out of 10!chris

do not miss this picture that defies ages. with no hesitation, a masterpiece. not only the script and the music but also choregraphy, casting,cut : everything contributes to the perfect achievement. now nearly 25 years ago and still amazing of maturity, art andsensitivity. available now in dvd, do not miss either. the transfert is perfectand the sound re-boosted. one mystery remains about this superb work : why the actors didnot succeed better after this flashing start ?

this movie was well done but it also made me feel very down at times as well. for anyone that is considering show business this is a must see as it shows the raw deal in what goes on for these struggling workers. the soundtrack was definitely cool and the acting and dancing complimented it nicely. some of the student's attitudes might have been a little far-fetched like leroy's especially because i'm sure someone like that would've been kicked out immediately for refusing to read and such if this was the real high school for performing arts. the coco screen test is hard to watch for any people out there with weak stomachs, please heed my warning. while it's very gritty i know it's the truth on what happens so in this respect the movie is right on. overall it's entertaining and even though some parts drag on the majority goes by really quickly.final grouping:movies: probably would've skipped this one.dvd purchase: not something i'd need to see again and again.rental: worth renting at least once in your life!

"fame" is a very well done portrait of the students who inhabit new york city's high school of the arts. the film focuses on a group of students who dream of making it big while they perfect their craft at the now famous school. director alan parker allows each of the highlighted students to mature on screen, allowing you to feel a connection with each one. the music here is infectious and fun. the dancing is exciting and fresh. the film eventually became the basis for an emmy-winning television series starring debbie allen and some of the other actors from the film. one of the more enjoyable "dance" films of the 1980's. received oscars for music. 8/10

it has taken me about a year now after seeing this film to write about it. lord knows i have wanted to, after witnessing it i knew i saw something i hadn't seen before but wasn't sure why. now after reflecting for quite some time i know, it's these characters that even now i still can't stop thinking about.distant briefly and slowly tells the story of a relative (yusuf) who comes from the rurals to live briefly with a well off to do photographer (mahmut) in the city in hopes to find employment. however it becomes clear that after yusuf hypothesizes the idea of being a sailor and his employment prospects dim, that he's really searching for something else, some sort of purpose in his life.through all this soul searching we are taken through seasonal surroundings that are filmed exquisitely. the context in which they happen makes the scenes more powerful in 2 particular ones when a girl yusuf has been following suddenly meets up with her significant other, and the look of yusuf's face as he looks into a basket of fish and the shot and light that reflects off his tortured face. that scene in itself has to be one of the most gorgeously filmed pieces i have witness in i don't know how long.in the end mahmut has his own demons too, but ends up confronting his relative that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave, in a scene that is very simple but has the feeling of true heartbreak.what the viewer is left with is lots of reflecting and pondering for these 2 people who everyone can see a piece of themselves in. you should not be put off by the pace of this film it is truly worth every single breathtaking second.rating 10 out of 10.

people must learn to watch what is up there on the screen. this is a great film that is based on a slow, careful gathering of details which serve to establish the personalities of these two men. the passivity of yusuf (emin toprak), the country cousin, is well described by his fear of talking to women. he has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young woman and loses all of them. he has many decades of bachelorhood ahead of him, and maybe unemployment as well.mahmut is a different case. he got out of the small town by working very hard (we imagine), and his resentment of slackers like yusuf is palpable (he leaves crumbs on the expensive carpet--the slob!). we are shown a group of friends talking about tarkovsky among other things, and we note that mahmut feels regret--but only slight regret--that his work has become commercial over the years. the gulf between the cousins just gets wider and wider. the mouse trap theme is wonderfully vivid, it brings out the compassion and confusion of yusuf, and the cold-blooded problem solving of mahmut.i was reminded of two classic films of men driving each other nuts: les cousins by chabrol (the rich boy with hitlerian pretensions played by brialy is always in my mind) and kiss of the spider woman (william hurt can't figure out why everybody's so mean). nuri bilge ceylan takes his place among the dozen important directors now active. i just hope that in future he will come to rely on collaborators, instead of directing, writing and shooting his films himself.

uzak (2002), a turkish film shown in the u.s. as "distant,"was directed, produced, written, and filmed by nuri bilgeceylan.this movie is a gritty and somber version of the clash between a "city mouse," mahmut, played by muzaffer √∂zdemir, and a "country mouse," yusuf, played by emin toprak. both men are superb actors, and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting skill. (tragically, emin toprak died in an automobile accident shortly after the movie was completed.)in most country cousin/city cousin tales, the contrast between rural and urban life styles is portrayed in a humorous fashion. in this film, there's little humor or even warmth. both menhave lost touch with human society. mahmut 's work as acommercial photographer for a tile company gives him no satisfaction. he has divorced a woman he clearlystill loves, and has no satisfying human relationships.mahmut has lost his job because of a factory closing in his small town, and doesn't have the skills or the energy to find work in the city. his human interactions are primarily confined to silent observations of the other people who cross his path. he's clearly a warm and caring person, but can't express these qualities in an urban environment.the cousins don't relate well to the world, and they don't relate well to each other. neither makes an effort to act in a way that would provide an opportunity for bonding or closeness. in a sense, this film portrays an opportunity wasted. conceivably, each cousin could have provided at least part of what was lacking in the other's life. instead, they steer parallel unhappy courses. the two men are distant throughout, which is a situation suggested by the film's title.one of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which ceylan builds detail upon detail. these details ultimately tell us more about the characters than we might have learned by simple exposition.uzak was shown as part of the rochester labor film series. it's not a "labor film" in the traditional sense of that genre. it is a labor film because it demonstrates the harmful effects of unsatisfying work (mahmut) and unemployment (yusuf).this is a quiet, absorbing, dark film. although it doesn't make for happy viewing, i walked out of thetheater realizing that i had seen a truly creative andimportant movie. this film is worth finding and seeing!

while sleeping, mr. eko is assigned by his brother yemi (adetokumboh mccormack) in a dream to go with john locke to disclose the meaning of the "?" symbol. with the pretext of chasing henry, mr. eko brings john with him and they find a second hatch called "pearl" underground the question mark symbol marked on the field, where a video explains that the other hatch is a psychological experiment and people behavior pressing the buttons of the computer every 108 minutes are actually subjects. meanwhile, jack unsuccessfully tries to save libby.in this episode, john locke loses his faith in the island when he finds that they have been monitored in the hatch. the disgusting michael sees the anguishing libby wishing that she was dead, while hurley, jack, kate and sawyer are suffering her pain, in a deep emotional contrast. my vote is eight.title (brazil): not available

one of the great tragedies of life is that disney is so very successful at everything that they do. if they were not, we might have more unique little gems of animation such as "the curious adventures of mr. wonderbird." the story is that an evil king has usurped the throne of a place called up-and-down-land (i could have the name wrong). he is hated by everyone. his favorite hobby is shooting birds, and at some point in the past, he presumably killed the wife of mr. wonderbird (a bird, played with typical flair by peter ustinov) leaving him with four young chicks to raise. meanwhile, we see that another of the evil king's hobbies is painting. he has done three paintings in particular: a self portrait, a painting of a shepherdess (which he has fallen in love with), and a painting of chimney sweep (of whom he is jealous). one night, the shepherdess and the chimney sweep climb down out of their paintings and run away together. the self portrait of the king climbs down out of his frame as well, and does away with the real king (you think i'm making this up? its the real plot) and sends the royal police force after the young lovers. mr. wonderbird then assists the lovers in attempting to escape the king's forces.the plot is wonderfully surreal, and the setting up-and-down-land is an incredibly imagined place, full of towering buildings accessible only by elevators. its an equal mixture of the worlds of "metropolis" and "1984" and the drawings of dr. seuss.watch it for a very unique viewing experience that doesn't fit the standard formula for most animated features.

wonderbird, certainly an unbelievably refined cartoon, drawn in a deliciously old¬ófashioned way, and sensationally old¬ófashioned in almost any respect, takes place in a kingdom ruled by a mean and heinous monarch; accordingly, the kingdom, or at least what we see¬óthe surroundings of the king's palace, seems devoid, uninhabited.a few inhabitants there are¬óaway from the sun¬óin the withered underground city.an advice¬ócall it an allegory, call it a parable, only do not call it a fable.because imdb encourages prolixity, and maybe for other reasons as well, i will add that this cartoon is the work of the great paul grimault.

(review is of the original 1950's version not the restored 1980's one) in a land where the king likes no one and no one likes the king a shepherdess and a chimney sweep from two nearby paintings come to life and run off. a portrait of the king, who loves the shepherdess, kills the real king and takes his place. a huge bird, the wonderbird of the title, acts as a hero of sorts and helps out our two lovers.this is a strange strange movie... no surreal, very very very surreal.the style of the background is very european while the characters are fliescher meet warner but early arty warner of the non major characters. they move in both realistic and cartoon like manners.this is an odd movie and it takes a bit to get into it but peter ustinov as the bird is a riot, his kids and the puppy are wonderful. there are cops in rubber ducks and a bear design that makes you smile.and there is deep philosophy in the film, about the existence of a world out there...out beyond a metropolis subterranean city.this is a really neat movie. there is something just so odd and unique about it that rewards you if you stay with it for the whole ride. its not perfect but what the hell.this is a movie to search out. if your local bargain dvd bin has the capcom version (paired with alice in paris) buy it. it should run you under ten bucks, probably around five and the price is absolutely worth it especially when you realize it comes with two full length cartoons, two short cartoons and several neat commercials and other fun things.

heard about this film a long while ago and finally found it on ebay for five bucks. i wasn't expecting much but wow, was i ever surprised. it's a story of a boy and girl in love trying to escape an evil king who wants the girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle, reminds me of ico for ps2 because some shots gave you a sense of vertigo.sounds pretty standard but this movie is insane! it's hard to believe such an original animated feature was made in 1952. also, the king was probably one of the creepiest character's i've seen in a long time, with a feminine walk, weird eyes (usually crossed), and a soft but scary voice. the only problem i had with the film was that the boy and girl had no personality and hardly even any lines except for calling for mr. wonderbird (a large talking green bird)to save them. the animation was fantastic in most areas but some cells were missing from some scenes which sucked. it's incredibly original with flying police and giant mechs and even laugh out loud funny at times, it's a real shame this is such an obscure title because it's really a good film. check it out sometime.

i just want to comment to the woman above, that the movie does credit beethoven in the begging. in the beginning credits they show it. thank you. i think this is an amazing movie. they picked just the right music for the mood of the movie, the animation is wonderful, and they picked the voices for the characters very well. it teaches children to never give up, and to always have hope. princess annika doesn't give up , and it shows children that they can do the same. the movie also has humor in in for all ages, parents and children, to laugh at. the colors in this movie are great, and kids can really feel good while they are watching it. i watched this movie for the first time, now i am a huge fan, and i'm sure your child will be too. walmart sells tons of barbie and the magic of pegasus stuff, so your child can continue to enjoy the movie even when they aren't watching it. thank you!

for a kid's movie, this is great. as an adult and mother, i enjoyed watching the movie with my daughter. there is a lot going on in this movie. the following *might* be considered a *spoiler*... barbie learns courage and learns not to judge others so quickly in this movie. she also learns not to give up hope and to master her anger. i loved the sense of teamwork you get from watching barbie and her sister and friends solve the puzzle. there's nothing in the movie i found offensive or inappropriate for young viewers. in fact, i felt that the moral messages of the movie were superb and well done.the animation was pretty good. i really enjoy the ice-skating scenes and think that they were very well done. there's a lot of action in this film, so i suspect that most kids would enjoy it... not just the ones that are really into barbie. my daughter actually picked it out because of the pegasus. she loves horses. but she enjoyed the movie very much. my daughter is autistic, and was able to sit through the whole movie and enjoy it. she really liked the action scenes and any parts with horses involved.one thing that i was thinking about was that many people object to barbie (and ken) because they are so beautiful. yet, i think that kids, just like adults like to look at beautiful people and things. it's natural. as adults, we enjoy watching beautiful movie stars too. it's wonderful though, that the barbie character and her "boyfriend" have a lot of personality. while it's fun to watch pretty people, it grows old if there is no substance behind the pretty face.overall, i'd say this is a great movie for kids and parents will enjoy it, too. :)

for once a barbie movie that is good. i'm 18 and a embarrassed to say this but i'm hooked on these movies. i hated barbie when i was younger but the movies i love. shiver is so cute and i've fallen in love with him. he's so cute as the polar bear and totally in love with aiden. oh man i'm in love with shiver. i love annika determination not to give up on hope and eventfully it works. i love this movie and hopefully they will be other good ones. barbie & swan lake is other brilliant movie. i would recommend this movie to children of all ages (even boys) because the movie is that good and i'm hard to please. barbie and the magic of pegasus is a movie that is enchanting and exciting.

i would have to say that in general barbie movies have impressed me. i have a 5 year old barbie fanatic niece and she watches them all the time so needless to say i have seen quite a lot of barbie these holidays, but i am not sick of them.this film, visually, has a lot to offer, especially the backgrounds, and the animation of the characters has improved with each new movie. one thing i noticed in particular was a vast improvement in the animation of barbie's hair in this film. it has a lovely range of excerpts from classical music and i think that this is great, as it exposes a new generation to the classics. this film is well worth ago, especially if you have young relievers. they will be entertained for hours!

my 5 year old daughter is very into the barbie series of movies. i've had mixed feelings about that - not wanting her to buy into the whole barbie-doll image of things, and recognizing that the movies are a marketing ploy to convince young girls to buy more dolls and make more money for mattel. this morning though she asked me to watch this movie with her, and - it being a lazy saturday morning and with not much else to do - i agreed. i don't know if the movies have been made to help market the dolls, which seem to be losing their appeal a bit from what i've heard or if the dolls are there to market the movies (or, more likely, a bit of both) but whichever is the case, i have to admit - somewhat to my surprise, this wasn't half bad.it's a fun and imaginative story full of magical places and people and memorable characters (both good and evil.) essentially, annika ("played" by barbie) has to find a way to build a "wand of light" to reverse the evil spells of the wizard wenlock, who among other things has turned her sister into a flying horse and her parents into stone. the animation here was pretty good - not disney-calibre (if one thinks of disney as the standard to aspire to) but generally pretty good, and while the movie is obviously tailored to young girls rather than middle-aged men, i still found there were enough twists and turns to make me wonder how it was all going to turn out. it's true that there were some holes in the story, or at least some logical inconsistencies, but again one must remember the target audience, who wouldn't really think of such things. this is an all around decent family movie. 7/10

normally i try to avoid barbie films, but this one was unmistakably awesome. kudos to the graphics and character voice overs. it all flowed well. this enchanting tale is a great spin off of others, but is well worth buying! i don't have kids, but the kids i babysit, (including boys) find it intriguing and love the extra features on the dvd. i honestly don't know why this is rated so low, but for kids, especially your barbie lovin' 8 year old will love this. its not straight forward and predictive like most movies are. this "childrens" film has excellent morals and shows teamwork. it has no swearing, bits of romance (if your old enough to figure it out) and beautifully written storyline. thats why i am giving it a ten out of ten!

after all these years, i am puzzled as to why julie brown (west coast) isn't a household name or a hugely famous comedic star. she is one of the funniest females on the planet. in this spoof, she takes on madonna who is one of her favorite targets. she is medusa, a hugely successful singer, like madonna who also happened to have documentary "truth or dare." julie brown spoofs madonna as medusa who came from wisconsin, the land of dairy and beer. i remember the segment where she went to wisconsin to visit her family and a grave. i don't remember if it was a parent or her pet. i remember somebody saying that medusa did nothing original. she was just copying others. i have to say that i hope this spoof documentary is available on dvd somewhere. julie brown was at her best mocking and spoofing others.

this parody is cleverly done: from the songs (express yourself becomes expose yourself, like a prayer is now party in my pants and vogue is now vague) to the fake interviews of the cast of the show, this movie is hilarious. remember madonna saying she didn't know about the rain season in asia? in this one, she doesn't know about the volcano season. it is a precious jewel. they got a lot of money on that spoof, and it pays off. highly recommended!!!

this is one of julie's greatest tributes to music, alongside her "trapped in the body of a white girl" album. to quote the great medusa "dare to go bare, just wear your underwear, you'll get a ride home everytime" - wow!!! now that is some good advice. "you can dance, at my party! yeah, justify your dance shoes!.....you're invited to the party in my pants. yeah come on boy let's dance, at the party in my pants" julie brown is hilarious!!! it is almost sad that this video is only 51 minutes long, but every minute is awesome!!!

"medusa: dare to be truthful" is an outrageously funny parody that is a fine companion to the original, "madonna: truth or dare". julie brown's brilliant creation skewers madonna's highly entertaining documentary (although it wasn't exactly daring, insightful, candid, or truthful) with a faithfulness to detail, right down to the packaging. i highly recommend this for madonna fans, julie brown fans, or anyone who enjoys sharp and clever parody.

julie brown hilariously demolishes madonna's attempt at a rockumentary with gut ripping humor and truly original and catchy songs that rival madonna's own. cinematography and sets are top notch.kathy griffin and chris elliott offer their own injections of comedy that enhances and compliments this film. appearances by bobcat goldthwait and wink martindale, as themselves, is an added bonus.it's hard to tell if brown's performance is meant to insult or playfully tease madonna, though i hardly think the material girl would find humor in it.my favorite line: "why don't you come here (to the phillipines); all they eat is dog and i'm a vegetarian."

this movie was a riot, it pokes fun of "madonna - truth or dare" in all the right places. i love madonna & i love julie brown. how could i ask for more..julie's spoof of "vogue", entitled "vague" was hysterical.. "kelly lebrock thinks she's great, she's just cold boogers on a paper plate". "brooke shields, dawber, pam personality of spam"!! i could've died! and just wait till you see what she can do with a watermelon!!

i really liked this movie. i watched it last night on the public broadcasting system. the part i liked about it was the fact that they dealt with issues of today not in the future or the past. they basically had some terrorists take a van or two and rent them out to be car bombs. i think what the movie could have showed was people in different countries at the same time. it did show the fact that england, or any other country, isn't prepared for an attack on the magnitude that they showed. i have never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie so i can't really say if they are normally their parts. after the movie, they had this panel of experts talking about if something like that could happen here in the u.s. it was a thought-provoking discussion!

before seeing this picture i was quite skeptic, i don't like movies with an agenda nor do i appreciate being scared into thinking like the writer. i was also afraid this would be like the 2-part mini-series "10.4" which had a far-fetched concept, little relation to the real world and very poor execution. at the beginning is says: "this film is fiction, but the events portrayed and the information about uk emergency planning are based on extensive research"; and the general feeling is that you're not being sold on an idea, but that you're being taught a lesson in civil awareness. the message that is being conveyed is obvious from the start: it is coming and we're not prepared. the use of real places and a scenario which not only could happen - there are plans for when it does - all add to the disturbing effect the movie will have, on even the most cynical of viewers. the movie's perspective is that of the society and it stays away from heart-breaking personal moments, which won't convey the message, so none of the romeo-juliet drama we're used to.

seeing this film brought back to me memories of 9/11. the first thing i remember of that morning was seeing tv pictures of an airplane flying into a large building, and my immediate thoughts "must be a preview for a new tom clancy film".this was not a tom clancy film. this was certainly not a british version of "the sum of all fears". the typical tom clancy film or novel has a relatively small cast, a linear plot, and usually some sort of resolution. this film had neither. sure, what i saw directly on screen was a small cast, a plot, and a vague resolution, but, like 9/11, the point was that reality was so much larger and more complex.i work in systems planning, and the reality of the disaster preparation exercise, and the disaster itself, is painfully obvious. it's impossible to prepare for a disaster like this, nor will it be any more possible to deal with this when it happens.from the argument between the police (not enough is being done to prepare) and the politicians (giving everybody on the tube a gasmask would cause panic), to the constant loudspeaker announcements (you are in no danger to your health, but don't go home before we decontaminate you), and (don't eat, drink, or smoke before we decontaminate you), i was on edge during the entire film. not the slightest urge to channel surf.this film was 90 minutes in length. it could have been twice that, and still not shown all the possible details. instead, it left enough unsaid to allow each of us to imagine the details, each of us in our own way. that made it so much more real to me, than any tom clancy film.i lived in london once, and just off the edgeware road. and i took the train from waterloo station many times. as i watched dirty war, i kept telling myself that this is only fiction. right now.allah and jehovah willing, this film will remain fiction, and sometime in 20 or 30 years, my nephews may watch this film and remember the early 21st century, and the panic we felt too much. hopefully to the same degree as i feel currently, when viewing memorabilia of the cold war with the evil communist regime of the mid-20th century, and remember "drop and cover" exercises in school.

dirty war is absolutely one of the best political, government, and well written t.v. drama's in the 25 years.the acting is superb, the writing is spectacular.diry war reveals the true side of why we are not ready to respond to a nuclear, biological, and radiological terrorist attack here on american soil.dirty war should be made into a major motion picture - it's that good! i highly recommend this great drama to everyone who desire to know the truth.this t.v. drama reveals how british intelligence (mi5 & mi6) attempt to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims -because of england's involvement in the iraq war.the scenes of different parts of london, england are also spectacular.dirty war is a must see!!!

the film is partly a thriller and partly a public-service announcement when seeing the events through the perspectives of politicians, terrorists and of course victims. in this smart drama lessons are given about contamination and surviving chaos while meantime the backstage look at the way crisis is managed prompts viewers to distrust guardians and to be scared by assailants. the film, originally aired on bbc, gets to arouse effectively doubts on official prepareparedness. performances are proper, understated though never terrific. the flick is just a beginning, a provocative start leading to a larger discussion but it gets to work in my opinion, giving the right thrills and causing the audience to reason and to ask itself questions.

this movie was really interesting... it also is quite shocking as the similar events of the movie occurred only 10 months after the movie premiered.it was interesting seeing the problems that could be encountered and realistic enough to show that no matter how prepared you think you are - you aren't. if this was made for an american audience - it would be different because they would have used this as a full propaganda film and not as a wake call which the bbc did! it still is propaganda, in some extend - no film today with these themes can not be - but it dealt with the issue successfully.a film that should be shown in all terrorism/counter-terrorism courses but will not because it shows faults which is not allowed to be acknowledged! a great film in which the bbc took a few risks and unfortunately, london does not need a fictional tale any more, due to the reality of july 7 2005.

i lived in london most of my adult life before i moved stateside so missed this film when it came out and only saw this now on hbo. i disagree with anyone who thinks this should have been a hollywood production, the uk team gave it a chilling and foreboding atmosphere from day one and i was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes wondering what was going to happen to my home city. and of course,nine months after the film comes out 7/7 happens. yes, the truth is stranger than fiction. having lived in both countries, it is also clear the likelihood of this happening in the uk is much greater than in the us, muslims live in ghettos and isolate themselves in the uk, in the us they assimilate much more readily.

the most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful lead actors. it isn't their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry either.to me, it is the mis-en-scene of the entire movie. the settings, the lighting, the props... all add to the mood for love between the main characters. a whiff of smoke from chow's cigarette tells us his state of mind, the ever-changing tight-fitting cheongsams of lizhen reflects the constraints of decision-making, the ruins of angkor wat ties in with the deteriorating relationship of the two leads.the excellent use of mis-en-scene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters' relationship. the film leaves the audience fruitlessly yearning for more.

two people living in the same flat complex find their partners are having an affair with each other. as they try and piece together how it happened, they also embark on an emotional journey that aches for a resolution¬Öbuilding on his previous success with happy together and chungking express, wong kar wai gives us this rather old fashioned and marvellous story of reawakened passions, yearning and unrequited love. possibly, in the mood for love is not to everyone's taste. it wanders in rather lazily at 98mins: not particularly long for a film, but it appears longer because not a lot really happens. but this lazy feel conceals a quite tightly constructed film. most of the story is cunningly woven around a series of set piece role plays, where the characters act out presumed scenarios between their respective spouses, trying to work out how the affair started. i say cunning because, of course, this makes it difficult for the audience (and the characters) to tell what is "in-role" and what is genuine. if all this sounds rather arty and self-conscience, that's because it is. unashamedly so. and it is played to perfection by two of hong kong's finest, maggie cheung and leung chui wai, with some excellent support from ping lam siu and rebecca pan.it is also a virtuoso performance by wong kar wai, who treats the audience to a sensory, and sensual, overload. bringing together christopher doyle (who later deployed his lush, over-ripe style on hero) and pin bing lee (whose beautifully understated style can be seen on springtime in a small town) was cinematographic genius. it has all the bold beauty of doyle, without, frankly, the athena-poster cheesiness of his work on hero. the music, as always with wong, is prominent. from nat king cole singing in spanish, to the haunting strings of the main theme, it perfectly matches the eclectic beauty of the images. all in all a top film, whether judged on plot, acting, cinematography or soundtrack. similar to, but more accessible than, wim wenders' wings of desire, this is a beautiful, old fashioned story about love lost and regained. and watch out for tony leung's hotel room 2046, which presaged wong's recent film of the same name.

i won't bore you with story and plot lines, as they have been presented many times already on this page, so¬Ö it's been along time coming since i have seen such a film. beautiful, elegant and restrained, with a narrative pace to match. a film with sensitivity and understated qualities that is rare in these times of clich√©d plots. the beautifully subdued photography, saturated in rich luxurious colors, and for lack of better words, each frame is filled with an air of tension. the settings and locations are used repeatedly but the film manages to breath new life into them each time they featured, there always seems to be a key prop, light fixture, or set piece to slightly clue the audience as to where we are in the characters world.the acting reminds me of the "the bicycle thief", not the style, but the fact that you forget that you are watching two actors engaged in their craft. there is meaning behind every gesture and almost every movement has assigned significance to explain the inside world of the characters, the relationship, the feelings, and situation of the two lovers. the dialogue is sparse but like the rest of the movie, is imbued with meaning. speaking of meaning, the soundtrack is infectious. used here it becomes a story telling device. and although the film is of chinese origins, even a song sung in spanish by nat king cole imparts the film with subtle meaning. the orchestrated soundtrack is repetitive, but the repetition is what makes it comfortable. it is used in conjunction with the story, and not just a means to put music to action, or to cue the audience to feel a certain way at a certain plot point.i would not recommend this film to anybody, i fear most people would be jaded by the calm flow of the story, but i would recommend it to someone who is looking for an alternative to the romantic schlock that fills the multiplexes on our side of the world. i must say that i was completely taken by this film, and continued to watch it night after night. the story takes time to present itself and bears repeated viewings as very few films in this genre are open to such a broad interpretation. a very beautiful movie.

when i fist watched the movie, i said to myself, "so a film can be made like this." wong kar wai's gorgeous poetic love story captured me throughout and even after the film. i must admit this is one of the best love movies, maybe the best of all, i have ever watched. the content and the form overlaps perfectly. as watching the secret love we see the characters in bounded frames that limits their movements as well as their feelings. beautiful camera angles and the lighting makes the feelings and the blues even touchable. i want to congratulate christopher doyle and pin bing lee for their fantastic cinematography which creates the mood for love. also the music defines the sadness of the love which plays along the beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in despairing moods. and of course the performances of the actors which makes the love so real. eventually, all the elements in the film combined in a perfect way under the direction of wkw and give the audience the feeling called love.

i was recommended this film as one of the best love stories ever told. and as i am huge fan of love, i bought the tickets and sat myself in the theatre. after 90 minutes i left the theatre with nothing but disappointment and the theme song as the only positive thing of the film. i was appalled at the story itself, that two people can love each other but be so afraid as to never act it. i just couldn't go passed the language barrier and the cultural barrier. the second time i ran into it... i was in a different mood, no longer had any expectation ... and had more patience, more relaxed mind to "see" the film... and as soon as i opened my eyes, i discovered the love... the beauty of the film. i went beyond the language and the love story and saw the acting (not even for a moment did i ever felt like they were acting!) and the cinematography. the first time i heard a definition of what a film is, i was told that it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photographs (shots) and this is the film to match the description. almost every shot has an idea behind it, and combined with the music... and the light effects... the result is just a masterpiece! and a masterpiece is just something that you must have in your collection of films.

in 60s hong kong, a man and woman move in the same day into adjacent apartments with their respective spouses. soon they suspect their ever absent spouses of having an affair with one-another. a strange bond emerges between the man and woman as they cope with their sadness by taking turns playing each other's spouse, before a more complex bond emerges...no summary can do it justice, for hong kong auteur wong kar-wai's "in the mood for love" is nothing short of a miracle. a story about sadness that manages to be touching and at times funny. a romance that never feels forced or fake. no doubt the director's method has a lot to do with that.directed from an inexistent screenplay (though the concept largely flows from a japanese short story) to favor improvisation, the film is immediately set apart by the freshness of it's performances. all the film revolves around that and the rest is pure enhancement. at the core of the film are two characters that will ease into your heart and stay there long after the end credits roll: maggie cheung and tony leung are simply amazing and no language barrier undermines a single fragment of immediacy and truth they display. the additional material is also top-notch: the films is magnificent to behold (in part lensed by "hero"'s christopher doyle) and the music is heartbreaking.this is something everybody must see, if only because it is by far the most heartfelt, mature and authentic "love story" out there. unmissable.

it's easy to see why many people consider in the mood for love to be wong kar-wai's best film. the toned down appeal of the film, centering on the studied view of a relationship put through an emotional ringer, is a retread into happy together territory but without the hyper-kinetic patchwork of jarring film stocks and hyper-saturated sequences that have become a trademark of kar-wai's films since chungking express. like soderbergh's the limey, this is a different kind of curio for kar-wai; where dialogue and plot are forsaken by mood and composition in order to create a tale of two delicate lives in a seemingly confining emotional stasis.it's a testament to the genius of kar-wai that he is capable to making such a simple tale so resonating. chow mo-wan (tony leung) and su li-zhen (maggie cheung) move in next-door to each other within the same apartment building. he's a journalist who dreams of publishing martial-arts novels and she is a secretary at a shipping company. their eventual coupling is obvious from the beginning but the pleasure here is the way that kar-wai ambiguously paints such a journey with his grand masterstrokes.the key to the success of the film is kar-wai's use of the interior space, playing with foreground and background planes in ways that are similar to the works of polanski. during the wooingly sensuous first half of the film, kar-wai isolates leung and cheung within shots in such a way that the second person in a conversation is never visible. kar-wai is concerned with environment and space here, creating a cramped emotional dynamic between his characters. it's also telling that kar-wai never chooses to focus on the physicality of mo-wan and li-zhen's spouses. their faceless partners are noticeably absent from the film, as they are tending to their own love affairs with each other.this is not to suggest that in the mood for love is a confining experience because kar-wai manages to inundate his film with broad splashes of hypnotic camera movement and sound. there is one shot where cheung's slow, sensual rise up a metaphorical stairway turns into leung's descent down the very same stairwell; their movements perfectly compliment each other, bookending the shot and creating a sense of erotic duality between the two figures. their souls have connected but they have yet to physically unite. the erotic displacement of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating, as two star-crossed lovers reject physical consummation due to their humble fidelity.other scenes in the film are punctuated with brief slow-motion shots of cheung erotically moving through her interior surroundings, set to mike galasso's hauntingly beautiful score. cheung's dresses beautifully compliment her exterior space as she moves slowly through her surroundings. her movements slowly build up to what seems to be an inevitable fusion between li-szhen and her dream lover even though the seduction process seems to be entirely sub-conscious.if i make it seem that these two characters are more like two birds unleashing pheromones on each other, it probably isn't that far-fetched of a statement. the tight bond these two characters have with their internal spaces is almost as intense as their relationship to the exteriors. the film rarely moves into an exterior space and when the camera does it is usually to peak through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like confined animals. kar-wai continues to tease us even when the lovers get close enough to touch, shattering the couple's proximity to each other by shooting them through mirrors or through gaps within articles of clothing located inside of a closet. mother nature even seems to respond to their love lust, often unleashing a soft crest of rain over the characters after their bodies have glided near each other.kar-wai's hauntingly atmospheric shots of a waterfall allowed leung's lai yu-fai to experience a cathartic release in happy together, even if leslie cheung's ho po-wing was not there to enjoy it with him. by that film's end, love was so inextricably bound to the act of war that a third man's muted declarations of love signaled yu-fai's realization that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace, even if it would not bring him back his lover. mo-wan's journey terminates within the confines of a crumbling temple. his own emotional depletion is paralleled nicely with the political climate of his country, and the absence of li-szhen is only made tolerable by the fact that kar-wai allows mo-wan to experience a release of sorts. mo-wan caters to an ancient myth and his secretive release into a crack in the temple leaves him capable of living his days with the hope that all his loss and heartache somehow served a higher purpose.

i think that new york times film critic elvis mitchell wrote the best one line review of in the mood for love when he said that it is "dizzy with a romantic spirit that's been missing from the cinema forever." how true those words are! truly romantic films are so rare these days, while films that include plenty of sex and nudity (which are often portrayed in a smutty and gratuitous manner) abound. so, given this cinematic climate, wong kar-wai's latest film feels like a much needed breath of fresh air. in the mood for love is about the doomed romance between two neighbors ("mr. chow," played by tony leung and "mrs. chan," played by maggie cheung), whose spouses are having an illicit affair, as they try "not to be like them." but after hanging out with each other on lonely nights (while their spouses are away "on business"/"taking care of a sick mother"), they fall madly in love, and must resist the temptation of going too far.several factors are responsible for making in the mood for love a new classic among "romantic melodramas," in the best sense of that term. first, the specific period of the film (i.e. 1960's hong kong) is faithfully recreated to an astonishing degree of detail. the clothes (including maggie cheung's lovely dresses), the music (e.g. nat king cole), and the overall atmosphere of this film evokes a nostalgia for that specific period. second, christopher doyle's award-winning, breathtakingly beautiful cinematography creates an environment which not only envelopes its two main characters, but seems to ooze with romantic longing in every one of its sumptuous, meticulously composed frame. make no mistake about it: in the mood for love was the most gorgeous film of 2001. (it should also be mentioned that wong kar-wai's usual hyper-kinetic visual style is (understandably) toned down for this film, although his pallet remain just as colorful.) third, there is the haunting score by michael galasso, which is accompanied by slow motion sequences of, e.g. chan walking in her elegant dresses, chan and chow "glancing" at each other as they pass one another on the stairs, and other beautiful scenes which etch themselves into one's memory. the main score--which makes its instruments sound as though they're literally crying--is heard eight times throughout various points in the film and it serves to highlight the sadness and the longing which the two main characters feel. fourth, tony leung and maggie cheung both deliver wonderful performances (leung won the prize for best actor at cannes) and they manage to generate real chemistry on screen.the above elements coalesce and work so nicely together to create a film that feels timeless, "dizzyingly romantic," and, in a word, magical. in the mood for love, perhaps more than any other film of 2001, reminded me why it is that i love "going to the movies." and i guess that is about the highest compliment that i can pay to a film.

i'm from ireland and i thought this film had the odd minute or two where accents where a little off but no worse than any brad pitt or other american doing the accent. furthermore, i have rarely seen any british actor handle an american or canadian accent except for colin farrel in minority report. this film is a little film and it was entertaining. no it wasn't a blockbuster hollywood production but frankly i'm sick of that shite. i laughed more than a few times and had a good time. it was definitely worth the rental. the main character is a spoof on other hard british gangsters. at least that's the way i saw it. if you go in expecting a $100 million dollar production you'll be disappointed. enjoy it for what it is- a small entertaining film.

superb and charming. justin henry is beautiful as a blissed out and mischievous howard kaylan, lead singer for the top ten hit making band, the turtles. the real magic is the titular sequence with an academy award worthy turn by royale watkins. a performance that completely captures the mystical and yet down to earth jimi hendrix. not many films, unbelievably so, can find the essence of a special moment in a life and times. i'd like to see this available at any home video retail outlet without any hassle. uh..what's the deal?thanks eddie. a worthy addition to the history of the psychedelic sixties. a definite twinkle in the mind's eye.

my dinner with jimi is a glimpse at howard kaylan's giddy and vertiginous ride to fame with his 60's folk-rock band, the turtles. the turtles were kind of a 'second tier' act during the sixties, but the film clearly demonstrates that they could eat, drink, and party with the titans of hippie culture. and, not only that, they had the musical chops to back it up. many of the stellar acts of the era are seen as they interact with the band at work and at play. this provides my only complaint about the film. almost from the beginning of the movie, one sees that it is nearly impossible to find actors who can convincingly impersonate such recognizable stars. too often during the film, i felt that i was watching an engaging exhibition of phony wigs and mustaches. but, if you are a fan of the music of the turtles, or the swinging 60's, in general-this might be the film for you. and, don't forget to view the extras. there is a very funny (and informative) bit by band members, mark volman and howard kaylan, about their disastrous experiences with managers and agents.

i smiled through the whole film. the music is great. the story-telling is great. it's a wonderful film. this picture is made with respect and a true love of the sixties.

i have been trying to track the age of kings down for many, many years.my theater life was filled with the actors in this series. at the time, in 1960 i was not able to follow all of it, as i was myself working in the theater, lots of night work. now in retirement i long to have this and keep it to myself. please, please can it not be issued on dvd, i would not mind what it cost. i see that there are others out there who feel the same. what can we do to get this done? something as great as this should not be sent into oblivion. i have to write two more lines. ok i can do that by saying that i want this series more than anything in the world. just to be able to watch some of the finest actor of our age playing out the finest words of our wonderful shakespeare. isn't that enough! a uzmen

anyone who enjoyed this series when first broadcast (i rushed home from school to see it) now is of a certain age so i can only add my comments to those asking for a dvd release to enable those of us to relive the memories of first transmission before it simply becomes a piece of unremembered tv archive history. if so many old tv series from the sixties and seventies can be released, why not this? surely the rights clearances can't be that difficult. most of the shakespeare lines i can quote comes from this iconic series and i remember swapping them with my school chums as we tried to outdo each other's memories of the text. peter dews rightly deserved the credit for having the foresight to bring it to the screen. this surely was public broadcasting at its finest. robert hardy and sean connery fighting to the death - it's riveting stuff and from the beginning of the bbc television's golden age. come on bbc. clear it and license it please. march 2009 so finally the dvd is here and congratulations to those who have made it happen. the picture quality is remarkably good and the performances every bit as good as the memory thought. now all those who clamoured for it must buy it and relive those magic moments.uk viewers. given the series was made in the uk by the bbc using british actors it's strange that the dvd release is not available there on region 2 (europe) dvd and can only be imported from the us and played on modified players. it seems hardly likely that there are major rights issues, perhaps the market was felt to be too small so why on earth wasn't it released 'region free?' so everyone could enjoy it?

my introduction to a lifelong love of shakespeare. my brother was 5 and i was not quite 7 when wttw chicago broadcast an age of kings. it became a family ritual to watch, including the reruns. as an autumn series, my father used to buy us a rare treat for the midwest--pomegranates; and my mother would pop corn on the stove. wonderful acting from actors whose names meant nothing to me then (although i will never forget the achingly young sean connery as hotspur), but do now! and they published the scripts in paperback so we could follow along and figure out the language. i managed to memorize most of richard iii over that. so glad to see it coming out on dvd! highly recommended for all ages and any level of familiarity with shakespeare or english history.

in 1961, this series was shown on local tv here in southern california. i and many others have been petering bbc for tape or dvd ever since. now all of a sudden, here it is on amazon. i pre-ordered in january and now here on march 30 it arrived. it was a long wait (48 years). was it worth it? so far i have just watched richard ii (i've only had the dvd since 2 o'clock) and i can truly say yea!!! totally worth the wait. the acting, direction, and production are superb and even better than i remember. the production is in b & w but somehow it fits. the video is clear and very good, the sound is flawless. further proof of how timeless shakespeare truly is.i gave this 10 stars even though i have only seen 1 of the 8 plays. i am sure that when i have seen them all i will change my rating to at least a 12.it's currently in stock at amazon (us region 1) at a reasonable price.i'd better stop now so i can get back to watching. next up is henry the iv, part 1 of which is my all time favorite shakespeare play.

a great production, that should be revived/rebroadcast. i doubt that it would be out of date! i'd love to hear from anyone who knows whether videos exist of this series, or any other information about where it could be found or viewed.

i followed this entire series when i was a child in grade school, by choice, not because it was required for school. i used to read the plays at the pace of the series. the experience gave me a life-long love for shakespeare and history. it even gave me a bit of an acting bug, although at an amateur level only. whenever i read any of shakespeare's history plays, the images that come to mind first are from this black and white production, seen on a big "furniture" tv set with a rabbit ear antenna, with all the "ghosts" and wobbles that go with that.although the sets were minimal, if i remember correctly, that was totally irrelevant because the acting was so good. at the time i had no idea who any of the actors were. now i see that many of them have become well known over the years. i particularly enjoyed hotspur and hal, whom i now see were played by sean connery and robert hardy. i would dearly love to see this available in video, especially since many of the plays are seldom performed and even fewer are available on video. it would be valuable also as a document of mid-20th century televised play production.

it was so very long ago (1960), but i have never forgotten this series and often wished it would reappear. so taken with it, i corresponded with mr. rathbun, then president of standard oil, which sponsored the presentation on pbs. he sent me a photo of the tapestry (actually a charcoal rendering) used behind the credits.to the opening theme music of bayco's "elizabethan masque," my family and i gathered around our black & white tv to drink in shakespeare's words as spoken by a group of excellent but relatively unknown players (at least to american audiences at the time).we were introduced to such actors as sean connery, dame judi dench, tom fleming, patrick garland, julian glover and robert hardy. i have continued to enjoy their accomplishments ever since. one of the most interesting things was the way in which the actors continued to age in their respective roles as shakespeare's "king" plays were presented, perhaps for the first time, in chronological order.i wish i could tell those actors just how much that series meant to me.if "age of kings" could be revived on vhs and/or dvd, it would so please those of us who long to see it again and those who missed it the first time around.good news! pbs has just issued a dvd of "an age of kings"! see their july 2009 catalog, page 19, or call them toll free. i just ordered mine!

watched this on kqed, with frank baxter commenting, as i recall. have never seen it since, but would like to find out where it is available.it is amazing how good something can be, but be in black and white, and have zero special effects. in fact, amazing how much better something like that is!

this series has recently been unearthed and excerpts can be seen, at least within britain, via http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html presumably there is some hope that the series may eventually become available more widely. the problem is that this series was followed by the series the wars of the roses that had a similarly stellar cast and which has been available to cable tv, or at least crowding the market. the two series are quite different in dramaturgy; the wars consolidates the plays through extensive rewriting and shifting of scenes; an age of kings follows shakespeare more closely. both series benefit from integral casting.

i saw this mini-series when i was in high school. i remember it as being absolutely brilliant and compelling. at the time, i knew none of the british actors in the series, but have since learned that some of today's stars performed in it, including sean connery (the original james bond among many other roles), judi dench (queen elizabeth in "shakespeare in love" among many other roles) and eilene atkins (probably best known for creating "upstairs/downstairs" but also superb in many acting roles). like the other commentator, i would like to see it again. i'm certain the production remains timeless, and i would hope that it has been or will be released on vhs or dvd. if you get a chance to see it, do not miss it.

all right - it was in black and white and probably on 2" tape - which means the bbc wiped it, right? but it stays in my mind from all those years ago (1960??) as a perfect slice of history enlivened by the most innovative editing and wonderful actors full of youth and bravado.i want to see it again! are you reading this, bbc? find your original 2" tapes or the 35mm film, deal with the actors and directors for the rights, and re-issue! i know, i know, some of them are dead, some of them are missing in action.where else will i be able to see mary morris as the 'serpent's heart wrapped in a tiger's hide'? where else will i be able to see paul daneman do 'now is the winter of discontent....'? or robert hardy deliver his speech about 'that idol ceremony'?

i believe it has been over 40 years since i saw this series, yet memory of it hasn't faded a bit. this would be a natural for dvd re-issue, it seems to me. many of the performers have gone on to greater fame (robert hardy, sean connery, to name a couple); though it was a smallish role, i still remember judy dench, then in her 20's, as katherine of france (henry v). she was very lovely then as now.there is a hint on this site that the series was filmed in color - is this so? who of us would know - virtually no color tv in those days. mores the pity, no vcr's; if so, some might have recorded it. as a way of teaching english history, this series made it come alive in ways few class room teachers can manage.what a fine re-issue this would be!

possibly the finest moment of tv, at least in my memory, as millions could watch shakespeare's gripping kings cycle (richard ii - richard iii) play out on prime time tv (i believe it was on friday nights). no word was left out, and the plays awoke in me (who was then in elementary school) a thirst for history and a hunger for shakespeare and drama.let's see these reissued on dvd. what a set this would be!

boogie nights follows a theme that is extremely familiar to gangster films (although it doesn't fit into that genre itself) - the rise and the fall. we see the rise of several individuals, some of them from complete obscurity, to achieving great heights ... and then falling from grace due to their excesses.i believe that this is the first feature by writer/director paul thomas anderson, and it's a great start! i saw elements of other directors' influences, such as robert altman, but the film holds its own in originality and plot development.character development is the movie's finest feature. i really identified with all of the characters and felt their pain and their success with them. all of the performances were brilliant. (it was especially good to see a small part performed by real-life porn veteran, nina hartley).basically this film combines comedy and tragedy with the result being one of the best films of 1997, which was snubbed at the oscars (probably due to the "racy" - as they would say - subject matter, and the general conservatism of the academy.

this film is a masterpiece. it was exhilarating from beginning to end. writer-director paul thomas anderson's story about a porn star is told with style, grace, humor, even poignancy. the actors and the characters they play are all first-rate, including mark wahlberg in the lead, who proves himself a solid actor and can carry a film. burt reynolds gives perhaps his best performance ever as a porno director who discovers wahlberg. the film recreates the late 70s and early 80s with dead-on accuracy, from the disco scene that begins the film to wahlberg's don johnson "miami vice" outfit that he wears in the final scene. most regular moviegoers who see this film will no doubt compare it to pulp fiction, but it really has much more in common with the films of robert altman and martin scorsese. the film is a triumph in style. the opening tracking shot that begins the film is just as impressive as the ones in the player and absolute beginners. the editing by dylan tichenor is simply phenomenal. i couldn't believe the editing didn't receive an oscar nomination (good will hunting was a better edited film?!). the best scene in the film has to be the one with the firecrackers. i had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense. when i saw the film a second time, i had the exact same reaction to the scene. unfortunately, it may not have the same impact on tv as it did in a theater with good stereo sound. it's a shame that many people didn't see this movie during its theatrical run, because it is the best way to watch it. anderson's use of widescreen will suffer on tv (so get the dvd or a letterbox tape). it is amazing how easy anderson makes it all look, because this is only his second film. the music, sets, costumes, photography, offbeat characters, sex, violence, happiness and heartbreak are captured by a guy who is clearly in love with filmmaking.

this was the best film of 1998 and one of the best of the 90's. yes, it is a rip off of goodfellas. but as the saying goes, good poets borrow, great poets steal. and pta has stolen brilliantly from some of the best, plus added some genius touches of his own. i gave this a ten (which is very rare for me).the main reason i am commenting on this though (cause i could just rave all night) is all those people who have seen it on vhs standard issue...what are you thinking? this deserves the full screen experience. look at the ratio it was shot in! i saw it 5 times at the cinema and haven't bothered to watch it on video.nuff said!

this movie has it all. great actors, good dialog, drama, comedy, and excellent writing and directing by paul thomas anderson. i have seen this film several times and enjoy it more each time. it doesn't get old, it is consistently entertaining and stimulating. easily burt reynolds best role, and he does a great job. john c. reilly and don cheadle also give excellent comedic performances. there is not a weak element in this film.

an interesting companion piece to true documentaries of john c. holmes. unfortunately, it doesn't deal with what ultimately killed holmes, and it certainly could have benefited from doing so. burt reynolds and mark wahlberg got the most praise for this, but i felt the true stars were julianne moore as the cocaine-sniffing mother wannabe, don cheadle as a black man struggling with identity as pornstar/stereo-salesman in some wild getups and william h. macy, who's wife is the ultimate slut. not to mention a nearly unrecognizable alfred molina. macy's new year's eve bash and cheadle's chance for a better life after a donut shop robbery gone wildly wrong are probably the two best scenes in the movie, or at least the two best shot. what this movie does best is show how power can easily corrupt in its various forms. however, none of the characters apparently learn anything from their dark downward spiral as they all rebound and return to their normal lives.

as far as i know this was my first experience with icelandic movies. it's such a relief to see something else than your regular hollywood motion picture. too bad that movies like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world. i can only hope that people watch this by accident, by recommendation or other...because it's really worth while. i left the cinema feeling really sad. i couldn't get the tragic destiny's of the characters out of my head. and it impressed me even more when i thought of the complexity of the film. not only was it a tragic story, it had excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack.if you have the opportunity, watch it! it's really thought provoking and made me ponder a lot.

this is an important historical film since it was the the first all-talking feature film. the film was made for a mere 23,000 dollars.it grossed over a million dollars upon its release. this film all so helped define the gangster melodramas that were to become the bread and butter of the warner's studio in the 1930's. the popularity of this film ended the silent era more so than its more famous part-talkie predecessor, the jazz singer. the film deserves its place in history and not as a mere footnote. the only actor who might be remember today that is in it was eugene palette.

"lights of new york" originally started out as an experimental two reel vitaphone short that eventually snowballed into the first all talkie feature film. helene costelle was supposedly one of the most beautiful actresses in hollywood and sister to (in my opinion the real beauty) dolores costello, who seemed to get all the breaks. poor helene is best known for appearing in this pretty dreary film that bought a revolution to hollywood!!two bootleggers on the lam in "main street" convince a couple of small town barbers to try their luck on broadway. the barbers eddie (cullen landis) and gene (eugene palette) don't realise that their barber shop is soon a cover for illegal bootlegging activities. they soon do realise it and regret the day they left their small town. the only thing keeping them going is the loan that eddie's mother gave them and that they desperately want to pay back. eddie becomes re-acquainted with kitty lewis (helene costello) a girl from his home town who has made good on broadway. kitty is worried about "hawk" miller (wheeler oakman) who is always hanging around her but eddie, innocently, thinks she is exaggerating as "hawk" already has a girlfriend molly (gladys brockwell) but to reassure her he gives her a little handgun to frighten unwanted admirers away. "hawk", who has killed a police officer and has the "feds" closing in, decides to frame eddie. meanwhile molly is getting pretty fed up with "hawks" treatment of her and after a showdown where he tells her he is after a chicken and not an old hen the stage is set for - murder!!!the fact is it isn't completely awful, apart from gangsters and showgirls alike speaking in their best elocution voices and that was still happening in films in 1930. gladys brockwell (if a trifle melodramatic) and eugene palette (quite natural) were okay and were the most seasoned actors in the cast. there was no john or ethel barrymore to be seen - cullen landis and helene costello soon returned to the obscurity from which they had come. i also didn't notice much of the "hidden mike" - where people had to be grouped around different objects ie a telephone or sitting on a couch before they could engage in conversation. people who saw it at the cinema probably started to think that all policeman talked in that flat monotone as that trend continued in many early talkies ie "little caesar" (1930). in any case they were probably intrigued by the novelty of a completely all talkie - with some singing and dancing - film in 1928.recommended.

lights of new york was the first all-talking feature film. there had been, of course, the jazz singer, released in oct. 1927 as the first feature film incorporating synchronized dialog. however, this film released in july 1928 is virtually unremembered for its place in film history. it had started out as a short, but gradually more was tacked on until - clocking in at 58 minutes - it accidentally became the first all-talking feature film. it opened to a grind house run and to warner bros. surprise, made over a million dollars. that was good money back in 1928.the plot is quite simple. two country barbers naively buy into a barber shop on broadway that fronts as a speak-easy for "the hawk", a gangster. when they learn the truth they can't afford to get out, because the younger barber, eddie, has all of his mother's money tied up in the place. kitty is the younger barber's girlfriend, and gangster hawk (wheeler oakman) has an eye for turning in his older girlfriend (gladys brockwell) for a newer model - chorus girl kitty(helene costello). a cop is killed while trying to stop the hawk's men from unloading a shipment of bootleg liquor, and the hawk sees it as an opportunity to frame eddie, thus getting kitty for himself.this early talkie is loads of fun for the enthusiast of these pioneering works. sure, the plot is elementary and the dialog stilted, but there is something you don't see much of in early talkies - background musical scoring. vitaphone had originally been used for this very purpose, and here they are still using it for musical accompaniment along with the dialog. and there are singing and dancing numbers! the scenes in hawk's nightclub are used as an opportunity to show off what films could never do before - musical numbers. there is even a wild-eyed emcee with some heavy makeup left over from the silent era that is a hoot to watch.vitaphone could not go outdoors at this point due to the static camera booths, so the scene in the park between the two lovers eddie and kitty is simulated - and cheaply. the greenery looks like something out of an ed wood movie or perhaps a high school production of "our town". gladys brockwell, as the hawk's castoff girlfriend, delivers her lines with punch. she's a real trooper considering what lines she has to deliver. to the hawk - "so you think you can have any chicken you want and throw me back in the deck!". huh? mixed metaphors anyone? and then there are her final lines "i've lived, and i've loved, and i've lost!" did someone get paid to write this dialog? brockwell was making a good success of her talkie career after scoring some triumphs in silent films (the evil sister in "seventh heaven"), when a fatal car accident cut her career short.then there is eugene palette - the older of the two barbers in our story. his frog voice, natural delivery of lines, and cuddly appearance gave him a long career as a character actor usually appearing as a put-upon family man/businessman with a gruff exterior and heart of gold. in fact, mr. palette is the only member of this cast who still has a notable career in films just three years after this movie is released.finally there is the question of "where is that microphone hidden?" microphones were still stationary at this point, and it's fun to figure out where they've hidden it. there is one famous scene, though, where everybody can pretty much figure it out. hawk is in his office talking to his two henchman - who seem to comprehend as slowly as they talk - about "taking eddie for a ride". if you watch this scene you'd swear the phone on the desk is a character in this film. it's front and center during the whole conversation. the microphone is likely planted in the phone.there is something heroic about these pioneers flying blind in the face of the new technology of sound. you have silent actors who are accustomed to using pantomime for expression, vaudevillians who know how to play to a live audience but don't know how to make the same impression on a vitaphone camera booth, and you have dialog writers either trying to write conversation as compactly as they did title cards or filling up films with endless chatter. check this one out. it is not boring, moves fast, and is loads of fun if you know what to look for. and no, i don't expect this one to ever be out on blu-ray, but i hope that the folks at warner brothers add it to the warner archive soon so everyone can see it.

lights of new york was the first "all-taking" feature film, coming in at a brisk 57 minutes and directed by bryan foy (of the famous vaudeville family).the story has two dopey barbers (cullen landis, eugene palette) yearning for a chance at "big city life" and getting involved with gangsters and bootleg booze. one of the guys gets framed for the murder of a cop but is saved at the last minute by a gun moll (gladys brockwell).much of the story takes place in a night club called the night hawk, which is run by a crook named hawk (wheeler oakman) who has his eye on a pretty chorine (helene costello) who is the girl friend of landis. costello gets to do a brief dance, and we hear harry downing (made up to resemble ted lewis) sing "at dawning) in his best al jolson style.the acting ranges from good (palette and brockwell) to awful (oakman). a couple of the actors muff their lines but then keep right on with the scene. as noted elsewhere this was intended to be a short 2-reeler and was made on a shoestring budget. yet the sound quality is surprisingly good, the voices all register clearly, and there is a neat cinematic touch in the silhouette death.the film was a box-office smash even though it was shown as a silent film where theaters were not wired for the new sound technology. no one expected this little film to gross an amazing $1.3 million. it briefly made stars of costello and landis and certainly launched palette on his long career as a star character actor.co-stars include mary carr as the mother, robert elliott as the detective, eddie kane as the street cop, and tom dugan as a thug.

before seeing this film, i suggest the viewer puts away any expectations that the victims of the crimes depicted will get equal treatment and consideration as the perpetrator. there have been many films about crime victims. this one is about the murderer."dead man walking" finds realism in simplicity of the story: there are no crack lawyers coming to save william poncelet and no dramatic story twists. the film does not attempt to put him in a good light; he is guilty, he is repugnant, is a racist, and was responsible for heinous murders. given all this, we are asked to do something very difficult: look at him as a human being despite his crimes. in this way, the film challenges the notion that the death penalty provides "justice". whether you are for or against the death penalty, the film raises questions about whether the guilty can find redemption, inequity in the justice system, and the appropriateness of the death penalty.great performances by both susan sarandon and sean penn. in particular the last moments of the film show the true depth of penn's ability.

just to clarify, matthew poncelet wasn't a real person, but a character combination of 2 killers who were both convicted and sentenced to die for a murder of two teenagers.i read the user comments and they react as if matthew was real. the character is based on a mixture of two killers, elmo patrick sonnier and robert lee willie (who murdered separate people) and the murder itself was based on the one willie committed. the conflict of both willie having someone else present and both parties swearing the other did the killing is worked into the story as well.prejean's approach is unique in that she not only is ministering to the convicts as they wait for their death and aiding them in taking responsibility for their actions, she also reaches out to the victims' families, to help them know that the convict did, indeed feel remorse for what they did-effectively aiding both parties.everyone posting here seems to have strong beliefs on the death sentence. it's not my place to say it's right or wrong-in theory punishing death with death makes some sort of karmic sense, however denying a person their freedom for the rest of their days, although costly, makes more sense to me-being stuck in a small room 23/7 (with one hour of exercise)for the rest of their days to be reminded of the cruel thing they did seem a more apt punishment-they are technically alive, but denied living. say someone killed someone so they could get out of the responsibility the person they killed required (like susan smith killing her poor kids by shoving her car into a lake). i find it fittingly ironic that they would not get that "freedom" they craved and would now have to spend the rest of their days imprisoned.prejean's point comes through the story very well. she has my respect-she manages to find that balance-she isn't supporting a killer, she is guiding them to accepting what they did. if they didn't feel some kind of remorse, they wouldn't be asking for spiritual guidance.ona final note, when poncelet apologizes to delacroix parent for killing his son, the parents of the girl who was also murdered mutters something about why he didn't apologize for her death. i think the point was that throughout the movie, poncelet denies killing both kids. there is doubt in prejean's mind he did both killings-there is a friend who was sentenced but not to death-my thought is that poncelet killed the delacroix boy and the other man murdered the girl-hence poncelet was taking responsibility for what he did. had he been responsible for the girl's death, he probably would have apologized for that as well.

dead man walking, absolutely brilliant, in tears by the end! you can not watch this film and not think about the issues it raises; how can you justify killing (whether it be murder or the death penalty) and to what point is forgiveness possible (not just in a spiritual way). don't watch this film when your down! but watch it!!!

having read most of the comments i feel like i have a word to say as well.what bothers me most is that most people here are think that this movie is either pro or con to the subject of death penalty and whether it worked with them. i remember having read an article back in 1995 when the film was published (yes, it has interested me so much ever since i heard that it would come out that i have not forgotten about the articles i read back then) in which tim robbins said that he did not want to make a movie to convince audiences of neither one nor the other.and i think that is completely right. i have to admit that i believe that in the way he made this film he did tend a little bit to the anti-death-penalty-side, but nevertheless people are still allowed to make their own choice. and this is a very rare thing in american films.i have shown this movie to many people since it came out and i have seen all kinds of reactions. death-penalty-supporters became opponents or became even stronger in their belief. and many death-penalty-opponents (including me) grew stronger in their belief that death penalty should be abolished everywhere in the world. but i have even seen opponents turn into supporters. this and the fact that people here seem to fight about it shows to me that there are really many ways of looking at it. so whatever effect it has on you, the important thing is that it makes you think.this is one of the few movies that really gives you the choice, that does not shy away with a simple path by making the convicted either bad or innocent. this may be a tough thing for people who prefer being entertained or tought a lesson. there is no lesson here you need to find one yourself.everyone praises the acting, directing and the music but since this has been said so many times the i will not repeat it all again.so if you have not seen this yet, do so - if you dare to be challenged!

one of the best 'guy' movies i've ever seen has to be the wind and the lion. gad, the scenes...raisouli's bandits swarm over the wall... a staid british gentleman calmly gets up from tea with candice bergen and drops three of them with a webley revolver in his coat. a whisper from the ghost of empire... lest we forget! lest we forget!u.s. marines coming ashore from the long, long gone _brooklyn_. they were carrying krags, it should have been lees, but, oh wow. and the winchester 97 blowing large holes in obstreperous natives and even more obstreperous and faithless europeans... raisouli --sean connery, o, wow!--wondering 'what kind of gun does roosevelt use?"teddy roosevelt--brian keith, o, wow!--wondering "what kind of gun does raisouli use?' and writing yet another angry letter to winchester about the stock on his winchester 95.raisouli, armed with but a sword... a prussian cavalry officer, holstering his pistol and drawing his sword... honor. that's something long dead, from a world long gone, but raisouli would never have flown a plane full of children into a building...milious at milious's magnificent best, and now out on dvd.

sean connery is very good as the great raisuli, lord of the rif and defender of the faithful. this is an adventure movie with arabs, germans and the usmc all coming to grips at one point or another. there is also a lot of humor in the interplay among the main and supporting characters. the story is based on the true incident in which a wealthy greek-american businessman was kidnapped by the raisuli in the early 1900s. milius has substituted candace bergen and her two children as the victims of the kidnapping, and this opens the story to a lot of literary license.on the other hand, the movie gives milius the opportunity to remind the viewer of two of the most famous (though mostly forgotten) political quotations of the tr era. brian keith (very good as tr) says, "pedecaris alive or the raisuli dead!"; and john huston (also good as sec of state john hay)asks the japanese ambassador at a white house dinner, "you likee knifee, you likee forkee?"

we usually think of the british as the experts at rendering great adventure from the imperial age, with the likes of the four feathers (1939) and zulu, simply because the imperial age was, for the most part, british. here, in the wind and the lion, we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age.america's projection of power under teddy roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who, despite her gentility, is smitten by the rough, manly nobility of her captor, who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn. (politically correct prigs eager to see some slight of "native" peoples or cultures can rest assured, that the way arabs and muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage.) what makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy - and vivid history.though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be sean connery's noble brigand, candace bergen's feisty heroine, john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, roosevelt's "big stick". there is a transcendent scene at the end, when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing moor on his white steed. this is high adventure at its best.

a movie i've seen and enjoyed possibly more than any other movie. i first saw it as a kid and loved the drama and the great climactic battle. as i got older, i enjoyed it as much or more than before, but now due to all of the components that work together to make a true classic. the acting is great (especially keith as t. roosevelt), the cinematography spectacular, the script is full of gems, and the directing pulls it all together wonderfully. it's loosely based on an actual event, and it shows rush of europe and a newly emergent america to carve up the 'sick old man' (the ottoman empire) as it collapses in a fashion unlike any other 'historical' movie i've seen. humor, drama, action, love...it's got it all and deserves far more acclaim (much like 'the great waldo pepper').

there was nothing else on tv yesterday afternoon, so i thought "okay, let's watch this." i didn't know the plot and i had no expectation whatsoever, i was thinking in a few minutes or so i will channel surf again. but then story started to unfold, and the characters played beautifully by the two boys. the story did have unrealistic parts and scenes, but overall it was a real good movie. very well worth watching.

junior high and high school teachers will find "the cure" an excellent teaching tool, both as a companion to "huckleberry finn" or as a stand-alone lesson. although aids is supposed to be the main theme, the strong sup-text of friendship and love, as they evolve between eric and dexter, is a powerful message for teenagers. writing prompts centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective. i also suggest directed class discussion about how eric evolves from manipulative user to loving friend.

*** contains spoilers ***a lovely film this, starring brad renfro and the ever wonderful joseph mazzello. i like joseph mazzello, out of all his films i've seen to date i've loved every single one of them for many different reasons and the cure is no different. brad renfro does very well in this movie as well. the cure is a drama/coming of age movie from the viewpoint of an ill child and his friend.the basic idea is: dexter (joseph mazzello) has aids. he ends up befriending the kid next door (brad renfro) but erik's mum is very narrow-minded, ill-informed and somewhat "thick" when it comes to dexter's illness. she thinks aids is contagious like the common cold so doesn't want her son going anywhere near dexter.after many attempts at making their own cure with no success, the boys go on their way to new orleans to find the cure after reading a pamphlet about it. after getting their kicks from playboy magazine, dexter's health goes south shortly afterwards and as his health detoriates, there's still enough life in the boy alongside erik for two pranks of pretending to stop breathing. unfortunately, poor dexter does indeed die from his illness, leaving poor erik behind to wonder why he couldn't find the cure. throughout the movie he ends up bonding more with dexter's mother than his own.it is a very heartwarming movie to watch and is not absolutely perfect (movies rarely are) but you won't care less about that as you get involved in the film more. a must for joseph mazzello fans, one of his best performances ever. very well recommended must-see movie - if you can find a copy :)

for all the viewers who have seen 'the cure' would agree with me on this comment that it is a superb movie and is very heartwarming. joseph mazzello and brad renfro prove their star quality in this movie, along with dexter's (mazzello) mother annabella sciorra.when i first watched the cure on tv, i didn't know what to expect, but as i watched this masterpiece it soon became clear what it was about. dexter an 11 year old boy who is plagued with aids, sits around his backyard playing with his toys when one day he meets his next door neighbour eric, which at first is a little awkward for the 2 boys, but they soon became good friends.during the film, i kept wondering what would happen to the two boys, as they kept me wondering. i wondered how the heck they would get to new orleans sitting a door with a sea biscuit under it pulling an inflatable crocodile behind it. there were other great scenes throughout the movie.but the part that reached out to me was the part when dexter's health started to deteriorate. you just couldn't help but wonder if he was going to make it but towards the end you find out. i thought at the first prank they played, that dexter was really dead he obviously wasn't, silly me. but when they play the third, something is very wrong. dexter doesn't get up to laugh nor does he show any kind of laughter. at that point the victim of their prank soon announces that poor dexter had died. at that part i lost it. i balled my eyes out, and from that scene onwards i was crying. you just have to. as the end nears you start to understand eric's loss and then the movie ends on a nice note with dexters shoe floating ever so slowly down the river.overall this movie was excellent. it has laughter, adventure, emotion and sadness etc. when you put that in a blender you get an excellent, must watch film. peter horton has done a great job directing this film and i believe its certainly one of his best. but for now, i will try to search for this movie on dvd, if it exists that is. once again a superb movie that will take you on an emotional rollercaoster.

this was such a beautiful film. such an amazing performance from joseph and brad. very innocently written and performed. a must see !! i cried my eyes out almost through the entire movie. this is a movie that every family should sit down with their children to watch, it does teach us all a very important lesson in life and how we should be approaching the harsh subject of aids, how we should be teaching our children to cope with it and people around them. not only with aids, but with any terminal illness. i hadn't even heard of this movie until i scrolled through t.v. one day and happen to run across it. i recommend everyone to watch this, just don't forget your box of tissues. more movies should be made like this one. extremely heartwarming.

i really liked the movie, thought it was very entertaining as well as dramatic. but i just had a question about the music is the movie. i haven't been able to find any kind of soundtrack(if there even is one). and specifically ,i was wondering if anyone could tell me the name of the song that is playing while the boys are going down the river on their way to new orleans? i thought it was something along the lines of "my great escape", but i've searched on the internet, books, pretty much everything i could think of to try to, and i just can't find it anywhere. if someone could help out it would be greatly appreciated. thanks.

the cure is a fantastic film about a boy with aids. i've cried about 4 times watching this film and it's just so sad. i can't promise everyone will cry watching this but it will make you want to. very emotional and very sad, the cure is a must-see movie. it shows you the meaning of friendship and love and is an extremely great movie.at first i didn't think it would be as great and wondered why my mum always cried watching it. but now i know it's a stunning film that is so original and is so close to real life situations, unlike most of the other films that doesn't make sense. words cannot describe the greatness of the cure, you just have to see it.

when the movie "the cure" starts, we find out about a young man named erik (brad renfro). erik is a teenage boy living with his paranoid mother, and living next door to him is a young boy named dexter (joseph mazello). one day, erik and dexter connect and head up to the supermarket, where dexter gets his first taste of butterfinger. when erik learns out that dexter has aids, he tries leaves-and-water tea to make it better. but when the front cover of the national enquirer says a new orleans doctor has found the cure for aids, the two boys will stop at nothing to get to new orleans for the cure.in my opinion, "the cure" is easily one of the best friendship movies ever made. it shows unconditional love between a boy, his (new) best friend, and his best friend's mom. everything is so well done, nothing needs to be changed. not only do i give this a 10/10 for being a fantastic friendship movie, but it also is a sad, but humorous, and fun aids movie. and the tragic finale with dexter's contraction of aids is enough to make me shed a tear. very well done.

i remember when this film came out, and watched it a few times on vhs. i was so glad when it was finally released on dvd. i was hoping for widescreen, but at the point would take what was available. i love how they used color in the film, the outdoor scenes are so alive with color. the trees are the greenest i've ever seen. most of the film was shot in stillwater, minnesota, a beautiful town located on the st. croix river. they must have really scouted locations for filming, because they did a great job. the story is well written, and directed. i would rate this as one of peter horton's best. i'm also surprised that andrew dintenfass (the director of photography) hasn't done more. he did an incredible job. the acting also rates up there. it's amazing to see two actors of such a young age pull off this type of film. annabella sciorra did a great job as dexter's mother. who wouldn't want her as a mother.

even though this film is 11 years old, i just rented it yesterday, and i found it to be a really touching film. the story of true friendship in the face of a very real monster is an inspiration and quite touching.while i did not care much for the amount of language used by some of the young actors--especially from renfro--i understand that art is imitating life. renfro once again does a magnificent job of the rough-and-tough, very (and i mean very) disturbed wannabe bully (his role in the client comes to mind), and mazzello does a wonderful job of the witty, somewhat quirky, dexter--a child who realizes that his life must end too soon.while there are so many touching and funny moments in the movie, i have to say that my favorite was when the boys were cornered by pony in the abandoned church, and dexter (mazzello) cut himself, saying his blood was poison. while very resourceful, and somewhat amusing seeing a grown man running away from two little kids, it's one of the hardest scenes in the film.definitely check this one out, but prepared with your kleenex--you'll need it!

the best movie about friendship! especially between an aids infected person and a " normal " person. this is a great movie for everyone to see even though there is strong language used. i have seen it 25 times.

the subject of children being terminally ill is difficult and saddening but 'the cure' successfully portrays the idea that it doesn't have to be all doom and gloom and, if anything, children need to have hope and delight in their lives if they are to find peace before the end. it is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood.the film sees erik, a dysfunctional adolescent boy with a distant mother, moving into a new area where their next-door neighbour is eleven-year-old dexter, who contracted aids through a blood transfusion. after his initial fears and ignorance over aids are allayed, erik befriends dexter and their almost fraternal friendship sees them embark on a journey down the mississippi to where they have heard about a new orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease.the talent from the two young leads of brad renfro and joseph mazzello, who play erik and dexter respectively, is exceptional. brad was able to portray erik's harder edge without comprising the subtle childish innocence inherent to the character while joseph depicts the sense of vulnerability to dexter's character but injects the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and zeal to highlight that his illness doesn't mean he still isn't a child who wants to run and play like any other eleven-year-old boy. the pair's interactions create a feel in the audience that these are two boys who are genuinely close and they carry the film well. annabella sciorra also delivers a touching performance as dexter's mother linda, who adores her son and delights in seeing him thrive with this new friendship to erik and eventually becomes a surrogate mother-figure to the other boy.set against an excellent soundtrack, 'the cure' is a very bittersweet film that manages to flawlessly weave the story of boyhood friendship that survives unflinchingly in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness without resorting to sappiness or unnecessary saccharine sweet scenes. a very interesting reflection in the film is that is it the adults who have the problem with dexter's aids status whereas the children, even the 'bullies', come to accept him as they would any other. what is also very touching is how, despite erik's streetwise nature, he is the more naive one in his determination to cure dexter while the younger boy has this haunting sense that he knows his fate but is swept away by his best friend's enthusiasm for a cure.i highly recommend 'the cure' for it is rare to find a film that is simultaneously sad and uplifting.

way back in 1996, one of the airliner pilots where i used to work gave me a copy of this film. he told me that it'll make me cry. i never believed him and we even made bets. after seeing the film....i cried a bucket! even after the seeing the film, i found myself in the bathroom crying. it was actually the most touching film i have ever seen. i like the part where dexter's mom confronted eric's mother the line went something like... "your sons' best friend just died today..and it's not gonna be easy...if you ever lay your hands on him again...i will kill you!" the last part where dexter took eric's shoe was a scene that never left my mind until today. honestly, just thinking about it makes my eyes teary. a story of what true friendship is all about. my girlfriend loved it too... she hated me for letting her see the film. i cried a bucket, she cried a river.

very nice movie! i was browsing the channels on my tv and i usually ignore the channels that air drama movies but then i saw this channel that airs old school movies and it is where i saw this movie. at first, when i saw the title "the cure" i thought it's gonna be boring but then i got hooked when i saw brad renfro was in this movie (because of one of my favorite movie of all time is "the client" where brad also stars). then the scenes was getting better and better. the story is so beautiful and very touching! i cried hard in this movie which i don't usually do. great casting! and there are so many beautiful lines/quotes in this movie which is very striking and made me cry hard! now, i bought my own copy on dvd and i always recommend it to everyone!

i had seen the cure when i was a kid and i loved it then. now, years later, i got a hold of a copy almost by accident, and watched it again. being a kid, you don't really have the ability to procure things for yourself that you want, that is usually a prerogative of your parents - but when i watched it again now i felt sorry that i did not do more to get a copy of this movie back then, and consequently almost forgot about it until today.this really is a beautiful movie. it tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a hard-edged, misfit kid - who takes his cues from his horrible, abusive mother - and his neighbor, a slightly younger boy who has aids.right, you say. another one of "those". a tear jerker. a bucket movie. a morality tail. yeah, i know, i hate those too. only this one isn't. it is one of the very few movies among those many i have seen that pulls off a very rare trick: it conveys a truly sad story (and yes, a morality tale) but without a single moment where it feels cheesy, forced or in any other way "hollywoody". it shows a real relationship between two real boys, who interact as real kids do. and through that interaction the good-natured, loving character of the older boy, eric, starts to shine through his "tough-guy" persona, as he takes on a kind of big-brotherly care for dexter, his hiv-positive younger neighbor. together, they embark on an adventure to find a cure - which to erik seems to be just around the corner - so that all this silly aids thing will go away and they can be friends forever.the production is top notch. but, of course, what really carries this movie, is the performances of the two leads - brad renfro and joseph mazzello. especially mazzello, who is simply stunning - he does convey a sense of frailty needed for an ailing boy, but at the same time he manages to make dexter a truly energetic and determined character. he shines at the scene where the boys confront pony: his impulse to protect his older friend lunges him forth, drives him to say what he says - and only afterwards, the horror is depicted on his face, as he realizes that what he himself said is true: his blood is poison... renfro also has his moments, in particular the scenes with his mother: he depicts perfectly how this macho, street-wise kid is left completely frozen and numb when faced with his abusive, storming mother, and can't get a word in to contradict her as she forbids his relationship with the ailing boy out of her fear and ignorance. annabella sciorra also gives a memorable performance as dexter's mother, who ultimately becomes, in a sense, a mother figure to erik as well.i've first seen this film when i was at school back in america, and loved it - not at all a given concerning movies of this sort. but the behavior of the kids in this movie was so real, i could easily relate to them. ironically enough, the teacher who had shown us this movie (a wonderful woman, i'm still in touch with her) got in trouble for it, as some uptight parent complained about it having the scene when the two boys are looking at a playboy... pathetic. seriously, will americans ever get over this ridiculous phobia, i do not know. there was a hardly-distinguishable shot of a playboy cover in the movie and thus it is not shown in schools... how sad. kids need to see this movie. it is more inspiring and educational than all the "official" after-school specials put together.oh, and one more thing. i know i'm rambling, but nevertheless... the score. it's great. i am a musician, and as such i know dave grusin from his records: he is a well known jazz pianist and record producer. up until this movie i really did not know that he did movie scores as well, even though when i later checked i found out that i had unknowingly watched several movies he worked on. really, a wonderful job there.all in all, a solid ten. i'd recommend this movie to anyone. and i'm definitely going to see it with my younger siblings - they can use watching a film like this among all the standard special-effect hysteria they usually see.

unbelievably close to real life feelings and emotions captured by joseph mazzello as a hemophiliac child affected by aids and his new young neighbor, a wanna-be tough redneck played to perfection by brad renfro. although the story may seem slightly farfetched (the two boys attempt to river-raft several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the cure to aids), the emotion, actions and interactions of all characters involved are tragically close to real life. being a "big brother" to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released, i strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with aids. superb direction by peter horton creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship, illness, prejudice and the final parting of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity.

this is one of the most touching films i had ever watched. no movie has effected me the way this one did. this is a great film and you have to see for yourself. i'm normally impregnable with these sob story movies but this one did it for me. i was in tears at the end. you'll yearn for the friendship that is portrayed in this movie. if i can give this movie a billion stars i could.

for unknown reasons this beautiful masterpiece didn't get well-deserved recognition and has been vastly under-appreciated by many american movie critics. so it's easy to understand that i've met lots of troubles trying to find this movie. finally i watched it and it was so beautiful, sincere and poignant that for the first time in my life i watched one movie five times in one week after getting the tape. the story is focused on the friendship between two young boys erik and dexter, eleven and twelve years old, who are very different from each other but they are becoming the best (and only) friends. the beauty and sincerity of their friendship have been shown in the cure so sincere and naturally as it has never been before. there are so many beautiful, heartfelt and poignant scenes (particularly on the river), which strike the heart and can't leave any human indifferent to them. the movie also is full of incredibly powerful and emotional symbolism, (particularly strong with erik's shoe) which also greatly increases visual impression from such beautiful work. the story, written by robert kuhn, is well written and on the contrary to overwhelming majority of modern hollywood's products practically every scene, every phrase and every sentence in the movie is meaningful and bring something important about characters and relations between them. peter horton, who as i know had no major experience in movie directing before, showed his great abilities and talents in this sphere. the cinematography is also superb with perfectly selected locations for the movie, but the most important is perfect acting, which with all above mentioned makes the cure one of the best movies ever. both brad renfro as erik and joseph mazello as dexter created wonderful atmosphere of sincere friendship and magnificent chemistry between two main characters. only one this movie (i haven't seen most of their other works) is enough to name them as one of the best actors of their generation. annabelle sciorra also give a terrific performance as dexter's mother. it's terribly sad that such talented actors didn't get wide recognition, while numerous overrated stars enjoy enormous publicity and huge salaries. finally it would be unfair not to mention amazing soundtrack written by david grusin, and terrific mark cohn's song (one of the best songs that i've ever heard in the movies) my great escape. so all that i can say about the cure is one simple word ¬ñ great. at any point of view this movie is a beautiful, heartfelt and inspiring work of all people involved in making of this masterpiece. i have to credit all those people who put their hearts and souls into the movie and universal pictures, which among numerous formulaic commercial projects has found a way to make such a beautiful movie. but such movie so rarely come to movie theaters that very often studios themselves don't realize what gem they have made that they're unable to provide respective marketing campaign. the only one minor drawback about the cure for me is its short length (only 97 minutes). i don't want to write more about the movie because it's simply impossible to put its beauty and sincerity into words, so if you have any opportunity for watching the cure, rent it or buy it and you wouldn't be disappointed. 10 out of 10. sorry for my bad english.

the cure is an outstanding real-life drama that deals with a very sensitive subject. it is the story of the profound and dear friendship between two boys, eric and dexter. the latter has acquired aids from a blood transfusion. thus he and his mom (annabella sciorra) have become outcasts, shunned by the public and labeled as dangerous company, basically due to a common lack of public knowledge of the disease.when eric (brad renfro, known from 'the client' and 'apt pupil') and his mom move into the house next to them, he has to deal with public insults and the fear of catching aids himself. however, eric overcomes his fear and risks everything. at first he starts talking to dexter, but eventually he climbs over the fence and joins the witty boy (played by jurassic park's joseph mazzello) and his games. very quickly he develops a real friendship with dexter, who is delicately built and frail due to his condition.the central theme of the movie ¬ñ the theme which makes it pervasively authentic and tragic at the same time ¬ñ is how eric and dexter try to find the ultimate cure. at first they experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves ¬ñ which is very naive, but also genuine at the same time, as it shows how young kids deal with such heinous diseases and how strongly they still believe in the magic of the world. when they hear about an alleged cure which has been developed in the south, they do not hesitate and take off for an adventure that will bring them even closer together and symbolizes the ultimate quest for hope.so they board a raft and head southwards on the mississippi river. what starts as a real adventure becomes a dangerous undertaking, which is emotionally intriguing and instructive at the same time. the scene when dexter reveals his fears and talks about the end of the universe, where everything is dark and cold, eric hands him his sneaker, a symbol that wherever the boy may have to go, eric is and will always be with him; he will never have to be alone. this sequence, which is one of the most compelling ones of the movie, features a very convincing interaction between the two actors, who manage to avoid awkward and corny dialogs and deliver a very genuine performance that is eventually smashing in its tenderness and honesty.i will not go any further in outlining the plot, as i do not intend to give away too much information. the ending however is emotionally tough and makes the audience so much a part of the tragedy that everyone who watches the movie will feel personally affected. this aspect makes this movie so strong, so outstanding and so convincing. the emotional burden on every character is so real and so thrashing that even the tougher members of the audience might need some hankies.a 10 is doing justice to this movie and is not too high a rating. there is hardly any other movie i have seen in my life so far that handles such an emotional issue with so much wit and sensibility. it is the story of how two boys make each other's life richer and how they teach each other lessons of life. thus dexter overcomes his isolation and sadness, and eric learns what really counts in life; and both of them realize how much of a gift real friendship is when it comes to the hardest moments of life.this movie is tragic ¬ñ but its message is sheer inspiration.

and i do not understand why the show gets so much beating. in my opinion this show really is excellent. well the first two episodes were not that great but it picks up a load of momentum at the third episode. which seems to be typical for a steve moffat sitcom. i would rate it among the best sitcoms britain has ever produced.the show itself is a farce at its best, it is not along the lines of fawlty towers, but you definitely can rank it as high as a black adder, coupling, or the young ones! i am watching the first season, and all i can say is that i am happy i bought the dvd!the problem probably with this show is and why it got smacked so hard, according to the internet, that the original press release compared it to fawlty towers, and everyone was disappointed it was not! well even green wing is closer to fawlty towers than this show, all i can say is clear your mind from every prejudice, give the show at least a run until (including episode 3) and then decide for yourself!all i can say is thanks steve moffat for writing it and thanks for the entire staff pulling it off!

this one of the best and funniest comedy series i have ever seen! all characters are brilliant.mr. slatt (david bamber) is a very very irritated man, irritated by everything and anyone.he wants to do things and handle situations as best as he possibly can, but he never gets it right and only gets himself deeper and deeper in trouble. not supported by his wife janet, who only tries to get him deeper and deeper into the trouble he is getting himself into (and really does not need the help at all!).all characters are played/portrayed brilliantly. just imagine sending your kid(s) to a school like this.it is unbelievable that people do not like it (maybe some don not get the many many plays on words, that are featured many times per episode).it is also unbelievable that there is still no dvd release of it. there are only 2 series!so please, release it, let it go! so the fans can and will enjoy it!try it, you might just like it!!!just some names & words from the series: pumpman, man helmet, hot bitch, mount suzy, travis fellatio, cockfoster, arshead (and many many more).

i don't think this cartoon was as bad as some may think. of course, i was only five at the time it came out. but, i did find it very entertaining at the time and would still give it a look today if given the opportunity. batman and robin being voiced by adam west and burt ward was a nice touch, and gave it a sense of familiarity for me as i was also watching re-runs of the campy 1960's live action show "batman" at that age. this cartoon also introduced some new twists i had forgotten all about, like "bat-mite" for instance. looking back on it, i'm sure he was likely as annoying as many think, but he didn't bother me much at the time. the best i can recall, his voice sounded like a cross between dumb donald and orko. gee, i wonder why? :) anyway, give it a look if you can and make up your own mind. you might be surprised.

interesting story and sympathetic treatment of racial discrimination, son of the gods is rather too long and contains some hammy acting, but on the whole remains a fascinating film.story about a chinese passing as white (rchard barthelmess) starts as barthelmess leaves college after being insulted by a trio of brainless co-eds. he embarks on a world tour to discover himself and ends up as secretary to a british playwright (claude king). in monte carlo he meets beautiful alanna wagner (constance bennett) and they fall in love. but when she discovers he is chinese she goes berserk in a memorable scene.plagued by guilt and love, alanna goes into a mental spiral and makes a few attempts to contact barthelmess. after his father dies he takes over the business (banking?) and dons chinese garb as a symbol of his hatred of the white race that has spurned him. after a san francisco detective tells him the truth about his birth, barthelmess makes the decision to honor his chinese father and mother.and i agree that one reviewer here never saw this film. alanna declares her love for sam before he tells her of his recent discovery. and that makes all the difference in this film.barthelmess and bennett each have a few scenes where they chew the scenery, but on the whole this is a solid and interesting drama. frank albertson is good as the nice college pal, claude king is solid as the playwright bathurst, bess flowers has one scene as an oklahoma indian, and e. alyn warren is the chinese father, dorothy mathews is nasty alice. not so good are anders randolf as bennett's father and mildred van dorn as eileen. also note the gorgeous blonde to the right of barthelmess at the roulette table. what a stunner whoever she was!

a wealthy young man, raised as a son of the gods, must confront his chinese heritage while living in a white world.although the premise upon which this film is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility and the secret of the plot when revealed at the movie's conclusion makes all which has preceded it faintly ludicrous, the story still serves up some decent entertainment and good acting.richard barthelmess has the title role as the sweet-natured oriental whose life is terribly complicated because he looks caucasian. barthelmess keeps the tone of his performance serious throughout, gazing intently into the middle distance (a mannerism he developed during silent days) whenever his character is indecently misused. he makes no attempt to replicate his classic performance in d. w. griffith's broken blossoms (1919) and this is to his credit. beautiful constance bennett is the millionaire's daughter who makes barthelmess miserable. she is gorgeous as always, but her behavior does not endear her to the viewer and her terrible illness in the final reel is kept mercifully off screen.multi-talented frank albertson has a small role as barthelmess' improvident buddy. serene e. alyn warren and blustery anders randolf play the leading stars' very different fathers, while claude king distinguishes his brief appearance as the english author who befriends barthelmess.movie mavens will recognize little dickie moore, uncredited, playing barthelmess as a tiny child.the original technicolor of the flashback sequence has faded with time to a ruddy tint. the shot purporting to be the south of france instead looks suspiciously like avalon on santa catalina island, off the coast of southern california.

sophisticated sex comedies are always difficult to pull off. look at the films of blake edwards, who is arguably the master of the genre, and you will find just as many misses as hits. for, if a film of this nature ever fails to work, it can never fall back on the tried and true toilet humor of a teen sex comedy [i.e. "american pie"], or warm the audience with the sentimentality of a romantic comedy [i.e. julia roberts' entire career]. it can only maintain a push to the end, and hope that the audience can appreciate the almost required irony of it's resolution.written by husband/wife team wally wolodarsky and maya forbes, "seeing other people" opens with engaged couple ed & alice [jay mohr & julianne nicholson] only seconds away from rear-ending the car in front of them. as the frame freezes, we unexpectedly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters. from here on out, we welcome that the story about to unfold will enjoy a point of view from both sexes.two months shy of their vows, ed & alice already look and act like an old married couple. in an early bathroom scene, their actions alone show us just how comfortable they are with each other and how long they have been together. so when the line to propel the plot forward is uttered - expectedly from the least likely of the two - it is as if the very relationship itself is calling for a change, even if it means it's own destruction.once all the ground rules are set [ed can not sleep with her mother or, for that matter, salma hayek], the two head off in their separate directions in the hope of finding some meaningless sex to strengthen their relationship. at first, everything seems to go as planned as their daily trysts only help to fire up the passion between them. but predictably, as the deeper emotions of regret and jealousy begin to emerge, they soon find themselves growing apart and on the verge of breaking up. all of these actions leading to a resolution you may or may not like - depending on your own degree of cynicism.for a comedy like this, you need a solid cast with supporting characters just as strong as the leads. and director wolodarsky does not disappoint. here he has cast two of my favorite actresses as sisters - julianne nicholson & lauren graham - and allows them to play to their strengths. for nicholson, who has always reminded me of a young shirley maclaine, she brings an air of naivete and vulnerability to alice even when her actions seems less than so. and as for graham, an actress who has proven she could outperform an entire howard hawks ensemble, she steals every scene she is in with an edgy "no bs" persona. as for the guys, jay mohr is serviceable here as is josh charles. "malcolm in the middle"'s byron cranston has to be applauded for taking on a british accent and letting it all hang out. but the real treat here is andy richter and his sub-plot involving single mother, helen slater. while his scenes almost seem to belong in another movie, they are by far the funniest and his dead panned delivery steals the show.for an independent production, "seeing other people" has a more personal and introspective feeling - something that would be noticeable absent from a big hollywood film of this kind. not to mention that this film also has some genuinely funny moments - unlike, say, most hollywood comedies in general.rating [on a 5 star system] : 3 1/2 stars

why this film was only released in 4 states is beyond me. i thought this film was a divine story. the name says it all: seeing other people. this movie has more logic than laughs, which i suppose is why it works so well. common sense also makes an appearance in what would seem to be another puerile sex comedy. alice is getting her feet frozen in the cold, when she feels irrationally about the way she might perform for her fianc√©, not just sexually, but as a partner, and friend etc. this starts what seems to be an almost archetypal journey for the both of them. one fling after another leads to trouble, as if it wasn't a bad idea from the start. witty dialogue and comic set-ups make this one funny as hell! nicholson and mohr set the tone of the film early on, and keep the promise they anticipate. other highlights are lauren graham, andy richter, and helen slater(in her first theatrical film in 10 years!). climax begins to take an insane turn, but a simple ending makes this one far more enjoyable than most movies today. mohr fans will see something different in his ed character, and fans of helen slater will enjoy her shiny moments of a quick, but excellent come-back. any richter takes home the award for most moralistic character. romantic and funny, or just plain fun. seeing other people is a gem, which needs to be noticed.

i channel surfed past this many times, mainly because the synopsis sounded so cheesy, so "love american style". however, it turned out to be quite good, very well done. the two stand-out features are the dialog and acting. great cast. the premise is actually well executed and there aren't too many weak moments. i guess what i was most amazed by was how often you thought the wheels are going to come off the cart, and instead, the cart just banks the turns, so to speak, and the movie keeps flying. there are some nice little sub-plots, particularly the relationship that develops between the character played by former conan sidekick andy richter. also, want to mention that the music accompanying it was good.

i rented this movie without having heard (or read) anything about it. what a shame! this movie is intelligent, witty, hilarious, fast-paced, and realistically ridiculous. the characters manage to get developed without relying too heavily on clich√©d, tired stereotypes. it was refreshing to watch. i couldn't help thinking that marketing would have helped lob this not-so-mainstream movie into the starved-for-intelligent-comedy mainstream. the quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors execute a huge range of awkwardness, heartbreak and comedy is so rare these days--i felt that the actors must have really enjoyed participating in something this rich. how is it that national treasure was number one at the box office for three weeks in a row--it is so weak in too many ways to mention. i guess i'm just happy that movies like "seeing.." are still being made somewhere out there.

i first saw this movie at a premiere-party in mr. zwarts hometown fredrikstad. there, between directors, musicians and other norwegian celebrities i laughed and laughed... i just couldn't stop. if you like a comedy with black humor, sharp lines and excellent acting - this is one flick you have to see! it's like mixing "true romance" with "the wedding singer" and add a dash of "mad about you" hilarios!10 points!

okay, maybe this movie not a revolution. but it a very good piece of entertainment, and it's liv tyler's variation of alicia silverstone's "clueless" or cameron diaz' "there's something about mary".liv plays a femme fatale, which just wants to have an own house and all kinds of material comfort in it. and well she does everything to get just that... even crimes. many crimes. and she drops every boyfriend which doesn't cooperate to get these things. additionally, she actually doesn't mind to have some additional lovers beside her current boyfriend.this movie is even funnier to watch if one knows that liv is actually of zodiac sign cancer - and cancer are reported to be very domestic. so the character liv played here is actually a parody of a cancer !i was alone in cinema when i watched this one. that was quite comfortable because i could laugh as loud as i wished all the time - but it also felt strange, as if nobody was actually interested in this movie ?i myself liked it very much. the acting was between very good to excellent, especially the main actors where brilliant. there where enough jokes, many of the black kind, and good dialogues.this is a trash movie, and it is full of black humor. if you like this kind of movies, try this one !

one night at mccool's is one of those films that starts with an awful amount of promise but as the film goes on it becomes silly and loses it's way big time. liv tyler plays a manipulative woman who tries to get her own way by flaunting her body to every man she meets ,all of which fall under her spell.there are a few funny moments in this but they get fewer and fewer as the film deteriorates into a comedy farce. michael douglas who plays the assassin is good as is liv tyler, although she does look like she had put on a bit of weight since armaggedon. this is ok but is only memorable for the scene in which liv tyler washes her car, you will know what i mean when you see it fella's! shwing!!!!! 7 out of 10 (just).

each guy liv tyler meets loses their head over her, not, of course, without some small encouragement from liv. liv is at her beautiful best, with matt dillon tops among the paramours. interesting initial premise, to tell story from perspective of each dupe, degenerates into sitcom-style finale (not unlike blame it on rio, with which it has more than a few similarities). worth watching nonetheless.

okay. here's the thing. i've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, darkest, blackest comedy ever made. whiffs of tarantino, etc. well, not exactly. but, guess what? it's still an enjoyable and, ultimately, funny film. not brilliant, not trash. liv tyler gives a great performance and you absolutely cannot take your eyes off her. she's a woman with very strong decorating ideas...matt dillon, a greatly underrated and under-used actor, is wonderful, as ever. he always manages to stride that delicate line between scruff and soul, and he pulls off the comedy beautifully. ditto john goodman (though the religious overtones, probably funny in the script, really don't work). paul reiser is very good --- definitely better than he was on tv.the usually unbearable michael douglas is actually great in this role. as for his coif, well, see the film. between this and "wonder boys," you're actually reminded of the fact that douglas can act. the movie will make you laugh in parts. okay, not exactly belly-laughing, but definitely in the i'm-amused-i'm-very-amused category. if you're renting this expecting to see another "pulp fiction," forget it. but if want something kinda hip and kinda fun, this is a damned good choice.

if you don't have anything better to do, then go ahead and rent this movie, it's intelligent, funny it will sure have your attention busy for a while.i discover it by surfing channels in a boring sunday, it was on cable, and for the faces i saw, i thought it may worth the try, it made me laugh and for a movie in a sunday with nothing else on tv, it was ok. liv tyler looks amazing in the movie, even though her acting is not what i expected, it's kind of poor acting and for the rest of the crew, i liked reba in her role as a dr. also i found interesting seeing the guy from the sitcom "what i like about you" playing an almost gay lawyer.as for j. goodman i found it, as always a very good performance, michael douglas plays a small role but his characterization was hard for me to identify him..it's also a good movie to watch with company.

a very funny movie. michael douglas' "do" is worth watching this flick for if for no other reason. i'd like to see him do more of these low life roles. he was terrific, as were all the performers.the film struck me right off as an american roshomon, only funnier and easier to watch because it was in american and didn't need no stinkin subtitles!in a funny movie with a laugh every minute or so, two of the best were with john goodman (not someone i am crazy about) - 1. he is telling the priest about jewel doing something he liked and says "i had to wipe the smile off my face." the visual shows he is not smiling and clearly is a guy who never smiles, but probably doesn't know it. 2. the scene at the end between goodman, all suited up for jewel in his cop uniform, and grappling with the be-leathered reiser hunched over a table... and the two of them then protesting that they are not gay to another character who happens on the scene - this alone deserved a special comedy academy award.

liv tayler in her sexiest movie! she incorporates the "femme fatale" role in an astonishing way, while in the same time she manages to appear a super sexy woman while keeping the "sweet girl" stand and not being over-wicked like other similar movies (e.g. "femme fatale" with rebecca romijn)until this movie, lord of the rings was the only movie i ever saw her (im hooked on with lotr)point: by lotr i had shaped an opinion that the role of the pure-sweet woman was the only role that liv tayler could interpret, but when i saw "one night at mc cool" i absolutely changed my mind. she is the sexiest woman ever!therefore as a film is a mediocre common comedy with a "confusing" plot

one night, barkeeper randy (matt dillon) rescues jewel (liv tyler) from her jealous boyfriend utah (andrew dice clay). he takes jewel to his home. but utah comes back and wants randy to open the safe at mc cool¬¥s. suddenly a shot - utah¬¥s dead. then... ...i¬¥ll better stop here to tell the plot. that¬¥s like to explain the story of "wild things". what i found so interesting, was the fact that the plot (written by stan seidel, his first and his last work - he died in july last year...) was told from 3 perspectives - the 3 men that fall for jewel. everybody of them sees her from different eyes - like john goodman as the detective, who tenderly falls in love with her because of being remembered of his dead wife...no wonder that the guys fall for her! liv tyler - she¬¥s a real jewel. she made the big screen shining! she played her role as if she was in a 40¬¥s noir- thriller. sweet - but in the same time she was the cool vamp who walks over dead body¬¥s and uses the men for her needs. and, of course, michael douglas. how could i forget him? mr. burmeister, the bingo-playing killer - he was quite cool!but in the last 10 minutes there was a little bit too much slapstick for my taste - it weakened the atmosphere. that part began when paul reiser (as randys cousin carl) putted on his leather dress for jewel. the "ymca"-song didn¬¥t fit so much here... ... but altogether, "one night at mc cool¬¥s" is a pretty cool film-noir parody!

this movie makes me laugh by even just thinking about it. such a smart comedy! very precise yet easy. the casting can not be any better. all actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play precisely the best, and there is no stupid laughs or shouting through out the whole movie. layers and the progress of story work perfectly together and the rhythm flow smoothly. the greatest of all is when the village people's ymca is cued in, it brings out the importance of the indian's statute which was only briefly brought up previously in the movie, which makes the smartest and funniest climax among many comedies. i give it a ten especially a lot of times comedies are so underrated.

liv tyler. liv tyler. liv tyler. yeah it's hard to keep your mind off this fetching beauty (giving an radiantly picture-perfect performance), as she simply has tongues wagging. 'one night at mccool's' is a dementedly quirky and raunchy black comedy with old-fashion shades tied in to its familiar, but smartly crafted and chaotic narrative which has three men lusting after the one women and she's milking it to her advantage. when you see tyler, no wonder why they are infatuated and would do anything¬Ö that's anything to see 'her' happy and living 'her' dreams. just like tyler, there's something rather intoxicating about this feature in that we see the likes of matt dillon, john goodman, paul reiser (who's great) and especially michael douglas (who plays the hired assassin with cool-ease, but a questionable hairdo) really having a good time with their roles. the consuming plot opens up with the main three characters (dillon, goodman and reiser) telling their story of how they came to encounter this divine presence and the eventual affects that she's having on them to lead to an insane climax. there's an unpredictable chain of events (ranging from fruity to sensual), where everything would virtually tie in together with a certain ironic (snowball) twist of fate for the characters (that see them leaving their reserved comfort zone to fulfill this girl). howard zwart's direction is colorfully zippy balancing the script's quick-fire gags and frenetically fun, if complicated situations. one of the best under-the-radar comedies in the last decade, which will have you under tyler's thumb.

this movie is never going to be on a list of the top 50 films of all time, but if you're compiling a list of "fun films", this isn't a bad place to start. liv tyler is amazing, captivating and luscious, and everyone else is dead-on right for their parts. it's a 21st century counterpart to "tom jones" -- in other words; just good, bawdy fun. i think that this may be tyler's breakthrough film on her way to major stardom. with no nudity she oozes sex in this film. it's no wonder all the boys give her toys. how could they help but do that for a helpless, innocent such as liv's jewel?

this is a very good black comedy, with a great view on how different people have a different perception of the same situations. the three main characters each met a girl named jewel, played by liv tyler, who is a different male fantasy for each of the three men. each of the three men go through the same situations, but when they tell of them to other people, their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two say. that is a very good concept, probably not entirely original but it works very well in the movie. the plot is very good, very bizarre and extreme, which makes it a good black comedy. the acting is equally good, not one of the actors seemed out of place or out of their league. the comedy is very black, pitch black in some scenes, and a lot of people will definitely be offended by it, but fans of black comedy will probably enjoy it. overall, this movie is not for everyone's taste, but most people who like black comedy will probably love it, as it is definitely one of the better black comedies. 7/10

i must admit, i liked this movie, and didnt find it all misogynist. it could be subtitled, three ways of looking at liv tyler. three different men become obsessed with the same woman,and tell their stories to very different characters;one man(john goodman) tells his story to a priest(the very funny richard jenkins).for goodmans charcter, the liv tyler character is an idealized saint, the second coming of his sainted wife,theresa.for paul riesers character(who tellls story to a shrink(a fine, understated performance by the great reba mcintire),the liv tyler character is simplyan object of (kinky)sexual fantasy.finally matt dillons rather dimwitted charcter tells his side of the story to a sleazy hit man, played by micheal douglas.all three of these narratives of obsession are told simultaneously,and all are amusing. finaly the film ends in a bizarrely funny climax, that i wont give away.

one night at mccool's is a very funny movie that is more intelligent than what it should be. its form is more sophisticated than what i expected, and its randomness was superb. the thoughts behind the movie (mysogeny, sadism, stupid men) are are infantile. that's what i have to say about this movie is that not only does it hate women, but it loathes men. it doesn't have any sympathy for any of the men, really. it seems that way because of the form, but the ending says it all. nobody cares.the form has the first 2/3 of the movie told in flashback by three characters: dillon, the stupid bartender; reiser, the mysogenistic stupid lawyer; and goodman, the stupid, holier-than-thou cop. the story is therefore always perverted by their own self images and altered realities. reiser's bbq fantasy is a great touch. in the end, we never really know the truth, and nothing is what it seems. dillon was never that innocent, etc. actually, the rest of the movie is funny too. from the randomness of the last 5 seconds of the movie to the overly-obviousness of tyler's manipulations, the movie seems to have an energy all its own. everything is just out of the blue, and nothing seems to make sense. do we really care if it does? no. it is also a very dark comedy, but has a shallow presentation. think nurse betty, or jawbreaker. very candy coated outside, dark chewy inside. if you like your movies random, dark, or just purely mean, see this movie. this one will satisfy your urges for the strangeness that is one night at mccool's.8/10

one night at mccool's / (2001) *** (out of four)by blake french:	according to harald zwart, the director of "one night at mccool's," this film is "a dark comedy about the power of women over men, and how a group of people can all perceive different realities. it's the same story told from three different points of view, and each time we tell the story, we try to reveal a little bit more about what actually happened, which nobody really knows." 	"one night at mccool's" marks the feature film directorial debut of zwart, an award winning commercial and music video director who began making short films when he was eight years old. i always get nervous when a director of commercials and music videos turns to filmmaking. we have seen so many examples of how these guys think they are making another advertisement or music video for tv with their productions. zwart resists that tendency. he captures a specific humorous truth in "one night at mccool's," from an inventive, complex screenplay by the late stan seidel, even if it is often somewhat perplexing. 	"one night at mccool's" features three men who share their separate experiences about a particularly beautiful young woman. in some ways, this movie is the comedy version of "american beauty," but in others, it is a world apart. 	"it all started one night at mccool's" explains each of the three men to their various listeners. there is randy (matt dillon), a tender at the local bar, and his cousin, a lawyer named carl (paul reiser), who stays until the place closes. detective dehling (john goodman), arrives when the saloon becomes the crime scene of the dead boyfriend of a female fatal appropriately named jewel (liv tyler). randy is the first to see her, as an individual treats her unkindly. he stands up for her, and before you can say sexy, they are having vigorous sex and she moves in with him. at first, randy is reluctant: "the sex and the violence, all in one night ¬ñ it's a little much." but who could turn a jewel like jewel away.	jewel changes the lives of each of the three men. for detective dehling, she pulls him out of a hole of grief since his wife died. for carl, she makes him forget his loving family and nice little suburban household. for randy, she lights a few fires, both positive and negative, the later persuading him to contact a bingo playing hit man named burmeister (michael douglas) to put an end to her deceptive ways.  it is interesting how the movie perceives the three different chronicles-even the costuming of jewel is relative to the man telling the story. dehling sees jewel as a beautiful, mesmerizing gift from god. carl sees jewel as two sexy legs and lots of cleavage. randy is unsure what to make of her, an awakening to his otherwise boring, road to nowhere life. the most intriguing element of this movie is jewel herself, however, deliciously played by the always delightful liv tyler ("armageddon"). she is not really interested in the men, but what they can offer her. her motives are all too simple, not truthfully diabolical or evil; she is simply a young lady who has learned at an early age that she can get what she wants out of life through her beauty. 	the film has a lot of fun with its material. from the enthusiastically entertaining cast, to its violently hilarious showdown, "one night at mccool's" takes advantage of most of its humorous ideas. what makes the movie even funnier is how the three men's points of view differ. the actors have a lot of fun with their characters, too. goodman is curiously whimsical; reiser fits his kinky, squirmy part quite well; douglas is sly and mysterious in one of the movie's funniest performances; dillon gives his character arrogant personality, even though randy is a lackluster nobody; liv tyler is dazzling. she injects jewel with the perfect amount of boastful charisma and tantalizing wit. she reminds us of mena suvari's intimate performance in "american beauty."	"one night at mccool's" is the first film to come from michael douglas' new production company, furthur films. it is a creative, genuine, and sexy production. along the way we often become caught up in the twisty structure, but that is a natural response to a movie that intentionally interweaves several angles to a single story. the movie ends on a note that is both black and comedic. this is another one of those comedies in which serious events take place in a humorous way; i.e., the black comedy. many films of this genre come across as either too black or too lackadaisical. "one night at mccool's" is one of the few that actually work. 

brought philip larkin to life in a way that is worthy of the greatest performances of all time, and not just the ones that are measured by popularity. it shows a stark portrayal of larkins life as the greatest unrecognized poet of his era - which is exactly how he would have wanted it, such was his disdain for cankers and medallions. it dramatically exposes the raw beauty in the intense sadness of philips observations of our relationship with our own mortality, and lays it our in a way that seems to have missed even the great philosophers. for anyone interested in profound observations of our relationship with life, love and death this is a must.

i am a big fan of larkin's works, i believe that he was amid the greatest 20th century poets. the film itself does a great justice to the bard of hull. wonderfully portrayed by all the players in their roles. bonneville does do a service to the sexually repressed larkin, he avoids an impression and strays from becoming a caricature. the use of his poetry was the highlight of the piece itself. rather than acting out the massive intensity with which larkin felt, the use of his words themselves give a better insight into plot and add a much more sombre but altogether more fascinating atmosphere. most enjoyable.

what's there not to like?i caught this again tonight and marvelled as to hugh bonneville's capturing of the essence of philip larkin without resorting to tics and caricature.there are many layers to the depiction of the complexity of the main character and hugh brings them to life. his prudish mother, his unresolved issues with his father and his inability to commit to one woman. his poetry is interlaced throughout and some scenes are caught in his recounting of them to the wife of a friend whom he later propositions but quite casually, almost innocently. it is not difficult to see where his attraction lay for the many women who fell in love with him (and knew about each other, to boot, and continued to see him!) cerebral, fun-loving, jazz aficionado, loyal friend. it is always more than looks, women moved beyond his baldness, deafness and short sightedness. and a beautifully nuanced performance by eileen atkins as his mum is an added bonus.9 out of 10.

i just do not see what is so bad about this movie. i loved this movie! i thought this movie was the best film in the series. though part 3 is the best in the series,i still gave this film 10 out of 10 because it is great. i don't see what everyone hates this movie. who would not want to see just a little bit of critter action. i wished that brad brown would of appeared in this one because it might of made it a little better. those who like a little bit of drama because...wait i won't tell you,you will just have to watch it. this film also contains a few popular actors who are...(i won't tell you because i hate it when people give spoilers so i do not want to be one of those people). well i guess that is all i have to say about this movie.

critters 4 is a good movie. a bit of a twist to the series, as it takes place in space, not in an earthly community. good effects and acting make this movie a must see. i would recommend this to horror/science fiction fans everywhere.10 out of 10fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master, skinned alive, sleep away camp, slumber party massacre, and other full moon pictures flicks. for other recommendations, check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section.

critters 4: this movie was continued after the 3rd critters movies. this one was released in the same years as critters 3 was released in 1991. critters 4 takes you in space as they hunt for the humans in a space ship. i doubt if there will be a critters 5 because the ending for the 4th was quite a good ending, which brought the end to the critters as there was no more left. i give this movie 10 out of 10.

i think it was a pretty good film. it shows how someone grew up in an environment that created a rich and powerful man but unfortunately because of his ambition and the people around him it led to his destruction. it shows that you can't trust anyone especially in a world that deals with a lot of money and envy.the character that i mostly liked was sebeva. she was another ambitious, powerful and ruthless woman in a man's world who loved and respected kilo. she also knew that business was business and a dangerous one. everything she did was risky but got the job done. she helped kilo become rich with her connections. overall, i really liked this film and have it in my collection and waiting for el padrino 2.

this film is just really great. i don't know why. i alway have a weakness for damian chapa. it's not scarface, but still i really enjoyed my self. this is a film i can see more than ten times. he really try's to make a good movie, but he just can't do it. i feel pity for him, so maybe it's a bit of a sympathy vote. i can't help it, but i just can't give it less than 9 stars. everyone should have seen this once in his life. to see how to make a cheap film work. i live in holland and bought this film for only one euro! that's 1,50 dollar. i would have also bought it for ten euro. great great great. on a little dutch film site this film gets a 101 votes. here only a 260. that's not so much more. so people all over the world. buy this movie!

i liked this movie. that's pretty much all i can say about it. lou gossett did a good job, even though i'm still very disappointed in him after all the iron eagle movies. and even if i was smiling on the inside when the first main teenager dies (i won't give it away) it was done in a nice, fitting fashion. pretty much everyone in this movie does a good job, so check it out! it's another one of those movies i found real cheap, so i bought it, and i recommend the same.

i don't understand how people could not like this movie. you have gossit jr., the kid who played the main character in stand by me, sean astin, and many other great actors. lots of action and fun that you don't see in today's movies anymore. it's really a shame. this is an underrated movie that is among other great movies like let's get harry. the 80's and early 90's created such great movies that will never again be topped by today's standards. they tried to somehow recreate this movie in masterminds, but came up short with some really bad acting. the only thing that movie had going was patrick stewart, but obviously that wasn't enough.

being raised at the time this movie was released has probably influenced my shallow mind, but still, this isn't a bad movie by any means. it's a movie about a hostage situation involving a prep school populated to some extent by endearing teenage boys who can't seem to get out of trouble. what's wrong with that? it doesn't have any big special effects, but so what? who needs special effects? cinema's decline began around the same time that special effects were popularized. a coincidence? i think not. it turned movies with potentially good plot and feelings and turned them into a big, substance-less light show for innocent kids and the self-medicated. well, you know, not all movies need special effects. about three fourths of the movies on the imdb top 250 are without special effects, but almost all of the top grossing movies of all time have some special effects. think about it: star wars, e.t., ghostbusters, etc. all good movies, but the rest of the top-grossing movies are usually cliched tripe with non-sensical plots and lots of eye candy. well some movies don't need ny of that junk.excuse me for going off on a tangent, which i normally do, but i'm just so fed up with that special effects junk. back to the point: toy soldiers is simply a great movie. i admit, some of the content is a little corny and ripped off, but so what, every movie rips off another to some extent. think of resovoir dogs. countless "appreciation" sites dictate the fact that beloved quentin tarentino, who i admit i like, has copied many, many, many movies in the making of his first major film reservoir dogs. many say that the entire plot is ripped off almost scene for scene from japanese and chinese gangster movies which mr. tarentino loved so much, and probably still does. sorry once again for the tangent.toy soldiers is fun. it has the whole insubordination from teenagers to unwanted members of authority, i.e. hostage takers. it's fun to see kids take over when they're being held to something they don't want to do. hell, teenage angst-inspired rebelion was the key topic to a great majority to 80's comedies. plus there's the tension and thrill of having the characters use fire-arms and knock out the bad guys, etc. plus there's some emotional points to the film. when one of the characters dies the others have to cope and adjust. it's not perfect acting but it beats most of the other tripe out there.in short, toy soldiers is exciting, interesting, and fun. how dare you jaded blowhards rate this movie poorly! shame on you all!personal rating: 8/10

peter coyote was the only name that i recognised from the cast list, so i wasn't too keen on watching this film. the only comment on imdb was positive, so i watched it on late night t.v. i would recommend this movie as a good late night viewing. it's better than a lot of this genre. the plot is excellent, the acting isn't brilliant, but it's not bad. i don't usually like flashbacks but in this film they work. as i've stated, i didn't recognise any of the cast by name, but i recognised michele lee, who gave a decent, hard working performance, as the woman wanting to stand by her man, who is lying to her. (was it knots landing?) anyhow, she's wearing really well. note: you may enjoy it more, if you miss the first few seconds of the credits. i did and it helped me. when you see the end credits, you'll get what i mean the wayne kennedy character, who is really weird, takes this to a 7 rather than a 6.

i gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10. it had an excellent plot, and peter coyote and michele lee, as well as the rest of the cast, did their parts well.both peter and michele were too long in the tooth for the ages their characters were supposed to be, and their children in the film, obviously would have been better suited being their grandchildren.i missed the first ten minutes of this film, so i don't know just how that body turned up after 25 years and got traced back to denny traynor (peter coyote's character), but i had no difficulty picking up on the storyline.barbara traynor (michele lee) is stunned when her long-time husband, denny is arrested for a murder in oregon some 25 years previous, a state denny claims he was never in.however, as evidence piles up against denny, his story changes. then his story changes again and yet again, until barbara doesn't know what to believe.barbara makes up her mind, however, to get to the bottom of the mystery whirling around the fateful time denny and a young girl named sherry accepted a ride from a stranger named wayne kennedy, that ended in murder.i found the film entertaining, well paced, and it kept me guessing as to what had really happened between those three people.from what i saw during the closing credits, this seemed to be based on a true story.

this is a nice little lifetime movie about a guy (peter coyote) who's living the perfect suburban middle class life when late one night the police suddenly bust into his home and arrest him for the murder of some guy 27 years ago.in his prison cell coyote recounts to his wife the fateful events of 27 years ago and how he came into contact with wayne kennedy the man who he supposedly killed.from here the story is told in flashback fashion and the more you learn about wayne and coyote and how they came to meet and what happened when they did the more interested you get.the acting isn't anything to crow about, although the guy who plays wayne kennedy is pretty creepy enough. the real strong point of the movie is that mystery of what actually happened on the mountain. the wife spends the movie running around digging up clues to the mystery and each time something new comes up we are treated with another flashback revealing more of the mystery. it's actually pretty well.so as far as lifetime tv movie's go this little flick comes highly recommended.enjoy!

i usually have a difficult time watching a tv movie, the extra long commercial breaks will break my concentration and i give up and find a good book. this one however made me put up with the adds and stay with it to the end. i realize the movie was based on a true story but it was not brought out why it took so long to find denny? they had his name and i would presume his social security number. while he did move around a lot it would seem he would be found as soon as his number was entered for a job etc. the actors seemed a bit old for the part and a buried metal object when dug up had no rust. these were only technical glitches and did not take from the file. for a lifetime movie it was better than most.

this movie is sort of similar to "better off dead" as it has some of the same stars. this one though isn't quite as good. granted it is rather funny and enjoyable, there is something about "better...that i like, well better. this one has these guys going to nantucket to spend there summer vacation. while there they meet this girl who's trying to save here house from this guy who wants to turn it into a lobster restaurant. this guy really doesn't seem to like lobsters, cause in one scene he sticks it into boiling water and puts in a stethoscope so he can hear it scream. the main character is torn between this girl and the girl of the son of the guy who wants to make the restaurant. somehow or another this leads to a big boat race showdown, kind of like in "summer rental" though it works a bit better here and fits into the plot a little better. though what is the deal with boat races at this time? was there some weird fascination with them? for the most part this movie delivers laughs at a good clip, but "better off dead" was still better cause it was the first and the jokes worked better.

i adore this film as much as any one adores viewing whatever it was they saw when they were young. it was one of those films that home box office showed every other day throughout my youth. this film is forever lodged in my brain. for someone who didn't grow up around this film, you may have become spoiled by the add cycle we've been in since the mid-90's and may find it more difficult to appreciate this gem. cool this is, as my sis was doped up on "better off dead" before i saw this (of which i raped & loved)-and no one, no one can deny the embrace of awkward teenage humor in american cinema in the 80's - this gave birth to everything we have found tiresome in teen comedies..because with all the overuse of slow-mo, the current soundtrack, the new tech. i wonder if cinema will go back to these roots... this is the teen comedy...yes!

"one crazy summer" is the funniest, craziest (not necessarily the best), movie i have ever seen.just when one crazy scene is done, another emerges. it never lets you rest. just one thing after another. the soundtrack is great. the songs are the right ones for the scenes.it is also a clean movie. little that is dirty in it.of course, it has the story of the guys you wouldn't trust with your lunch money, taking up a challenge, and winning over people with more resources. who'd want to see it if they failed? there is a serious side, in that parents and children do not live up to each others' dreams. one should always have an open mind, and weigh all the options. this applies both to parents and children. in "one crazy summer", the parents are wrong. this is not always the case.

i saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when it was on hbo and i loved it!! it was so hilarious i have seen it too many times to count. i love the stork brothers and the pitiful, ugly dog, bosco! my favorite quote form the movie is, "it's so ugly, it should be put to sleep." i also loved it when the little sister slaps the girls on the back and their faces stick that way. i love john cusack and demi moore in this movie too. they were great. this movie brings back memories of my college days when i first saw it. i rented the movie countless times and watched it over and over. my college roommate and i just couldn't get enough of it.who couldn't love this crazy movie?! i want to buy a copy on dvd, does anyone know where i can get it?

this is classic 80's humor. if you were a teen in the 80's this was a summer hit to go see. it was a early look at those now super stars. this and better off dead just are fun and silly movies to sit back and enjoy. everyone can admit they had a crazy summer when they were a teenager. even crazy family and friends like these characters. to be introduced to some of these characters was so much fun. the uncle who is crazy sitting every waking moment at a radio waiting to win a million dollars, the grandmother who only likes the granddaughter and handed a bill to the kids after dinner, the twin brothers who look nothing alike, and to meet hoopz was so much fun. this may not of won an award but it is just a fun movie to get lost in one afternoon.

this is the follow-up creation to better off dead. in a competition, better off dead would win hands-down. but for star power, one crazy summer outshines savage steve's better script. problems with one crazy summer (ocs): casting. better off dead (bod) was cast so much better. friendship: ocs shows cusack giving hateful looks to bill murray's little bro. trouble on the set?? more outrageous friends in ocs, but more genuine friends in bod. plot was good. you'll predict some of it, but even the predictable parts go further than you think they could. so, even though this is better off dead's ugly stepsister, it's worth a look. see demi moore before the plastic surgery if for no other reason. john cusack fans, you gotta see it, just to say you have. if you don't like bobcat golthwaite, i'm sorry. i don't like him either, but you can't escape him in this one. at least he does a great job in the film doing a tribute to another movie monster. editing needed help on the beach, but for most part, not much to complain about. overall, it's good and funny. but try not to compare it to bod or you'll find it lacking. *sigh*

i seem to notice that a lot of people have never seen this movie, and those that have usually dismiss it as garbage... that's pretty bad really.the first time i saw this movie, i admittedly was almost one of those people... thank god i'm patient, otherwise i would have never found such a classic.as goofy as this movie is, it's also a must have for anyone who is either a fan of 80's movies, or just happens to have a sense of humor.i know that there are a lot of people out there that will tell you that this movie is sort of derivative of better off dead... so what if it is? they were both excellent movies!i can honestly say that savage steve holland is a genius! 10/10

this is from much of the same creative team behind "better off dead", but is not quite as good as that amazing teen comedy. its a lot of fun, but its all over the place and just not quite as funny. curtis armstrong is used to less effect (he was incredibly funny in "better off dead", bobcat goldthwaite is hilarious, cusack is good, demi moore is demi moore (only with better hair here.) overall its fun, and as a person from cape cod, it catches the feeling of an 80s cape cod summer very effectively. for some reason, this film feels more "mainstream" than "better off dead". there isn't quite as much left field absurdity going on here. again, if you are a fan of john cusack and savage steve holland its definitely recommended.

i really love anything done by savage steve holland, the writer/director of this great movie. also see "better off dead" and "how i got into college." wonderful! anyway this movie is really humorous and delivers some unexpected things. where else but in this movie can you see demi moore as a talented singer and bobcat golthwait as a twin? i recommend this to anybody looking for some old fashioned slapstick comedy (george with the turtle raft), not to mention some really well written sarcasm (the christmas tree on the roof of the car). this movie constantly throws you unexpected things even after you've seen it 100 times like i have! enjoy!

80's comedies (especially ones with john cusak) are awesome. almost all are hillarious and instant classics and this film is no exception. plenty of nods to other films (i.e. godzilla and jaws) through out the movie that are so hillarious you'll be laughing for hours. some may complain that the movie is a little corny at times but hey it was the 80's and things were always a little cheesy. throw in a young demi moore and an even louder bob cat and you have a laughfest on your fans. if you haven't seen this, you better soon!!!!!!

one crazy summer is a fun and quirky look at love through the eyes of hoops mccann. what could have been hokey and dull is one of the freshest and most energetic comedies ever. savage steve holland reteams with john cusack to make the ultimate summer movie!

if i ever write movies or make them, i would want one of them to be like this one. i enjoy the goof-ball sense of humor and jokes contained within. this movie does stupid things without looking like it. the names of the places and characters are priceless, generic new york high school, squid calimari (george's sister), etc...genius. i've seen this movie so many times because it was a cable tv staple while i was growing up, of course i didn't get all of the jokes back than but it was still funny.this movie is a time-less classic.

john cusack stars as hoops in this silly little movie that has to be one of the best of the eighties teen comedies.believe it or not demi moore is his co star...if you love the eighties,grew up around that time,or are an angst ridden teenage artist get ready to laugh.wait until you see the cartoons..what a riot....

ok, so there's always people out there that seem to make it a point not to like movies because they're good, but instead choose to like movies based on how depressing or boring they can be, or whether they're from a foreign country. all that aside, one crazy summer is the perfect example of what a great american teen comedy should be. the jokes are a good mix of slapstick (a la bobcat goldthwait), surreal (bobcat under the inspired direction of steve holland), and dry (john cusack, one of the most morosely dry and funny actors in american cinema), and there is no character in this movie who does not deliver at least one funny line (ok, except demi moore).yes, it's immature, yes, it's screw-ball, yes, bobcat dresses up like godzilla and trashes a scale-model of a seafood restaurant. it's also funny as hell. watch it.

what can i say about this movie except that it is great fun!john cusack plays hoops mccann a recent high school graduate who has two choices, learn to take up the family business of street sweeping or spend the summer at nantucket with his pal george calamari (played hilariously by joel murray) and his zany friends.when i say zany, believe me, it can't get much zanier than the stork brothers, egg (bobcat goldthwait) and clay (tom villard) and ack ack raymond (curtis armstrong). throw in a little girl named squid and her weirdo mutt and a great performance by demi moore and you have the makings of a split your sides laughing, movie.the laughs flow freely in this movie and the story line, though the typical good versus bad and good conquers, is great with the twist of a regatta as the showdown.i would recommend this movie for anyone who likes loads of laughs and a feel good time. if you like to thoroughly *enjoy* your movies, then you can't miss one crazy summer!

it's a simple fact that there are many of us from the 80's generation who grew up loving those loopy john cusack comedies made by savage steve holland, and while i prefer there other more bizarre, out-there flick, better off dead, it's hard for me to dislike one crazy summer, a movie i grew up loving wholeheartedly as a kid into my teens. ocs was a follow-up to better off dead, returning cusack and curtis armstrong from that film. cusack is hoops, following graduation pal joel murray(george)to nantucket for the summer to each some fun on the beach. hoops finds himself embroiled in a feud with a blonde, buff punk named teddy beckersted whose lecherous father has designs on bulldozing over homes of a neighborhood to build a giant condominium. one of the homes, needing it's mortgage repaid belongs to demi moore(cassandra). there's a sailboat race which might be their only hope of saving cassandra's grandfather's home(..he had recently passed), but it has been won by teddy over the past many years, and hoops is deathly afraid of boats over water. but, with the help and motivation of newfound nantucket friends(..such as bobcat goldwait and tom villard as auto-mechanic twin brothers!), george, and budding love-interest cassandra, perhaps hoops can come to terms with his fears and win the race to save the neighborhood. armstrong has a supporting part as the son of a kooky, manic weapons salesman, general raymond(..sctv's joe flaherty in an inspired bit of casting), ack, who uses the training from his father to assist hoops and company in their goals to win the race. memorable scenes include bobcat getting stuck in a godzilla suit(!)running rampant across an entire model of aguilla beckersted(mark metcalf, barely recognizable as teddy's rather unhinged pops)'s condominium, hoops being chased by deranged cub scouts wishing to perform first aid, george a victim of toxic flatulence, bruce wagner's nutty uncle frank's increasing insanity every time he tries to better his chances to win 1 million dollars from a radio show, and the wonderful billie bird as george's grandma who actually bills the group after a meal! jeremy piven as(you guessed it)a brutish jerk who associates with teddy and causes trouble for hoops and his posse, the yummy kimberly foster as cookie(..teddy's girl who attempts to make-out with hoops while he attends a luncheon with his father), and the one-and-only william hickey as old man beckersted, who will not reward his son and grandson an inheritance if they lose the sail boat race. demi moore is cute, but this is cusack's vehicle, though bobcat and villard steal most of the scenes their in. again, some delightful animation from holland are sprinkled throughout the movie(hoops is an artist, appropriately). if you like his movies, i highly recommend the underrated, how i got into college.

affable aspiring cartoonist hoops mccann (a wonderfully engaging performance by john cusack) and his best buddy george (the deliciously deadpan joel murray) go to nantucket for the summer following graduation from high school. hoops, george, and several newfound pals come to the aid of cassandra (demi moore at her most charming), a singer who's family house is being threatened with demolition by the greedy beckersted clan. writer/director savage steve holland offers an often hilariously wacky and zesty nonstop barrage of admittedly broad and dumb, but still very funny jokes. the constant madcap lunacy has a real giddy, good-natured and infectiously inane vitality to it that's impossible to either dislike or resist. moreover, the lively and enthusiastic acting from a fine game cast adds immensely to the zany merriment: bobcat goldthwait as the spastic egg stork, tom villard as his goofy brother clay, curtis armstrong as the sweet ack ack raymond, mark metcalf as evil rich jerk aquilla beckersted, matt mulhern as the mean teddy, kimberly foster as the fetching cookie, joe flaherty as the gung-ho general raymond, william hickey as cranky old man beckersted, jeremy piven as smug preppy bully ty, and john matuszak as hulking biker stan. isidore mankofsky's slick cinematography, the hip thrashy soundtrack, cory lerios' cool rockin' score, and the funky animation are all uniformly excellent. single funniest scene: egg in a godzilla suit terrorizing a posh dinner party. an absolute hoot.

thus starts "one crazy summer", the evil twin of "better off dead..". how can any movie be bad when the opening lines are sung by david lee roth?this movie is a total blast. pairing again john cusack with curtis armstrong, but this time adding bobcat goldwaith to the mix has great, funny results. hyperactive bobcat grates the nerve of everyone around, curtis "ak ak" is the son of a deranged military with pacifist tendencies, and demi moore (with natural breasts... wow!) as the love interest of, once again, chronically depressed cusack.the story is, well, simple enough. the laughs are there, but both savage steve holland films have a certain quality to them... they are funny, but they are also sweet. the scene where curtis finds a blown up doll in the target practice beach, and begins musing about how a little girl won't be able to sleep was dumb, funny and touching. the animation used throughout is quite surreal. "the boat" is hysterical (complete with watsamatta u. sail and odie plush doll). overall, a fun film, though not as good as "better off dead..."

in the eighties, savage steve holland put out three movies, two of which are classics of what seems to be a very small genre, absurdist teen comedies. the third "how i got into college" does not measure up to "better off dead" and this one, mainly because of it's lack of john cusack and curtis armstrong (except for a tiny cameo).one crazy summer is an underrated movie, with lots of great characterizations and gags. as i recall, savage steve's movies were vilified as being brain dead at the time and after three movies he drifted into children's tv. we could use more movies from the likes of him.

when one thinks of soviet cinema, the propaganda masterpieces of eisenstein or the somber meditations of tarkovsky generally come to mind. they're great films sure, but generally not the most entertaining material out there. however, the countries within the iron curtain apparently enjoyed their escapist musicals just as much as the states had. in fact, from the 1930s up until the 70s, forty of these song-and-dance extravaganzas were released to much adoration by the public. however, they are completely unheard of in the west, so this documentary attempts to rectify that situation. it does a terrific job of both showcasing these films and putting them into the proper cultural context. despite the fact i've never been a fan of musicals, i found this documentary to be completely compelling from beginning to end. it goes to prove that, no matter how many films you manage to see in your lifetime, you're only skimming the surface of whats out there.as for the film clips themselves, they're very entertaining. while some of the musicals are blatant propaganda showing workers singing of how much they love working under the regime, some of the films (particularly the later ones) look quite accomplished from a production standpoint. plus, they are all extremely campy because of how alien they are to my western eyes. there's a few similarities between them and the american musicals i'm used to, but the presence of strict government enforcing of a message gives them a surreal edge. they certainly don't resemble the musicals made in the west. this documentary is both one of the most bizarre and entertaining films i've seen in recent memory, and its an absolute must-see for any film buff. (9/10)

east side story entertains and informs about an unknown part of cold war history. what is the purpose of any documentary? to inform the reader through commentary and footage. this one succeeds at both. you will never find many movies whose clips you get to see in here because some of them have been destroyed and some are unaccessible.you get to see and her music from musicals made in east germany, russia, and other countries under soviet control. it shows you that the people who made these movies and the people who watched them all look for same things a westerner would look for, which are pretty women and men singing and dancing on the streets with smiles and (hopefully) white teeth.

this was really one of the most enjoyable specials that i have seen on tv. he is just an incredible performer. his personality shines through in each one of the songs that he does. i really wish this was available as an uncut dvd so i could watch it over and over without the -beeps- for explicit language. i have not had the chance to see him live, but that is something that i really want to do now. i can't forget his backup singers. they really added a lot of substance and humor to the show. with their campy style, and flamboyant dance moves, they really complement the true talent of dan. i wish there were some more of the songs that are on his live cd, which is also incredible. it is refreshing to see someone like him perform. just so incredibly personable and real, i really can't say enough good things about dan and this show. once again, i just wish this was available as an uncut dvd.

i laughed my ass off for an hour. i had no idea who dan finneity was. why haven't i heard of dan finnerty before? he's hysterical and so are his backup singers. they make all of these women songs that we would never wanna hear a new experience. they blow these songs away. this was on bravo last night. why isn't this dan guy like "ultra famous"? great voice! charisma to burn! he blew me away with this show! i just read on the internet that he was once a member of "stomp" i guess there isn't anything he can't do. i saw "stomp" at a ucla theater years ago and those guys were amazing. this show last night was done by dreamworks! does that mean that spielberg did this? why don't they star this dan finnerty in a movie. there was a standing ovation at the end of this show and every time the camera's cut to the audience, everyone was so into it, singing along or dancing. the whole show had this amazing energy. my only complaint was that it was not longer, but looking back, when you see how much energy these guys put out, i guess it would be impossible for any human being to perform with such gusto for over an hour. man i loved this show!

spending an hour seeing this brilliant dan finnerty and his "dan band" perform their special on bravo is the most enjoyable hour i've ever spent watching tv. this young man (dan) is such an incredible talent, as a singer, performer and even dancer. he can go from the cheesiest of ballad pop songs, all of which have only been sung by women, to hip-hop, rock, also songs written for women.. this guy can do anything. i've seen him live at least 11 times, so i was not expecting just how well that his show would adapt to a television or film format, but all reservations went away instantly when the show started because of dan's overwhelming star quality.do yourself a favor and watch this, or better yet, buy it.

i think that gost'ya iz buduschego is one of the best russians minis for teens. i think i were near 6-8 parts of the movie. "one boy form 6th grade found a time machine in the old house where nobody lived. and he goes to the 21st century, just 100 years in future. in future he meat pirates, they tried to steal a "milafon" - machine to read minds and a story started..." soundtrack for that movie was very popular in soviet union. everybody loved that movie which was on tv every year.

guest from the future tells a fascinating story of time travel, friendship, battle of good and evil -- all with a small budget, child actors, and few special effects. something for spielberg and lucas to learn from. ;) a sixth-grader kolya "nick" gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. he discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. the device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. when two evil space pirates from saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy nick. with the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and alice. chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. alice enrolls in the same school nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in pe class. the catch is, alice doesn't know what nick looks like, while the pirates do. also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (hmm, i wonder if this is where james cameron got the idea for terminator...) who gets to nick -- and mielophone -- first? excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. i wish hollywood made kid movies like this one...

i was a schoolboy when i watched this film for the first time. the next day i knew that all pupils of our form watched it and all were fascinated by the film as i was. i think the same situation was in all forms of our school and in the whole soviet union. later i watched it every time it was shown on tv and want to watch more. i think that comparison with "back to the future" or other sci-fi films is not appropriate. "gost'ya iz budushchego" is unique in many ways, once you have watched it, you never forget it.this film is full of belief in peaceful science achievements, full of belief in the beautiful future of our world. it's not only the film, but also a forecast of many scientific inventions and achievements. the time shown in the film is the year 1984 (the year of its creation) and the year 2084 (where a schoolboy kolya gerasimov has traveled for some time and where his friend alisa seleznyova was from). the year now is 2005, many inventions and achievements predicted in the film are not realized yet. such as "mielophone" (a device, which can read thoughts of any animal and human), expeditions to venus and mars (as easy as going for a picnic in the weekend), creating and launching of the satellites as a homework for pupils, easy to drive flying machines (which completely replaced automobiles), biorobots, "historical identification" of any kind of material or creature performed in a couple of minutes, and many others. meanwhile, some of them nowadays became much more realistic than they seemed in 1984! just wait for 2084 :-)the film also depicts typical russian schoolboys and schoolgirls (and does it so naturally!). with their inventiveness, curiosity, humour, dreaminess. look for example at fima korolyov, you could find such character in nearly all forms of every school of the soviet union, similar character was in my form too! alisa seleznyova... i myself, as well as many my classmates fell in love at first sight with her! by the way, later an actress who played alisa became a scientist - i think she was as much influenced by the film as people who watched it on tv.beautiful idea, beautiful realization, beautiful actors, beautiful music, beautiful song "prekrasnoye daleko" ("the wonderful far-away")... beautiful, beautiful, beautiful...the last thing i want to say is that different remakes and "new versions" of the song from the film and even the film itself were made later and spread on tv and in the internet. all they are not even comparable with the original. i should not even comment them, my comment is only about the original. so, request the original and enjoy it!

hollywood has turned the mafia in to a production line of output ranging from the banal to the excellent and despite some good acting and a reasonable script (much of which is - for a change - true!) this "home entertainment" effort has to fall slap bang in the middle.the script is not only obvious (all of the checklist boxes end up being ticked), but spends a lot of time trying to create a pastiche of the best of other people's work. the godfather being the most obvious, but there are other references too. i won't bother naming them. nevertheless it is a good taste borrower! the producer seems to set a quota for gunshots and murder (one at least every twenty minutes?) and the ending is weak and "so what?" i am told there are various versions of this production so that maybe that is just the version i have seen.gangsters don't make money they take money. usually by fear. some seem more in to the murder and mayhem side of the business than making money. they were the ones that were the first to go (in real life and here). "you can't make money with a gun in your hand" says charlie 'lucky' luciano at one stage. one of the smarter gangsters, although all things are relative. he was a skilled white slave trader and a drug dealer before being bundled home to italy.the old school "moustached pete's" were picked off by the new bloods who wanted the power and the money for themselves and to break free of the straight jacket of italian/sicilian power (rarely doing business outside themselves). the young turk knew they needed to be allied with other groups (most notably "the jews" who knew how to launder money) and this is at least referenced and acknowledged. what isn't made so clear is that most immigrant groups had their own mafia's - but most of them made their money and went legit. and why not? who wants to die in jail?joseph bonanno was a ruthless man prepared to kill if needs be , but not an unfair or stupid one. his story was tragic in that he could have made money in the over ground world and he showed a special skill in avoiding getting killed. with a little bit of luck attached, naturally.despite the range of respectable names and three actors in the title role (bruce ramsay, martin landau and tony nardi) there isn't the charisma or the talent to bring us in and feel anything. we are - merely - passive observers in a life we are glad not to have lead. the people shown here were born in to a cruel world but their only mark was to make it crueler.if you can't get enough of the gangster genre that will be better than watching godfather 1 & 2 for the tenth time and it is even better -- as basic entertainment -- than the horrible misfire that was godfather 3.

i found parts of this movie rather slow, especially the first part; the second part seemed to go a lot faster, but it's not totally clear to me as to why one part was faster than the other. i somehow managed to find it enjoyable. the acting was good, the writing was good (yet vulgar). there was also another good side to it: it was easier to understand than say, the godfather movies. you knew who was on whose side, etc. all in all, the movie wasn't half-bad.

this movie have 4 parts and every is around 170 minutes long. its based on true story of life of joe bonanno and it is telling all how he did see. so in some events we can notice that we heard different about it. movie make you tied up for chair till the end, i think it is possible to watch all 4 in a row, and not notice i watched 2 in a row and 2 next day in a row. acting in movie is ok in some scenes awesome but in general could be bather, but this movie is not about acting or special effects and glamor, this one show real thing and story is key to this movie. so the one who look for same spectacular rambo/matrix/titanic movie you can skip this one. good thing in movie is that follow the main story so you will not have long and boring love scenes or any different interrupt with something not important to crime business of bonanno.

very well done acting and directing. this is a cross between "the last don" and " godfather 2".one large plus for this production is that it is claimed to be a true story of joseph bonanno. with a better music score to create mood, it could have been a rival for both godfather movies.

i have nothing but praise for this movie and cast, especially ann margaret. but more importantly i have praise for my in-laws who were (are) the adoptive parents of warren and frank in real life. i met most of the "children" at warren's wedding in 1989. this is an amazing story and is even more incredible to me knowing the family and what everyone went through. it is also enjoyable for me to see how my in-laws were portrayed in the movie. it was pretty accurate. my wife even enjoys seeing some little details such as a toaster that she remembered from her childhood. yes, it is a hard movie to watch, but so amazing and heartfelt.the beauty of this story for me is how many of the children passed through my in-laws lives and, as a result of marrying their daughter,and having warren as a brother-in-law, how many i have met in mine. for the past 20 years this story has been a part of my life because of what my mother-in-law has shared with me. that and knowing warren. for what it is worth, warren lives in california with his family. he married his high school sweetheart, who he reconnected with at his 20 year high school reunion.there was a show in the 1980's called "that's incredible." they had a reunion of the family who also got to meet the cast of the show.for anyone's interest, the dvd is available in great britain and australia. it is a tough video to come by here in the united states and i have not been able to find a dvd here, yet.

ann-margret did the best job she has ever done in her history of film making. i felt as if she was mrs. frey. there might be one or two films of ann-margret's i have not seen since her film debut in "pocket full of miracles" with betty davis in 1961. i feel she has been totally under-rated in the industry. though she was nominated for an emmy award for this role in "who will love my children," she was overlooked. like she was nominated for an academy award for her roles in "carnal knowledge" and "tommy," she was snubbed. over all, i think everyone did a superb acting job including all the children in "who will love my children." yes, it is a sad movie (as true stories can be), but well worth the time. thank you.

this movie is based on the true story of iowa housewife lucille fray, who got breast cancer after the birth of her 10th child. realizing that the state would take the children away from her ineffectual, alcoholic husband, she devoted the last year of her life traveling around the state to find new homes for each of the children. a terrific script - which still holds up 20 years after it was first made. the grown children, many of whom had not seen each other since their mother died in the late 50's, were reunited on "that's incredible," prior to the film's airing in 1983. barbara stanwyck won the emmy for best actress in a tv movie or mini-series, but during her acceptance speech, she went out of her way to single ann-margret out for her moving performance.

i originally saw this on its premiere in the uk. i was mesmerised by it, and it had me in tears all throughout its duration. i taped it off the tv for safekeeping, but over the years, it's worn out. and tv never seem to show it. therefore it was a joy to find out that true movies own the copyright and were showing it on their channels. this time, i taped it onto a dvd, so i can enjoy it again and again.lucile fray (played magnificently by ann - margret) discovers she has cancer, and that it is terminal. her husband has arthritis, and, although he is loving, he is an alcoholic, and would be incapable of taking care of their children after she has gone. therefore, she has to find new homes for each of her children before she dies.the acting is top notch, the music beautiful, and it has stood the test of time wonderfully (it still makes me cry!) if you ever get the chance, you would be silly to miss this. it is a wonderful film! a must see for everyone!!!

i was still living with my parents when they aired this on dutch tv. usually i was the one watching movies with the other's not caring. but somehow we all sat down and watched this movie. this kinda movie used to be aired at wednesday-evening. it is the story of a woman who'll die soon. but before she dies she wants to make sure her ( many ) kids will have the best possible foster-parents. so we were watching this and my dad ( the most emotional of the four of us) started to cry. i followed almost immediately and before long my sister and mother were teared up too. there we were, totally moved by this simple but heartbreaking story. if you want a good cry, this is the one for you!

this has to be the ultimate chick flick ever. we taped it off the t.v. years ago and i've watched it about 30 times over the years. i hadn't seen it for about 12 years and just recently watched this movie. i'm not lying, i cried from the opening credits to the ending credits. this movie truly tears your heart out, even if you don't have children.

"who will love my children" saddest movie i have ever seen. definite 10/10. released on tv in 1983. movie has been released on vhs. dvd release is a must, sooner rather than later. mother dying of cancer, must find homes for all her children before she dies, because her thoughts are that her husband and father of the kids is not capable of caring for them once she has died. she manages to find homes for the children except one, a young boy whom is not wanted because he suffers from epilepsy. very sad when your not wanted. in for a real good tear jerker, get your hands on this movie. i'm a male even i cried when i watched this movie. not to be missed.

i watched this film many years ago on tv and taped it from there i could never really understand why my own mother was upset watching it! it was because i was so young at the time. i have just sat and watched this film again i now have 2 children of my own and i had to try and fight the tears back but that didn't happen i was crying through most of the film it just go's to show how different you feel when you have children of your own! such an amazing family such a heart wrenching film truly wonderful! someone has said about 8 still living any more news are you all still in touch i would love to know! touched by the film all over!

i saw this movie when it was broadcast on television in february of 1983. i was in the hospital, having just given birth to my first and only child. i'll refrain from telling you the extent to which i was moved. suffice it to say that the memory of the movie has remained with me to this day, almost 23 years later. i hope i can find a copy of this movie, if such a thing was ever made. this movie should be remembered fondly by anyone who ever saw it. however, i must admit that the fact it remains somewhat obscure is just fine by me. this way, it will always be a small secret to me and those who were also moved by it. i never saw ms. margaret perform a better part. nor have i ever seen her in a more convincing role. i will forever respect her just for accepting such a lovely part.

who will love my children has changed my heart, it made me cry all the way through, the most i cried with was when the family had to say goodbye to the baby, i cried the most with that, and each time a child was adopted, i cried when they had to say goodbye to their mother, it was sad for them to lose their mother, i felt sorry for the kid with epilepsy, i was glad he was adopted by the same family as one of his brothers. to me that boy i thought was the special one because he was going in a home. i feel that i am special because i am in a world with aspergers syndrome and sometimes when i feel down, i sometimes like to cry. i really enjoyed this movie, 10 out of 10. a true story, very good. another movie that would bring tears to your eyes i think would haver to be tuesday's with morrie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805)

most definitely the saddest movie i have ever seen. a must see, just so you can walk away and realise just how precious your life and loves are. the acting is superb, the story line potentially 'real'.remains a firm favourite of mine even after all this time.

i was just looking up " who will love my children" to buy, when i came across this web site and an entry made by a fellow briton!! i am a great fan of this movie and would, and have, recommended it to all. what i found comforting is to find someone else who also finds comfort in the good will of others. i also have a son with aspergers (amongst other things) and it is also a fear of mine to think if anything ever happened to me and my husband, that someone would not only want to take on just my beautiful 'normal' daughter, but my special and gifted son also. missing home and being able to relate to people raised with the same values as myself has more meaning than you know. living here in the us i have yet to meet anyone who has seen this movie. so to all of you reading this, if you have not seen it, make an effort to do so. it is a very moving experience, especially for anyone who is a parent, or even if you just have a sympathetic bone in your body, you will cry, and beg. after that you will count your blessings, and to anyone who has ever been through an experience like , or close to this one, my heart goes out to you. it makes me realize no matter how hard or stressful thing get, just remind yourself that there is always someone worse off than you. an amazing movie and what makes it more powerful is the fact that it is based on a true story. do not be put off by how sad it is, at the same time this movie is heart warming, and makes you feel encouraged about the strength and goodness of mankind.

i may be a good old boy from virginia in the confederate states of america, but this man does it for me. that mustache gets me riled up. i remember when i first saw a video of his. that girl he beat was amazing. the depth of his acting when they cut to his weathered facade was a new level of masculinity. it reminds me of the granite sculptures of our mt. rushmore. if i could ask him one question, it would be,"if you were a hot-dog, would you eat yourself?" will orhan be doing a reunion tour? take note from the greats like gordon lightfoot, true music from the heart never fades away. vive la john denver. gracias my friend, o.f.f.l. (orhan fan for life)

first of all, i should point out that i really enjoyed watching this documentary. not only it had great music in it, but the shots and the editing were also wonderful. however, all these positive things about the film does not change the fact that it plays to the orientalist "east meets west" clich√© that bothers many turks like myself. okay, this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary turkish music in a very stylish manner which is a good thing, something that would show ignorant europeans and americans that this country is not just about murdering armenians and kurds. however, the problematic of the film is that it looks at what it defines as "east" from the eyes of the "west". i mean, like one jazz musician says in the film, maybe there is no east and west, maybe it is just a myth, a lie created by the ruling leaders of "western" countries in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue ruling the world and "keep the cash flowing"? why don't you think about that?

i would be interested to hear from the director, barbet schroeder, as to why he decided to make more his first film, and more specifically what his interest in hippies- or rather this form of the euro-hippie paradise- and about their demise. the film is, at least, true enough to keep one interested, but in its own kind of truth it's strange, biased. it's a given heroin (aka, "horse") is awful stuff, rotten, the conclusion for many a dumb-headed drug user that sees that as the be-all-end-all, because it basically is: after that everything else stops, that becomes the life, and it's either a continuous run for more of the same or death. more starts off as something concerning a romance between a new york girl and a german man, but it becomes something else, for better or worse (sometimes both in the same scene).it's basically about two "young" people, estelle and stefan, who meet in a city where stefan has come as a sort of wanderer away from his home country. she's wandering too, sort of, and is maybe too friendly with a big-time pusher named wolf. they end up on a remote island somewhere nearby and, after a somewhat daring grab for some "horse" by estelle, they also find a pad in the form of a seemingly remoter house along the seashore. schroeder's comment on youth and sex and drugs isn't too simplistic, which makes the film actually lucid and intelligent so many years later. it's both direct and subtle, more about the characters and then about the fact that what he's depicting could in other hands just be a propagandistic hippie-exploitation picture. perhaps most pleasantly, and this is just a guess, schroeder uses as inspiration the sort of long sequence from bergman's summer with monika: two kids in an inexorable connection, some good some definitely not so good, set against (too?) perfectly shot landscapes.on the one hand, i should mention that there are problems, some big ones in fact. the performances aren't very convincing throughout; a few scenes strike some power or have the actors in a good connection with one another, but klaus grumberg overplays himself even if he is an ornery german by nature (in that case i would've preferred klaus kinski in the part to make it crazier but deep enough for the subject matter) as does farmer to her own degree. and there's gaps of naivet√© in the screenplay that keep it from being as deep as it really thinks it is. on the other hand, there are two big things going for it: nestor almendros, the great cinematographer (i.e. days of heaven) is dp and is a big boost for a first time director like schroeder. nearly every image is seen with an awesome purpose or artistry, be it a shot of the cliffs by the sea or sun or something as simple as the seemingly natural light of a room.the other thing is pink floyd, probably the main reason i and many others have heard of the film in the first place (years before i knew really who schroeder was i saw the "more" soundtrack whenever i looked up pink floyd albums). it's very good music throughout, occasionally the mind-blowing variety that gives them the reputation they deserve. some of it, too, is a little tedious, even as it is a movie that concerns free love and lots of drugs and sometimes both at the same time. i wouldn't rank it anywhere near as high as a meddle or animals, certainly not dark side, but it too helps to elevate the subject matter another notch, particularly when one least expects it or in low tones or floating in and out of buildings as stefan or other walks on the streets. it's almost better atmosphere than the movie itself deserves, but overall more is still worth watching as a period piece- dated, but potent, like a less ambitious but more substantial zabriskie point.

a german freshman, stefan hitch hikes to paris during summer break were he falls for a mysterious young woman he meets in the paris freak scene. he then follows her in the famous isle of ibiza, the hippie joint were meets wolf, a man who throws hitler-jugend knives, owns bars and hotels and keeps estelle under his thumb with dope. the couple tries to escape wolf, stefan gets hooked with dope and jealousy for estelle, who's groovy and a free spirit. great photography and music, plot is quite usual for the period but it's not an exploitation kind of movie, cold and dramatic. the moral is quite strong (he was looking for the sun...) but i would not say it's a film against drugs even it puts enphasy on drug use.

"more", maybe, is mostly remembered for the excellent soundtrack composed by pink floyd -in 1969 they weren't superstars yet. actually they made an album with the film music, no fan can miss it!but this is also the first film of german-french director barbet schroeder: it's a cult movie. when it was released, censorship everywhere cut several scenes of sex and drugs. it is also one of the first films to treat explicitly the theme of drug slavery.a german boy travels to paris and meets an american girl: they fall in love. together they search for sun and exoticism. but it's a too high price love: she initiates him into drugs.in the sixties anti-drug campaigns were not like today, there wasn't much information. on the contrary, in many milieus taking drugs was a sort of spiritual experience... so it's quite surprising to see a film of that period which describes a nightmarish heroin experience.the film is simple, not vulgar at all and shot in a "cinema-verit√©" style. actors mimsy farmer and klaus gr√ºnberg are very convincing. "more" is a document of the end of the sixties -and a document of the end of the hippies illusions as well.

like most people, i was interested in "more" solely because of the pink floyd soundtrack, which has turned out to be the only pink floyd album that i still listen to after all these years. it was quite a surprise to run across the film in a local video store, in a digitally remastered version. it was an even bigger surprise to find that it is a pretty good movie.visually it is quite beautiful, especially when the two main characters are cavorting on the rocks on the spanish island of ibiza. and the use of the soundtrack music, which as far as i can tell is exclusively by pink floyd, is excellent. it was a joy to watch the film with my copy of the album alongside me, mentally ticking off each track as it was used in the film. dave gilmour's brief "a spanish piece" was the only one i didn't hear, and several tracks are used quite prominently, especially "cymbaline," "main theme," and "quicksilver." that latter track is tedious on the soundtrack album but works very well during the title sequence of the film, resurfacing at least once later on. maybe now i can appreciate it on the album, now that i have some visuals to accompany it in my mind.the plot of "more" is a little hard to take at times, especially in the early going, when the film appears to be merely a vehicle to demonstrate the hipness of those involved in making it. but eventually the film proves that it has much more than that to offer, as the plot becomes more focused. why does stefan take heroin? why does anybody take heroin, fully knowing the possible consequences? the film does not attempt to answer that question directly, but stefan's heroin use seems a logical extension of his single-minded pursuit of pure pleasure.i strongly recommend this film to any pink floyd fan who has an appreciation of the vastly underrated "more" soundtrack. i also recommend it to anyone who has an interest in sixties counterculture and how it was portrayed in the media. i have no idea how realistic this movie is, since i am too young to have experienced the sixties firsthand, but it does seem to capture the spirit of the times in a way that no other movie does.

has there ever been an angel of death like mimsy farmer in barbet schroeder's 1960s heroin opus? sort of jean seberg with a hypodermic. pink floyd score. despite some ultimately insignificant weaknesses, a classic, shamelessly ripped off by erich segal/noel black for their inept jennifer on my mind (1971), although tippy walker, playing a similar character, is herself very junkie-appealing in the latter mess. more, though, is terrific, a great 60s drug movie and, simply, an important document of its time. very much a cult film so join the cult.no american movie then, as far as i can remember, charts the same territory. mimsy's an astonishing archetype, elevating this into mythic realms. not for the faint-hearted. great sex scenes too.

there has been a political documentary, of recent vintage, called why we fight, which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation. it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq. yet, a far more famous series of films, with the same name, was made during world war two, by hollywood director frank capra. although considered documentaries, and having won oscars in that category, this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop, more in the vein of leni reifenstal's triumph of the will, scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes. that said, that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries (such as the bbc's lauded the world at war) lacked, nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable. they are skillfully made, and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store, i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase. i chose goodtimes dvd's four dvd collection of the series.rarely has something free been so worth invaluable. while there are no extras on the dvds, and the sound quality of the prints varies, these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago, when racism was overt (as in many of the classic warner brothers pro-war cartoons of the era), and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts. the seven films, produced between 1942 and 1945, are prelude to war, the nazis strike, divide and conquer, the battle of britain, the battle of russia, the battle of china, and war comes to america.overall, the film series is well worth watching, not only for the obvious reasons, but for the subtle things it reveals, such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars, rather than the modern singular, or the most overused graphic in the whole series- a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria. yet, it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars. the lesson of world war one (avoid foreign entanglements) was not applicable to world war two, whose own lesson (act early against dictatorships) has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since: korea, vietnam, nor iraq. the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today's information-clogged times. it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today, but at least you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position, nor will you be the last.

with all of mainland europe under his control hitler prepares for the last obstacle in his way before heading for north america, great britain. with an overwhelming edge in aircraft goering's luftwaffe looks unstoppable on paper. once in the air however the raf tenaciously disrupts the paradigm by blowing the enemy out of sky air at a seven to one rate. the battle of britain rages on for a over a year as the island nation is bloodied but unbowed providing crucial time for their american allies to produce more arms for the inevitable struggle. using more staged footage than the three previous documentaries in the why we fight series the battle of britain has a more propaganda like feel to it with the dramatized (some with unmistakable warners music score ) scenes glaringly obvious to newsreel. in an ironic twist amid the devastation caused by german air attacks beethoven's seventh symphony is employed to underscore the visual suffering. the story itself is one of remarkable courage by a defiant nation who refused to buckle under to the devastating attacks inflicted upon it by up until that point an invincible war machine. it is the 20th century version of the 300 spartans.there have been more exhaustively researched and better looking commercial efforts done on this battle since this film but the immediacy and motivation the battle of britain provided then will always make it a more valuable document of england during its "finest hour".

britain and france declared war on germany in 1939, but by then, almost all of europe had fallen under the advance of the nazi war machine. entering the war, britain virtually started from scratch, with scarce supplies and with an air force that was outnumbered by germany ten to one. but the will of the brits was firm, emboldened by their new prime minister winston churchill who declared - "we shall never go under".on august 8, 1940, the battle for britain was on. however for the first time since hitler's declared stance to conquer the world, he hit a wall. though massively outnumbered, the british royal air force went on the offensive, and in the span of twenty eight days in september and october of 1940, german luftwaffe casualties climbed to two thousand three hundred seventy five lost planes and crew. hitler's rage was seething, but he had to call a momentary time out. responding later in the year, hitler launched a massive fire bombing of london on christmas day of 1940. when i say that there has never been a disaster movie to rival the real live footage of london in flames during this assault would be an understatement. perhaps the most surreal effect of this chapter in the "why we fight" series would be seeing british citizens emerge from their underground shelters following the bombing raids to resume what was left of their life above ground. even as you watch, there is no way to comprehend the living horror these people must have gone through, as the city of london was left in virtual ruin.yet the nazis were stunned and stymied as well. everything hitler wanted to believe about freedom and democracy was now turned on it's head. instead of being weak willed and complacent like the french, the british were not going to give up without a fight. and fight they did, taking the air battle to germany and responding in kind with attacks on the german homeland. it was a turning point, forcing hitler to rethink his strategy.

the frozen limits is a big screen vehicle for the artists known as the crazy gang. they were a group of british entertainers who formed in the early 1930s. in the main the group's six men were bud flanagan, chesney allen, jimmy nervo, teddy knox, charlie naughton and jimmy gold. hugely popular in the variety halls the group were also darlings of the then royal family. the plot here sees them as the wonder boys troupe who set off to seek their fortunes in alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper. only problem is is that when they finally get to red gulch it turns out they are 40 years too late!i often cringe when i see the statement "it's very british" because it implies that those not of the british isles may struggle to get it. the reason it bothers me is because in this www/internet age i have garnered a ream of non british film loving friends who have been known to split their sides at the best of ealing, will hay and the imperious terry-thomas. so, then, is it true that something such as the frozen limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non british audience? well yes it's true, so much here is topically british, but really it has to be said that the classic movie fan is pretty well versed in history, and when all is said and done the visual mirth here is universal. with the anarchic "not" so wild west make over an absolute winner. a winner that has every chance of being more appreciated by an american audience now than it will be by a british audience. not all the comedy works, and in truth the "big 6" are trumped big time by a film stealing moore marriott. but there are skits and parodies here that deserve respect and a nod of approval from more illustrious comedy acts. you are unlikely to nearly fall off your chair like i did because of an ovaltine gag, but if you be a classic comedy film fan? i feel sure that you will at the worst acknowledge there's some very talented people at work here.now then, dose the mounties always get their man? 8/10

i quite this anne rice book adaption. while most of the film is filmed here in australia it offers a great amount of scenery and a fantastic area to shoot in. lestat (stuart townsend) has recently woke up from a long period time of sleep and has decided to betray his vampire oath by revealing himself to a band. when he becomes a popular movie icon his fellow vampires, understadebly, go mad and plot his death. meanwhile jesse (marguerite moreau) a orphaned member of the supernatural studies, who has an ancient vampire family tree, has become deeply obsessed with lestat. her boss david (paul mcgann) understands her obsession and revaeals his obsession with the vampire marius, (vincent perez)who is an ancient vampire and the man who made lestat a vampire too. jesse is given lestats diary and reads of his first killing and an encounter with the queen of the damned- akasha (aaliyah). when lestat holds a concert in death valley he receives news that not only will angry vampires be there akasha may come as well. meanwhile akasha has other plans. she goes to a vampire coven, a bar, and kills everyone in her path. with lestat tempted with royality and loving care by akasha the ancient vampires consisting of marius and jesses aunt maharet (lena olin) plot against them. join her or die?i thought the film was fantastic, it had great fight scenes, great music and great locations. aaliyah sadly passed away in a plane crash shortly before the films premiere, but she looked stunning on the set and off the sets.i gave this film 10/10 because it was a fantastic film and i urge you to see it!

personally, i loved tris movie! my best friend told me about it so i rented it out a watched it. it's amazing! the music, the acting, the story lines the emotion, everything...... well except for one minor fact. absolutely no loyalty to the books at all. i saw this movie before interview with the vampire and before i even knew the books existed, so i was shocked to find how many people actually hated the movie. i picked up quickly that the book fans weren't at all happy with the unfaithfulness, not wanting to be hypocritical (i hate the harry potter movies due to lack of book loyalty)i stayed silent. eventually i picked up "the vampire lestat" and understood immediately why everyone hated it. it is completely different (the movie queen of the damned is a combination of "the vampire lestat" and "the queen of the damned"). but i still loved the movie from when i saw it before reading any of the books. so if you haven't seen this movie or read the book watch the movie first or you'll hate it. if you have read the book then you have every right to hate this movie.

***may contain spoilers*** ok, it wasn't exactly as good as expected in fact it was a lot different than i had thought it would be but it still turned out to be a pretty good movie.i usually don't care too much for that type of music but in this movie it worked perfectly (i mean duh he's a rock star) but anyway i loved stuart townsend in this, and aaliyah, although she had a small part in the movie was amazing.and even though tom cruise played lestat in the interview with a vampire, i have to admit that i am glad he turned down the role even though i normally hate when they use different people to play the same characters in like sequels and stuff.overall, the movie was great and i enjoyed watching it, even if there were parts that could have been better. great vampire movie.

i have to say this movie is absolutely amazing. i don't understand why it got such a low rating. it has romance, music, darkness and vampires. also stuart townsend did a great job of being lestat, the acting was great. also, normally i am not into that music, well sometimes. but i have to say in this movie the music fit it perfectly. if you like dark movies about vampires this is definitely for you or even if you don't there is a love story to this.but,all i can say is one word: amazing! my rating is defiantly: 10 out of 10. anyway, i seriously suggest you watch it. i remember not seeing this for years, i watched it again about a year ago and im addicted to it again. lol. great movie!!!

okay... first to anne rice book fans....sure lestat's eyes are not blue...sure he isn't blond in this movie... but even though marius is not lestat's maker...even though they completely altered the story.....how can u say its not a good movie..this movie...is the best vampire movie i ever saw...and lestat is pictured perfectly in it....maybe not his features...but i don't think one can find a better lestat....the way he speaks...and the way he looks at mere mortals...his arrogance..and sheer love for fame is pictured flawlessly.if u for once...consider it just a movie..and not try and relate every scene to the book...u will love the movie as much as i do.now...to the non readers..be prepared to fall absolutely in love with this movie....it has every thing....and the goth music...is like an added treat... the dialogues...are beautiful...and catching...and even though its a vampire movie..u will find yourself smiling...at the wit of the characters...and u will find yourself sympathizing with the vampires..overall...one of my fav movies...!!10/10

i remember disliking this movie the 1st time i saw it, but it has grown on me. i love the costumes and poses the actors make, the humor, the cinematography, the soundtrack. the scenes are very rich, and it moves very quickly. every time i watch it, there is something new that catches my eye. aaliyah as akasha is probably the only thing that ruins it, but not enough.also, the lestat in this movie is different, it is not the same character. you can see that the character armand has been given lestat-like qualities because i'm assuming anne wanted it in. but there is no reason to trash this movie just because it's not like books, it's a fascinating by itself.

this has been one of the best vampire movies that i have seen in a long time. it was very seductive and alluring, i liked that it did not have the usual gore and carnage that comes along with most vampire movies. the music was excellent. it would be great if there was a sequel.

"queen of the damned" is one of the best vampire movies i had ever seen! the movie had suspense, action, and gore. the combination of the fierce demanding attitude of the queen and the rock mood of our star, very well acted by stuart townsend, makes a wonderfully done movie that only this combination can create. i'm always the one to give advice to my friends and family members on which movies are worthy of renting and when they ask me if "queen of the damned" is worthy, i tell them it's worthy of buying. this movie is most for sure a must-have in all horror movie lovers' homes!

after going to sleep out of sheer loneliness, lestat wakes from a 100-year sleep to the sounds of a new music he wants to be a part of and the band "the vampire lestat" is born. his longing to end his loneliness and his "living in the light" attitude along with his music, anger his fellow vampires and awaken an evil that has been slumbering for thousands of years.this film is not for those looking for a true book-to-film adaptation. those who have read the books and expect to see it on the screen are in for a huge disappointment. this film will appeal to those who really enjoyed the "interview with the vampire" film.there are a few plot holes and incongruencies, but as a whole, this film was satisfying. stuart townsend portrays lestat with a sensuality and sexiness lacking in the previous film. the relationships portrayed in the film were very sexy and sizzling.as a film, the story compels you and draws you in. casting is wonderful. loved this story and film. if you like simmering sensuality and sexual tension you'll love this film!

i thought that this was actually the best vampire movie that i've ever seen. i've seen a lot too. the effects were great, and the casting was brilliant. it was an all around good movie. the makeup and costumes were great too. i would recommend it, but not for kids. it's not a children's movie.

the movie, although not faithful to the original novels, succeeds in creating modern gothic vampire vision. somebody tried to insult qotd calling it a 1,5h music video clip. actually it is a complement. the everpresent gothic music combined with the music-video-like shots made the movie so moody - and "queen of the damned" is a mood-driven story.i do not understand the die hard fans who complain on the modifications of the story. the plot has been modified to be less confusing for viewers who do not know the novels. the number of characters had been lessened and i have no problems with changing lestat's maker or skipping mekare's character. the biggest change - the romance of lestat and jesse - seemed a very nice addition to me.actually, i think that a faithful adaptation would be a complete failure. the slow and gloomy mood, that was perfect to xixth century new orlean and louis's angst, wouldn't fit lestat's rebellion and his music. and while the book can be slow, descriptive and combining multiple elements yet conveying them well, the movie simply cannot do it without turning chaotic. "vampire lestat" and "queen of the damned" can be split into at least three movies - the creators had to choose something.some of the special effects, like the flying or walking out of the flames were the only thing i actually didn't like in this movie. but akasha's death was very nice. the cast was good, stuard townsend was convincing as lestat, especially on the concert, but i preferred banderas as armand. i loved jesse, maharet and marius though. and of course aaliyah was perfect with her quasi-ancient-egyptian accent.so if you are into gothic music and vampiric dillemas of loneliness and eternity (and you don't consider books to be movie scenarios) "queen of the damned" is one of the few movies which show vampires as something more than blood sucking monsters. but please do not compare it to the "interview" movie. it has a completely different style, precisely as much different as different were louis and lestat. personally i find it thrilling first to watch a vampire's existence from louis' "bottled hunger" point of view, and then switching to one devoid of all morals but surprisingly outgoing for a vampire, lestat.i'd give "queen" 8 of 10 as it had some technical flaws, but i decided to give it 9 as it's vastly underrated by people who hate it simply because it didn't match their vision of the books, which can be clearly seen by looking at the votes breakdown.

despite the pans of reviewers, i liked this movie. in fact, i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat (stuart townsend) better than cruise's attempt. all the major players from the series were present: talbot, lestat, armand, maharet, khayman, pandora, mael, marius and a half-dozen more (albeit most of them in cameo). marius, lestat and akasha were the main players (and jesse of the talamasca). also, despite other reviews, i think this movie and the music was faithful to anne rice's portrayal and ethos, at least as i perceive it. aailiyah was pretty good as akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene). the movie didn't capture the breadth of the books series but i thought it was a nice supplement.i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style, sensitivities and treatments. and i found this movie a faithful and often superlative representation of the author's vision.

it has very little to do with the books: half of the characters have been eliminated, the plot has been greatly altered, people's parents are changed for different characters . . .however, if you watch it as an independent piece (try and forget you ever read the books) the movie is very well put together, everyone is very good looking, and there is even a sweet ending...

i've seen this movie countes times now and still can't get sick of it. it's like a frickin' drug. i know a lot of people don't like it but there's something about it that just draws me in. every single performance is spectacular, but aaliyah is the one who steals the show. she not only played the role of akasha she became it. her body movement and beauty was captured exceptionally well. it's also nice to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an egyptian queen (no, i'm not predjudice against white people, i am one). true it's not known what color the ancient egyptians really were but this was a nice change. stuart townsend completely made me forget about tom cruise's portrayel of lestat and marguerite was striking once again. all in all it was a good time at the movies. for those who haven't seen it, be sure to watch it with an open mind and not take it too seriously. i mean, it's a movie about a vampire who becomes a rock star. take it as that.

although this movie doesn't have the darkness of the books, it is in my opinion a great movie. it's great campy fun with the beautiful stuart townsend as lestat. he may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, but to be fair, he would not look good with blond hair, and lestat is most definitely about looking good. he moves like the predator i always imagined lestat would have. the visual effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. it's not interview with the vampire, so don't try to compare the two. interview is louis' story. this is a cut and paste version of lestat's. in any case, i highly recommend.

despite a few acceptable adaptations of the books' main themes, queen of the damned/the vampire lestat did not stay true to anne rices's complicated story telling. the deep layers that build up all the characters were shredded apart to only their surface, if not a completely different identity. the chronological order of the major events in the movie seemed warped and uneven.however, there were quite a few things the movie did to deserve my rating of 7. one was that the film strongly captured the affect that lestat (among other vampires)had to the public, especially young girls. the movie also did a fairly good job focusing on the importance of heredity and history that the vampires took pride in. the scenes of sensuality were also atmospherically satisfying.the acting in queen of the damned was moderate, if disappointing. stuart townsend and aaliyah have a surprising chemistry, though it only shows when the acting is at its best (not very often). the characters are nothing compared to the ones established in interview with a vampire. it also lacks the emotional intelligence of the feast of all saints, which is a shame because rice's queen of the damned book had that, and more.this movie doesn't give all that it appears to be. the effects are dull and very disappointing. the extravagance needed in many scenes is not given, and the dialog is tiring. the settings for many scenes are not how i pictured them in the book, and i think that many of them weren't even taken from the story. there are only a few areas of incoherence near the beginning and middle of the movie, but it wraps itself up fairly neatly, giving the viewer a full story (if they had not read the book).somethings that i feel the movie needed include a good original score (howard shore or elmer bernstein), instead of the mix of rock music; though i had no problem with some of the songs. another thing that would have made the movie better is better set direction. the scenery was boring as well as unclear, which is important in a story that moves around quite frequently.overall, queen of the damned was an unevenly disappointing yet somewhat satisfying adaption of the important novel. with a few simple changes, it may have been a very successful piece of film work. i'd recommend this movie for people who has seen interview or have read the books, so that they can make their own opinion on the adaption.

if vampire tales are your cup of blood, then this goth-fest based on the anne rice vampire chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience. a veritable consortium of the undead in a contemporary setting, `queen of the damned,' directed by michael rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness, and of the unfortunate souls who dwell therein for eternity.	the vampire lestat (stuart townsend), bored with a world that no longer excites him, has been `asleep' for many years; but suddenly, the sounds of that world he hears from his extended slumber change, and liking what he hears, he ventures forth to investigate. what he finds is a world filled with new sounds, a new kind of music-- driving and penetrating-- sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome. and he knows that at long last his time has come, that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms. toward that end he becomes the front man for a band-- a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known. he presents himself as a vampire, and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond london (where it all begins), and will ultimately take him to death valley, california, where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced.	lestat is powerful, without question, but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them, one of whom is marius (vincent perez), a vampire powerful in his own right-- the vampire, in fact, who `made' lestat so many years before-- and they are gathering, coming together and making their plans to meet lestat at the concert. and they are not going for the music. but there is something else, as well: at one point lestat has inadvertently awakened the `mother' of them all, the most powerful of all the vampires, akasha (aaliyah), who is about to make her presence known to all, and especially to the one she has chosen to rule by her side as her king: lestat. and at the concert, rest assured, akasha will be in attendance, without fail.	make no mistake, this is lestat's story, and rymer presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments, though his film has less bite to it than say, `interview with the vampire,' or `bram stoker's dracula.' he sets a good pace, and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills, but overall the film isn't as soaked in menace as it could be, or as much as one might expect. in the final tally, in fact, the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual blood-letting, though there is more than a taste of gore, and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff. there's some good f/x on hand, too, especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires, as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern. it's a decent job by rymer, but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by lestat; as it is, you get a sense of his detachment, but not enough to get you totally involved.	in `interview with the vampire,' tom cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of lestat, but townsend is even more effective, with a look and an attitude that captures lestat perfectly. he plays him with a sense of acceptance, and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing. it's a good performance, and one that sells his character convincingly.	as marius, vincent perez does a nice job, too-- he is, in fact, one of the strengths of the film-- though his character is a bit ambiguous; that, however, has more to do with the way he was written than with perez's performance, which is quite good. 	turning in noteworthy performances, as well, are marguerite moreau, as jesse, a young woman too curious for her own good; and the gorgeous lena olin as maharet, jesse's aunt, who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving lestat and akasha.	and as akasha, aaliyah is an absolutely riveting presence. what more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer, with tremendous talent and beauty. and, tragically, she has left us much too soon.	the supporting cast includes paul mcgann (david), christian manon (mael), claudia black (pandora), bruce spence (khayman), matthew newton (armand), tiriel mora (roger) and megan dorman (maudy). with a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre, anne rice fans, especially, will be pleased with `queen of the damned,' a film nicely crafted and delivered by director rymer and his engaging cast. by focusing attention on the drama of the story-- and the way it's presented-- rather than concentrating on merely providing some cheap thrills, rymer has succeeded in turning out a true horror film that is definitely a cut above, and one that just may whet your appetite for more of the same. and that's the magic of the movies. i rate this one 7/10.   

surface is one of the greatest t.v. series i have seen. the acting is great and the storyline enthralling. each episode left me barely able to wait to watch the next. i especially thought carter jenkins who played miles bennett did a superb job...he is a very talented actor and i look forward to seeing more of his work. i can't believe surface only made one season...once again the public has let me down. it is hard to fathom that a great shows like this one would get canceled, while crap reality shows continue on year after year. whoever made the decision to cancel this show really dropped the ball on this one.

once again, there's dastardly government agencies stopping at nothing to prevent public knowledge of some momentous events. in this case, the discovery of a new underwater species that could threaten the planet's ecology. although the creature is no e.t. he does seem to befriend one youngster, who protects it at all costs, not realising it is but an infant of the species and is going to get a lot bigger ¬ñ and badder this 2005 series had a lot going for it. it is family drama, sci-fi, thriller with more than a few comedic moments. the characters are believable, well acted and well photographed. the show holds the attention. of course, as with any sci-fi show, suspension of disbelief has to be achieved. and i think it is here. alas, the series crashed after season one, so we never get a resolution. infuriating.. there is a general comment i feel worth making here. many tv networks and/or film distribution companies cancel, quite arbitrarily, seemingly excellent tv series ¬ñ particularly intelligent sci-fi ones. now there may be some very good reasons for this, although the audiences are treated with utmost disdain and rarely told the reasons. this in itself is annoying. what really gets my goat is that, having cancelled the series, they then issue the thing as far as it's got, on dvd, in an obvious attempt to milk the cash cow as far as possible. for previous viewers of the series that's ok, they know what they're in for but ¬Ö many of these unfinished series end on a cliffhanger. two that come to mind immediately are "surface", and "odyssey 5". if you've heard good things about the series and not seen it you go and buy the blasted dvd and end up with an unresolved plot issue ¬ñ it makes me very angry!! i enjoyed "surface" immensely and didn't realise the poor characters would end up in a situation that looked totally untenable ¬ñ and we'll never know what happened next. i believe that there should be a prominent notice on all such dvd issues, to the effect that the story is unfinished. nowadays i check on tv series purchases (imdb is an obvious excellent starting point) to find out whether a 'complete' series is really complete or not. buyer beware.

surface was one of the few truly unique shows on tv last season. i can honestly say i modified my schedule so i could be home to watch every episode. tons of action, suspense, science fiction, etc.story was of a boy who found an egg that hatched into a sea creature. the same sea creature that had killed the main character's brother and the woman character (oceanographer) had seen. most people think it is a deadly killing machine but the one raised from the egg was very friendly.only problem is nbc canceled it so now we'll never know what happens... hopefully sci-fi or some other channel will pick it up.

i have now seen the whole of season one and can say i have not enjoyed a show of this standard in a long time it great to see a show like this in the pipeline and hope that there are many on the way the season final was the best bar none cant wait for season 2 as far as i am conserned things can only get better like how will milles continu to change will rick get his family back and how will they get off the church roof with acting of this level it is easy to see why the show is such a big hit with people as long as people as making shows like this i will keep watching i think its hard now to come up with an original idea as so many shows have coverd a large range of subjects so to see one as original as this is refreshing

i thought this was a very good tv series and i would like to see it continue. it really got interesting there at the end and i really want to see where it is going from there. some times we are to quick to kill a series without giving it a chance. i think this one needs a chance to go on, and i will definitely be waiting for it. the ocean is one of the places that man knows so little about and i think that is a mystery in itself. what is waiting for us beneath the waters of the world. it is even said that man maybe crawled out or slivered out of the waters many millennium ago. is this a new evolution coming about? are we going to move down the food chain or fight for our position?

a new and innovative show with a great cast that keeps you on the edge of your seat. lake bell is wonderful..it is to bad that her other show "miss match" was canceled. i am just glad she came back on "surface". i can't wait for the return of "surface". this show is really something unique to watch. with an eerie underwater world that is akin to jurassic park, this show keeps you wondering what is next. nim is adorable even if he is going to turn into something larger and much more ominous. there are so many generic shows out there that just seem to rehash the same old subjects. when something like "surface" comes along you just have to say "thank you!".

this is the first sci fi series that i have seriously become hooked on since star trek, (and i haven't watched trek in years). it takes the invasion theme in somewhat different directions, but has done it in a very exciting way. it also borrows from soap opera format, where it continues the arc throughout the entire year run of the series. the cgi definitely doesn't overcome the plot or the characters, except for nim, the fledgling creature who is a pet with definite attitude. (anything that would show what he really thought about the neighbor's yippy dog is a-1 in my book.) he was a stroke of genius. i am left at the end of the finale asking questions (intelligent ones, i hope) and crossing my fingers and toes that nbc or someone else (sci fi, maybe) will continue to run the series and answer those questions. a really great, classy show.

i am sorry to see that surface has not been picked up for the nbc 2006-2007 season. i guess market demand for inane game and reality shows on broadcast television, a reflection on our sense of culture, has conquered a good story. i hope and pray that some network picks it up so it will continue on as does stargate and it's spin-offs.i also hope the producers find a venue where they can produce the level of post production they wished for in a tv guide interview. right now the reruns on sci-fi, marathons, will have to do. i for one would love to see where the story goes after the tsunami that ended episode 15. i would like to find out the mastermind of the efficient effort to obfuscate the real identity of the creatures.fyc morningbear

surface was awesome, i don't know how many mondays i survived at school just by thinking about the new episode of surface. i loved it, sometimes i had to call home and tell my mom to tape it for me. i was pretty upset when i heard it was cancelled, i mean jeez way to let us hang. so,they can have their new tina fay comedy(you couldn't pay me to watch that, i think seeing the commercials made me dumber). i'm gonna miss my monday night fix of surface, even if my sister did make fun of me. although,kidnapped does look good and, they still have l&o: svu (i think, i still have to check) (i only wrote the 2 lines above, because they said i needed ten lines).

surface, from the day its teaser first showed in the summer of 2005, was a tossup. on one hand, it seemed so high-concept and plot driven that to the passerby it felt like it would work out better as a motion picture (or several). plus, it felt like it was nbc's attempt at a "lost-killer". on the other hand, one may have realized that the story was too expansive to tell in a movie or two, and fans of lost seemed intrigued.so, after one (and possibly only) season on nbc, the show is on an indefinite hiatus that could either put it in the vault, on sci-fi, or filling a gap in nbc's lineup in the summer or fall of 2007 or beyond. its ratings were some of the better on the network (which isn't saying much), but the show has been taken off the air with no real official announcement of its future.so, is it worthwhile? yes.surface follows a continuing story format, driven by plot with next to no filler episodes. almost everything that happens on the show is important to the plot, much like a motion picture. no filler episodes, which put a pain in your side when you missed an episode. yet, the show's double-edge helped made up for that; big things seem to happen every episode, but since it feels like a movie you end every episode feeling like little happened and you're left wanting more! that trait of the show, though shows how great it is. the cast is solid; the three main leads, including the beautiful lake bell as laura daughtery, put in a solid performance every episode, each driven by their own reasons for finding/studying the creatures. the supporting cast, including ian anthony dale and the brief performance by rade serbedzija fill out the cast well. the story is slow to start (my one regret; it doesn't really pick up until a 3-4 episodes in to the short 15-episode season), but the latter half of the season makes up for it. the visual effects are stunning (one's jaw will drop when you see an overhead view of one of the creatures 'attack' a ship), as well.many of the show's problems can be remedied by purchasing the complete first season and not having to wait a week (or three) to watch the next episode.in short, if you've missed the first season and you're curious, go back and watch it. it's no twin peaks in terms of quirkiness, but the high-concept nature of it puts in in league with that, lost, and other similar shows, with a flair for action and adventure. enjoy it.

all i can say after watching the dvds of the first season is that i can not believe nbc "green-lighted" this show. it's so different than what's currently in vogue save for lost. those who miss the x-files just may have a worthy successor. not as mysterious or intense as lost, i find it to be overall more entertaining.this kind of extended story is hard to make. i mean it could degenerate into childish dribble if most of the elements do not cohere together. but cohere they do and i think the cast is excellent, the writing sharp, the location and props first rate, and the special effects very good for a television budget. sure it pushes what is plausible, but as it does it never gets so silly as to insult your intelligence.bottomline is that this is great sci-fi drama for the entire family. i doubt it will be a classic with a long run like x-files, but in the meantime i recommend getting the dvd if you missed it like i did the first time around. this fall my must see shows has just increased by one more series!ps: i just heard it got axed from nbc...here's hoping sci-fi picks it up.

this show has an amazing plot with good and recognizable actors (like the girl from boston legal and boris the butcher from snatch). even the extras and the kid, whom i thought from the commercial might be a weak link, surprised me with his skill. it's just the little things that the director needs to tweak. like the guy who does the recap of the last episode at the beginning of each new episode needs to be fired. having a narrator tell you what happened kind of ruins the story. the only other small problem i had was that sometimes they take too long to do things, but no where near as long as some shows like prison break. anyone know when they will resume the season??

i am new at this, so bear with me please. i am a big fan of surface. i thought the script and the computer graphics were exceptional, as good as any sci fi flick i've seen at the theater. in february the tv guide said season finale, the announcer for the show said something to the effect of, "...and now for the season finale of surface." season finale, not series finale! i couldn't wait for fall to get here, to see was going to happen next. so fall gets here and it's nowhere to be found! if nbc isn't going to pick it up, what about sci fi or usa? it seems to me that bay watch didn't last long on abc & then usa picked it up, and it went gang busters! (i bet abc was chocking) ha! if not a series, then at least a mini series, to give all us loyal fans closure. what happened to our guy's trapped in the church steeple? was the creature in the chaple nim? did he have a grouth spert? does the cloned guy come over to our side? there are so many unanswered questions. thank's for listening to me babble!

i would like if they brought back surface. i really enjoyed the show along with my family. i felt the plot development and storyline were first rate. like the other person said, it seems that everything gets reduced to the lowest common denominator. nothing but bland, politically correct junk survives. just look at the internet to see how many people were watching the show. also it is not nice to leave us hanging as to what happened the all of the characters on the show. this is the same thing that happened to the time travel show i think was called 8 days but should have been called backstep. did the olympics kill surface? i know the writers strike killed another one of my favorite shows years ago called greatest american hero.

when i started watching "surface"for the first time i was hooked.it had everything i wanted in a show suspense,action,mystery,great plot,and a great cast of characters.my whole family loved to watch the show.it seems when there's a great show on tv the network usually cancels it like they seemed to do with this show.they go by the nielson rating system which i think is stupid because there is a lot of junk that they seem to watch which the networks keep on the air.if only there was a way for everyone to vote on a show then maybe the good shows won't get canceled.when i watch tv now i only watch good shows so right now thats not watching a whole lot of tv.i hope that the network brings the show back but when they make up there mind with a dumb decision they seem to stick to it.i hope there's a lot of people out there that feel the same way.

i enjoy the show surface very much. the show is very entertaining and it's a clean show. a show like surface is interesting. it keeps my attention. it has compassion and suspense. i love all the cast members that are on the show. they are all very good choices. i think it is very important to have the right cast of any show because thats what makes any show a success and of course the scenes and the show itself. television has changed so much over the years. it has changed in good ways and in bad. i love to watch some comedy,action, suspense and romance. and scifi. but surface is a show that i hope comes back for many seasons because it is a great show and its something that families can watch. my children are grown, but my husband and i enjoy watching these types of shows. i appreciate your time and letting me comment my opinion. thanks.paulette blackwell

i don't believe it sixty percent of voters voted this show as ten now how the hell is the rating a five point eight it impossible i don't get it, its totally pathetic i mean how. anyway the show is great the story is great and the characters are interesting, definitely a ten out of ten from me i think the creatures are cool they look great and i wish i had a nimrod great show great cgi hope there's a second series as a lot went unanswered in the first season and when is nimrod gonna get any bigger as the rest of the creatures are huge, again why is the rating so low when the votes were so high 10/10

someone asked why it was canceled i tell you why because "reality" makes money. the show surface was canceled so that they could replace it with a "reality" show, this will haunt nbc, i and about half of my high school, about 1000 people total have vowed to boycott nbc, until they bring this show back. in my area (i don't know about other places) but they had a great thing going with the sci-fi channel where the sci-fi channel would show last weeks episode at 7:00 and then nbc would show the week's new episode at 8:00 this was great because it gave you a little refresher as to what happened in the last episode. i was so angry when i learned that the show was canceled and they were going to just leave them on top of the church like that!

the problem with tv today is that people have been spoiled by "lite" tv viewing. this type of television show is the equivalent of elevator music or "easy listening" jazz. the typical viewers idea of "continuity" is remembering who got voted off the island last week and wondering who will be the next to go. show them a program like surface, firefly, dr. who, or anything with a plot arc of more than three episodes and...well, they'll just flip back to survivor.95% of the sheep watching tv don't want to rack their brains. they want excuses to not think. they want to make sure the "boob tube" lives up to its name...and they don't want shows that try and go any other route. because of this, surface and many other high-quality shows that should have lasted far longer have gotten the axe.tv viewers don't want stories, or morals, or philosophy, or anything over a third grade vocabulary level. they want people eating earthworms, or over-dramatized "real life" series (no such thing! you cannot observe something without changing the very nature of what you observe) or hormonal shows involving groups of people having trysts and then bragging about it to their friends.today's television is nothing but a wasteland, and the few diamonds you can pick out of the dust are just tossed out because no one even knows what a diamond is anymore. surface was one of those diamonds.

i have bought the complete season of surface. watched it in 3 days! i was so captured by the the plot, theories and basically everything about this show. the actor who plays miles is great. mile's sister, mother and father acted like real life family would. you could connect on so many levels it's fascinating.i find animals are so wonderful, you can almost connect with them as a parent is to a child. it would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists.am sadden, that surface is not having a second season or at least four more shows. i have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book.love the show very much. for those who haven't watched surface, if you like sci-fi you need to watch this!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this dvd set is the complete widescreen 15-episode run of "surface", a television show made by universal in 2006. the full running time is 10 hours and 34 minutes plus a few bonus features (deleted scenes, cast interviews, special effects featurette). this was a relatively high budget show and much of the budget makes it to the screen in the form of quality production design and special effects. unfortunately 10+ hours is a lot of time and as typically happens with this type of stuff, the overall quality begins to fall off in the later episodes. i found the first 7 episodes (discs 1 and 2) extremely engaging and the remainder a disappointment. "surface" was produced, written and directed by josh and jonas pate; and it appears that they were surprised by the success of the series and unable to cobble together enough good subsequent material as they rushed to fill the order for additional episodes. it even looks like additional writers were brought in for the later episodes because the characters (who were already the weakest part of the series) lack consistency with the way they were played in the early episodes. the series was canceled and although the last episode provides a conclusion of sorts there are still a lot of things left hanging. it is basically a science fiction story about genetically created dragons; sort of a television blend of "jurassic park" and "et". the story begins as a puzzle as a crew-less navy sub is found adrift at sea, boaters on a texas lake are sucked into whirlpool, a lighthouse in africa is destroyed by a huge monster, etc. etc. and as long as things stay this vague there is a fair amount of tension and suspense. a human element is introduced in the form of three american families, one on each coast and one on the gulf of mexico. laura daughterty (lake bell) is a california marine biologist who discovers a strange creature rising from an undersea thermal vent on the ocean floor. rich connelly (jay r. ferguson) is diving with his younger brother in the gulf when a similar creature drags his brother away (never to be seen again). miles bennett (carter jenkins) is a wilmington teenager who finds some strange eggs floating in the ocean. he takes one home where it hatches into an "et" type dragon. he will spend the rest of the series trying to hide his strange pet from his family and from the local authorities. these dragons may look like lizards but they are more like indestructible electric eels, firing electromagnetic pulses, causing lightning strikes, emptying the sea of fish, and reproducing like a bunch of randy rabbits when they find an undersea thermal vent of boiling water. as long as it's uncertain whether or not they're intelligent, extraterrestrial, or harmless the premise is interesting. once you begin to suspect their origin it all gets very tired and predictable. jay r. ferguson (a staggeringly bad actor in the tradition of david hasselhoff) essentially plays the richard dreyfuss character from "close encounters of the third kind", so you know that with a better actor and a better director it could have been an interesting character. you will grow to hate this character more with each episode. unfortunately what starts out as three parallel story lines is soon condensed into two as ferguson and bell (a low-budget version of sandra bullock) are soon paired up and involved in a series of moronic adventures almost as improbable as the stuff "jason bourne" gets himself into. you expect plot holes and the need to suspend disbelief in this type of show (that can even be part of the fun) but their adventures are not just totally implausible, they are utterly and completely boring. there are three consecutive episodes that feature ferguson and bell together in a submersible that will have you longing for the excitement of an all-day actuarial conference. jenkins (miles) is the strongest member of the cast and the segments with his pet dragon (nimrod) are inter-cut often enough with the boring ferguson-bell stuff to keep you watching. and these segments benefit from the presence of gorgeous leighton meester (of recent "gossip girl" fame) as his sister savannah. apparently the producers picked up on the importance of this to their "teenage boy" target audience and the one positive thing they did with the later episodes of the series was to introduce linsey godrey (caitlin) as a "first love" interest for miles. so as savannah's screen time decreases catlin is gradually phased in. in retrospect they needed a third storyline to keep viewers sufficiently engaged and it would have been better to limit the adult melodrama in favor of a second group of young actors. then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

i like the show, but come-on writers, get some action in it! quit dragging it on and on. you have a great concept and it could be a whole lot more. miles (jenkins) is great and performs as a kid that age should act in the situation he finds himself in. hey, get creative with the creatures, they may have telepathic capabilities or other out-worldly powers. the kid actors in the series are very good and convincing. the parents of miles do appear to be a little too out-of-sense as to what is going on, but develop this, come on! you have a great seed here and there can be a whole new twist to next season with a lot of new characters and creatures and all kinds of neat sci-fi stuff. if they could make a series on a witch, then you should be able to make one on these creatures and kids.

i am continuously amazed at the us networks. what is the matter with them? yet another very very promising series axed after just 15 episodes and we are left not knowing what the hell happens to everyone. i really thoroughly enjoyed this show and am so annoyed that we will never find out what happens to the characters and the 'monsters' from the deep. this show had everything. humour, suspense, action. what more could you want. why oh why did the pull the plug on this? it just doesn't make sense. buffy went on for 7 series as did charmed and enjoyable as they were, surface, invasion and dead like me were even better. just because a show does not get terribly high ratings doesn't mean it's rubbish and if they gave it a bit longer probably more people would catch on to it and they would end up with a big hit on their hands. one season just does not give it enough time to catch on and the networks are far to eager to pull the plug. they should learn that like fine wines and cheeses, they take time to mature.bring surface and invasion back - p l e a s e !!!!!!!

i love this show. it's truly unique. i was under the impression it was going to have more seasons. in anticipation of series 2, recently i purchased series 1 to re-watch it in order to be refreshed when part 2 started. now after watching it i was excited and craving more, so i came to the site to see the schedule for the continuation. i am really disappointed to see there no longer are plans for a second series as i was eagerly looking forward to watching more of this story. i think they really dropped the ball on this one. there was plenty of story line left to build on and lots of unanswered questions. i'm now a very unhappy view and i hope that they would reconsider their decision and pick up the story where it left off.

this is one of the better sci-fi series. it involves character development, a few really tensionate moments and reasonable episode scripts. as one other commentator said here, it looked as if it were a mini series, not a full blown series with filler episodes and low budgets.the problem with the show, which in short is a godzilla series, is that it started too big, with incredible monsters, fantastic science, then it all boiled down to local americans doing stuff. then, the show ended too soon, since the olympics were coming and hey! a sci-fi show is a sci-fi show, but half naked athletic people running around aimlessly is much more important. so they only did 15 episodes instead of the expected 22. the audience was small, too, as people didn't really caught it on at 20:00. in the end the suits did it. trust a marketing plan to destroy anything that looks remotely original and promising.conclusion: you have a show with good special effects, stuff like huge monsters killing people or destroying boats, then going into genetic engineering, transforming people, human clones, end of the world, tsunamis. also, the only fillers are scenes with aggressive rednecks or other annoying people being killed for their stupidity. the down-side is that after 15 episodes that prepare something huge, the show ends. no real ending, no closure, just a bitter taste of cloth in one's mouth, as if you just swallowed a piece of suit.

there is no denying it. sci-fi on tv is difficult. there are so many problems that the genre brings with it. like the need for a good budget, solid writing, decent acting. perhaps the budget and the script writing is the departments where i feel most attempts have failed. so does "surface" succeed? not completely, but more so than most.the way i see it, a good sci-fi show doesn't really need a lot of cgi to work, nor does it need a ton of money. what it needs is the capacity to create a larger-than-life feeling. the feeling that there is more than meets the eye, something to make me curious and willing to try and figure out how it's going to end. adding the pieces of the puzzle and sometimes saying "aha!" is what makes or breaks a show like this one."surface" had a couple of flaws. first of all it's basic premise is not as exciting as it could have been, nor is the revealed story as exciting (or daring) as i hoped in the beginning. also the tv-feeling is very present much of the time. all the way from the crappy cgi (that ranges from decent to awful) to the rather shifting quality in the acting department. also it feels sometimes a bit too family-oriented in that it takes the edge of sometimes and becomes almost cutesy. but aside from these flaws it's an enjoyable show. maybe not as spectacular as some of the other sci-fi shows out there. but it manages to keep me interested the whole season and it offers a couple of nice cliffhangers between shows as well. the ending for me is not that appealing. i don't like shows that end without ending so to speak, leaving the story unresolved. it's especially unfortunate in this case since the show seems to be canceled after the first season (it is as of yet undecided).hbo is to me the benchmark for quality television. their series have the best actors, the best production values and above all the most solid writing. this is not hbo-quality, but it's good for what it is. good enough to want another season without a doubt.

as part of an initiation prank julie (meg tilly of psycho 2) has to spend the night in a mausoleum, but karl rhamarevich, a master of telekinesis has recently died and been put in there. when julie's fellow sorority sisters desecrate where he's housed the real terror starts.this little flick had a good deal of atmosphere and i enjoyed the build up, plus the last twenty minutes are just plain great. anyone who's looking for a lost gem of an '80's horror movie needn't look any further. highly under-appreciated. plus elizabeth daily is adorable.my grade: b media blaster dvd extras: disc 1) commentary with director tom mcloughlin and co-writer michael hawes; and trailers for "the being", "frankestien's bloody terror", "just before dawn", & "devil dog" disc 2) alternate director's cut (that's almost unwatchable due to a bad print) & behind-the-scenes featurette

"one dark night" is a staple in the 1980's low budget horror genre. filled with retro puns, clothing and scenery, "odn" transports the viewer to a simpler time, when horror films were just that... horror!nothing so intense that you can't understand whats going on, the film tells a dark fable of what happens when you mess with the dead. well acted by it's stable of scream-queens, and a fine directorial job by tom mcloughlin, whom revels in the time and makes you believe what he's presenting. there is no "who done it?" and certainly no big twist at the end. it is straight-forward and in your face horror from beginning to end, with a lot of 80's humor thrown in for added spice. i give it "8" simply because some of the special effects fall short towards the end of the film, but at least there is no cgi... perfect film for new fans to the 1980's horror genre, or anyone looking to re-live a fun night of classic horror bliss.

i also saw this at the cinema in the 80s and have never forgotten it, even though i have never seen it again anywhere. i don't know whether if i did see it now it would seem dated, but remembering the storyline and comparing it to some of the terrible modern films i've seen on zone horror i should think it would stand up very well.i can still remember his coffin sliding out and opening up and all the dead bodies becoming reanimated, and the blue lightning. having seen hundreds of horror movies and still remembering this one, it must be good.

i didn't know anything about this movie before i watched it. it seems to be a lesser-known teen horror from the 80's. what struck me were the ways it differed from so many other movies from that era.the first thing i noticed was how slowly this movie builds. it doesn't do the typical setup of showing characters being murdered one by one. it takes its time building the back story, leaving a little bit of mystery about what might happen. i was almost starting to think no one would even really get hurt in this movie. but everything leads to the climatic sequence during the last 15 minutes, and then it gets fairly graphic (this was a bad time to take a snack break--i almost couldn't finish my pizza once it started).the characters also seem slightly more three-dimensional than a lot of the cheap teen scare flicks. there conversations were refreshingly level-headed for the most part, as opposed to the over-the-top stereotypes you'd expect. for example, the girl who is the popular, snobby, queen-bee of the clique isn't constantly spouting insults at everyone, but is capable of having doubts and showing some consideration for others.so, to summarize, i felt this movie was somewhat original compared to what i expected, and a little better made as well. it drew me in, kept me interested, and then let me have it. as i said, it's pretty gory during the finale, but almost family friendly much of the rest of the time. i don't need to own it, but i'm glad i discovered it.

i saw this film when it was released to theaters. it's definitely one to remember, i had forgotten the title until recently. a friend found it via online search.one dark night is rather unusual for the suspense/horror genre of the time in that it contains no blood. it is of the teen fright variety yet the teens are respectable in their own ways. it's a nice, old-school film with props and scenes that reflect the times. our hero rides a motorcycle with no brain bucket, for example.as has been mentioned by previous reviewers, one dark night is currently available on dvd. the original negative was not available for the dvd transition. some reel changes are a bit rough but this doesn't take away from the story. that being said, the colors are vibrant and the lighting is very good.adam west plays a rather smallish part in this film as raymar's son-in-law. his role as an overbearing and indifferent husband is thankfully short.the story builds over the course of the film. unlike many horror films of the era, one dark night is a great suspense story that gives the viewer time to absorb what is happening.the final 20 minutes or so of one dark night are what make it so memorable. raymar's telekinetic abilities are used to open old graves in the mausoleum, pull the coffins out, open them and move the corpses around. attention was afforded to great detail in the final scenes. the rotting, worm-riddled corpses look quite real.

since jason and his ilk took over horror films circa 1980 most every horror film has involved a group of hormonally charged teenagers being chopped to bits with the focus on the chopping and not the suspense.this little film is different. made in the early 80's it does what every good horror film should do - bring your worst fears to life while you sit around just knowing that these horrors are just around the corner. then, you make those horrors simmer, just don't turn it into a lesson on the biology of butchering.the story features meg tilly right before she had a short-lived turn with fame starting with "the big chill" and then slipped back into obscurity in the early 90's. meg plays an outcast teenager who is just dying to get into the good graces of some classic mean girls. they tell her she can be part of their little group if she spends the night in a crypt. the mean girls intend to scare her and cause her to leave the crypt thus giving them a double reward - further tormenting the outcast girl and having an excuse to reject her.meanwhile famed occultist karl rhamarevich has died a bizarre death shortly after having claimed to have discovered a way to return from the grave and upon his return command great magical powers. his daughter doesn't believe this at first, but she listens to a tape about her father's experiments which included his successful animation of small dead animals and of his plans to emerge from the grave with the power to animate bigger game and draw further power from these animations. she also learns that she may have inherited her father's power and may be the only person who can stop him should he actually rise from the dead. i think you know where this story is headed, so i'll stop here. did i mention the magician was entombed in the same crypt in which meg tilly's character is spending the night?i will mention that the commercial dvd containing this film does look somewhat degraded compared to what you would expect from a film that was made so recently. i saw it on tv in the mid 1980's and i remember it looking better than this. the problem is that the original negative of the film was never located so the dvd had to be created from a print. this means it comes complete with dirt and scratches.this is worth checking out for any horror fan. it was an independently made film and an example of the kind of unusual stuff that you could commonly find on late night tv until the infomercial turned that time slot into a vast wasteland circa 1986. only tcm underground airs this kind of film anymore.

a bunch of sorority girls make a new pledge spend the night in a creepy mausoleum. of course the recently deceased don't stay deceased for long and all hell breaks loose."one dark night" is an enjoyable 80's horror with some ghastly dead bodies floating around that are being controlled by the spirit of a dead psychic raymar.there is no gore and nudity,but the atmosphere of a mausoleum is very eerie.the acting is solid,but the script takes too much time to develop the characters until the final 20 minutes that raymar finally breaks out of his grave.the cinematography is impressive and the the mausoleum is a great location for the climactic events.the film takes so long to get going and this is its major flaw.7 out of 10.

this film is like "the breakfast club" meets "mad city." it's got one plot twist after another with justin walker, corey feldman, and james remar delivering really great performances. however, this movie is not for everyone. if you don't like movies that "go all the way" with regards to violence, then don't watch the last twenty minutes. my wife had to leave the room. of course, i couldn't take my eyes off the screen. this is a really gritty, realistic teen drama. i can't believe it came from b-movie king roger corman. this film is a must-see for those who are not faint of heart. highly recommended.

i recently rented this video after seeing "final ascent" by the same writer. i wasn't prepared for how intense this film would get. i found it engaging from start to finish, and was rooting for the teenagers to get away with their attempted crime. the ending was definitely disturbing with some of its implied violence, but well-done. i highly recommend this picture.

this film was so well-paced that i don't think i actually blinked while watching. one intense situation after another kept me glued to the set. however, i would have liked to have seen corey feldman a lot more in this picture. he just steals every scene that he is in. this could be my favorite grown up corey performance. the ending was clever and unlike other films which back away from severing body parts of likeable supporting characters, this film goes for it! i liked that it was not graphic blood and gore but left more to the viewer's imagination. bravo. i literally had to wipe sweat from my forehead during this particular torture scene with a paper cutter. ultimately, the film works because of its likeable lead character and the awesome presence of my all-time favorite bad guy, james remar(48 hours, remember?) i strongly recommend this film for anyone looking to break a sweat.

the efficacy of this picture was best proven on the intended target audience, namely teens. my 14-year-old son became so engrossed in this film that i rate it considerably higher than its imitator "mad city." it sparked debate in our household on issues such as peer pressure and loyalty vs. doing the right thing. for that alone, i rate this film a 10! parents should watch it with their teens and discuss it afterwards.i very much liked the smart dialogue and consistent acting. i thought that james remar was adequate in his role, but the teenage cast really carried this picture. other imdb users have praised corey feldman's performance, which truly is inspired. all in all, i give this picture my highest recommendation. go get this one!

i love this film. tense with great characters. the kid from "sandlot" is excellent as is corey feldman. when the kids storm the bank, it is pure adrenaline. inside of the bank, it becomes a bit like a "lord of the flies" situation where they turn on each other. justin walker from "clueless" is wonderful. i saw this on "showtime" while channel surfing. it was a pleasant surprise. james remar is also quite good here as the small town sheriff. taylor nichols who i love from "barcelona" does a nice job too as a federal agent. i recommend this film for any fan of bank robbery movies with a lot of good characters. i was shocked to discover that roger corman was a producer on this, since the film is not a b movie.

this movie about a group of small town teens that decide to rob the local bank is excellent. brian (justin walker) wants to get out of his small town, much like jimmy stewart in "it's a wonderful life." however, unlike george bailey, brian is going to rob a bank to finance his dream of attending art school, even if his father is not supportive. the offer to brian is to act like a customer and distract the guard. it's a tempting offer that if offered to many, i question what they would do. anyways, brian does it. when the sheriff (james remar) and his force surround the bank, things go from bad to worse. it's a standoff with even the feds moving in to kill the kids if they have a clean shot. the sheriff must prevent this and try to end the standoff in a peaceful way. unfortunately, tensions rise, and the teens inside turn on each other. some are out of control. the paper cutter scene is gruesome and hard to watch. very intense!

this picture doesn't have any big explosions or expensive chase sequences. however, it does have really wonderful performances and an exceptional script that puts this at the top of my "indie-must-see list." taylor nichols and james remar are terrific together. the young cast surprised me with really consistent acting. usually, indie pictures have some weak link, but there are no weak links here. impressive. go get this one.

my wife and i loved this film. smart dialogue, great characters, clever plot construction. the pacing in this film is non-stop. couldn't even get to the kitchen for some munchies. we have never seen corey feldman this funny. taylor nichols plays a good fed...my wife loves him on that "married man" hbo show. the ensemble cast were all strong. the twist at the end had us cheering. that is why we give this film a "standing o."

this "tftd" episode from season one titled ironically "answer me" is a pretty well done and memorable episode, and it takes a shocking twist at the end. you have jean marsh as an over the hill and washed up actress from l.a. who's moved to new york city for an audition and she's living in an apartment provided by an old friend. oddly every night she's kept awake by a ringing phone from the next door apartment, yet oddly enough the dwelling where the ringing phone continues to ring is unoccupied as the guests have been dead for many years. finally she has to give in only she should have followed along and not answered the phone with no one home, as it's bad to get wrapped up in a phone with a life of it's own! overall good episode a strange one though about a supernatural phone still it's suspenseful and it twists well at the end.

i can understand why others reacted rather unpleasantly towards the climax yielding a twist that really is hard to take seriously. i think, though, that the build-up to it works rather well. the music, quite menacing and spine-tingling, really provides a spooky aura matching the unforgiving sound of a constant ringing telephone that is driving struggling english actress, joan matlin(jean marsh)bonkers. she's borrowing a pal's nice apartment while attempting to jump-start her career in new york city(..the city buildings outside the window look about as realistic as david letterman's)and is unceremoniously welcome by a noisy telephone which rings quite a bit, followed by loud slams against the wall. searching for answers regarding the one responsible for such disregard towards her sanity, joan discovers that no one rents that room, and that a former tenant had in fact strangled herself. without help from the manager, joan will decide to find out for herself who is causing her such anguish. joan discovers the room empty and the phone with a particular female voice which will haunt her.the episode, i think, is a tour-de-force for jean marsh who is a one woman show. she's the only actress visible and we follow her through the crisis which slowly erodes her, the phone and the banging from that other room causing her much distress which grows into fear. instead of leaving, joan remains, so shaken by the noise and to the breaking point where she just wishes for the phone(..or whoever is ringing)to stop. the episode provides a possible answer as to who is plaguing joan and why. a character named beth comes into the story rather late as joan struggles to find out whose female voice it was across the other line who knew her name on that dreaded phone she discovers in the room across from hers. the fate of beth might just tell the viewer why joan is being traumatized. i think this episode is an exercise in spooks instead of credibility;some didn't particularly like it, but i certainly did. i will admit that the phone, as a physical menace "crawling" towards joan is hard to take seriously, not to mention it's attack on her, but i thought the intense opening twenty minutes before this were suitably chilling enough to make up for it.

i know that chill wills usually played lovable old sorts in westerns. but his role in this segment is something i've remembered for a long time. wills could be a first rate villain. yes, burgess meredith's fall was correct! that look in hepplewhite's eye! it expressed porcine greed, ignorance, and the threat of violence all at once. quite a performance, i think.the segment itself was a good one, too. question: couldn't the little black bag cure alcoholism? i guess it did, sort of, with fall. but the doctor would have been wise to apply the cure, if he had it, as quickly as possible to hepplewhite.there is one moment that was annoying but also necessary. and it is something that appears to recur in these night gallery segments. it's serling's constant need to sermonize. for that's what we got, one more time, with dr. fall. i don't know what was more frustrating, losing the black bag and all its miracles or not being to stop fall from preaching about the bag's benefit for humanity, all while rubbing hepplewhite's greedy face in the mud, and, therefore, all but begging for hepplewhite to strike out at him. but as i say, it was necessary. at least it was for me. otherwise, we wouldn't have been able to see wills' performance discussed above. all done without moving a muscle or speaking a word.

this is a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold and snowy night. if you like a few laughs with your horror then this is the movie for you. the makings of a real cult classic. it has everything you would want to see in a horror movie. a beautiful girl, a hero, the buffoon, a monster truck and of course a family of mutant satanic killers. this one is full of blood,guts and gore. i strongly recommend watching this one in the wee early morning hours, and be careful of who sees you being entertained by the sounds of monster trucks, bad {but funny } one liners and our hero eating eye ball stew. not as good as the evil dead but a close second. just remember warning..... do not eat before viewing this film...

this is a surprisingly great low budget horror/comedy, it's funny and pretty well made, with good performances and a really cool twist ending!. all the characters are pretty cool, and the story while unoriginal is very good, plus eric jungmann(adam) and justin urich(harley) had fantastic chemistry together. one of the funniest moments in the film for me is when adam is trapped in the bathroom, and harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there, and decides to take a p*ss in the truck, and aimee brooks is just plain sexy!, plus this is one of the best low budget horror films i have seen in a long time. it's very gory, but in a comical way, and i thought it was very well written as well, plus michael bailey smith is fantastic as the monster man and had some wicked makeup!. it's similar to films like joy ride, duel, jeepers creepers, etc, etc and it has some suspenseful moments here and there, plus the gore effects are really well done for the most part. this is a surprisingly great low budget horror/comedy, it's funny and pretty well made, with good performances and a really cool twist ending, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. michael davis does a very good! job here, with great camera work, good angles,good use of colors, and using a great setting, plus he kept the film funny and at a very fast pace.there is a lot of gore!. we get extremely bloody nose bleeds,gory impaling's, bloody stabbings,guy is cut in half by a monster truck, human remains in a cooked stew, guts all over the place,guys guts fall out,pencil in the eyes,bloody slit throat,bunch of people walking around without limbs,gory dead squirrel,heads are squished,severed limbs,bloody and mangled corpses,decent amount of bloodshed,one very gory scene at the very end and more!.the acting is very good for a low budget film. eric jungmann is fantastic here as adam, he was a nerd but a very likable one, he had fantastic chemistry with justin urich, had some cool lines,and i just loved his character, he also seemed to be enjoying himself,and he was especially good at the end!. justin urich is excellent as the ass of a best friend, however i just couldn't help but love him as he was very funny, and often stole a lot of the scenes, i really dug him!. aimee brooks is gorgeous, and did great with what she had to do, she had good chemistry with jungmann and like jungmann was especially good at the end, as i loved her mysterious character. michael bailey smith is wonderful as the monster man he was very creepy looking, had some awesome makeup, and is now one of my favorite slashers!. rest of the cast do fine.overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5

two city guys are driving through hicksville usa when a rusty monster truck suddenly appears and repeatedly attempts to run them off the road.having picked up a mysterious blonde hitchhiker,they pull up at a truck-stop full of redneck amputees,one of whom warns them of 'the demon out there'. but they don't listen.big mistake!"monster man" by michael davis mixes comedy with horror surprisingly well.the film borrows heavily from "duel","the blair witch project","jeepers creepers" and "the texas chainsaw massacre".the story is pretty silly,but there is enough gore and violence to keep splatter freaks happy.i enjoyed especially the performance of justin urich,which offers the film its comedy relief.still the complete lack of suspense is hard to forgive.give this one a chance,if you have some time to waste.7 out of 10.did i mention that aimee brooks is sexy?

great horror comedy from michael davis.iwas laughing so hard i almost peed! great acting from eric jungman as the good guy who saves the day & great performance by the jack black-esquire like performance from justin urich. he was just divine in this film. this guy deserves to be a big star. also,aimee brooks was good in the film as well as the girl in danger along with the guys from a killer reminiscent of jeepers creepers. the gore to was given in copious amounts & i loved it.i just hope they release a not rated version. great low-budget horror comedy. the dead cat in the hotel sex scene is just gruesomely funny! ***** out of *****

in the veins of jeepers creepers and the texas chainsaw massacre, monster man surprisingly well-made--though mindless--little horror. throw in a little buddy-comedy, nice gore and intense scare. it's hard no to say that monster man is really entertaining. the low budget seem pretty obvious, but it doesn't effected the presentation of the movie in general and put more big budget horror movies in shame.yes, the plot somewhat generic as possible. pair of friend, adam (eric jungman)and harley (justin urich) are driving cross country to interrupt the wedding of a woman adam has always loved. while adam is more nerdy type, harley is a self-proclaimed ladies man and very offensive loudmouth. adding a bonus to the plot, then they picked up a sexy hitchhiker, sarah (aimee brooks). things turn into nightmare when a monster truck with scary face drive stalking them. when dead body starts counting, they must do the race against the time before their own life on risk.the plot is obviously reminiscent of many prior famous horror movies, but michael davis as the writer and director succeed in keeping the tension. the scare is build well enough, where characterization is never be the best, but fairly okay. the script also littered with comedies that works for the funny moments and they quite enjoyable rather than annoying and also wait for the twist in the finale. it's hilarious and shocking in the same time, which is pretty amusing.as conclusion, monster man surprisingly entertaining. it deserves more attention in the big screen. it proves that big budget doesn't make an effective horror movie, but skill does! something that the director has shown and delivers.

i first saw this on demand. or on tv. i'm not really sure. but this has got to be my all time favorite movie ever! i mean, this movie has blood, gore, laughs and chills through out the movie. i recently ordered "monster man" from amazon and i've been watching "monster man" ever since i got it. trust me, you will love this movie. p.s. the commentary on the dvd is way funny. they also said something about "monster man 2" during the commentary. let's hope they make "monster man 2"! if you have the chance, rent the movie or buy it. you will absolutely love it! this is the best movie that has come out in 2003.10/10

adam (eric jungmann) and obnoxious best friend harley (justin urich) are driving cross country to a wedding. along the way they pick up sexy hitchhiker sarah (aimee brooks). then, for no reason, a monster truck keeps trying to run them off the road...and maybe kill them. who is doing this and why?pretty good horror film. its energetic and full of flashy direction which gets you right into the action. it's also a horror comedy. most of the humor is infantile and really gross but actually somewhat funny. also this movie really piles on the gore at times--but that's a good thing! the acting is ok--jungmann overplays his nerd role a bit much; urich is stuck with the hopeless role of the foul-mouthed, sex-obsessed best friend--but pulls it off; brooks is good too in a limited role.but i could see the "twist" ending coming long before it happened and logic totally disappears at the end (especially the rescue). still, this is a gory, sometimes funny and sometimes scary horror movie. i give it a 7.

i saw this on zone horror and fully expected it to be compete crap like most of the films they play , however i was pleasantly surprised. the film revolves around 2 friends and a maniac in a monster truck who is chasing them (i know it sounds crap but its actually quite good) , the film is creepy when it intends to be and is laugh out loud funny in parts (and not in an unintentional way either, it is well paced and is a lot of fun as well as being very gory , there's some very funny black humour thrown in as well. its not the most original movie but so what. if your after shakespeare then this is not it , if your after a fun movie then this should be fine

while driving in a highway to the wedding of his beloved betty-ann, adam (eric jungmann) is surprised by his former schoolmate harley (justin urich) on the backseat of his car. adam has broken off with the inconvenient and moron harley because of betty-ann. along their road trip, harley makes fun of some rednecks in a bar and later their car is chased by a giant monster truck on the road. after some incidents, they give a lift to the hitchhiker sarah (aimee brooks) and sooner the trio is terrorized by a scary monster driving the monster truck.in spite of having one of the most annoying characters i have ever seen in a horror movie, the irritating harley, "monster man" is a surprisingly good trash horror-comedy. the story is a collection of clich√©s, beginning like "joy ride" or "duel"; then it turns to one of the countless rip-offs of "the texas chainsaw massacre"; there is a surprising twist, ending with a hook for a sequel. there are hilarious scenes, aimee brooks is extremely sexy and this film really entertains. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "monster man"

if you took a really good jack black movie, added a little jeepers creepers, and then a dash of joyride with a hint of texas chainsaw massacre and house of a 1000 corpses...you would have monster man! i went into this movie, not really expecting much at all, but i wound up really enjoying the movie. the whole premise is really cheesy, a monster man in a monster truck chases down people, but it is so funny that the writer/director doesn't expect you to take it seriously. justin urich is a comic gem and should have a very promising career. he is identical to jack black. the only problem with the film is the unbelievable hero role played by eric jungmann. but overall, if you are looking for a really really fun movie that will crack you up until you are rolling in the aisles, and at the same time, scare the crap out of you...check out this film.

this was on showtime the other night, and i figured it was going to be another made-for-video crap fest, like "earth vs. the spider" or any of those other hbo horror shorts. instead, i found a comedy/gore classic. it was legitimately funny, and surprisingly, the acting was quite good. even my wife, an overall horror-hater, agreed and was laughing at parts. in addition, the fx were high-quality.overall, the film felt like a parody of joy ride/jeepers creepers, and the 2 main characters reminded me of the pair from shaun of the dead. definitely worth watching, but don't take it seriously.the end.

a beautiful woman, a backwoods, inbred monster man, a super sweet monster truck, a road kill zombie brother and 2 friends...one anal retentive, overly sensitive nerd and the other a foul mouthed, adolescent slob. throw them all together with a dash of jeepers creepers, texas chainsaw massacre and road trip and you've got monster man. a hilarious horror/comedy outing that never sets out to "say something". it's a simple, straight forward laugh fest. unpretentious and well made, this horror/comedy is at its heart, a buddy flick. this film offered some hilarious and sickening set pieces. i highly recommend this to fright fans looking to be entertained.

well, it has to be said that monster man is a huge mess of a film, but somehow multiple different genres and a clich√©d plot come together to make one of the most enjoyable modern horror films i've seen in ages! the two biggest styles that the film mixes are a 'road trip' style teenage comedy and a 'texas chainsaw massacre' style redneck horror vibe, and while one gets in the way of the other quite often; director michael davis manages to keep things moving thanks to the fact that the constant shift in tone means that we're never quite sure where the film is going to be taken next. things start out worryingly as we're introduced to two characters, both irritating in different ways. adam is a wussy virgin, while harley is a fat big-mouthed "a-hole". they're both driving across the desert to attend the wedding of some chick they both liked in high school. after a couple of strange events, they pick up a hitch-hiker, and then find themselves being chased by some maniac in a monster truck for reasons unknown...the idea of someone being chased by someone else in a bigger vehicle is hardly original, but the way the monster truck is used here is one of the film's biggest assets. the truck itself looks spooky because it's so haggard and rusty, and the fact that it bounces around the screen makes the unfolding action exciting and suspenseful. after a while, you begin to get used to the characters and once aimee brooks enters the fray, things start to look up. the teen comedy side of the movie actually works pretty well, as justin ulrich is always on hand to deliver some entertaining lines of dialogue and the scenes between the dorky virgin and the hot female hitch-hiker are interesting enough. just when you think the film couldn't possibly get any messier, things take a turn for the weird in the final third. without spoiling things, it has to be said that monster man features the sort of ending that couldn't possibly be seen coming, and along with the twist, is a big surprise. some people may feel ripped off by the sudden turn at the end - but i actually thought it worked quite well as it fits the film in that nothing here really fits... overall, this isn't a 'great' film by any means - but if you're looking for some silly entertainment, monster man should hit the spot!

before watching this movie from beginning to end, i happened to just catch the last half hour. ordinarily i don't watch a movie if i haven't seen it from the beginning, but a friend had it on and once i started watching it i couldn't stop.i'm really surprised this movie didn't get a wide theatrical release. this is quite a funny movie (often gallows humor) , and the monster and monster truck in it are quite menacing. the monster makes leatherface look pretty, and the monster truck is a like a cross between a world war i german artillery vehicle and a giant coffin.a timid twenty-five year-old virgin guy is on a long drive to stop the woman he loves from getting married. his ex-best friend tags along and rags on him constantly. they're menaced on the road by a vintage black hearse and the aforementioned monster truck. they also pick up a hitchhiker, played by the very sexy aimee brooks.i also watched the animated trailer with the director's commentary, and the electronic press kit and i found those both to be interesting. i would bet that the feature commentary with the director and the two male stars is pretty enjoyable too, but i have so many other movies to watch i've never seen before....

"gaming? nicotine? fisticuffs? we're moving in a descending spiral of iniquity!" so says the head of st. swithen's upon inspecting the master's common at nutbourne. the faculty and students of st. swithen's have been ordered to share facilities at nutbourne to avoid german bombs during world war ii. then there's the masters' library. "the diary of samuel pepys? abridged...well, that's something to be thankful for. what's up here? the memoirs of casanova? wasn't that the book we caught jessica james reading in the closet? decameron nights! well, really! what ever else this place may or may not be, it's no place to bring carefully nurtured girls!" yes, a terrible mistake has been made by the ministry of education. nutbourne is a school for boys. st. swithen's is a school for girls. and what makes this one of the best post-wwii british comedies, nutbourne's head master is wetherby pond...played by alastair sim, while st. swithen's head mistress is muriel whitchurch...played by margaret rutherford. "st. swithen's?" says pond. "you don't mean to say that yours is a school for boys and girls?" he asks one of the early girls. "only girls" she says cheerfully. "does this mean, sir," asks one of nutbourne's teachers, "that we are to expect 100 young girls?" "it means that not only have the ministry made a mistake in sending a school here at all, but that it is guilty of an appalling sexual aberration!" margaret rutherford's miss whitchurch, as positive and immovable as a battleship, intends to make the best of it, by briskly taking over nutbourne if possible. alastair sim's pond is exasperated up to his big bald head and is determined to salvage his school. in the meantime, there are 100 young girls and 170 young boys to be fed and places found for them to sleep (along with all their teachers). the cooks and caretakers, totally put upon, walk out. miss whitchurch and her girls, however, are up to the cooking tasks. "come now, angela," she says to one girl who is trying to stir something in a big pot, "haven't you made porridge before?" "yes, but no one ever had to eat it." "that's a defeatist attitude, my dear. stir it well and don't shilly shally." things are hardly going well when pond discovers four governors from a school he hopes to lead are arriving at any moment to see for themselves how well led nutbourne is. and miss whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents have just arrived to see how their daughters are doing in the new -- boy free, they were told -- facilities. the only solution? miss whitchurch and pond, their teachers and their students, concoct a split-second shifting of classes to give the allusion that nutbourne has no girls and that st. swithen's has no boys. after the parents inspect a dorm and leave for a class, the girls in the beds duck under and the boys who'd been hidden under leap up into the beds, just as the governors walk in. the boys are observed at rugby and, as soon as the governors turn their backs, the goal posts are taken down, nets for lacrosse are put up, and just then the parents walk over to observes the girls. one parent spots her daughter in a science class, then moments later sees her in a choir practice, then moments later.... "there's angela again," she says to miss whitchurch. "why so it is," she replies, hustling the parents out to avoid the governors who are approaching just around the corner. "the child's quite ubiquitous." when we leave nutbourne, everything has been discovered. the students are milling about. the teachers are dazed (except for two who are kissing.) the education ministry has just sent several more busloads of students. the parents are speechless but the governors are not. "we're waiting for an explanation," one says sharply. pond holds his head and shudders. "can't you see i'm trying to think of one." the film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation after another, braced by a very funny script and two hugely comedic performances by rutherford and sim. sim's droll exasperation and rutherford's implacable determination are so well matched that's it's a shame this is the only movie they ever made together. joyce grenfell, as gossage, st. swithen's tall, awkward, loping sports teacher gives them some competition. if you keep your eyes open, you'll also find some amusing references director frank launder works in, including a gong at nutbourne that looks just like a midget version of j. arthur rank's, a faint echo of the zither theme from the third man and a shot stolen from david lean's oliver twist, except this time the little boy walks up holding his porridge bowl and says, "please, sir. i don't want anymore." frank launder and his partner, sidney gilliat, were responsible for some of the best films produced in britain during the thirties, forties and fifties. they wrote, produced and directed, sometimes doing one, sometimes the other. in one way or another they were responsible for such first-rate films as green for danger (with a masterly droll performance by sim), i see a dark stranger, the lady vanishes, night train to munich, wee geordie, the belles of st. trinian's, the rake's progress and many others. with the happiest days of your life, launder wrote and directed while both produced. it's one of their best.

this film is just plain lovely. it's funny as hell and as old as the hills. the acting is superb and it's fascinating seeing post-war britain and how we used to behave in those days. this seems to have been some pre-runner to the st. trinians films (given the alastair sim and margaret rutherford connection - there's also a very young george cole in there who appeared in many st. trinians films) but i don't myself understand the connection. it was shown on bbc4 recently after a biography of st. trinians creator ronald searle, however i missed enough of the biography to miss the connection with this film. anyway a great film in its own right and something that should be preserved for all time!

this film was made thirteen years before i was born but i still think it is the wittiest, dottiest, most harmless piece of fun ever made. it simply could not go wrong with the cast of superb british character actors it boasts.where to start? alastair sim-peerless; margaret rutherford-ditto;the wonderfully alkward, innocent gossage, played to perfection by the imperious joyce grenfell. the caddish victor hyde-brown (a guy middleton special) and the rest of the staff sum up post-war middle-class england to a tee.the humour is sometimes obvious, but it is of that special "ealing" variety and is never offensive.i have watched this film more times than i care to remember and still laugh like a drain at the antics every time. the storming of the dorms occupied by the girls school, the magnificently-planned but ultimately doomed twin tours of the school and the chaotic ending involving the arrival of a third school to add to the anarchy, are priceless.it's an old clich√© i know, but they really do not make them like that anymore. how i wish they did. if you haven't seen it, please do, you won't be disappointed.

a bumbling error at the ministry of education results in nutbourne boys school having to share with st swithin's school for girls. this bemuses the respective head teachers of each school and leads to all manner of chaotic goings on, however the two are forced to come to an uneasy alliance in the hope of averting major trouble.the happiest days of your life is based on the john dighton play from 1948, with dighton writing the part of headmistress whitchurch specifically for margaret rutherford. replacing george howe from the play in the role of headmaster pond, is alastair sim, and here in lies the crowning glory of this filmic adaptation, sim & rutherford are perfectly wonderful, bouncing off each other to keep what is basically a one joke movie, highly entertaining. directed by the gifted frank launder, and produced by the equally adroit sidney gilliat, the happiest days of your life is a quintessentially british movie, obviously a precursor to the st trinians franchise, the film entertains the children with it's high jinks clash of the sexes heart, whilst tickling the watching adults with its very saucy undercurrent. thankfully the chaotic ending cements all that has gone before it to leave this particular viewer with a grin as wide as nutbourne rail station, great fun 8/10.

after a long run in the west end this charming film re-cast margaret rutherford as the headmistress 'miss whitchurch' in this financially successful adaptation made in 1950.all interior shots took place at riverside studios in hammersmith, london. the exterior scenes were filmed on location at a public girl's school near liss in hampshire. during the 12 - week shoot both margaret rutherford and joyce grenfell were staying in a hotel nearby and would often visit the school during the evenings where they would happily enjoy the company of the real school mistresses.although the film's script contains only two original lines from the original play the leads and supporting actors are in fine form and you can only feel sympathetic for their predicament especially in the final scenes.

the play is cleverly constructed - begin with the porter, rainbow - & let the audience see the background unfold through his eyes. the film follows the play with great faithfulness, working, no doubt, on the simple premise that it couldn't be bettered. now throw in a host of superb character actors - & the result is a resounding triumph.a definite must-see.

the happiest days of your life showcases some of britain's greatest comedy talents of its time in a traditionally farcical and upper-class-twit like fashion. generally it is a whistle-stop tour of stuffy english behaviour with the girls-only school providing a great setting for the dotty goings-on. margaret rutherford, alastair sim and - most especially! - joyce grenfell are all fantastic, giving us a lot of laughs as they express their utter horror at what they are having to deal with. as the film moves on, things get sillier and sillier with the tour around the school for the parents being a suitably crackers high point.at this point i will give special mention, again, to joyce grenfell and her wonderful character miss gossage. she is so extraordinarily innocent, silly, apologetic and ineffectual that she seems to steal the whole film. she provides the greatest laugh of the film when she flirts with a male teacher ("call me sausage!").whilst some of the film is slow or dated, and not always very involving, it still maintains most of its sparkle and barely pauses for romance. good for a silly, harmless giggle.7/10

this film, without doubt, is the clearest example of the british humour the germans can't understand. one-liners run rampant in a film spawning one of the greatest series of films in british cinema history (st.trinians). the story of bureaucratic incompetence amid post-war trials enables frank launder to direct maximum talent from all the cast. it's probably the only film in which margaret rutherford meets her match, in alastair sim, for forceful characterisation (she still wins though). joyce grenfell (bless her) and richard wattis both deserve mentions in dighton's masterpiece of english etiquette and stiff upper lip under pressure.no rutherford/sim/grenfell fan would be without this in their collection. absolutely brilliant. why 9/10? only 83mins long.

one of the flat-out drollest movies of all-time. sim and rutherford are at their best matching wits over the predicament of an all-boys and all-girls school sharing the same quarters. slapstick has never been this sophisticated.

from the golden period of british films, this has my vote for one of the funniest of all time. screened yesterday at my film society to a rapturous audience, i was astonished at how well the comedy has lasted (made in 1950!). it is really down to the expert timing and inimitable playing from two of the finest actors britain has produced: margaret rutherford and alastair sim. adapted from a play by john dighton, this farce is briskly handled by director frank launder. the plot is simple: a ministry mistake billets a girls' school on a boys' school. i will always laugh when i think of this film.

i can't remember exactly where i heard of them first, but i listen to a little of one song and liked it. went and bought the cd and had finally found the type of music i like. i heard about this video and knew i had to have it. it has a lot of clips from them playing in concert. let me tell you, watching this video doesn't even compare to them in concert. i've seen them twice in concert and don't want to ever miss a chance to see them again. the other two things it has is some interview, and even a video for one of their biggest songs. couple little side notes...i saw them at ozzfest 2001 and they ruled there, but seeing them in a smaller inside stage was much better (they had some really cool things to do with being able to cut out the lights) the other, in case anyone wonders, votary means a devout follower.

slipknot is a heavy metal band from the great city of des moines, iowa in which the rockers wear their own distinguished mask (i know someone already said this, but i need to fill up space for this review). the band members are joey, mick, 133, sid, clown, james, corey, chris, and paul. this band is one of the best new heavy metal bands in my opinion and should be heard by everyone that loves hardcore rock. another good movie is called "disasterpieces" which shows the band's performance at the london arena. the "my plague" video was shot there and is included on the dvd. the most kick ass song they made is also on there (sic). so if you love the band you need to see this and if you love heavy metal music then you have to hear this band.

i did it too. when i first saw the band, i dismissed them straight away without even listening to the music. then one day, out of sheer curiosity, i bought the cd and fell in love with it. so i bought the video. hold onto your lunch kids, this isnt going to be pretty! the video was excellent - a great opportunity to hear the music, see some of the promo videos, and meet the band...although i *still* dont know how they can cope with wearing those masks all the time! a must for all fans of the band, and fans of alternative music in general

this dvd usually sells for around $20. i wouldn't pay this much for the dvd if i had known what i was getting, but regardless this is a pretty good disc. it displays the knot in all their glory, with footage from their concerts... playing surfacing, wait and bleed and scissors among other tracks, including the "spit it out" music video, which was apparently banned from mtv.slipknot, for those who don't know, is essentially a symphony of the damned: nine masked men who display total chaos on stage, with machine gun drums, squealing guitar and vocals that will tear your face off and leave you wanting more. for those who've never seen slipknot before, i cannot recommend enough you get this dvd... probably off ebay or amazon so you can get a better deal.a short, though well made show of the knot.seven out of ten.

slipknot is a hardcore rock band from des moines, iowa. nine band members who all wear customized boilersuits, and personalized, homemade masks (eg. #6's clown mask, #0's various gasmasks, #8's tattered + torn crashtest dummie mask with dreadlocks). the music itself seems to walk the finelines between sane and otherwise, yet is performed so brilliantly and psychotic."welcome to our neighborhood" sounds rather a generic title, but the footage itself is something else. interviews with the band, soundbites from their latest, selftitled album, 2 live performances, and one banned-by-mtv music video (a brilliant homage to the classic kubrick film "the shining"), the movie clocks in at not even half-an-hour, but is certainly worth it. it is perfect for introducing any metal/hardcore fan to slipknot.

this is one of the most enjoyable teen movies i have ever seen (and that i wished was released to video). it was released the same year as another great comedy in which tim matheson played a role "animal house" (which is probably why it was overlooked). one of the most memorable parts of this film would definitely be the soundtrack, which could have and should have been a formal label release. the soundtrack features a lesser-known 70's act named high inergy whose song "we are the future", played a marquee role in the movie's prom scene. i remember purchasing the group's album "steppin' out" as a kid mainly because of the look of the girls and not necessarily for their musical talents. the closing song is one of the best ballads i have ever heard, and i can still hear it in my head. i wish i knew the group's name so that i could look for it somewhere in cyberspace.if you liked films such as "over the edge" and "rich kids", i think this is one that you will enjoy as well.

i remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when i was 6 years-old (you do the math). i absolutely loved it. i was tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it (climbing the furniture, jumping around making monkey sounds). it started a fascination with tarzan and monkeys, but oddly enough a longer lasting love for christopher lambert (keep in mind that i saw highlander very shortly after this). 1984 was the last time i saw that film, until about a month ago. it happened to be on cable as i was getting ready for bed at 3:30 am and even though it was late and i was tired and i had to be at work at 9:00 am, i stayed up to watch this movie that i loved as a kid. upon viewing it i realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that, that andie macdowell's voice was dubbed by someone else. ian holme was of course solid as usual, and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up, but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan. he was great! the depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark, were just amazing.as i stated earlier i am lambert fan, but i'm used to highlander, the hunted and fortress. in this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again.so to make a short story way too long, i was a little disappointed that the film was not that good, but i was glad to see that lambert was good and i do not regret staying up until 6:00am to see it.

how his charter evolved as both man and ape was outstanding. not to mention the scenery of the film. christopher lambert was astonishing as lord of greystoke. christopher is the soul to this masterpiece. i became so enthrawled with his performance i could feel my heart pounding. the entireity of the movie still moves me to this day. his portrayal of john was oscar worthy; as he should have been nominated for it.

although films about edgar rice burroughs famous rousseauian hero tarzan have been seen by movie goers for almost a century now, this is the definitive version of the story. greystoke is the actual story of the origins of tarzan as set down by edgar rice burroughs way back in the second decade of the last century. i've been assured by experts.tarzan and sherlock holmes are probably the most filmed fictional heroes in history. i've no basis in fact for saying that, just a gut feeling. the most popular holmes was basil rathbone, the most popular tarzan was johnny weissmuller. and films that they made with both those characters will be criticized no end by purists.but greystoke is the real deal, a faithful adaption of burroughs first story concerning the origin of his hero. i can't think of another film which shows that tarzan learned french before english, but that is shown here and it's only natural since it was a french survivor of a massacred safari played by ian holm who discovers tarzan who has been raised by the apes since his parents who were shipwrecked on the african coast died there after his mother gave birth.his parents were in fact the son and daughter-in-law of the earl of greystoke and the surviving earl, played by ralph richardson is of course overjoyed to learn he has a grandson. of course there are others who don't welcome the new heir back in society. one who doesn't is andie mcdowell playing of course jane. she does not communicate with tarzan in answer to his grunts and monosyllabic commands. tarzan speaks a concise english, french, and understands the language of the apes as well. as for the language of love, tarzan and jane need no lessons.greystoke earned three oscar nominations for best makeup in regard to the apes, best adapted screenplay and a posthumous nomination for ralph richardson for best supporting actor. it should also have rated a nomination for cinematography of the jungle scenes in cameroun and the scenes of the british aristocracy in several landmark places like hatfield house and blenheim palace.for burroughs purists, greystoke is the real deal.

i have seen most of the tarzan episodes. certainly the rated x with o'keeffe & bo derek, which is totally deplorable.i have seen this version several times since it was originally shown.all the cast had memorable parts, great acting the ape sequences.last night i viewed same on spanish station and other than some french dialog all in spanish.as far as hudson not wanting andie's voice he did nothing until the very end. he viewed the dailies and could have hired a dialog coach.it seems silly that a story about apes and a man raised by them all speaking gibberish that hudson attacked andie.the story line in the movie was that she was an american cousin. the last time i checked carolina was in the usa.she was beautiful in movie and her eyes, and gorgeous hair, alabaster skin mystified all us males. she did not have to resort to bo's level.she has remained a lady throughout the rest of her career and should look at this movie (half her life ago),as a starting point. her performance, sincerity, made this movie enjoyable, believable that a half wild man could ascertain her inner beauty.great sending point for sir richardson, he did steal the movie.

while it comes no closer to the tarzan of edgar rice burroughs than, say, the johnny wiesmuller flicks did it does have it's own peculiar, and entertaining, slant on the story. its a well done tarzan movie. nice scenery, good photography, workable continuity, and a tarzan yell that echos the one described by burroughs. the players all perform well. the only bad points i found were, i think, related. it moves slow in places. that slow movement? makes this picture to long. it could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter, which i think would have helped with the natural flow of the plot line and the character development. but the rest of the film works well enough to carry it over these two rough spots and still leave the viewer satisfied with the flick. short version of all the above ... its a very good tarzan movie.

i thought this was a very daring representation of the old hokey 'tarzan' concept made so popular by hollywood, weismuller, et al.yes; there is a lot of silly stuff. but then, the idea is silly. it is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees. i am tempted to say completely unbelievable, but that the concept has never been tried. and there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort. though under the circumstances i can see how that would be very difficult to avoid. we also now have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation, and know that a human raised from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them in adulthood.still, if you can get your head around that lot, there's a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring. lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb. i am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play. there are plenty of other excellent performances too. not least of which are sir ralph richardson and ian holm.what is particularly disturbing - and rightly so - is the simian perception of humans. we get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor, dumb, helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it. and it demonstrates well how the phony 'civilisation' and 'morality' with which we cloak and justify our conduct, is no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance. it may seem a little overstated at times, especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms, but what we see isn't just a truth about the victorians; its a truth about the way we are today. it's one that needs to be stated, and cannot be stated often enough. holm's character's obsession with the 'ray-zor' as a symptom of civilisation - as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned - is an excellent case in point. primitive bearded readers take note.the story is depressing. ultimately it's a tragedy. because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral tyranny that is truly human 'civilisation'; we know he's doomed. before the third millennium is 50 years old, wild simians will be hunted into extinction as bush meat, and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify insatiable human excess.in the end, it's a tale about ourselves. the path to extinction that other simians tread, must eventually be followed by humans.highly recommended for its ethical take, despite the hokey moments.

before i review this film, i must make a confession that is rather a bold statement to make as a film reviewer. anyone who has already read any of my previous reviews may know that i've always been controversial in a low-key sense, giving high marks for flops such as "captain america" and 1985's "creature" and panning such film classics as alistar sim's "a christmas carol" and "shakespeare in love." with that in mind, this confession might not come as a surprise:the simple fact is, christopher lambert is probably one of my favorite actors. woah, now, don't start getting crazy on me just yet. let me explain myself: i by no means think he's the greatest actor in the world. i clearly confess that he is not. he is certainly no morgan freeman or anthony hopkins, but i would say that his acting ability is probably somewhere up there with at least bruce willis. what i admire about him, however, are the human qualities that he brings into his action heroes. he is just an average guy who laughs and cries and bleeds, who is a hero because he has to be, not necessarily because he wants to be. it takes a lot, in my opinion, to be able to bring out those qualities in a character (especially in the movies he's worked in), and lambert's heroes are a far cry from schwartzennegger's or stallone's. quite frankly, lambert's characters are easier for me to relate to. hence, he's not the greatest actor in the world....he's just a personal favorite.i can't say that same, however, for his films. however much i appretiate his acting, it would be foolish not to confess that his choice of films leave something to be desired. most of them are, quite frankly, terrible, and any ridicule that he's gotten over the years from me isn't due to his acting, but rather his bad choice in scripts.with that in mind, i can say that his debut film, "tarzan," is one of his best films and probably his greatest performance. as i mentioned, it is effective becasue of the humaness he brings to the role, and for how seriously the director, writers and actors handle the material. this is a far leap from the b-movie action adventures with johnny weismeller from the 1940's. in fact, i would hesitate to call it an action movie. instead, it is a serious drama that takes all of e.r. burrough's material seriously, showing tarzan's quest to discover his real family in scotland after realizing that he doesn't fit in as a "white ape." he is torn in between his old family and his new one, which includes a wonderful sir ralph richardson in his final role. in an attempt to adapt to humans, his ape instincts also kick in, and he can't decide what he loves more: his real family, or the one that he's always known. all in all, it is a wonderful commentary on society, and a wonderful character study.if nothing else, it launched lambert into international stardom, which continued will into the 1980's with films like "highlander" and "he sicilian." unfortunately, it didn't last. but just wait a while....his latest career moves such as "gideon" and "resurrection" have proven that though he still have a long way to go, he's a competent enough actor to be able to perhaps make a... ahem.... comeback if he'll just pick his roles better.for now, however, here's the verdict on his first film:*** out of ****

the greatest tarzan ever made! this movie is done in a way that no other tarzan ever has come close in doing. it has every thing in it that you would want in a tarzan movie. no other tarzan movie ever has or ever will portray the character this well. i would say that if you have seen a tarzan movie and liked it you should see this one you will love it, and if you have never seen tarzan you should see this one and forget the rest of them.

i must confess that i don't remember this film very well. but, certainly i liked it. i think it was the best adaptation from burroughs novel, really. and of course it's one of the best movie from christopher lambert.a good movie about tarzan, as cult as the ones with weissmuller.

don't let the wildly varying reviews of the movie deter you. you'll love it or hate it according to your own tastes. however, if for no other reason, see "greystoke" to experience the excitement of a great actor grabbing your heart as he breathes life into his role. ralph richardson was not a great actor for how perfectly he could handle shakespeare; rather, he is to be remembered for his sensitive treatment of every character he portrayed. he was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor. his reading of the part of the sixth lord of greystoke, his last performance, is to be cherished by all who love the theatre.

now for sure, this is one of the lightest-hearted stories that bruce willis has been in to date and yet,-- it is still touching. i really like bruce's style and persona, i haven't loved everything he has ever been in, but he brings it to the 'big-time' for me in most all his film endeavors.the story begins..... he is power, confidence and style with a capitol 's' . he drives a porshe he lives well, in a palatial estate with a grand view of the fair city. that's russell duritz. he is an image consultant to those who are on the top or rising to it. his acclaim, he is russell duritz, he knows what it takes to make it. it just seems that as life is going along swiftly and foundation-ally set, there is a problem, an intruder at his home, the alarm has been activated! russell can't seem to figure out (for the moment) what is happening to him. it's different and yet it is somehow familiar. a small boy, who looks exactly like....-- him. as their lives run smack dab into each other, there seems to be a reason that is screaming out to him, "you have unfinished business to take care of, now!"amy the supporting young lady of the story is probably the best balance that he has seen and has in his life. she works with him, puts up with his 'ego' and yet, she is smitten with russell. very much so. with rusty his past 'self' now in the picture and talking a mile a minute, singing too late at night, everything that was foundational is becoming like jelly! willis is fun, egocentric and at times out of his head in this lovable disney modern times classic 'the kid' and to add his little heavy-duty side kick spencer breslin is a perfect addition to this sparkling story of childhood to adult and back to childhood adventure. chi mcbride is an inspirational supporting character, as he is the heavy-weight champ, teaching 'little' rusty how to box to defend himself against the bullies on the playground. all in all this is a real winner of a movie with even lillie tomlin as the secretary and aide to russell. i originally saw this back in 2000' and then again years later, with equal enjoyment. this is a shiny family comedy that has a super ending that will warm the hearts of any disney fan recommended highly (*****)

when the first trailer for this film was viewed by myself, i was curious as to what angle the storyline would take. after all the plot of having one's childhood self return to the present leaves open many options. bruce willis however does a superb job in the role he was given. i was surprised to see just how well he could act in this part. this is also a good career move as many others have said but after seeing it i now agree. this film is mainly about remembering the kid you used to be, and coming to the realization that you aren't the adult you planned to be. this is a wonderful story and a gripping tale that makes us all think. usually we scorn at "what if..." movies. for example, waterworld attempted to answer the question "what if the world were to be covered with water and...?" but truthfully, nobody cared. this movie however effects everyone in the theatre. true, young children may not fully grasp the idea of growing up and having all your dreams fizzle away, but it leaves a great impact on the adults and parents of those children. this movie is definitely worth seeing. although, it will be better the second time around because you won't be thinking so much (about how the kid got there, and why and all that stuff) just relax and have fun. and take something with you when you leave that cinema. take that piece of your childhood you've forgotten and enjoy it.

the kid - at 39 years old russel duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a great job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money. but everything comes at a cost, in this case no social life, no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone. he just needs someone to show him the way.as i watched the movie, i kept wondering why disney didn't pass this film on to miramax - not because it's particularly daring or edgy, but because it is clearly a movie for adults. this is exacerbated by the marketing campaign which is clearly targeting children - it is lumped in with trailers for "rugrats the movie", and "pokemon 2000" (aren't they passe yet?). but i quibble.i was impressed by the sensitive treatment of the subject matter - rather than the typical male midlife crisis that involves some pathetic sap buying a porsche convertible and acting like a moron, willis' character undertakes some serious introspection and takes stock of his life. his guide on this journey of self-discovery is himself at age 8 (they never explain how rusty arrives and frankly, i didn't care). young rusty's innocence and unbridled optimism give him a distinct advantage in divining the truth - he sums up russell's job as an image consultant thusly, "you teach people how to lie and pretend to be something they aren't". in order for a good script to succeed, however, you need actors to bring it to life. not a problem here.although willis has thrice ignored w.c. fields' warnings about starring with children or animals he has lucked out once again, meshing as well comedically with breslin as he did dramatically with osment. willis manages to balance russell's cutthroat powerbroker traits with vulnerability and confusion, without becoming ridiculous. breslin meanwhile gives a dead on portrayal of a kid from everyone's childhood - the one that always stuck out for some reason and got picked on. we also get two bonus performances: lily tomlin is great as russell's levelheaded assistant and jean smart is perfect as an insightful charming anchorwoman (i loved her in "guinevere").the kid is charming, heavy, and real. and it will appeal to adults of all ages.

from a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, this one is definitely worthwhile. this is the second bruce willis film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity, off-color humor, profanity, or gratuitous violence. (i refer of course to the sixth sense.) both movies are engaging on more than one level. this one is appropriate for children as well, although as others have pointed out, it isn't a flick for kids. i was bothered that the time travel device that drives this plot is never explained, except that we know russell himself initiates it as a 70 year old. also, why does his dying mother have to come to school to get him when he wins the fight; why, if as his older self says, he has to fight that kid again and again for the next few years does his mother not have to come and get him every time, and why he doesn't learn to kick butt in the process. i also found the score rather annoying and not always appropriate to the action on stage. good use of the red plane as metaphor, however.

the kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant, russ duritz, who has lots of money, a good job, nice house, etc. the only problem is he doesn't have much of a social life as nobody seems to like him as he isn't always very nice. one day though things are about to change when an eight year old version of himself magically appears. this gives russ a second chance to make things right. bruce willis plays the lead role here and he gives a really good performance. the kid is a nice, heart-warming movie for everyone.

this is a totally awesome movie! if you haven't seen it yet, you damn well should. sure, the plot is slow to develop, the special effects are laughable, the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed, but as wrestler ddp would say; that's not a bad thing....that's a good thing! everything about this movie is hilarious, especially if you get the dubbed version, which has even worse actors. it's countless laughs until you get to the end, yearning for the sequel, where the mummy fights wrestling women. thus, i give it ten stars. unless you're one of those 'discriminating' and 'intelligent' people with good taste, who likes only 'high quality' films of the highest calibre, i recommend this utterly monkeydellic movie!

what a film. quite possibly the best i've ever seen, the direction, the production,the score and the cinematography,absoloutley wonderful. the acting is also excellent, and the man/robot scenes have to be seen to be belieived. i can not recommend this film enough. get it out on video now, turn the lights down and enjoy.

this flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of k gordon murray. that's because it was easy to find. it was on every public domain label in the vhs era, and before that, a late night t.v. cult classic, double knee thigh slapper. besides, how do you resist the title?for late comers, a brief explanation of it's merit: florida wheeler dealer k. gordon murray imported mexican horror films, dubbed them into english, then made a mint with them at the drive in. the mexican originals were weird enough to begin with; american boundaries and accepted horror film conventions were cheerfully disregarded. great, great set design and lighting were placed beside weird or laughable special effects. nothing in hollywood was as close as these were to out and out strange. now, mix in catholic influenced social conventions, mexican folk lore, and we are not in kansas anymore. add to that the english scripts they were dubbed into. most were written by reuban guberman, who wanted words to match movements of the actors lips on screen, not the literal translation. as a result the american soundtracks tended to run from overwrought to down right loopy. there's even a fan web site for murray that prints the best, most over the top lines for each movie. first time viewers to the films complain about the pacing, the purple prose, the production values and are told it's supposed to be that way..while the people laugh with enjoyment over things normally considered fatal film flaws. it all must be very confusing if you don't have a taste for it.this one was made back to back in 1957 with the two previous films in the series; the aztec mummy and curse of the aztec mummy. all three are now available on the 3 disc aztec mummy collection (bci) and it's about time. it has the k gordon murray version on one side, the original mexican production on the other side. the contrast between the two is fascinating. a lot of the times the original spanish is not much saner.robot/mummy starts off with a nice long flashback bringing you up to speed on the previous episodes, sort of..continuity was tossed out the window in number two, and it's downhill from there, logic wise. you don't even get the angel back, or any mention of him in this final episode. names, places, even family trees switch between films. after a while, you start looking for the continuity changes. by now, the series villain doc krupp is totally pig biting mad, nearly drooling with dementia and still wants to steal the aztec breastplate. rosita arenas is sent back to the past with another nice edit of the aztec mummy floor show, and wanders out into the dark in her nightie to help find that doggone breastplate again. the mummy isn't any happier with this then he was last time.the robot actually has a production credit. it was made by 'viana & co s.a.'. i mention this, because it looks like the grips came up with it between takes on a slow afternoon when the real costume went walkabout. nope.this was planned. wait until you see the controller it runs from. x box, where were you when krupp needed you??? the robot looks crushed to death at the end, but actually came back in two more mexican made movies..it had a fan base.. all in all, a funny quirky finish to a three movie series. sit back and enjoy.

this was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long. there was an aspect of film-noir contained in this movie and i am glad that nolan picked to film it in black and white. the plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged. even the dialogue was good along with the acting. it reminded me of what was to come in memento by not being in chronological order. i liked how the main character tried to use what cobb taught him for example saying "everyone has a box" which he put his personal things into. also, on the writer's door was the batman logo which seemed ironic because christopher nolan would later direct batman begins and the dark knight, two other great movies. there is a great twist in the end which i'm not going to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, even though i kind of figured what would happen when cobb gave the young man d lloyds credit card. i also liked how the writer had a copy of the republic by plato one of my favorite philosophical books. this is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full aspect of it, plus it only being an hour long. there is also a circular aspect to it by ending where it began which i thought was pretty brilliant.

this film is superb, it has the same low-budget first film feel of 'pi' and 'clerks', but has the style of 'memento' (also by writer/director christopher nolan). the score, sound effects, photography and editing are almost 'memento' prototypes, and the story shows that christopher nolan is best when writing and directing. don't be put off by the low-budget look and acting, or even the short length of the film, and just watch it!

saw this at the hong kong international film festival, over three years ago. i went in with no expectations since christopher nolan was a no-name at the time, but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things i saw at that festival. it worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood. mr.nolan gave a good account of its making at the end, enough to put anybody off starting out as a film-maker! i liked it better than memento although this was, perhaps, due to the lower expectations. and the fact that it was more of an art house movie.

i'm amazed that memento (which is an excellent flick) is so well-regarded in the top 250 and this one doesn't even appear!! what the hell is that?? to be honest - when this movie ended my knee-jerk reaction was that this movie is better than memento. after the euphoria of the fabulous ending wore off, i concluded that they are equal in their excellence. i am just confused about why its not in the top 50 along with memento. i'm going to venture a guess that (sadly) it's because it's in black and white or because (again sadly)that the characters all have british accents ...sadly because that is no reason to not appreciate a great movie like this.i'm telling you that if you loved memento, you will love following as well. brilliant!

following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood. the plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology. the event sequence complicates following following. if you are willing to pay attention, it is an exciting movie full of noir earmarks. with the running time at 70 minutes, there is a lot to take in, but the fast pace helps to keep the viewer enthralled.bill is a lonely, untidy fellow who takes up shadowing people and seeing where they go-what they do. he is a bit too conspicuous, however, and eventually gets caught by a well dressed, clean-cut bloke named cobb. cobb entangles bill in a world the poor boy is not prepared to live in. cobb is a smart rogue who seems to have complete control over the other characters. by the end of the film the disjointed story is explained thoroughly. the film is an excellent first effort from the talented christoper nolan, who would go on to make memento, one of the most original movies of our time.

this is an excellent film, but momento (nolan's other big budget film) is much better . i would recommend people go to see momento and then if they like that, see this film. the film is shot in black and white which i was a bit annoyed with at first but once into the film you understand black and white is the best way for the film to be seen. it is extremely gripping and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is made is extremely clever. elements of the storyline i think are a bit daft but the film is definitely worthy of a second viewing. to conculde the film has a clever plot, clever twists and turns, very good acting and bearing in mind the budget of the film i have to say that it is pretty amazing.

there are two things that i noticed in this film. (this is not a spoiler, just a mistake in storytelling.) when cole takes bill to his first b&e, he finds the "box". as soon as cole finds it he says, "the box. everyone's got a box". a minute later, just before he dumps the contents on the floor he says, "we're actually very fortunate. you don't see these often".observation #2 (spoiler alert!)i had to watch the thing three times, i couldn't figure a couple of things out. then i watched the chronological version and saw that they were having flash backs from the latter to the previous during the time changes. so at some points we were actually watching three different times in about 1 min of wall time.that was a good thing because i don't know how many more times i could watch it before returning it to netflix.color me obsessive.

an excellent debut movie for the the director of batman begins, comes the following, a movie about a man who follows other people for inspiration of characters in stories he writes. one man he follows, he decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he bargained for.using a cast of non-actors and his uncle, writing directing producing and otherwise completely making this movie entirely on his own with almost no budget and produced independently, this movie is much more than you'd expect.for anyone who likes memento and complex twists, turns, shocks, and messing around with time, this is definitely a movie for you.

christopher nolan's first film is a 'no budget' black and white film about a unemployed writer who begins following strangers, which in turn leads to robbery and also violence. it is very good.like in his later film 'memento' he doesn't present the story in a linear way. instead it jumps around somewhat so you end up really sucked in trying to piece it all together and early, apparently random, shots take on significance as the film progresses. this style also means the twists are much more effective.definitely worth seeing if you get the chance (especially if you like his later work and/or film noir)

brit director chrstopher nolan now has a career in america, and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed; but this small film was where he started. and it certainly showcased his talent, with its striking black-and-white cinematography and achronological storytelling that prefigures his later 'momento', albeit in a less extreme way. thematically and mechanistically, the plot reminded me of david mamet's 'house of games', but the film still feels fresh and sharp, right up to the final twist of the ending whose flavour was expected, but whose pointedness is unexpectedly delicious. the acting, on the other hand, is not quite in the same class - the film has a stylised quality, and possibly to a greater extent than the director intended. but it's still a fine debut, simultaneously claustrophobic and beguiling.

chris nolan's labyrinth like noir about voyeurism and identity is amazing from start to finish. a first film is as complex as "memento" or "the prestige", though maybe a little harder to get a handle on. still it smacks of originality and creative drive, and has a "twist" as intellectually challenging as it is realistic pulp. few film makers have made as good of use of their editors and attention to narrative that nolan has. the story is about a bored writer who likes to follow random strangers down the street, until he follows someone, whose noticed him following others, and has been following him in tern, from there the complexity escalates and identities begin to rearrange. more naturalistic and realist than nolan's later work but just as razor sharp.

following is a little-known 1998 british film, which was made with a budget of ¬£8000 and has a running time of 70 minutes. when watching it, you'd never expect its director to go on to make it in hollywood and become one of the most acclaimed and celebrated directors of the 21st century ¬ñ well, everybody has to start somewhere i suppose.the director of following, as you probably already know is englishman christopher nolan, who directly after following would go on to direct the critically-acclaimed independent film memento; a few years later he would be hired by warner bros. to direct the new batman series, which further brought him acclaim, and so on and so forth. my point is, everybody has to start somewhere ¬ñ even if it's not in the most astounding debut ¬ñ and christopher nolan introduces himself to the world in 1998 with following.when watching it, i couldn't help but draw resemblances to another directorial debut, avant-garde auteur david lynch's eraserhead. following is not a surrealist psychological horror film in that sense, but the similarities are noticeable; most notable, it's shot in grainy black-and-white and has an atmosphere about it that makes it unique. it's hard to describe in words, but it loosely resembles the smoky atmosphere you'd find in the film noirs of old. hence, it can be said that following is a contemporary film noir, or a neo-noir. overall, it's an amalgamation of that and a psychological thriller, and the story is most appropriate to these two genres.the main character is nameless, and the movie's title stems from an early, obsessive-compulsive trait he possessed ¬ñ randomly picking out people on the street and following them, sometimes even for hours on end. during one of these 'stalking expeditions', the main character becomes noticed by one of the people he is following, and is confronted. turns out that the 'confronter' is a man who is willing to befriend our narrator, and he introduces himself; his name is cobb, and he's a petty burglar who invites the narrator to follow him on his burglaries.from there, the main character becomes swept up in cobb's world, and he becomes embroiled in crime, passion and violence as he gets more and more intimate with cobb. following is not so much a character study, but instead a film which follows the tumultuous relationship between these two main characters, and the devastating ramifications it has on our narrator. nolan succeeds in making the film resemble a film noir, and emulates the respective atmosphere well.as a thriller, following is taut and atmospheric; however as a film in general, it's somewhat of a disappointment. if not that, then one could definitely call it underwhelming. the entire film is shot in a non-chronological and non-linear fashion, and it makes the story and film-experience unique, to some extent ¬ñ this style has been done so many times now it's almost commonplace technique ¬ñ and the story itself is unique to some extent.however, following is ultimately underwhelming for the entire film, and is disappointingly unspectacular. the story calls for more ¬ñ more action, more suspense and more thrills ¬ñ but it becomes too embroiled in its own storyline, and instead focuses on creating an intricate story. following does succeed in doing that, but without any other elements it's a film noir that doesn't quite work out; it's got a sense of emptiness which isn't enormous, but still noticeable nonetheless. furthermore, the film's shocking revelation at the end ¬ñ almost a mandatory convention in film noirs ¬ñ is one that makes us feel cheated; it's unpredictable and comes out of nowhere, but in relation to the story it's disappointing, as it essentially makes the preceding scenes, and the entire film, seem like an enormous waste of time.but the positives far outweigh the negatives, and in the end following turns out to be a flawed but satisfying film, yes, everybody has to start somewhere. christopher nolan does it with following, and he does it in a fine manner. a quiet, meek but fine manner. it's not the most astounding movie, and it isn't quite worthy of the accolades the director would go on to receive in the following decade, but it's still a good film nonetheless. when singling out following, you find a well-made, taut and atmospheric thriller, one which lacks noticeable nuance or innovative style but still manages to grip audiences nonetheless.

the debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured, if limited, stab at the con game and obsession. filmed for zero money, nolan couldn't have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of london to ply his trade, given the lack of funds. this short (67 min) is at its best in playing with the audience's and protagonist's expectations about who is scamming whom, though the initial set-up does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept. the muddy cinematography (he often used natural lighting due to budget) can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization, though the limitations do show at times.one can easily see nolan's style developing in this fledgling effort; many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in memento and insomnia. not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and nolan fans.

christopher nolan's first directorial effort, a year before he did "memento," and this is almost as brilliant as that classic. he uses time differentials in a similar manner to tell his story, and it's a very clever one.bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about. one day, he follows this man, cobb, who turns the tables and confronts bill, who breaks down and confesses what he's up to. cobb is a burglar and he takes bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes. both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them. but there's an ulterior motive for cobb nurturing this relationship, and it all ties in very smartly at the end. no, i won't spoil it but this is a very cool movie and i'm beginning to think christopher nolan is a genius.if you like suspense films with surprise endings, this one is a must see.

christopher nolan's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out. shot on a micro budget of $6,000 this is a student film with real class. the film is shot in black and white, and features people who you assume are friends of nolan's appearing in the movie. this is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good. you could see jeremy theobald and alex haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven't since this was made 6 years ago.nolan's thriller, much like memento, does not play chronologically, it shifts the scenes around much like pulp fiction. the writing is fantastic. it is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting. i thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent.for a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all, this is so good. it is superior to most that hollywood studios offer and nolan after three films (this, the superior memento and the not quite as good but still excellent insomnia) has cemented himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times. i can't wait for batman.this film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch. it is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising. i also thought that the score from david julyan was also excellent, very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it. he has gone on to compose nolan's other films. overall i would recommend this, i intend to get all of nolan's films. this is a low budget gem. *****

"you were on your way up and you tripped on a skirt !" gilligan says to jim leonard. that sums up the plot of this story of up and coming leonard (a young humphrey bogart) when his dream gets sidetracked by the bombshell heiress carol, played by dorothy mackaill. leonard has been working on a new and improved motor, but now his love life and motor company both have their ups and downs in this 68 minute shortie. bogart hadn't developed the quiet, brooding style yet. good performances by most of the supporting characters - her butler, his co-workers, a sister, interlopers along the way. some adult themes, since it was done just before they really enforced the film code, but it's still tame compared to what is on tv today. directed by thornton freeland, a year before freeland directed the incredible "flying down to rio".

humphrey bogart in his first starring role looks very young, acts well, but has a pronounced lisp only hinted at later in his career. still, he's very good and very appealing as the idealistic young inventor of a new airplane motor.dorothy mackaill is the real star here, playing a once-rich woman who's torn between her real love for bogart (he's broke too) and the comfort and security of marrying an older man (hale hamilton).along for the ride are astrid allwyn as bogart's trampy sister, bradley page as her would-be producer, barbara leonard as the cosmetologist, jack kennedy as gilligan, and halliwell hobbes as the faithful (and wise) butler).both mackaill (whi had been a star in silent films) and bogart were trying to gain a toehold in talkies in 1932. bogart was a slow-rising actor from the broadway stage; mackaill was slipping and would soon appear in skid-row production like picture brides. yet they are both very good here. mackaill wasn't even 30 when she appeared in this film!

i just found the entire 3 dvd set at wal-mart in the bargain bin for $5.50, so i thought i would take another look. total of 13 hours to watch it all (26 episodes). i was born in 1948 and saw most of them on tv in the sixties. many independent stations repeated them for many years.better than i expected actually, time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of it's creators, and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all the allied fighting men and women. more abstract and arty than a straight forward documentary, but very truthful in it's depiction of the causes and final results of wwii. that war was greatly dependent on sea transportation, and the final victory was dependent on who achieved the final mastery of the world's oceans. the allies were the ones who were able to do it.interesting too, to see how they try to strike a balance between big events, and the individual soldiers and sailors that made them happen. the score is impressive, if a bit too much by today's standards. i read somewhere that robert russell bennett contributed just as much as richard rodgers to final score. i imagine that rodgers provided all the major themes, and it was up to bennett to fit them to the images. great job!should be seen by every ruler, or potential ruler. a warning to tyrants that wars are eventually won by ideals, determination, and the supplies to back them up. logistics: their quality and delivery will determine the eventual victors. the allies outproduced and surpassed the material quality of the axis, attacked their very source in the process, and insured their eventual defeat.sorry to see that the producer, henry salomon, lived a very short life. imdb's facts were rather skimpy, i have to find out more about him. he did a few more outstanding documentaries before his early death. might have more to say at a later timetrivia: i had all 3 lp records made of the background music, pretty good overall. unfortunately, the producers decided to add sound effects to the last one, relegating immediately to just novelty status, rather than for serious music listening. too bad too, because it contained some interesting but more minor themes in the series. silly stuff like 16 inch guns firing, torpedoes being fired, bulldozers, planes...just for kids mainly.rsgre

i spotted this film in a branch of the duane reed pharmacy in new york on holiday, and it seemed like a bit of silly fun. and sure enough, the whole premise is ridiculous beyond words - but it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable action film for kids, and their parents too.10-year-old ricky bernard (jordan garrett) has his head in the clouds most of the time, much to his father's (larry miller) dismay. as a member of his school orchestra, ricky and schoolmates fly to a concert performance ... and once again ricky's mind 'takes off' and suspects some criminal plot is happening.reluctantly aided by best friend sashi, who is a fan of hot sauce (what a strange plot device that was) and others they try to get to solve the mystery. oh yes, and ricky's skills 1,000 hours of flight simulator experience prove to be handy when he is called on to save the day in the film's thrilling climax! it was good to see eric roberts and mark dacoscos play parts in a family film. and watching the dvd interviews everyone seems to have had great fun taking part.i totally liked junior pilot; charming and good-natured performances, funny plot line and a real; sense of enjoyment and sheer silliness.if you are looking for an entertaining family film, you could do far worse than buy this one.

definitely worth renting! good clean family entertainment. my 4 and 5 year-olds (and i) loved it. kept them on the edge of their seats. i recommend parents sit with their younger children to watch this, as it can be quite suspenseful for them. it's not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your children, and so this is a rare find. some of the acting / realism isn't quite there at times, or maybe is a little corny, but children don't seem to notice or care, they love it. parts are predictable, but other parts are not - like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. the movie doesn't have any really scary/creepy stuff, and so i doubt it will give children nightmares. it does inspire children to dream, which is something we need to encourage and foster more in our children. rent and be blessed!

this was a great movie. it had one "sot-so-nice" outburst. plus there were some very intense (drama) scenes which might make it inappropriate for younger viewers, under 6.for a under the radar film, the acting was quite enjoyable, and touched down in our family room for a near perfect landing. it held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it end.this movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day, but was given a somewhat more believable scenario. the dream scenes were a distraction at first, but did a great deal to establish the plot. the pranks and hi-jinx were also quite amusing.we hope you like as much as we did.

this film is titled "junior pilot" here on imdb but "final approach" at netflix. go figure! the movie is a delight for both the target youth audience and for adults who can suspend their maturity long enough to watch this film through the eyes of their own youth. for the adult, the story is quite predictable, and perhaps trite and melodramatic; whereas the tale may seem new and creative to youngsters who have not yet seen or read many films or books with such a story line.in any case, credit must be given to the film's creators, particularly the director james becket and the cinematographer denis maloney, for making this most entertaining and visually interesting film. the cut-aways to the young protagonist ricky's fantasy thoughts are hilarious as well as delightfully filmed.the young actors give uniformly believable performances, seemingly quite invested in their roles--silly as many scenes are. jordan garrett plays the protagonist "ricky" with quite well, having excellent camera presence. jeffrey tedmori creates a delightfully soft and sensitive "shashi" who of all ridiculous things thrives on hot sauce. skyler samuels and adam cagley give solid performances as well.as is typical of his always fine acting, larry miller creates a solid parental figure around which the children's part-real, part-fantasy world revolves. compared to his father-figure, the other major adult roles appear to be shallow and one-dimensional, intentionally and quite humorously so, to be sure.this movie is a simplistic youth-targeted story, of course, yet it is quite entertaining, perhaps repeatedly so to the targeted youth crowd, but also for at least one viewing by adults who retain the ability to view such a film from their once-youthful perspective.

i've just watched this with my three children - 12yrs (boy), 10yrs (boy) and 8yrs (girl) and this film was good old fashioned family action adventure. although definitely aimed at the kid market (i'd say 5 to 13)it was certainly watchable and as a parent it is a pleasure to find a movie that appeals to a broad range of ages whilst still being suitable for the whole family to watch - particularly younger children.the story revolves around ricky, a bit of a nerd with a vivid imagination (this can definitely be seen in his daydream sequences) who foils a kidnapping and major art theft while on on-board a flight to washington for a school trip. ricky's dad is an airplane mechanic, so ricky not only knows the structure of the aircraft inside out but is also a top-gun on his computer flight simulator. this comes in handy when the pilot and co-pilot are out cold through a series of misadventures and there is no-one left to fly the plane. i don't want to give away any more of the plot.

i never heard of mishima before i watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious, i still find myself drawn to watch it when it is repeated on the box. at the beginning of the film, we are told about a celebrated japanese writer behaves like a lunatic and commits seppuku in public. as the film progresses you are gently inducted into twisted logic of mishima's mind. the stages of his life are are presented in four chapters. each chapter itself is a blend of two contrasting narratives, the first continues the story with scenes from mishima's life and appear in black and white. the second narrative is an adaptation of scenes from a novel and these are staged like a play and filmed in vivid colours. there is a different novel staged in each chapter. between each chapter, the narrative returns to the present, as mishima proceeds towards his eventual ritual suicide. this means that the drama and tension is maintained until the end.i suspect that many people will find this film to be boring pretentious and art-house. i respect that, this is not a film for people who want action and a strong story line. if on the other hand you are the kind of person who relishes the opportunity to penetrate the mind a bizarre man while watching his life story told in collage of beautiful pictures set to music by philip glass, you will love it. i loved it.

i saw this originally on channel 4 (uk) and it was a fantastic film that left a great impression on me. however i saw it on irish tv recently and there was an added narration by roy scheider ("we're going to need a bigger boat!"). this ruined the film for me. his droning monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film, and if anything takes from the films brilliance. i wonder at the new dvd version that has no roy (due to legal reasons?) would stop people from buying it. well believe me, the film is much better for it!cheersdamian

this movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet, mishima. it jumps around through his past, through his last day, and through some of his stories but is expertly constructed as it moves from section to section. it captures the flavor of the man, his work and of his times...the difficult 1960s.i think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of "wonder") are the excerpts from his works. the sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective. they could be used as exemplars for any set designer. i woke up at night dreaming of the golden pagoda. the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art. after watching this film, i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or japanese history.

mishima: a life in four chapters is an art-house biography about yukio mishima, celebrated japanese writer, who bears resemblance to paul schrader's earlier character travis bickle (taxi driver): both of them are lonely people searching for their place in their society and when they realize that world doesn't need them, they try to destroy their surrounding universe.if you want to learn about life of mishima, then you won't find a lot of information here, because it shows that he didn't live a very interesting life (except for his final day), but if you want to understand his personality, then it is the best movie of its kind, as most of the movie is adaptation of his novels and also provides a guide to his thoughts. this movie shows that mishima was a person, who witnessed the fall of japanese culture, which he was very fond of and with his final act he tried to save traditions and prove to himself that he is a real warrior, but he realized that as a person he was just a man with no power to change the events.

paul schrader and his brother leonard wrote mishima, and in so doing, clearly drew parallels between the life of yukio mishima and his work. the film is divided into four sections: beauty, art, action, and the fateful day when mishima held an army general hostage and spoke to the garrison, only to have it ridicule him and his bushido ideals of the samurai code. mishima committed ritual seppuku on november 25, 1970, and he planned it as a meshing of beauty, art, and action. schrader edits scenes recreating that day with three different scenarios from mishima's novels: temple of the golden pavilion, kyoko's house, and runaway horses. the moment of seppuku is perfectly realized in relation to its shocking climax via pulling back the camera while simultaneously zooming in. black and white sequences are intermingled with the colorful moments depicted in mishima's novels. the black and white scenes represent memories from mishima's childhood and youth. schrader correlates some of these autobiographical moments with scenes from the novels that often parallel mishima's real life, such as his stammer, development of his bodybuilding obsession, and his fostering of the samurai code. each of the three themes of beauty, art, and action is exemplified in the chosen depictions from the respective novels. the color sequences are reminiscent of early, stagy technicolor films, giving the film, perhaps, an intended surreal quality considering the subject matter.ken ogata plays the real mishima with unfailing determination, headed to the general's office on that fateful day and resembles the real mishima. schrader took tremendous risks with this film in focusing on the novels he did and with tying them thematically to both mishima's personal life and his literary ambitions. the editing of the film between the three main sections of november 25, 1970, the black and white growing up segments, and the colorful novel scenes clearly point to the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty, art, and action in mishima's life. at times, it is difficult to follow, and there may be little to recommend for the uninitiated viewer. *** of 4 stars.

this is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art. this is an oblivious labour of love by the schrader brothers about the life of yukio mishima that is full truly artistic elements. the movie jumps from color to black and white, past to present, fictional works by mishima to him. all without being confusing in the least bit. the only thing that gets me is that the entire movie, with the exception of the narrator's spoken parts is in japanese. still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but hasn't found won. criterion, if you are reading this, this is a film that should be released under your imprint with as much extras as possible. this film truley deserves more. 10/10

"mishima: a life in four chapters" is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative ease. it is based on the life of controversial japanese author yukio mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. it is not really a biopic - at least not one in the traditional sense - but an exploration of mishima's iconoclastic oeuvre. the film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an unembroidered, totally engaging manner. paul schrader makes you sympathize with mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work. it doesn't quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it. an added bonus: as we see mishima's fury over the lack of tradition in a morally vacant modern society, schrader gives us an excellent demonstration of the dichotomy between thought and execution in cinema. john bailey's cinematography is spectacularly good. the grandiosity of composer philip glass' work is perfectly suited for the project. "mishima" is the best film i've seen this year, so far.

anything park chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant, and very twisted at a minimum. well, anything that isn't i'm a cyborg at least. park's newest film titled thirst is a vampire romance-erotic-thriller-dark comedy-drama ¬ñ yes, that is a lot of adjectives ¬ó inspired by the 19th century french novel by emile zola titled therese raquin. park creates a uniquely korean, and uniquely park, vision of the vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a catholic priest discovering himself having a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop. park delivers on the elements you would hope but definitely falls short of masterpiece quality like oldboy or even that of lady vengeance. heavily bloated with a narrative that often loses itself much less the audience, thirst desperately needed another trip through the cutting room. it crawls when it should be running but luckily brings it back home before losing the audience completely. as negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted zeitgeist of park chan-wook film.check out the rest of our review at www.thefilmstage.com

although at times i was the only one in the cinema who was laughing, this is the main pleasure i took from the beautifully shot "thirst" - laughter. although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and didn't know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy, the blackest of black humour shone through at regular intervals. it helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful, and that i was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady, who was gorgeously elegant no matter how blood soaked and malevolent she became.i read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong. i didn't think so. in fact the last scenes, moving and hilarious (i mean, the brown shoes....) by turns, were among the best in the film.

ms. stowe is sensational in this power drama about a secret policeman who interrogates a children's author because he believes she is trying to plant ideas in her writings that are contrary to the state's. this is an incredibly powerful film. both performances are worthy of more recognition as is the message of this movie. put this on your must see list if you can locate it.

rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion. what makes this film so unsettling is that the drama feels so real, it's almost hard to remember that it's only a movie. this is by far madeline stowe and alan rickman's performance of their careers. the film almost feels like a theatrical production the way it is staged and lit. the only bad thing about this movie is that it's very difficult to get a copy of it. i have yet to see it other than on laserdisc. this truly powerful film deserves a digitally remastered transfer and special edition treatment on dvd. it really is that good.

what would it be like to be accused of being a subversive? this is what this film explores through the eyes of 2 characters, one being the accused subversive, the other being the interrogator. it is a frightening journey from the beginning to the end. this film is not for everybody and if you do not understand political governments thoroughly, you will never get the point of this film, as proved by 90% of the reviews here.

this movie took me by surprise. i first saw it more than 10 years ago, and it stays with me still. it's got it's just plain boring points, and i, personally, would have ended it differently- this has not in the least bit discouraged me from watching it over and over and recommending it to others. the acting is _fantastic_. the cast and director do an amazing job with the script, and anyone who likes 'different' movies, who has the patience to sit and say, "what the hell is this?", and allow themselves to be drawn in should give this film a chance. if you just want alan rickman to be goofy or to see things explode this is not the movie for you.

i really love this movie. it has a very real feel to it. i believe it was never popular because of the subject matter, however, because of the subject matter, it makes the movie all that much more important.this is an "a" movie and i recommend it highly. if you liked "1984" book or movie, i think you will like this one as well.this is harsh, to say the least, including mental and physical acts of torture, some pretty vile. not for the week at heart or stomach. no gore, but his movie is so great at projecting the mental anticipation it doesn't need blood and guts.if you are not a realist or a pestimistic person i don't think you will enjoy it. it leaves you with an uneasy feeling about humans, what they're capable of, and the very real possibility that our government(s)does not necessarily have our personal best interest in it's heart.

i am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie. the acting is astonishing, the movie itself is powerful and clear, and the issues involved are handled with subtlety and depth.this is an important movie. it could be profoundly transformative.i would pay good money never, ever to see it again. because it *is* so good and so complex, it is extremely difficult to watch. i admit that my taste in movies tends strongly toward light entertainment; the visual medium can be so powerful that i tend to avoid it for anything really important. those of you with greater fortitude than i have may find it easier to handle.but i strongly encourage people to see it at least once. preferably with others, so you can talk to each other, and have someone around to remind you that there's more to the world than the movie.

even the trailer for this movie makes me cry, like the first time i saw this movie. not for people who are easily upset by intense material! the finest performances by alan rickman and madelaine stowe, without a doubt. this dreadful tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture it's citizens for any reason, whether they are anarchist's or the writer of children's books will chill you to the bone. i saw it when it first came out 1991 and i remember every frame. it still scares the hell out me today. it's happening now.apparently, imdb requires ten lines to meet their criteria for a film review. imdb might want to get a grip! some of us are a little more succinct about writing opinions.

this two-character drama is extremely well-acted and has a valid message and some truly shocking moments (shocking not because they are graphic, but because you're not prepared for them when they come). but eventually it does become oppressive, just like the somewhat similar "a pure formality" did. still, alan rickman should have gotten an oscar nomination for his multi-dimensional performance, no doubt about it. (**1/2)

at the first glance of this film the camera angles immediately make you think that this is a low budget film that will bore you to tears or make you press the stop button. surprisingly, the storyline comes forward and is played through the screen in a way that i feel most would relate to. i scored this movie at 7 but like most would, felt it should be a 10, you will understand as you watch it because its a rare thing for a film to be in touch with a persons feelings and how life should be shown by a tv set. most films try to leave you in awe of their special effects, twists and turns etc, this film dealt a true hand showed a good film backed by an alabama style storyline that most would feel was a good waste of a couple of hours. wish i had put the popcorn maker on after all well done!

six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses. the one negative review happens to reside (or did) on the first page of the movie's location in the imdb.i found "what alice found" to be one of the best movies almost no one's heard of that i have seen this year. it's 6.4 rating is misleading and may be more a function of the difficult subject matter than the quality of the movie. who would think that a movie purportedly about truck stop prostitution would be worth seeing? guess again.for me, "alice" was a positively gripping psychological thriller. i was virtually on the edge of my seat the entire time. it's a very credible story with a realistic script and is very well cast. in a fairer world, actress judith ivey would win awards for keeping you guessing whether she was good or evil.ignore the rating and see this terrific movie. (and by the way, i wish there was a soundtrack album.)

there's nothing much to the story. a young woman steals some money from the dreary vermont supermarket where she works, decides to run away to florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend julie, and encounters an odd couple on the highway. if you remember the elderly couple from "rosemary's baby," you have some idea of what these two are like. bill has a comical face and is retired from the army. sandra is an ex stripper now become a truckstop whore, although we don't find this out at once. they're affectionate, helpful, and full of common sense.they more or less adopt the girl, alice, and promise to give her a ride in their elaborate rv, although they are not driving "directly" to florida.this is where the film could have gone one-hundred-percent wrong. all the film makers had to do was turn the elderly couple into the personification of evil. they would take the virginal alice (handcuffed to the bed or whatever) and sell her body to any greaseball driver who has a lot of money and likes rough sex. (alice would have had a heck of a time escaping, with lots of aborted attempts, before the final shootout.) but, no. the couple really is pretty nice, and alice is far from virginal. alice overhears sandra with a customer, asks about the business, and tries to turn a trick on her own. bill prevents anything from happening and insists she do the job right if she's going to do it at all. they don't talk her into it. they guide her.alice makes several hundred dollars, which is several hundred dollars more than she had when she met the couple. bill and sandra keep her money in the safe where customers aren't going to find it. alice misunderstands. she doesn't find whoring very pleasant work, and she thinks she'll never be paid off because every time she asks to be dropped off, sandra responds with, "what? not here, honey. not in the middle of nowhere." however, after she is talked into handing her gun over to sandra, the couple give her the money she wants and rather lovingly release her to continue her trip to florida.you know what i found the most tragic moment in the film? it had nothing to do with prostitution or thievery. alice has been expecting to room with her friend julie after she arrives in miami. julie is after all a legitimate student. but when alice calls her friend from someplace in alabama to assure her she's on her way but will be late, julie hesitates and says, "well -- my mother doesn't think you should room with us. and to tell you the truth, my roommate isn't cool on it either. i invited you down, sure, but i thought it was just like a visit for a week or something. go back to milford, alice" there is a long silence before alice hangs up.only one shot is fired (a few white frames of film) and no one is hit. tears appear only once. nobody slugs anybody else. no car explodes in a fireball. no cop chases them down the interstate.the direction is occasionally clumsy. too much cross-cutting between sandra trying to disarm alice and alice's hand holding the wobbling pistol. there is hardly any musical score. there is brief male and female nudity and it's awkward, as it's probably supposed to be. alice isn't unattractive but she is not babalicious either. she sports asiatic eyes, a kind of robust version of molly parker. the cinematography looks cheap and the colors are washed out. the direction is a straightforward narrative, with a few illuminating flashbacks. nothing is wasted. and it was all evidently shot around danbury, connecticut. the city sticks in my mind because i drove through it after one of its floods and remember the cars caked with a film of mud all the way up to the door handles.i don't know exactly what alice found. (i dread even thinking that the answer to the riddle is that "she found herself.") the acting isn't bad at all. judith ivey is better than that. it's definitely worth seeing, a quiet, orderly film that treats the audience like adults.

as a fan of the book, this work is fantastically adapted; remaining true to the source materials, and demonstrating an honest respect for the literary work. the intrigues translate well to film by virtue of ron howard's good eye for detail and sound devotion to authenticity.i like hanks as robert langdon. his portrayal is genuine and earthy, with only the barest glint of the kip we all knew and loved, back in "the day." he is a good dramatic actor and, while i miss his comedic efforts, i do enjoy his more serious performances.the subject matter is no less controversial than the davinci code, and the vatican seems to never learn their lesson. as with the aforementioned film, the holy see issued a scathing rebuke and called for a global catholic boycott of the film, which of course, generated millions in ticket sales.although the story of the "god particle" was played down dramatically, and the science was written out of this piece of science fiction, the fiction that was left, was entertaining and extremely well done. and, the truth be known, people who have not read the book, will not notice any missing or lesser element to the story, as the screen version carries the main story well on its own.in fact, it is not necessary to have seen the first installment of this franchise, in order to enjoy this second, which should have been a prequel in all honesty, although that does not lessen the effectiveness, nor does it meddle with the continuity or flow of this second work.all in all, this is good for a friday/saturday night's viewing, although the execution may be a bit rough for the small ones.it rates an 8.8/10 from...the fiend :.

still haven't read a single dan brown book, but i watched all his movies adaptations. i won't fall into the game to rate this one with the previous because the scope isn't really the same: actually, this one is a thriller, a race against time filled with puzzles.the plot is very twisted, imaginative and the cast is excellent: i never been a great fan of hanks but he delivers well. i noticed his jeans shirt (the one spilled with blood) because i search for one like this in vain! the italian searcher is a brilliant newcomer for me but i really applauded ewan macgregor portrayal: his inner faith and calm is really impressive.i really like the debate between science and religion. the action taking place in the vatican, it felt like vacation. at last, i am not sure it helps to add new converts into christianism. with all the gold and man presence displayed, any one would ask what charity means and why women are so dismissed of the church life whereas they stand for half or more the believers.

was excited at the opening to hear part of "chevaliers de sangreal" but wanted more so i bought said hans zimmer piece. possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written! this movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even w/o the religious considerations. you get to tour the vatican and parts of rome with excellent cinematography. the opening at cern where the "god particle" or largest quantity of antimatter is created with stunning visuals is an immediate clue which foretells the excellence of this movie. who doesn't love hanks? the storyline and twists in this film are just superb and well drawn out until the amazingly twisted climax. this film suggests a satisfying compromise between science and religion though plenty of closed heads will persist on both sides. "science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind." a.einstein

three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow caused them to grow up without consciences. as their simultaneous tenth birthday celebrations approach, they become cunning and calculating cold-blooded murderers. nice-girl local teen joyce russel (lori lethin) finds herself confronting these little terrors when most others are falling for their angelic demeanors.hearkening back to films like "the bad seed" and "village of the damned", this films' premise of evil children may not be wholly original but it's still pretty disturbing. all three of the child actors - elizabeth hoy, billy jacoby, and andy freeman - are chillingly convincing. director ed hunt and his co-writer barry pearson maintain the unpleasant yet compelling mood for the duration of the film; they go so far as to have the little girl charge admission for an unwilling peep show involving her older sister (future stand-up comedienne and mtv personality julie brown, whose striptease is a real eyeful).name actors susan strasberg, as an icy teacher, and jose ferrer, with barely any screen time as a doctor, add to the proceedings with their presence, while k.c. martel, one of the youngsters from the original "the amityville horror", is very likable as joyces' kid brother. other familiar faces like ellen geer, b-movie he-man michael dudikoff, cyril o'reilly ("porky's", "dance of the damned"), joe penny ('jake and the fatman'), and william boyett ("the hidden") can be seen as well.touching upon such parental fears as children playing with guns that they've discovered and being locked inside old refrigerators, "bloody birthday" is a little more than just a slasher variation with kids as antagonists. aided and abetted by arlon obers' music score, this film sticks in the memory more than some of its brethren, without lots of gore to fall back on (although that arrow through the eye gag works quite well).bleak, nasty, and downbeat, "bloody birthday" is worth a look for the curious.7/10

rififi is a great film that is overlooked. it's a crime drama where a man gets out of jail and plans another job. it's an over used story but this one is different from the others. they round up the usual suspects for the job. this film takes a look at how the family gets torn apart as time goes on. the actual heist scene is one of the best i have ever seen. instead of a suspenseful soundtrack the director decided to go with silence, around thirty minutes of silence. this fits the mood perfectly and is often copied these days. of course things get out of hand and people die and it ends in a great ending that builds up in suspense.so if you're looking for a great film noir that not a lot of people talk about this is a great pick up.

"rififi" is a terrific heist movie, and one from which subsequent heist films have drawn ever since. jules dassin had a feel for the seedy underworld in which these thieves live---you will not find here the hollywood glamour of "ocean's eleven." the robbers in "rififi" don't rob for the thrill, and they're not playing a game. they rob to survive, to pay for their children's upbringing, to prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world. the much-lauded heist scene is a nail biter, filmed in virtual silence. i did have the feeling that the plot went on a bit longer than it needed to, but the high-speed race to deliver the child to his mother that ends the film is classic.be warned---this movie is very bleak. but it's also very good.grade: a-

what a gas of a movie! "film noir" has always been one of my favorite genres, but this one stands apart from the rest. only "the big sleep", "out of the past", "murder my sweet", and "the killers" can come close to this caper classic. i know these four american films i mentioned are not caper movies per se, but rather detective stories with complicated story lines, which still exude a "noirean", gritty quality about them, similar to "rififi".what is different here is the way jules dassin sets into motion the total ambiance of the film, not only in the gritty realism of the principals, but also in the usage of the streets of paris as a subliminal character and co-conspirator unto itself! the movie centers around "le stephanois", a dark, moody and complicated ex-con getting pulled into one last shot at the hefty payoff. even though he is an unsmiling and hard-nosed tough guy, one still senses in him a yearning for some kind of redemption by extricating himself from the demons of his past (hey, he saved little toni!). dassin picked the right guy (jean servais) for that role.that aside, the rest of the story development kind of falls into place as we journey through the famous "silent" caper scene to the the eventual demise of the principal "perps". only their women survive, except for ida, mario's honey. they seemed to best understand the underlying futility of it all!

to start with, i have done some further research on the film. firslty, jules dassin directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different film noir crime film. secondly, this was a very low budget film, created in the rennaissance of the prime moment of film noir. thirdly, the jewelers where the robbery was attempted is an actual jewelers. the producers of rififi asked them to film their, surprisingly, (i quote jules dassin in a recent interview on the subject, "surprisingly, for some not very obvious reason, they were delighted at the idea of a crime film being set in their shop). it's impeccable characters and plot fit in so beautifully with their surroundings. to add on to my praise i will say this; some might say that this was a typical hollywood film, on the contrary, this set the base for the regular plot of a hollywood crime film. laslty, i would like to say that i support this fresh idea of a film where not only one side wins, and that side doesn't always have to be the good one. for once, i can say that a film is not predictable! ten stars!

story about three eclipse (maybe even indigo, ha) children beginning their love for murder. oh, and the people who are "hot" on their trail.bloody birthday, a pretty mediocre title for the film, was a nice lil surprise. i was in no way expecting a film that dealt with blood-thirsty psychopath kids. and i may say it's also one of the best flicks i've seen with kids as the villains. by the end of the movie i seriously wanted these kids to die in horrible fashion.it's a really solid 80s horror flick, but how these kids are getting away with all this mayhem and murder is just something that you can't not think about. even the slightest bit of investigation would easily uncover these lil sh!ts as the murderers. but there seems to be only a couple police in town, well by the end, only one, and he seemed like a dimwit, so i suppose they could have gotten away with it. haha, yeah, and i'm a chinese jet-pilot.nevertheless, this movie delivered some evilass kids who were more than entertaining, a lot of premarital sex and a decent amount of boobage. no kiddin! if you're put off by the less than stellar title, dash it from your mind and give this flick a shot. it's a very recommendable and underrated 80s horror flick.

bloody birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters. steven (andy freeman), curtis (billy jayne;credited as billy jacoby), and debbie (elizabeth hoy), were all born on the same day during an eclipse. besides sharing a birthday, they also share a love of murder (and they're not picky about who they kill either). young billy, elizabeth, and andy play the parts of these emotionless monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too. but they can't go on fooling everyone. this is an overall good horror flick, its not too unrealistic, there are a few good moments of suspense and the kids portrayed the roles well, (the grown-ups are pretty hammy though). i'd say its well worth seeing, (i own a copy myself).

this agreeably perverse and oddball early 80's teen body count flick may never reach the astonishingly bent pinnacle of the deeply unsettling and criminally underrated murderous moppets movie "devil times five," but it's still an above average killer kid opus nonetheless.the slim, but serviceable plot centers on a trio of misfit tykes -- two bratty boys and one creepily twinkle-eyed, albeit angelic-looking little girl -- who are all born during a solar eclipse on june 9th, 1970. when the strange antisocial trio, who stick together in a tightly self-contained and exclusive circle, reach ten years of age they suddenly go homicidally bonkers and declare open season on the hapless, unsuspecting local yokels of the heretofore sleepy and peaceful california suburb of meadowvale. writer/director ed hunt, the usually incompetent unsung hack responsible for such wonderfully wretched clunkers as the delightfully dopey "starship invasions," the uproariously inane jesus christ vigilante parable (!) "alien warrior," and the stunningly silly "the brain," does a pretty solid and capable job here: the kill scenes are abundant and reasonably brutal (the arrow-through-the-eye gag is especially nasty), there's a sizable smattering of gratuitous nudity and soft-core sex, a goodly amount of tension is neatly created and maintained, some nice dollops of dark humor punctuate the arrestingly warped mayhem, and the surprise grim ending manages to be truly jolting.moreover, the top-drawer cast further elevates the proceedings to the perfectly watchable and absorbing: jose ferror as a small-town doctor, future "jake and the fatman" tv series star joe penny as an amateur astrologer, "the prey" 's lori lethin as the plucky babysitter heroine, susan strasberg as a bitchy school teacher, "american ninja" 's michael dudikoff as a chowderhead jock, and cyril o'reilly (the lonely misanthrope vampire in the hauntingly melancholy "dance of the damned") as a libidinous teen dude who gets bagged while doing just what you think with some naked hot chick in back of a parked van. billy jacoby (who went on to star in such late 80's direct-to-video dross as "dr. alien" and "demonwarp"), andy freeman, and especially the eerily adorable elizabeth hoy are genuinely creepy and convincing as the terrible troika of chillingly evil and amoral rugrats. and, yes, that's none other than julie brown, the brassy comedienne who scored a surprise top 40 hit with the hilarious novelty tune "the homecoming queen's gotta gun," as the lovely, vacuous, full-breasted redhead bimbo who does a great lengthy, totally extraneous, yet still sizzling and much-appreciated nude striptease while dancing in her bedroom to a cheesy blaring rock song! all in all, this baby sizes up as a sturdy and satisfying slasher item.

this movie is great. 80's sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse, so they kill everyone they see. the reason they kill makes practically no sense, but it just adds to the charm of this movie. and dang, these kids are crazy, especially curtis. if you've seen the movie, you know who i am talking about. that kid's vicous! although the movie doesn't have much gore, it is entertaining, and for some reason you kind of care about the characters. it also has some nice nudity. has some decent acting as well, really a decent 80's slasher movie, it's worth a look if you ever get the chance to see it. you'll have nightmares about those darn kids though, i guarantee you!

sorry about the "extremely clever" summary phrase. i don't know what i was thinking, but i really couldn't help myself.i've been meaning to see 'bloody birthday' for a long time and i must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price. and believe me, i live in a small south american village and these things are very unlikely to happen. it's a real shame that some of these 'gems' from the 80s are now almost completely forgotten. 'bloody birthday' is one of those movies that surprisingly ages well enough to remain watchable nowadays. not a masterpiece for sure, but still entertaining and guess what?... it doesn't really have unintentionally funny scenes. i know it's a shocker if we keep in mind that this is a low budget flick from the early 80s about a group of evil children who kill people. but trust me, the movie manages to remain respectable and watchable for the most part.in 'blood birthday', the story revolves around three children who are born during a a total eclipse. according to astrology, during eclipses, the sun and the moon block saturn, which controls emotions. as a consequence, the three children who are born that day, eventually become uncaring and evil. since they don't experience any feelings of remorse whatsoever, these 10-year-old kids gang up against basically everyone who stands in their way, including their own parents and siblings... and kill them! the body count increases day after day and the police authorities believe that there's a psychopath lurking around the place. in the meantime, debbie, curtis and steven, don't hesitate to keep butchering people, since nobody seems to suspect of those sweet angel faces (?)like i was saying before, 'bloody birthday' is surprisingly not funny. i know i said that before, but i'm truly surprised by this. i was expecting some hilariously bad scenes, but the movie proved me wrong. true, it's not exactly what most people would consider a 'serious' horror movie, but if i have to be fair, i'd say that the story is decently executed. one of the most important reasons why one would normally expect laughable situations (like i did), it's because in these kind of movies in which the main villains are children, the young actors tend to be plain awful and they make the whole thing laughable. let's face it: kids tend to be horrible actors, which is understandable and we can't blame them for that. but to my surprise, the three young actors who played the merciless killers in this film, looked very disturbing and not at all funny. the rest of the actors are also good and if you're a george clooney fan, you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie. yeah, i know right?... who cares?. also, julie brown, the great actress, singer, comedienne and gay icon, gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and in case anyone is interested in nudity: she also strips in one of the scenes and she looks great naked. too bad she didn't have more time on the screen though! julie is 'absolutely fabulous':pso basically, this movie is fine if you're in the mood for some modest horror from the 80s. my only objection regarding 'bloody birthday' would be the way to justify the children's motives. this is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film. let's see: if children who were born during an eclipse end up being heartless killers, then how come these three were the only ones who actually murdered people? i'm sure there were other children who had been born the same day... and during other days of total eclipse too, oh well!. overall, no big deal, it's just a simple observation, that's all. i've seen worse, trust me. take 'the children' (1980) for example, in which the precocious killer get their evilness after being turned into zombies by toxic cloud. no, believe me, 'bloody birthday' is far more decent and if you enjoy simple slashers, you're going to enjoy this one very much.so, now you know: you're invited to the children's birthday party... and the hosts will be serving a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests. come on, you can't miss it ;)

three ten-year-old children born at the same time during a solar eclipse begin to slyly murder anybody that offends them.while killer kid movies weren't exactly new at the time of this twisted 80's slasher the theme of children as murderers works nicely for this film. bloody birthday does deliver some good chills and suspense, while managing to be a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities. it straddles a fine line between cheesy and creepy, but it does remain entertaining throughout with an interesting plot. there's some strong murder scenes, as well as a good bit of nudity to establish this as a solid slasher guilty pleasure.the cast does a fairly good job. young stars elizabeth hoy and k.c. martel deliver some menacing performances, while rising star julie brown does a striptease before a memorable murder scene. veteran star susan strasberg does well as the teacher and jose ferrer has a cameo appearance.all around this off-beat slasher entry isn't bad, though it's admittedly not flawless, but it is well worth watching for genre fans.*** out of ****

most of other reactions by subscribers to this service were very apt, although that some found it slow or ambiguous puzzled me. rather than ambiguous, it was complex and multi-layered in its meanings. one can see it as anti-war, because of the opening and closing scenes, and the folly of pretended grandeur, as how wonderful the cavalry men looked as they prepared for the great charge at eylau, contrasted with its so horrible and disturbing conclusion, when we see the bloody uniforms, the boyish dead, etc--but chiefly, i see the film as about a moral man in an immoral society. at the end chabert chooses retreat from the corrupt post-napoleonic french world and opts for the simple pleasures provided by derville (who himself is saved by his recognition of chabert's basic decency and the morality of his choice of renunciation)--white bread, cheese, some wine and tobacco--over the riches he leaves to his wife, and her and society's dishonor. in her case, we can see the film as also feminist, in the position of women at that time, in which the only weapons mme chabert has are her charm, beauty, wiles and, ultimately, money.

this is an unfortunately unrecognized classic.the look is superb, the design, costumes etc are flawless, the post battle scenes and the cavalry charge are both chilling and exciting.the characters are vivid and really human. ardent is right and fabrice luchini as the lawyer derville steals the movie with his clever pedantic rodent-like performance, delighting in the ups and downs of others' misfortunes. depardieu is good but perhaps too large a presence for this role.where the film really excels is the story and also its changes from balzac's novella. those changes are editorial in that balzac has lots of discussion on society and this film breaths with characters. nevertheless yves angelo has retained the key ingredient, not just the missing man trying to regain his place in society but every character has to find their place in society: the comte ferraud is trying to buy a peerage, his wife (ardent) comes from a lowly birth and when she was married to colonel chabert they achieved their position in the turbulence of post-revolutionary france. everyone has something to lose in terms of status and that makes for a good drama as their objectives are in conflict with each other.it also feels very modern: money is critical to buy status to reach power, but someone can go down as quickly as they go up. derville enjoys the strategy, he has seen the worst of people he says to chabert when he takes the case. this speech's original place is at the end of the novella as balzac sums up the human comedy with huge irony.

i was a guest at the sept. 30th screening of eddie monroe and was pleasantly surprised with the story, the great acting and the talented directing. i found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film. powerful performances by vario, (uncle benny), sara, (jessica tsunis), and morris, (eddie monroe). the supporting cast was chock full of colorful and amusing characters. this film reminds me of one of those movies that you will look back on in 20 years and discover that it launched many actors into stardom. much like "the outsiders" where tom cruise, emilio estavez, patrick swazey, ralph macchio, and others can be found. look out hollywood, there are new stars out on the horizon and they can be discovered in a little long island, independent film called, "eddie monroe." great job!

"the next karate kid" is an outstanding movie full of adventure and new surprises. it has a wonderful plot and moral that tells a wonderful story. hilary swank does an incredible job of achieving the role of julie. i have seen the actor who plays mr. miagee and this is one of his best performances in my opinion. the movie is funny and charming and i cannot stress enough about how interesting the movie is. i definantly gove this movie a 10 out of 10. i suggest the movie to anyone who likes a good movie.

i like this movie cause it has a good approach of buddhism, for example, the way buddhist use to care all kind of living things, combining some fancy and real situations; in some parts the photography is very good and a lot of messages about freedom, as the hawk episode, staying always focused in every moment, even in tough situations.. it has also funny situations as swank's birthday and, talking this two times academy awards, her acting show us how the people who use to live in this kind of culture is trying to have a resistance behavior when miyagi is taking her to a buddhist temple, and how she, slowly, is changing her mind. and, of course, pat morita has been always great

well, it took them 4 tries, but they finally got it right! in this 4th sequel to the karate kid franchise, the producers really hit a home run! well first of all i applaud them for finally getting rid of ralph macchio. i felt he never did service to the role of the karate kid. i would have rather have seen danny 'ralph mouth' most in that role. macchio turned out what proved to be the best movie in the series, and look where his career is now! instead they put in a girl! they got hillary swank, best known for playing a variety of sheman parts in every movie she is in. i personally don't care for her buck teeth, but thats a personal preference. but still, look how karate kid 4 launched her career into orbit! she won a freakin oscar. jiminey christmas! meanwhile where is ralphy?? he should put out some amateur porn tape like screech or something.anyways, my only disagreement with the movie is that they have a girl doing karate. as a self-proclaimed master of karate, i have been the proud owner of a white belt for the last 8 5/8 years. the first thing they taught me is that there is no place in any of the martial arts for girls... well except for judo... but thats kinda gay. so for the purposes of accuracy, i think they should have stuck with another male for this role. i was thinking perhaps dennis franz. he would give the role the depth it requires.perhaps they will listen to my suggestions and make the proper adjustments in karate kid 5. its too pat marita is no longer. i was thinking maybe justin guarini is the perfect replacement for the lovable asian fellow mr. miyagi. he will give "wax on wax off" a whole new meaning. hahahahahaha funny huh? anyways, if you are looking for an exciting movie filled with karate and triumph of the human spirit, karate kid 4 is for you. don't waste your time with 1-3. this is the karate kid for you! this is the karate kid for r the ages!

***spoilers*** feeling alone and needing companionship as well as love frances austen, sandy dennis, keeps all these emotions inside as she goes through life as a popular young single lady who has many high class friends. but for reasons of her own deep insecurity she keeps them at arms length. as for frances male friends non are anywhere near her age so that she won't have any reason to have any romantic involvement with them. one early evening as frances was entertaining some of her friends she spots outside her apartment window a young man, michael burns, sitting alone in the cold pouring rain. feeling that he's homeless and alone after her friends leave frances goes outside to the park and offers the young man shelter at her place until the rain subsides and even to stay over for the night at a guest bedroom that she has. you can see right away that frances is more interested in just having the young mans safely out of the cold and rain then she wants to have him as a friend lover or even play-toy all for herself and as the movie progresses you see that you were right. a really amazing performance by sandy dennis that in a way is very much like that of kathy bates' academy award performance in the movie "misery" that was made in 1990 some twenty one years later. frances thinking that the young man was alone and homeless and, later when she meets him, mute sees the perfect person for her to have as a true friend. he's in no way her equal or better then her like the friends that she has, doctors lawyers indian chiefs, and thus is totally dependent on her. it later turns out that the young man is not the lonely and homeless person that frances thought that he is. it's when she slowly finds out that he really doesn't need her as well as him manipulating her instead the other way around it sets off something in frances' mind that turns out to be a compulsion of murderous proportions. a really weird film by director robert altman that goes deep into the depths of loneliness and depression of the human mind. actress sandy dennis is perfect as the dr. jekyll and miss. hyde personality in her acting as the lonely but at the same time dangerous frances austen and it's a pity that not only didn't she get an academy award for her role in the film but wasn't even nominated for it. like most robert altman movies there seems to be a lot of improvisation among the actors in the movie and ad lib dialog especially between the young man's sister nina, susanne benton, and her boyfriend nick, david garfield. the only thing in the movie that i found confusing is when we see frances go to a city clinic to have a full gynecological exam and tells the doctor that she expects to get married very soon. was her husband to be the young man staying at her apartment? but besides that the movie sticks to the story pretty well and the ending is a real shock to the audience as well as the young man. when he finally, in the end, realizes that frances is not only a bit off-the-wall but murderously insane as well.

this is another of robert altman's underrated films(let's be honest, the only movie he's made that really didn't work was ready to wear), and sandy dennis gives a spellbinding performance in it.she is far better here than she was in "the out of towners". the material, i will admit, is beneath the great director altman and the extraordinary actress dennis, but that hardly matters anyway.as long as there allowed to do their thing and do it well, just about any story will do.

this film requires a lot of patience. because it focuses on mood and character development, the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same set - in frances austen's (the sandy dennis character) apartment. but the film builds to a disturbing climax.the characters create an atmosphere rife with sexual tension and psychological trickery. it's very interesting that robert altman directed this, considering the style and structure of his other films. still, the trademark altman audio style is evident here and there. i think what really makes this film work is the brilliant performance by sandy dennis. it's definitely one of her darker characters, but she plays it so perfectly and convincingly that it's scary. michael burns does a good job as the "mute" young man. regular altman player michael murphy has a small part. the solemn, moody set fits the content of the story very well. in short, this movie is a powerful study of loneliness, sexual repression, and desperation. be patient, soak up the atmosphere, and pay attention to the wonderfully written script.i praise robert altman. this is one of his many films that deals with unconventional, fascinating subject matter. this film is disturbing, but it's sincere and it's sure to elicit a strong emotional response from the viewer. if you want to see an unusual film - some might even say bizarre - this is worth the time.unfortunately, it's very difficult to find in video stores. you may have to buy it off the internet.

first of all, let me say this film isn't for everyone. it has a very strange subject matter. a spinster living alone and living a boring life discovers a young man in a park just across the street from her townhouse. she notices him sitting out in the rain and invites him in to dry off & warm up. the man does not speak and the woman assumes he is deaf mute. still, she is fascinated with him and sexually interested in him. he finds her odd and continues his silence although we find out later that he isn't mute at all and that he reports to his sister everything that is going on between him & the woman. i won't give away the rest of the plot. if you can find this film watch it. you cannot take your eyes off of it. what makes it so interesting? well, it is totally unique. i've never seen anything like it and watching these two together is very uncomfortable. especially when you find out what this bland, boring, obsessive spinster is capable of. you won't forget it soon.

what i find remarkable about this terrific film, is that altman, the crazy and wild guy that he is, took the novel that cold day in the park and the sandy dennis character was originally a male in the book. he was a mentally whacked out isolated gay who looked out of his apartment window when he spotted the hustler. it is strange that altman fans aren't aware of how clever he was to change the sex of the main character; thereby avoiding the homo erotic taboos of gay life in the 60's and actually making dennis' reclusive kind of madness work even better in the transposition.if you see the film again, it will be evident how wily the altman mind works...

i wouldn't be so sure to accept the dna tests as irrefutable evidence against anna anderson. first, read peter kurth's book on which this film is based. anna anderson knew things that only the real grand duchess anastasia could possibly have known (forensic evidence in anna's favor aside). second, compare the pictures of anastasia and anna anderson. anyone can see that they are one-and-the-same person. third, visit peter kurth's website (url below) where you can read detailed information about the dna tests, as well as why franziska schanzkowska and anna anderson are not the same person (scroll down to the link, "anna-anastasia notes on franziska schanzkowska"). even schanzkowska's relatives believed that their sister and anna anderson were not the same person.i for one will always believe that hih anastasia nicolevna romanova and anna anderson were indeed the same person; i will never be swayed to the contrary .www.peterkurth.com

it was probably watching this tv movie that got me interested in the debate as to whether "anna" was really tsar nicholas's daughter anastasia. since seeing it i have made a point of watching various documentaries and also bought a book. despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released, i sometimes still think she was. such is the power of amy irving's acting in this 2-parter which is somewhat liberal with the historical facts, but packed to the brim with tear-jerking drama and irving's totally convincing performance.i was not consciously aware of irving before this, though i must have seen her without realizing it in "carrie" (another favourite film). in "anasasia", i never felt for one moment that "it's only a film". for me this woman was anastasia, and when part one ended with her in the railway carriage meeting members of the royal family, i knew that come hell or high water i had to see the second part. i just wanted to see how she would prove that she was who she claimed to be, and as the story progressed i felt an intense hatred of rex harrison's character, though i greatly admire him as an actor.when i saw the movie listed again in the tv guide, i convinced my mother that we should watch it, and afterward she thanked me for doing so, being almost as keen as i had been to watch part 2. then i bought the video and can totally recommend it. "anastasia" is one of those rare tv movies that you simply must watch for the sheer enjoyment of watching the finest acting i have ever seen on tv, and it doesn't really matter whether you believe the legend or not.

i'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of black snake moan. it's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though i think director craig brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. it's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though christina ricci's character, rae, typifies those. it's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. it's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end. and it's certainly not about the south, where "everything is hotter," though it's set in the south and it's undeniably hot; holy smokes, even the tag-line writers didn't get the point.black snake moan is a parable about mississippi delta blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they're playing about, how it heals them.it's as though the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked, "ok, if we were going to help people understand what the blues are really about, what would it look like?" so they set it in the rural south. then they dream up two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town. then, we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion (they know jesus wants their lives, and though they respect him, they know they can't give him that), some violence between men and women, and lots and lots of steamy sexual images, including -- ready to go over the top? -- a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a half-naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain. fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, make it about a genuine blues picker, use music as the main healing element in the plot, slap clips of blues-man son house on both ends, and voila -- you have a modern parable about what the blues are all about. even the film's climax is not character conflict, but the whole town dancing steamy dances to hot, raunchy blues.of course, there's a bit of a dilemma here. rae (ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is being healed by lazarus' (jackson's) homey religion and steadfastness (and don't forget the chain.) but then, we're shown the restored rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end. is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force, or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place? brewer wants it both ways, but blues really is about sex and violence, not to mention depression. i suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without unleashing either. i have my doubts.not for the first time, samuel l jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching samuel l jackson; the man is unbelievably good. he even picks some of his own tunes in the film, and his playing is authentic, dirty, and hot. christina ricci isn't usually this good, either. granted, half her job is done by the costume that wasn't there and her slinky figure, but she's a marvelous combination of cynical lust, rebellion, and vulnerability; bravo to her, she's arrived. i was impressed by the country preacher, john cothran, jr. i had to check the database to assure myself that he's a professional actor and not a genuine country minister.parents need to be aware of what they're getting if their kids bring this one home. the language is pretty far off the charts, the first half-hour is full of graphic sex, and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film (lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, chaining a woman to the radiator?) plus, ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex; if you've got teenage boys, they'll be licking the screen halfway into the film. i don't recommend this for kids of any age. adults only, please.that being said, black snake moan is informative and accurate about blues, folk religion, and sexual abuse, and tells a tale that's redemptive in lots of ways. it's unorthodox, but well worth the time. and, my goodness, is the sound track hot.

this movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. it is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. sex and love. women's emotional abuse of men, men's physical abuse of women, sexual child abuse, fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.i promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. and the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect. music is outstanding the writing is powerful and acting from everyone was brilliant.and the dvd has some great features, including samuel jackson's background of learning to play guitar and feel the blues.this movie is not for children and i even caution parents of teenagers.

watched this film at a local festival, the silver sprocket international film festival florida . what a lovely film. a simple, uncomplicated morality tale about a young care free young man having to take responsibility for his actions. it neither pretentious or flashy my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change i wasn't embarrassed by any of the film content or language. a real family film and the best british comedy film i've seen since billy elliot.the film went on to win not surprisingly the top festival awards of best film and best director. ten out of ten.

i actually though that black snake moan was great movie which takes place in the south. the story follows a man named lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. lazarus finds out that rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. samuel l jackson and christina ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that lazarus and rae become best friends. i was also amazed by sam's ability to play an electric guitar and being able to sing. s epatha merrkensen is great as lazarus' love interest angela, justin timberlake plays rae's boyfriend ronnie who is underused in the film but does the best that he can to deliver a fine performance.

in "black snake moan," writer-director craig brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. the movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. after the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and i'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into "happy ending" territory for my liking). and that's not to mention the archival footage of musician son house, ruminating on love and death (and heavily foreshadowing things to come, of course). yet in a strange way, these demerits are also qualities of "black snake moan," the tale of aging lazarus (samuel l. jackson), recently dumped by his wife (for his brother, no less), who comes across near-death nympho rae (christina ricci, easily giving the hottest portrayal of trailer trash on celluloid ever); nursing the girl back to health, he chains her to his radiator to overcome her demons, and hopefully redeem his own fallen self. while there is a definite prurient appeal in watching ricci fall out of her skimpy outfits, her performance is risky and mature--not a trace of wednesday addams to be found, and she easily holds her own with jackson, who personifies "the blues" in his portrait of a flawed, god-fearing man. while heavy-handed, the scene where lazarus sings rae a song in the midst of a lightning storm/blackout is compelling, as is a scene inside a jumping blues club that makes you wish you were there. the setting is strong, and a case can be made for the literal symbolism (the chain, the radiator, the strange blurry man who haunts rae's libido) being a deliberate outgrowth of superstition and spirituality. and it is the conviction with which this spirituality is played that lends "black snake moan" much of its strength--the committed performances of jackson and ricci make this a film that goes from wrenching to uplifting with, well, seamless grace. while justin timberlake's jealous lover is a plot contrivance i could have done without, neither he nor the sledgehammer subtlety can keep this from being a fascinatingly meditative film.

i suppose this is what is called southern gothic.it stars samuel l. jackson, christina ricci, and also justin timberlake is featured in a role. timberlake does good work, much to my surprise, i didn't expect it of him.when you're lost and you can't find your way home--that's the black snake moan.the people in this movie are definitely lost in many ways, psychologically and emotionally damaged, betrayed by those they trusted and loved and filled with a lot of pain.samuel l. jackson plays a blues singer/musician--whose wife has messed around with his brother and now left him for his brother, along with aborting a child he had hoped to have with her.christina ricci's character is a woman who was sexually abused when young--this has turned her into a self destructive nymphomaniac; allowing men to treat her badly.the story lies in the intersection of these two characters lives. it is a love story, but not a sexual love story, between them--the older black man and the young white woman.it is different from most films hollywood grinds out.i highly recommend it.10 stars

this if the first movie i've given a 10 to in years. if there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. a $4 mil box is a disgrace. people don't know what it's about. if you have any appreciation for the blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. how many people knew jackson could sing, and damn fine too. you hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. after seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word. yes, it's gritty, sexy, down home truth, bizarre and in-your-face real. isn't that the best reason to see a movie? those that get my meaning won't stay away from seeing this another week.

if you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. if you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. you've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. the surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie. look for a final scene that is an unexpected evidence of a wounded person healing. perhaps we who wonder why we wallow in the abundant profane will learn that love can be located above the loins in the heart. from the pumping pounding follow the rhythm to where where love is sacred.

logged on to the imdb to say what a charming film love love is and am totally confused. seems to me that someone has been getting their titles mixed up. "plastic demon baby" what? this wasn't love life. a little bit luvy dovey for my tastes but a great, funny and original film. especially liked the ending that didn't fall into the normal pit of cliche that all hollywood romantic films crash and burn it. nine out of ten.

i couldn't believe that the adult swim guys came up with this character. i laughed for days just thinking about this show. having finally seen the pilot i guess i will stick around for a few more episodes. assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips. assy drinks too much and "plays by his own rules" as you might have guessed. the only other funny moments are assy shooting many,many people and spending time at home - in the bathroom. it is not squidbillies funny, but it is worth a look.

"please, don't kill me! i'm just an actor!" "can you play dead?" it's difficult to describe this show. it's like a crime dramedy. where the bad cop is an ass. literally. what's great about the show is some of assy's perfectly awful one-liners. cracking out such gems as "adios, blimp," assy mcgee provides some great laughs at points. sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch. this is definitely the kind of show you'll love or hate, there's essentially no middleman. it's not the best show on {adult swim}, but it has some strong points. it's worth looking into just to see if you enjoy it. i know i did.

assy mcgee is an out-of-control, hard-nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas. the twist here is that assy is literally a walking buttocks.the cheap, low-brow facade of the show belies its cleverness and hidden satire. that is not to say that assy is devoid of fart jokes, just that the toilet humor is used sparingly enough to elicit consistent laughs, not groans and eye-rolls. the title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever, subtle humor used throughout. the sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s cop theme. in one photo, a police cruiser is shown and the "camera" zooms in on the front license plate holder, which is vacant. the meaningless zoom-in satirizes the production of the typical 70s-80s cop drama and, incidentally, makes me laugh every time.all the typical characters are included: the frustrated police chief who can't control assy; the loyal, minority partner who acts as a foil to assy's recklessness; the regular cops who detest assy's means.... all are accounted for and all are hilarious satires of the typical police drama.the voice acting, primarily performed by larry murphy, is nothing less than spectacular. assy's voice--breathy and gruff with a bit of a drunken slur--is so clever and unique that it ranks alongside all-time greats like stewie griffin (family guy) and homer simpson (simpsons). though the voice is slurred, the diction is somehow clear and easy to understand. this is a nice change from other adult swim program voices that often require closed captioning to understand.besides the fantastic production and voice acting, the script is also hilarious. assy's no- nonsense directness fuels most of the humor, particularly in his interactions with citizens outside the police force.if you have access to the adult swim comedies, assy mcgee is certainly worth the watching. each episode clocks in at a mere 8-9 minutes, so you really have little to lose.

we really liked this movie. it wasn't trying to be outrageous, controversial, clever or profound. it was just entertaining and was what it said on the box a charming romantic comedy. every other brit film maker seems to want to change the world, nice to see one that just concentrates on telling a good yarn with elegant style.

rented this out from my local because it was the only new british film available this week. never heard of the film-maker before or his other films (thank you imdb). about time some one made a good young british comedy that didn't star hugh grant or forty something's. the story is a morality tale but never preachy, throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast. luke goss's cameo was surprisingly very good, but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in 'blade'. loved the colour grading, especially in the night club sequences. great music and a truly original voice at work here. nine out of ten and well worth the rental charge.

a vg brit rom-com, one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy. quirky and often surprising, this is not the best of brady's films (kiss kiss bang bang is by far the funniest), though it does have a unique charm. well written the story veers off into a few dead ends but mostly surfaces with a new plot high. you know from the start how it's going to end, but when it comes it is honest and very open ended, a realistic and credible ending, the end seemed like a beginning, enjoyable and left me wanting more.

inherited this from my x's dvd collection when he left with my best friend (enough said), watched it one night when there was nothing on the telly (nothing new there then) and got a very pleasant surprise. very british (you no hardly any budget, no faces you know or have even seen before), the accents were a bit thick for my liking, but after a worrying start (a bit too close to home in my case) it began to grow on me. apart from the some unnecessary jokey cutting that really didn't add anything, i found the film throughly uplifting, very real, natural performances throughout left me wanting more from an ending that came suddenly too soon. highly recommended!

after having seen the lost child for quite a number of times since its release in 1995, and having read the reader's comments (mostly about jane tennison's background and helen mirren's superb role in it), it strikes me more than ever that no comments are made upon the brilliant role robert glenister is playing as chris hughes. even after 10 years it is still one of the most credible ways of portraying the complex personality of a child abuser, carrying the weight of his own past.watching the episode for the full one and a half hour makes you constantly switch between feelings of love and hate for this guy, in which the hate prevails because of the gravity of his actions. i have seen more brilliant roles of my favorite actor, but this one never fails to make the largest impression possible to me. helen mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her. praise for robert glenister!

this is one of the funniest shows on tv today. it hits the mark 99% of the time. usually after watching a sitcom after a few years, the actors become to cartoonish, as if they are trying to become the beloved characters they play. these actors have in my opinion stayed true to their roles. the chemistry is still there, the writing has not gone down and i still look forward to watching it. the family dynamic still seems real and the situations after all this time are not so far fetched to make it seem the writers are reaching into an empty bag trying to keep the show on for one more season it is one of the few shows i watch without the remote in my hand for quick switching.

king of queens is comic genius. kevin james, whom plays ips deliveryman doug heffernan is extremely funny, leah remini who plays doug's wife carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. the true magic of the show however is the scenes with jerry stiller, they are the funniest in the show. jerry, a comic genius, plays carrie's father, arthur spooner, whom lives in doug and carrie's always cold basement. i must admit that i never watched this show until this year, 2006. whenever i had flipped by it previously it never seemed funny, but with the cancellation of friends, still standing, and yes dear, i needed some new comedy. actually giving the king of queens a chance i discovered that it was absolutely fantastic. so funny in fact that i downloaded the first 7 seasons and watched each season in 8 hour blocks. i strongly urge anyone whom has not seen this treasure to check it out. you will not be disappointed.

"the king of queens" could be divided into two eras.the first era, constituted of the first few seasons portrayed the issues of everyday life of a man and his wife making it through life in the city paycheck by paycheck.the second era, increased the scope of the show, addressing current popular culture and marital issues with a humorous spin.but besides all of that...this show was freaking hilarious.kevin james, when not doing crap comedy films with adam sandler, is a genius of laughter, and his chemistry with leah remini was unparalleled on tv.jerry stiller as the psychotic live-in father in law added his own unique style of quirky humor, and patton oswalt as the "man-child" spence ulchin was amazing, (he's a great comedian too) "the king of queens" was the final sitcom of the 1990s to go off the air, and it's a damn shame. now, all we have to watch are the idiotic sitcoms full of untalented actors and actresses whose only appeal is their physical appearance. i like many fans of actually funny tv shows am now in a state of mourning

in a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, king of queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! it is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. nothing has been this good since married with children. kevin james and jerry stiller are comic geniuses! and believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. these guys truly understand what is funny. i could watch ten episodes of seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing koq just once. other funny people in this show are carrie, janet heffernan, spence and doug pruzan (carrie's boss). i'm so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem. the show has been a hilarious winner in a time of mostly comic losers. check it out if you haven't!!

i have not seen a better comedy than the king of queens for many years. i rate it one of the best ever. i've just returned to ireland from arizona on american airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. i laughed my head off and later i asked the stewards to play again and they did. thank you aa. the acting from all the team is first rate and especially from kevin james, leah remini and gerry stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. i love all the cast, they are so funny. there is a hard edge in the king of queens that i love and is seldom seen in today's tv comedy. both leah and kevin play off each other so well that every situation is believable and hilariously funny. i have just purchased the 2nd season while i was in az this week and i intend buying the full set the next time i am in the us. my son who is 20yrs old also loves this show and its brilliance is that it has the magic to reach out to different generations. i would like to thank all those involved with this amazing show - it's so appreciated to see this kind of tv show in what is in my opinion an era of poor tv fair in general these days with the exception of re-runs of seinfeld and such like... thanks for a great show..

when this show first came on the air, i saw it once or twice and thought it was another "fat guy, skinny wife" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. it was just "okay" upon initial viewings and i didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, i caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and i'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud. every new episode i watch is more creative than the one before--people who only watch this a couple of times will not notice this. the writing and story lines are much more sophisticated than they appear at first (this is far from "according to jim"). first of all, kevin james is hysterical, incredibly charming, and a talented comedic actor, as is the supporting cast. leah remini has excellent timing, and patton oswalt's spence is one of the funnier characters on the show. and of course, jerry stiller is brilliant as arthur. i was shocked to read comments that he was the worst part of the show--he's a gigantic part of why this show is so great--his delivery of these ridiculous schemes (rounding out the crazy dad character) are beyond hilarious. and the yelling--the best episode is when they show him as a kid yelling "lemon icee!!". that episode, during which carrie takes him to a therapist in hopes to get him medicated (to make doug less stressed out), guest star william hurt decides that arthur yells because he's never been validated. the latter part of the episode where doug beats up his childhood self in a therapy session is beyond funny, it's one of the most creative scenes i've seen on a sitcom. i feel the strange need to defend this show, because it is severely underrated--while "friends" was sometimes amusing, and "raymond" has some great episodes and characters, they both lacked the creative touch that "king of queens" has. in an era where most sitcoms have canned jokes and are on the whole mediocre, "king of queens" continues to push the sitcom envelope and show real comic genius. critics of this show obviously don't get it--or haven't watched the show enough to give it a chance, because anyone with real comic and creative sensibility has to laugh out loud while watching. it's certainly on par with my other two favorites, "seinfeld" and "the office" in its ridiculous tone. it's the arthurs, kramers, and michael scotts of tv that keep us watching, and laughing out loud.

i have been watching king of queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. this show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because i work at a company a lot like ips, (dhl) and we just love the teamster plugs!! carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. arthur well what can you say? he just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things. doug, well he is just so lovable, and funny, the three characters, plus all the friends just make the show complete. this is the best comedy on tv!! i would say up there with seinfeld, and hey, there's nothing wrong with that .... excellente!! as doug would say.

a must for any die hard carpenters fans!cynthia gibb does the role of kc a huuuuuge amount of justice, and although the 'story' isn't 100% factual, is still a good insight into the lives of both richard and karen and worth a watch just for the soundtrack.makes me cry everytime!!!

every time i hear karen carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. what an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. cynthia gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, i thought karen allen would have been a better choice. this is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of karen and richard but also the personal struggles that karen dealt with and her disease. the recording sessions in herp albert's studio are very nicely done. however karen carpenter turned out, there was a time when she was very special and brought a great deal joy to her fans and music lovers. even if you weren't a carpenter's fan this is a nice story that depicts how a great talent can fall victim to the pressures of society.

yes, this is one of the better done television movies and i wouldn't expect less from joe sargent. one thing for this reviewer is that i was also a great fan of the carpenters, i got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and i got to do much of the solo material of which karen sang lead. i thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing i was looking forward to was meeting this woman. i never got to, she died three weeks before that was to happen. and yes, that did effect me for i knew nothing of anorexia - and could not understand completely what happened.when this tv movie got produced, i got quite an understanding. maybe not everything in karen and richard's life is open to the television audience, but in opening the parts that were shown, i got to understand much from the music industry of that time. what upsets me is that i am writing "of that time" and seeing "now". no one has learned a darned thing, even though this was a very informative and heartfelt look into a family's problems in the music industry.these films aren't done for fun, they're done to open a door and show us something. here was a wonderful woman who got caught up in the whole idea that her talent was based on weight. she was fine. didn't know it. she got mixed messages about her weight from the brother she loved, the parents she loved and the music industry that cared more about her looks/weight than the talent within. with the onset of mtv, it got worse. with 'american idol' it's like a puss festering in an english accent.a wonderful tv film, i am sure later someone may give it an hbo treatment but either way, many lessons to be learned and the absence of another wonderful talent.

on watching this film, i was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. karen carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. as with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. this had a huge effect on karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. this heart felt film was not initially something which i would have thought of watching. but on starting to view it, then i was hooked. in the same way that the tina turner story does, then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life. the acting was superb and even after nearly 20 years after it was made, then the directional and the dialogue are still entertaining.i would recommend this to anyone who hasn't yet watched it. it is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged.

this film was made soon enough after karen's passing that perhaps richard carpenter and the people closest to karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. as the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. richard has spent the years after karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. he married his cousin, mary, and from what i have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation carpenters with his children. he seems to have regretted making this film,and that may very well be why it is unavailable in any form. it seemed to me to be a fairly honest assessment of the tragically short life and incredible talent that was karen carpenter.

being an avid carpenter fan, i really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off i went to discover more. i must recommend a book by ray coleman - carpenters - the untold story. the book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. i hope you enjoy it. i remember cynthia gibb from her days in fame and gypsy. she is a singer (aswell as dancer) in her own right and i think this was the edge needed to create the character. some other actresses may have struggled with this. it is ashame the film did not delve deeper into her story. after all this is the film title, but i felt we learnt more about richard, but i suppose like any performer worth their salt, you should always leave them wanting more!

the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenter's complex life. though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.cynthia gibb (portrays karen) was not a fine election. she is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb karen carpenter. i think that the role needed a stronger character. someone with a stronger personality.louise fletcher role as agnes carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as karen's mother.it has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album. unfortunately they weren't, though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries

this is how i interpreted the movie: first things first. there was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (taylor) torturing or nailing ben's hands to the wall. however the same cannot be told of the gals. in the end too, u see taylor disappear as he walks. looks like the message there was "there was no taylor". and the whole movie was a figment of imagination of ben. also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as ben. it was taylor all the time. but in real, taylor was ben. if they were two different people, then why was there no scene showing both of them in one frame during the horrific times? but of course before that, u do see both of them together and that cud just be ben's imagination at work. also, when ben was out of jail, the text on screen clearly says that ben's story was unrealistic and there was no such place as he had explained (read mine, cars etc...)even after liz hunter leaves kristy and comes back to find ben, she doesn't find him. why??? because ben (taylor) was out looking for the gals. instead kristy has all the time in the world to check out taylor's (ben) web cam, photos etc...somehow everything sums up to just one fact that kristy and liz, both of them knew that taylor was ben. so, my conclusion is that ben was schizophrenic and the movie where you see him and taylor in one frame was nothing but figments of his imagination. otherwise if there really was a taylor, then they should have found him out given all the detailed explanation coming from ben.

i thought i was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. but at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of aparna sen, i decided to turn up for the movie. going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos i had seen king kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly i wasn't complaining. a great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on shabana azmi and konkona sen sharma's part. shabana azmi a divorc√©e who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister. konkona sen sharma a schizophrenic(spare me the spelling), who imagines thing all the time. rahul bose also gives a stellar performance. the story is that mithi (sen sharma) is a schizophrenic, and after getting brutally raped on her field job as a reporter, her levels really increase, her fianc√©e leaves her, for the person she became. in all her world comes down upon her. shabana azmi, her elder step sister, takes care of her, and mithi in her imagination believes that she has been married to her fianc√©e, has 5 children and they stay in 15th park avenue (which really is a place in new york). the plot goes on as mithi becomes suicidal, as she believe no one believes her and she is being held captive in her home from her husband. as fate would have, mithi and her fianc√©e meet up when they both are out on a trip. 11 years after the brutal rape, her fianc√©e has no existence in her real world, she cant recognize him. her fianc√©e, now married and a father of two children feels it is his duty to correct the wrong he did 11 years earlier and he promises to take her to park avenue. and he does. he takes her to a place in kolkata which supposedly looks like her husband's home. as joydeep/jojo(rahul bose), her fianc√©e is talking on his cell phone he loses track of mithi. everyone comes looking for her but she is nowhere to be found. she finally gets what was denied to her, her family, her own imaginative family in her own world at 15th park avenue.i must say, that it touched my heart. i myself am now a fan of aparna sen's direction. the camera work is superb. and the quality of performance is spell bounding. konkona sen sharma gives a solid performance as the schizophrenic child. shabana azmi gives another mind blowing role as the divorc√©e elder sister, who has the load of keeping the family. rahul bose, another neat and quiet role(i don't know why this guy doesn't get big breaks, he has so much potential). lastly aparna sen, she still captivates the audience, even if she is not in front of the camera and behind it. a very well deserved 8/10....

exquisite!! in simple words... both aparna sen and konkona sen seem to understand each other quite well or maybe they both are just too good.this might just be her best performance as an actor and aparna's best as a director. yeah maybe better than mr and mrs iyer. konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic. shabana azmi plays the role of anjali,mithi's(konkona sen's) elder sister. shabana azmi made the best out of anjali's character for she had to play a strong,responsible,arrogant role of an elder sister who had the full responsibility of her family. aparna sen has beautifully crafted anjali's character,a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life,her love for her family.mithi's behavior was'not juvenile at all,for you can expect this from most of indian directors for this role.looks like a lot of research has been done to understand the role of mithi,a schizophrenic. when at times mithi is a normal,sweet college going girl,she also scares you when she is shown ill..both the sides have been beautifully judged and played..believe me it at times reminds you of the girl in exorcist..not that scary though.. overall..marvellous piece of work by aparna sen,konkona sen and shabana azmi...

after mrs and mr. iyer this is yet another very good film by aparna sen(mostly in english). in the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. in this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. as a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on "reality". it is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.mithee the younger sister (konkana sen sharma, the daughter of aparna sen) is suffering from schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister anjali (shabana azmi) . mithee after her marriage with jojo and separation from him believes that she is still with jojo and her five children in 15 park avenue in kolkotta.(there is no such address in kolkotta-it seems there is one in new york) and she is intense in her belief. it is almost like an intense religious belief. ultimately what is reality? in one scene she tells anjali "if i tell you that you are not a professor but only imagine that you are a professor". the open ending reflects this reality. in a supposedly search for her home in park avenue, mithee is lost. the penultimate scene is mithee looking at a group of five children playing and her looking at them with joy of returning to her family and then she is lost. about this concept of reality i am reminded of another film of fifties called harry with james stewart. the protagonist believes that a big sized rabbit (?), called harry is always with him and he is always conversing with him. at the end even the doctor believes perhaps there is harry. what is reality, is it what the protagonist believes or what other believe shabhna azmi dominates the film with her sterling performance as the strong elder sister with undercurrent of frustration. konkana sen sharma gives equally befitting performance as the schizophrenic.yet the film is not as tight as mrs and mr. iyer. there appear to be some loose ends. and perhaps there are too many characters. those who want a closed ending may not appreciate the open ending here. but the ending befits the theme of the film.yet another good film by aparana sen.

from "36 chowringhee lane" to "15 park avenue", aparna sen has indeed traveled a long way. if the first one goes down in history as a d√©butant's clean sweep the latter will definitely carve a special place as a "mature" film. until you see 15 park avenue you cannot imagine feeling thrilled and moved at the same time. thrilled to see the director's ingenuity and agility in portraying seriously challenging situations and moved by the sensitivity echoing throughout the film. it is not a movie that merely makes you feel 'tchh tchh, how difficult life must be for schizophrenics', but makes you ask a much deeper question about the reality that you see and believe. sen has done a brilliant job in highlighting this supreme fact of our existence that we all are, in some way or other, trying to live in a make-believe world of our own, trying to run after mirages called happiness, peace, contentment. along with the depiction of a delusional mind, sen's magic has brought forth many little nuances of human relationships as they sustain stress and strain. the fact that at times we all lose calm, break down, make wrong choices, be haunted by guilt, behave selfishly and so on, is captured with extreme adroitness by sen. she showed the cruel dilemma which shabana had to deal with all her life, of having to choose between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with a husband and kids for herself. and in the act of always being beside her sister, always being a strong persona, providing support, making judgments and so on, she unknowingly cut off some of the oxygen that her sister needed to bloom. isn't this a very harsh truth that at times, in an attempt to do the best for someone, we strangle their assertiveness and end up hurting their self-esteem? of course konkona's and shabana's acting deserves laurels as always because had the ingredients not been so good, the dish could not have turned out to be so extraordinary. aparna sen once again made a masterpiece of a movie for those who crave for some "food-for-thought" . bravo !

well its a great work by aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. it has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. we all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways. so when joydeep was discussing with her wife he says that , 'she is looking for a thing which she will never get' and the wife replies 'are not we all?'. so that was a great comment which after the film left me with a great question, 'are we all sick?'

aparna sen's 15 park avenue is a film about nature of reality. a young delusional girl, prone to imagining things and hearing voices, possibly out of sheer boredom, is taken to be schizophrenic by her educated father and control-freak educated elder step-sister. controlled, pitied and treated like an invalid (even if out of love and affection), she has ghost of a chance to develop as a normal person. when a boy offers to marry her, her father and step-sister passionately try to convince him against taking such a step. a traumatic experience, caused primarily due to her sheltered existence, finally takes her across the line of no return, and she lives full time in a delusional world of her own. the family and society around her are intolerant of her delusions,and want to suppress them with medicines, electric shock therapy, anything, even though they all have delusions of one kind or other of their own. her mother doesn't see the irony in allowing a ghost-buster to treat her of the delusions. her step-sister is a professor of physics, teaching among other things quantum mechanics, a subject in which a stream of experts accept parallel multi-universes and many more dimensions in space than the 3 we see. a friend recounts with admiration an experience with a holy person claiming to hear hallucinatory voices. far away, george w bush has real or fake delusions of saddam's weapons of mass destruction, and is allowed to invade iraq. as some viewers have already pointed out, aparna sen shied away from attacking the mother of all delusions -mainstream religions, which is a pity. in other words, accepted reality is what a majority or an influential minority believe in. that's been the case since the beginning, and lot more powerful people than mithali in the film, among them bruno and galileo, have suffered as a consequence. the film's controversial and difficult ending was necessary to show it's a film about nature of reality, and not the case study of a schizophrenic girl. all the cast have given great performances, but shabana azmi and konkona sen sharma have excelled. aparna sen has produced an outstanding philosophical film.

the most beautiful film. if one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. even more beautiful than a beautiful mind itself. simply awesome!! i wish this movie entered the oscars. i cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..the most beautiful film. if one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. even more beautiful than a beautiful mind itself. simply awesome!! i wish this movie entered the oscars. i cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character.

once in a while one come across a movie that forces one to rethink about society's reaction to people who differ from its definition of normal.mitthi having suffered at the hands of unsocial elements,left all alone to cope with her tragedy, retreats into her idyllic world....one which according to her is the real world.....surreal(mitthi's world) superimposes itself on the real(her family).mitthi, suffering from schizophrenia, forces us to reconsider our priorities about trying to rehabilitate 'patients' like them. are we right to drag them back to our reality when all we have to offer them in ours is pain and suffering? what right have we to deprive them of their source of happiness? what right do we have to take away their joy when we are unable to help them in their sorrow? 15 park avenue is one of the best movies on social issues...showing us the need that any patient needs empathy and not plain sympathy.

ms aparna sen, the maker of mr & mrs iyer, directs this movie about a young girl's struggle to cope with her debilitating condition.meethi (konkona sen) has been an aloof kid ever since childhood and has shown signs of delusion, no one knows why. the dormant tendency however slips out of control, when the job assignment takes her to neighboring bihar where she's raped by some political goons. the resulting trauma also leads to episodes of manic-depressive psychosis in addition to her schizophrenia. she careens out of control over the years, progressively getting worse and sinking deeper into her private 'world'.the juxtaposition of an 'unsettled' (divorced) elder sister and how her domineering ways make an already bad situation worse, is indicative of what a fine line there is between abnormal and *seemingly normal*. ms sen also makes an excellent commentary on the social alienation of such individuals. social rehab is standard therapy along with all the deadly mind-altering drugs. but what about the poor and the destitute, who're always left to fend for themselves and usually fall by the wayside?the romantic connection between dr kunal and anu was unnecessary. also the cafeteria scene where dr kunal explains to anu how real their world really is to them, was redundant. anu should already know all that. the english dialog is a bit awkward at times though the acting compensates for that. konkona and shabana prove that their reputation is every bit worth it. waheeda, rahul and shefali play their limited roles very well. extensive research seems to have been done about this illness, its very evident. but its not clear if mdp can coexist with schizophrenia in the same patient, side-by-side. also in the early part, dr kunal recommends e.c.t (shock therapy) while invalidating the fact that it doesn't work for schizophrenics, only for extreme mdp with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder.the ending of the remarkable story is suggestive of an unknown solution (maybe no solution). the movie could have ended on a nicer note, since worldwide the mentally ill can and do lead balanced and fruitful if not very fulfilling, lives under good medical care.nonetheless, its an excellent film made with extreme sensitivity to the subject. hats off to ms sen! no one in india could've done it better.

as everyone knows by now, 15 park avenue is the story of a schizophrenic girl and her half-sister.the manifestation of schizophrenia is still viewed as being an illness which people often feel might disappear if ignored. there are also those, who, however far fetched it may seem when it's shown in the film, think that the illness manifests itself as a result of some sort of supernatural influence. i think ms. sen deserves a lot of praise for "15 park avenue". she has done a good turn, not only to the general public, but also to those who deal with schizophrenics ... relatives, social workers, psycho-analysts. the film actually helps in dispelling a lot of myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder. i'm told that the film is largely based on her own personal experiences with a person very close to her, who suffers from this mental affliction. to that effect, i'm sure that none of what has been shown, is blown out of proportion ... on the contrary, it is a true representation of facts.the performances are good, on the whole, as can be expected. konkona sen sharma, shabana azmi and of course rahul bose, are very good indeed. they emerge as very "real" characters ... credible enough for one to be able to identify with them at times. people may think me terribly queer, but i think there are moments when one can identify with meethi as well! i suppose all of us have a streak of "insanity" inside us .... perhaps some more than others. these are the people who are singled out. after all, don't we all have our secret fantasies and dreams? impossible ones, at times? would we be dubbed as being "off our rockers" if people could glimpse into these areas of our minds? would a person with low self-esteem, be considered a schizophrenic because he/she shuns company ... preferring instead to live in a world of his/her own because that's the only space where there is a sense of security?konkona, as meethi, is outstanding!! her performance is so effortless ... she lives her part. she has shown the ability to lull the audience into forgetting the divide between reality and acting! a case in point is the part where she's distressed at the scene, shown on tv, of saddam hussein's arrest. her reaction seems so uninhibited and intense ...as if she's really heart-broken at this tragedy! her brand of indian english too, is so spontaneous and natural. however, the same cannot be said for at least a couple of the other actors. kanwaljeet and waheeda rehman, splendid actors both, seem ill at ease when delivering their dialogue in english. their diction is less than perfect ... stilted and affected, the fact that they are making a supreme effort, becomes more than apparent. their dialogue delivery is jarring and tends to break the smooth flow of the unfolding of the tale.the brutal rape of meethi (konkona), seems somewhat unnecessary. any other incident would have sufficed just as well, i feel. the point here is that something triggers off the extreme manifestation of the illness. as the psychiatrist explains, one cannot, with any modicum of conviction or certainty, say that the incident of the rape was instrumental in bringing the hitherto latent propensity towards schizophrenia, to the fore. then why are we subjected to the scene where meethi lies bleeding and unconscious. was ms. sen trying to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country, where the voice of the masses is silenced by a handful of people who resort to violence in order to stay in power?? if so, then the scene of the rape is warranted but not strictly in the context of the main body of the film.the ending seems somewhat abrupt. is the audience expected to find a solution? where does meethi disappear to? does ms. sen want us to feel that perhaps what the psychiatrist says about whose reality is more real and hence credible, holds true? in other words, is she trying to say that we are not without bias when judging who is on this side of the fine line between sanity and insanity? i'm not very sure.a thought-provoking film on the whole and well worth watching. however, if you are the sort of person who likes things to be neat and tidy ... everything cut and dried, with a water-tight solution to each issue that comes up ... this film is clearly not meant for you!

15 park avenue is the address "mithi/mithali" (konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. "prof.anu" (shabhana azmi)is mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from mithi's mom's earlier marriage. the movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (mithi). the director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of mithi, through her continuous blabbering to anu and others. konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which i am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of mithi in this movie. you can see the look of a patient written on her face, by the drooping lips and sleepy eyes, from the first scene itself. rahul bose has done a good job, but has been reduced to one half of the movie in spite of his importance in their life.watch out for the intense relationships shown between the characters of the movie, mithi & anu, anu & anu's mom and between anu & sanjiv (kanwaljit singh). shabhana azmi, as usual has done a riveting performance to be remembered as the sister, who sacrificed her life for mithi.the movie might not be your usual hindi potboiler, but can certainly make people look at the schizophrenic patients in a different light altogether.as usual, aparna sen brings the movie to a different ending rather than any clich√©d ones, we might think off. hats off to her, for this great movie!!!

i must say it was a let down. overall its great to see the way aparna sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, i am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in a beautiful mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.but the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of english. its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in india which talks in english even at home, but i am sure its not as formal as in the movie. moreover, waheeda rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in english. charu's dialogue in bihari tone was seemingly much more realistic and digestible.the second thing, its about the abstract flavor she has tried to give to the movie. i generally like movies with open ending, but here there were many loose ends. its like cut pieces are joined together to make the movie. also there seemed no central theme to the movie. schizophernia for sure was the main line but intermingling sister-sister, mother-daughter, adding doctor-azmi relation, no real use of brother, bose - bose's wife relations..... all were not required and made the audience loose track of what actually did she try to depict.on the whole, a watch for people who like off-beat movies, a must avoid for the ones who just see movies as an entertainment tool.

i have just seen the movie "15 park avenue" which was the first night presentation movie in the asia society human rights film festival in new york.i was really moved by the subject matter of this movie and also the excellent portrayal of "mithi" by the lead actor konkona sen sharma.i have just one word for everyone who is reading this comment,run to get a copy of this gem and watch it.my sincere thanks to director aparna sen who has done a excellent job again.movie like this comes on once in a blue moon and i was lucky enough to see this movie on screen and also took part in a after movie discussion/question and answer session with konkona sen sharma.in a simple word "a wonderful experience.

spoilers ahead 15 park avenue: my humble take on this film now, for a viewer of cinema having tastes as severely limited as mine, niche films like 15 park avenue ought to be palatable to my sensibilities. with this thought, and a mild sense of embarrassment that i hadn't watched the complete film earlier, i watched this film last saturday. there are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary mulholland drive (david lynch) from which, this film borrows at least 3 concepts:- a) that (at least some) truths are relative b) the first scene of shabana and konkonam going around in a car as the opening credits roll, is uncannily similar to the car ride that betty and rita undertook in mulholland drive. in both cases, the object of inquiry happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in aparna's film c) the incident revolving around the mad beggar woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole 'occurence behind winkies' involving a bum but while that scary creature is an embodiment of something and that that 'something' as well as the character per se is seamlessly linked to other works of lynch (notice carefully the disheveled long hair), the effect of the beggar woman in 15 pa appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message the other films from which 15 pa also borrows is blow up (especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth vs. perceived truth poser presented towards the end of antonioni's masterpiece). of course, the professor and schizophrenia angle also bring to the mind, "a beautiful mind". although, admittedly the subject here is high brow physics and shabana, who professes it, inadvertently ends up being the brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucinations of konkona's character through those very prophecies. in an outstanding scene in the movie, some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of shabana, where quantum physics and the theory of relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe, to the artificial edifice of the 'make believe' world of mithi but for all their differences, the sisters are alike too. both are incapable of forming long lasting relationships- one out of choice and the other out of nature. so, mithi's pain at being rejected in love by joydeep is in harmony with the inability of shaban to form a special bond with either kunal(dhritiman) or sanjeev (kanwaljeet). but i'm getting ahead of myself. viewers generally tend to view this film in one of the following two ways:- hypothesis 1: "it was shabana all along" there is a certain section of the audience who think so. but that explanation is not only too far fetched but also contrived as that would mean she was dreaming up so many other characters too (i.e. all those characters whom she visualized as visualizing mithi along with her) hypothesis 2: "there was a real mithi and the ending is a metaphor" this pov says that the film's essence is summarized in one dialog in the film, when in response to a statement by joy (rahul bose), that mithi is looking for something that she will never find, his wife laxmi (shefali shah) philosophizes that we all are looking indeed for that illusive utopia, the end of the rainbow wherein appears to lie the mirage of happiness and contentment there are other more minor possibilities which have not been embraced that much by our knowledgeable audience like:- hypothesis 3:" shabana and konkona are alter egos of the same person" hypothesis 4: "shabana too is a figment of mithi's imagination" hypothesis 5: "the old, haggard, perhaps mad, beggar woman is the real protagonist of the story" are these hypotheses worthy of even being tested? well, your guess is as good as mine "why 15 park avenue?" contrary to the popular perception that she was thinking of the park avenue in ny, i believe that she got the name from the brand name of a semi popular bathing soap. remember, her stating jo jo's profession as "prime minister of shikakai", which as you may be knowing is a popular ingredient used in manufacturing shampoos. the prefix '15' is used as it was on 15th december that mithi got engaged to joydeep and after his walkout, she remains forever in a time warp. the film has its fair share of flaws- lack of use of a strong background score, which in films like these can really augment the narrative, some sloppy dialogs unabated by some forced dialog delivery. inconsistent performances (shabana and dhritimaan are excellent though imo) by a few of the cast members albeit many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted. shefali chaya's sudden insecurity about her husband seems to be an unimaginatively introduced dimension in the plot. i give it 7/10 as it made me think but not any higher than that because i can easily fathom its sources of inspiration and having experienced (and for the most part, thoroughly enjoyed) those previously, i have already thought on similar lines earlier. so, the experience post 15 pa is bound to be sans a certain degree of novelty. where am i coming from? i gave 9.5/10 to '36 chowringhee lane' (though rumors still persist that one satyajit ray ghost directed it), 7.5 to 'paromiter ek din', 7 to 'mr and mrs iyer' and 5 to 'paroma'. on an existential level, it failed to invoke my interest, not even as much as say a 'truman show'

i went to watch this film with my family who were expecting a neatly conclusive story like ''mr.& mrs.iyer''.and they returned home thoroughly disappointed.so,this is a warning to all ''conclusive story lovers'' to stay away.15 park avenue does not seek to answer questions or provide moral solutions on how to treat the mentally challenged.rather its intention is loud and clear.it questions every human being's,sane or not,sense of reality.in fact for me it even arouses doubts about my taken-for-granted sense of sanity.the security,bondage,satisfaction that i find in my present,is it really what i am or does it really create an illusion that all of us desperately and sometimes ignorantly cling on to just to falsely console the neglected 'meethi' which exists in all of us in some way or the other? so,why does anjali so maniacally makes it a point to show off her strength of mind when she is really harrowed by the realization that she is becoming a monster?aren't we all who think we are ''normal'' ,really monstrous and helplessly vulnerable about it deep down inside? is it not better to be happy even insanely,than to create the impression of 'normalcy' while suppressing one's fragility? meethi bravely,madly,sincerely does that.and society labels her as ''schizophrenic''.the ending did confound me at first,but then you realise that meethi bravery and sincere belief took her where she wanted to go.she found what she was searching for,not caring what society had to comment upon her search. and it is the seemingly 'real' people - anjali,the psychiatrist,and jojo- who never reach anywhere.my family thinks that i am schizophrenic too in trying to make sense of a film that is largely 'insane' to the rest of the world.anyone else willing to believe in my sense of reality...........?

15 park avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from new york and film being set in kolkata. however as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between relationships, social cause and of course the world of schizophrenia. i would say aparna sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. in a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 park avenue'. its an unending search within each of one of us...the powerhouse performance from shabana azmi is a treat to watch. her screen presence brings whole lot of life into the scene. indeed it was surprising to see her in such a powerful act after long because i expected it to be all the way konkona sen's terrain. shabana makes you feel skin deep of an elder sister who is running the whole show for a rather unfortunate family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life. she burdens all her ambitions and desires with ailing 18 year younger sister ( who is more like a daughter to her ) and an aging mother played by veteran waheeda rehman. as for the leading actress from guide ( that's how i can recall her instantly ) there is hardly anything to say except few lines and tear drops here and there. ever dependable rahul bose plays another pivotal role in the film, he shows the emotions of a middle age man with repent on his face to near perfection. this man really amazes me with the variety of work he has done. from a musician in jhankar beats to a liberal muslim in mr. & mrs. iyer and so many others¬Ö. he is one versatile i really wish if he had some more shots in the first part of the movie as well. the cameo in the movie is by shefali shah (remember satya and monsoon wedding). she looks really beautiful and depicts the role of a mother of 2 kids with real ease. she gives you a glimpse of today's indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to her husband's prior relationships. the focus of camera has been meethi, portrayed by konkona. she and her schizophrenic world constitute the nucleus of 15 park avenue. she has really worked hard for the character but there are times when she is not able to relate with the audience. the fateful accident of her life tries to rope in sympathy and it has been only partially successful. the movie tries to address quite a few things in one go starting from the unique world of a disabled person to the unequal status of a female even in today's modern india and also the twisted relationships in a tattered family. and i believe aparna has succeeded to certain extent. the helplessness of meethi while she works as a journalist in a rural eastern state really gives us all a naked picture of the country we are so proud of. well after i finished 15 park avenue, there was a sense of unquenched thirst within me. i wanted more out of this movie to drench me emotionally. it has been a commendable effort on the part of director except few hiccups. must watch for all those who like to see a different cinema, something with a strong purpose.

this is a multi-faceted, insightful and bold story about the people in the life of a schizophrenic patient, their (and our) perception and realities. although the main theme revolves around a delusional young woman, the story delightfully flirts with physics, medicine, religion and even politics as it questions our perceptions about what is true and what is real. konkona sensharma beautifully conveys that the world mithi is living in is as real to her as ours is to us. within that world, she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent, not the gibberish that they seem to us in our world.here are a few outstanding scenes to look out for while watching the movie (don't worry, these are not spoilers). i absolutely loved the way aparna sen wove these commentaries into the story.- the references to quantum mechanics and relativity intermingled with the witch-doctor ("ojha" in hindi) performing his religious rituals that he believes will drive away the "ghosts" sitting in mithi's brain. - the doctor prescribing shock-treatment as a solution that is "believed" to work - windows of perception - the scene about the review of anu's book. - the allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for "maya". - news footage of george bush telling the whole world that there is "no doubt in his mind" that there are wmd in iraq (now, that is not as much about bush's perception, who i suspect knew the truth, as the gullible public's perception about wmd in iraq.)- one of the best scenes in the movie is where mithi tells anu "charu sent this man to beat me" and anu dismisses it as a matter of course. konkona did a fantastic job, bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a schizophrenic's brain when her world and the real world clash.aparna sen was bold, but not bold enough to pose one big question: is nearly all of mankind delusional to believe in god? she could have inserted some scenes about "normal", "healthy" people praying to and sacrificing for a being that no one has ever seen or heard from in all of human history (the ritual/exorcism scene doesn't go far enough). that would be the ultimate question: what is normal? who's reality is right, the believer's or the atheist's?imho, this movie is a far more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than "a beautiful mind". it looks at the minds of not just the sick person, but also the healthy, and does so from many different angles and illuminates our understanding of our own minds and our world. if the former got 4 oscars, this deserves more - at least one each for story, screenplay, direction, konkona, and shabana azmi. it was truly a treat to watch this movie and i'm glad i bought the dvd for my collection. this was a story very well-told indeed.

if you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (mithi). the movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. aparna sen delivers yet another masterpiece. each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. konkona sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. she pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. shabana azmi is incredible as usual. she plays the dominating and fiercely independent elder sister of mithi who takes care of her ailing sister and aging mother. she refuses to accept that in-spite of all her strength and courage, she still feels lonely at times. this should have been a very easy movie for rahul bose. the role was least bit demanding and anyone could have done the role.the ending of the movie was the most surreal part of the whole park avenue experience. it took me a while to digest that the movie had ended. it left me confused and maybe even a bit disturbed. but later on, it started sinking in. my eyes are black. but if everyone says they are blue, will i still believe that its black??!

i have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! it was funny and creative; i wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. it ranks right up there with winky dink - another favorite. i was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on rocky and bullwinkle. these early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances. while the early cartoons didn't address evil very much - it was a much gentler and safer time - they allowed us to develop our own talents and character.

during the brief golden age of the super 8 magnetic sound home movies, we purchased a gaf projector for $148.00 on close-out at a downtown chicago camera store. it seemed that gaf was getting out of the camera & projector business; although they would continue with their other enterprises, such as the former sawyer's vue-master 3 dimensional color slide viewers.little did we know nor anticipate the rapid approach of the video camera, the betamax, the vhs and the eventual dvd revolutions. with the super 8 magnetic sound camera that we also purchased, we took some sound film records as our daughter, jenn's first holy communion and her younger sister, michelle's graduation from pre-school. this was all circa 1979-82.during this time we also purchased a few daddy toys to go with it; like some super 8 magnetic sound laurel & hardy films and w.c. fields' shorts from blackhawk films, davenport, iowa. we also picked up a columbia pictures home movies sound film of a then sort of forgotten classic cartoon, upa's gerald mcboing-boing (united productions of america/columbia, 1951). it was the hit of our home movies time! being members of that baby boomer generation, the wife (deanna) and meself had recollection of the character of gerald mcboing-boing; for gerald had a network tv show on cbs, early sunday evenings, ca. 1955. bill goodwin was the announcer/host. but we had never seen this original upa theatrical cartoon; nor was it known to us that the young master mcboing-boing was a creation of dr. seuss of "grinch", "horton" and "mulberry street" fame.the staff assembled was very talent rich and deep. the outstanding production values are apparent. director robert cannon and supervisoring director john hubley were veterans at the top of their craft. writers were theodore geisel (dr. seuss, himself), phil eastman and bill scott.mr. scott is remembered not so much for his writing contributions to upa, but for being partners with jay ward in such television properties as rocky & bullwinkle, mr. peabody, fractured flickers, george of the jungle, hoppity hooper and fractured flickers. with the jay ward productions he was a writer, voice man and kibitzer-general of the whole company.the cartoon receives its only "voice" from the narrator, radio/movie/tv actor marvin miller. remember him? he was michael anthony on the tv ssries the millionaire (don fedderson productions/cbs television network, 1955-60).bold color schematic and imaginative design went into giving the upa animations a special feelings of loneliness, fear apprehension and eventual triumph. and, we might add, the animation is definitely of the "limited" variety.as with so many great stories, ours starts out with a simple premise; one's being born different. in this case it is young boy gerald mccloy, who has been born to make sound effects in communicating rather than talking. kids can be cruel and soon he is dubbed with his not so flattering nick name by a group of youthful taunters chanting: "nya, nya, your name's not mccloy; it's gerald mcboing-boing, the noise making boy!" at this point, the animation team does an outstanding job in shifting the emotional gears in the young outcast from happy & carefree to isolated & lonely and finally to depression & despair in not being able to turn to anyone for help and understanding; not even to his mother and father.a frighteningly fashioned dark scene involving a highly upa stylized run away scene involving a train and an equally stylized snowfall brings gerald right to the brink of absolute despair. but then, he is interrupted by a gentleman announcing that young gerald is wanted by the producer of some radio program to provide the sounds for the show down at the studio.once the premiere show is done with gerald starring in the sound department, he rides off in a huge limousine (which seems to have anticipated those s-t-r-e-t-c-h limos of our day) to the cheers and admiration of his classmates and the world.it has been said that there are only so many plots and, in that case this story is most likely a variation on the ugly duckling; for after all, a sad and lonely boy finds his place in the world and true happiness.note: united productions of america, or upa for short, was an outstanding center of creativity in the field of the animated cartoon. they were responsible not only for gerald mcboing-boing and several sequels and a tv series, but also the highly popular mr. magoo theatrical cartoons and subsequent tv show (with voice talent of jim backus), the classic original tv cartoon of frosty the snowman and the rather bizarre dick tracy cartoon show (with tracy's voice rendered by mr. everett sloane!).

mcboing boing is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. if i remember correctly we had to watch it on a uhf station and this meant using a converter in those days uhf not part of regular tv to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. i remember all the sound effects that gerald used to talk. a great memory from 50+ years ago. i'll have to see what other memories might be hiding on the web. by the way i try to do computer animation thats where the johnl3d comes into the picture

my dad had this movie as an 8mm reel. i loved it when he would pull out the projector, tape a sheet to the wall, and play gerald mcboing boing. the thought of a child who communicated through sounds fascinated me.nine years ago, my son was diagnosised as autistic. the doctors would ask me questions about my son such as "how does he communicate with you?" i would respond, "have you ever seen the cartoon, gerald mcboing boing?" i would love to have a copy of this cartoon to show my son and his educators, this is how my son see he's world.recently, i spoke with a digital transfer specialist who indicated most personal 8mm films did not contain sound until the mid 1970's. i guess i was pretty lucky to have experienced the sights and sounds of gerald mcboing boing in 1972.

if there's one cartoon that helped to put upa on the map more than any other, it's gerald mcboing-boing. this tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by marvin miller, pretty much everything. and it won the oscar for best animated short of 1950. glad to have seen it on youtube after reading about this dr. seuss story for so many years. and rocky and bullwinkle creator bill scott also contributed, how awesome! hope to see the subsequent shorts made in the series, if not on youtube, then maybe in a dvd collection. now i guess i'll watch another upa short there...

this short, which won an oscar, spawned two sequels and a tv cartoon show, has minimal animation but adelightful script (by theodore geisel aka dr. seuss) and aneven more memorable and enchanting main character. upa pioneered a style of animation that even influenced disney during the mid-1950s and produced some of the best animated shorts done in the late 1940s and the 1950s. this is on of their finest. god to have it in print. highly recommended.

this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book, brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award. special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon. later episodes in the series (of which there were four in total) were not actually based on original dr seuss material, although all but the last continued to use his familiar rhyming style. the three sequels were: gerald mcboing boing's symphony (1953); how now boing boing (1954); gerald mcboing boing on planet moo (1956) - although he also appeared in a later episode of mr magoo.

before the wwf became cartoon with hulk hoagan leading the way, the events of wwf tv broadcasts of the very early 1980s resembled the wild, wild west with all kinds of grudges and vicious acts of violence performed by some of the wrestlers that are known today to be the wwf's most beloved stars. some of these seemingly very real moments stand out. a maniacal sgt. slaughter whipped then champion bob backlund with a riding crop after backlund showed him up in a fitness test. welts were all over backlund! sarge made the iron shiek look like a daycare provider! slaughter also issued a challenge to anyone who could break his dreaded cobra clutch hold. this led a legendary and bloody alley match with commentator pat patterson. hall of fame member blackjack mulligan with freddie blassie came into the wwf with a claw hold that was censored on television. he claimed he was the true giant at 6'7" and challenged andre long before big john studd in 1984. adrian adonis used his ominously named "good night, irene" sleeper to take out the competition. a new yorker clad in black leather, he was an ominous figure. george "the animal" steele was far from a crowd pleaser, as well. even jimmy snuka was a fearsome sight as he set out maim opponents until ray "the crippler" stevens delivered a piledriver onto the cement floor leaving snuka a bloody mess. all these encounters took place a decade before hardcore wrestling was ever spoken of.

every saturday morning at 11 a.m. i watched superstars. all the biggest events happened on this show at the time. challenge, which aired sunday mornings, was decent too, but all the big stuff happened on this show. wrestlers would do all their interviews with mean gene on a platform next to the live crowd or talk on their own to the screen in front of a background that promoted them. the matches were usually squashes but sometimes you would see 2 mid carders square off in the main event. there were also interview shows that usually resulted in violence thus setting up a feud. these segments ranged from pipers pit, the body shop, the flower shop, the snake pit, the brother love show, the funeral parlor, and the barber shop. i don't recall any titles changing hands on this show. that usually happened at pay per views and saturday nights main event.

loved the shots of airports -- dallas, phoenix, fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. and the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. fast-forward 75 years....but what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. remember when the mutual acquaintance neil and jill encounter says that jim'd become a general in a chinese rebel army? that, based on the hammer and sickle, could only have been the people's revolutionary army of mao tse dung!!! never mind the undies and the unwed twosome in bed -- would that logo and that reference have survived during the cold war? additional observation 12/27: this film of the 30's with the soviet emblem may/must also reflect the influence on and charm of communism in hollywood and much of america during the depression. adds to the historical value of this terrific film. also i liked the american dream aspects of two guys from winnemucca taking at least part of the world by storm, red-blooded (literally and copiously in jim's case)american boys.others have commented more ably than i on the aerobatics, etc. i loved it all.this gem deserved more than the mere 1.5 stars osborne and co. rated it on tcm, if only for recording parts of american history of the early 30s.

many of the earlier comments are right on the money, but some, well, not so much.this is hardly a 'b' movie...it's well produced, the live flying sequences are really superb, and the model sequences are first rate. it's no "cheapie".ricard barthelmess is quite good in this, and it makes a a nice companion piece for "only angels have wings".if you want to spot john wayne, spot j. carrol naish first, they end up together.tom browne is juvenile enough (and somewhat dull), but when they saddle him with the most pathetic pencil-mustache in hollywood history, it makes his character even less believable. sally eilers is much more so.as for later influences, this is wellman in the early airliner-in-distress zone...the opening sequence of this film, with the airline operations guy arriving at the "grand central airport" would have fit very nicely into "the high and the mighty"...just imagine regis toomey...and a 1955 buick.

i was mighty impressed with nurse betty all the way through. it has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending i shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.if theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was morgan freeman and chris rock's interaction. these two are great and it warms my heart to see rock isn't going to do crappy big hollywood fare like lethal weapon 4 for the rest of his life. freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore. hell, kiss the girls was watchable with him in it.renee zellwegger does the best she can with her role, and kinnear is good as her obession.sweet movie with a nice touch of gratuitous violence in it to satisfy the bloodlust of the male. 9 outa 10

if i'd only seen the poster for nurse betty, i probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. but after i heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at cannes, i decided to give it a try. what i got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. rene zelleweger is impressive in her role as ¬ënurse' betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. i also liked morgan freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian chris rock. the film bounces continuously between comedy, drama, romance, and thriller. yet despite this apparent identity crisis, it holds up quite well. i found my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end always waiting for the next twist in the story. the entire cast is strong, if not spectacular. my only real complaint is that director neil labute (who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark ¬ëin the company of men') relied much too heavily on many cliched hollywood conventions. the mood-creating musical effects he crammed down our throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable! and he did the standard old "let's take some of the minor characters and pair them up at the end in an illogical and unnecessary romance" trick, just to make absolutely certain everyone goes home with a smile on their face. why must directors and writers treat their audiences like idiots??but the movie is still much too enjoyable to be dragged down very far by these annoying irritations. in a very subpar year for movies, 'nurse betty' ranks as one of the more pleasant surprises of 2000. 8 out of 10.

this is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. the true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. the unbelievable story of a guy who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. gosh, is this what life made us be? people deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? "toto, i think we're not in kansas anymore".

renee zellweger is a kansas housewife whose domineering husband is mixed up in drug trafficking. two professional hit men -- morgan freeman and his son, chris rock, murder the husband in his dining room. zellweger, unobserved by the killers, witnesses this and undergoes a dissociative reaction, assuming the personality of a nurse -- the eponymous betty -- who is a character in her favorite soap opera. believing herself to be the tv character, zellweger takes off in her husband's car, which has a load of dope in the trunk, and travels to la where she hopes to link up with another character in this mindless afternoon drama, "dr. david ravell", greg kinnear. not realizing she is being pursued by the two hit men, she drives to la where she manages to link up with kinnear and is actually written into the show as a nurse named betty. a handful of men in the know, including the local sheriff, catch on to what's happening and also seek zellweger in la. the ending is believable and poignant.if that sounds crazy, it's because it is. and it's the writer's responsibility, john c. richards. the curious thing is that richards and the director, neil labute, with considerable help from the performers, just about pull it all off. this isn't a plot that has been cast in a familiar mold. nope. i give it bonus points for sheer originality. somebody went out on a limb. somebody took a chance on a movie that was not a copy or remake of something that had made money ten years or fifty years ago. i imagine the people involved, down on their knees every night, praying fervently. i don't know if the film was remunerative but it's mostly successful on its own aesthetic terms.it's what might be called an "initial premise" movie. you start off with a single transformative event, in this case the murder of zellweger's husband and her adoption of a genuinely new personality, and follow the resultant logical paths realistically. "groundhog day" is another, better and more intricately plotted, example. "nurse betty" has its logical cracks, where the incidents give up their plausibility. eg., at a party in la, zellweger finally runs into kinnear, the guy who plays her ex-fianc√© on tv. she's stunned (because, after all, she thinks she's betty, who lost her fianc√© long ago). she approaches kinnear and a couple of his colleagues and introduces herself as "nurse betty", the character. she addresses kinnear by the name of his tv character, "david ravell." the group are puzzled at first, then convince themselves that she's an aspiring actress who insists on staying "in character" during the conversation -- and afterward, too, after kinnear has become fascinated by her and the others bored. kinnear drives her home and even when she kisses him goodnight, she's still in character, leaving kinnear wide-eyed with astonishment at the relentless way she captures the character of betty. on the next date, kinnear returns her love. that development, the relationship between zellweger and kinnear at this point, is a crack in the logic, the kind that's absent from "groundhog day." by the end of night one, kinnear, like any other person, would realize that zellweger is a few clowns short of a circus.the rest of the film, which includes many digressions, succeeds beyond expectations. the relationship between morgan freeman and his insolent, nihilistic son is marvelously spelled out. morgan is flawless in his exasperation. he manages to fall in love with the image of zellweger as he unearths clues to her whereabouts and activities, and at the end he can't bring himself to shoot her. she's too sweet to shoot. after her transformation into betty, she left a note behind in kansas. "i want to help all life, whether it be animal, plant, or mineral." who could harm the author of such a preposterous connative statement? his admiration of her comes as an epiphany, as he stands near one of the floodlights at the rim of the grand canyon. zellweger, dressed as dorothy, or maybe the good witch of the east -- well, characters that, like zellweger, are from kansas anyway -- appears to freeman and he embraces her and kisses her tenderly. it's a scene that's at once eerie, romantic, and a little spooky. i once stood at one of those lights and threw some shredded paper into the updraft from the dark canyon and found myself surrounded by a thousand swirling bats who had misperceived the fluttering shreds as moths.right. where was i? okay. i was trying not to run out of space. zellweger's performance deserves plaudits. everything she does, every movement, every utterance, is naive and tentative. she really is a likable character -- and that despite the fact that she's no glamor girl by hollywood standards. but -- what an actress. compare her performance as the bumptious 19th-century hick in "cold mountain." just the opposite. but then everyone is up to snuff in this enjoyable film. allyson jannings does a fine job in a minor role. watch her when she tells greg kinnear that she's considering killing off his character in the soap opera in a drowning accident. kinnear is one of those narcissists who wears the kind of ten-thousand dollar thin black leather jackets that were popular at the time. he chuckles and says, "oh, one of those castaway deals, right? okay, how do i get back?" jannings doesn't answer. she just smiles at him with those enormous blue eyes and tilts her head mockingly.not a masterpiece of film-making but a good, original, professional job by everyone concerned.

minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the dvd.held together by a wonderful central performance from ren√©e zellweger, nurse betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fianc√© and sets off from kansas to hollywood to find him.instead of making jokes at the expense of betty's mental state, writer john c. richards is very sympathetic, with zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless. crucially she's never really a victim despite this and while she undoubtedly suffers horribly the motives of the characters who treat her poorly are all understandable - even greg kinnear as the object of her deluded affections may be an egotistical, blinkered, arrogant pig but he genuinely believes that she's merely a quirky wannabe actress with bags of talent rather than an insane stalker.the farcical ending where all the main protagonists descend on the same place (in this instance betty's house) at the same time to have it out is as old as cinema itself but it works quite well here, even if the shift in tone is unfortunate.zellweger is ably supported by kinnear and morgan freeman both doing solid work, and it's especially pleasing to see chris rock show restraint in his earlier scenes.not nearly as cruel as you might expect, and not at all mean-spirited, nurse betty - while far from being a laugh riot - is a solid entertainment elevated to something considerably more by the lead actress.

renee zellweger is betty, a kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (greg kinnear), and who is married to del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while betty secretly watches. it leaves her unhinged, believing that kinnear is really the character he plays, dr. david ravell, and that she is his rn ex-fianc√©e. she heads for la to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk. pursuing her are charlie and wesley (morgan freeman and chris rock respectively), the hit men who inadvertently killed del before they found out where the drugs were hidden. they pursue her across the country, while charlie gradually falls in love with his image of her.and in la, things get totally bizarre, as no one realizes that betty is delusional. alternately funny and touching, this movie is almost perfect. stop reading commentaries and go see it.

betty sizemore (renee zellweger) lives her life through soap opera "a reason to love" as a way to escape her slob husband and dull life. after a shocking incident involving two hit men (morgan freeman and chris rock), betty goes into shock and travels to la, believing that she is destined to marry the show's main character (greg kinnear).nurse betty is that rare thing, a lesser known film with an all-star cast and a fluffy rom-com plot that surprises with it's terrific script and spot on acting. indeed, such a plot makes one question the r rating, but it's warranted all right. the shocking incident that sends betty over the edge is a tad too graphic compared to the light, amusing comedy that is to come and feels like something out of a different movie, but at the same time it is necessary to believably show betty's transformation into the doe eyed, lovable nut job she becomes.as we go along with betty on her journey, director neil labute works some extraordinary magic which makes the movie unique and high above your bog standard comedy of error. an example of this would be betty's first meeting with her crush. she pours her heart out to him and he plays along, thinking she's auditioning for a part on the show. even as we are aware of the ludicrous nature of betty's ramblings, the music swells as she speaks, giving us, the audience, betty's emotional perspective. we almost believe what she is saying, yet we understand that her mind is fractured. whereas other filmmakers would try to accent the ridiculousness of the situation to wring every ounce of possible comedy out of the scene, labute is sensitive to his main character and treats her with the utmost sympathy and understanding.the banter between the hit men played by freeman and rock is priceless, the excellent script doling out clever line after clever line for them to riff off of. freeman in particular is excellent as always, pacing himself as his character slowly and blindly falls in love with his own ideal of betty, not even truly knowing who she is or what has happened to her. aaron eckhart once again shows versatility in the thankless role of betty's no-good husband and he is almost unrecognisable. the other revelation here is kinnear, whose portrayal of the soap's star is not too overcooked. there's a tendency to lay on the celebrity bastard clich√© as thickly as possible, and kinnear resists, instead imbuing him with a pompous yet restrained self importance, despite simply being a soap star.the soap opera is realised so well, it could almost exist. labute and co hit the nail on the head with this one and a good thing too. if the soap opera had been too satirical, a large part of the film would not have worked. to do a "days of our lives" spoof as seen in friends would have been the wrong move for this movie. the dedication to detail pays off, as the style and feel of the soap opera begins to bleed into betty's reality more and more, while keeping with the overall unintentionally comedic aspect of the genre. the scenes on the set feel real, as opposed to some films in which the atmosphere feels so manufactured, you wondered why people who do it for a living can't get it right.the neat resolution of the final act, while being a tad predictable, is wholly satisfying overall. it's a shame that after labute directed this wonderful film, the mainstream came calling for him to direct the abysmal remake of the wicker man, a fine example of a man so totally above the material given to him. unfortunately, one cannot absolve him of all responsibility.if you haven't seen nurse betty, it's something to discover. if you have, it's worth a re-visit. there is a charm to nurse betty that is infectious, even if it may not leave you thinking that much afterwards. a hidden gem nonetheless.

how do these guys keep going? they're about 50 years old each, and act as if they're only 30. they play 3 hours of music at every concert, and barely break a sweat. this dvd is their first concert in rio, brazil. although the people don't speak english, they try to memorize the words to the most famous rush songs, and try to sing a foreign language at the concert with their best friends.from tom sawyer to the spirit of radio, this concert dvd will keep you in the chair not wanting to pause or move away from the classics that you've listened to when you were young. this is their 30th reunion tour (started in 1974). i went to their scranton pa concert, and this was just as good, although in pa they didn't play freewill, so i was upset.they have freewill, they have the trees, they have yyz, the pass, driven, dreamline, red sector a, limelight, roll the bones, 2112, and much more. 10 out of 10, because nothing else compares. if you never go to a rush concert, then at least buy this dvd.

personally, i regard "the egyptian" in an extremely favourable light.it was introduced to me by a well-known australian movie commenter & critic named bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. this movie fitted the bill perfectly & i came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as i watched it, as i was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.to me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production! yes, i am aware of its flaws! but it was so enticing ¬Ö the young man of idealism learning from & inspired by his father ¬Ö the peasant treated like rubbish in his suffering ¬Ö the opportunistic friend however flawed but nonetheless loved by his friend, the central character sinute ¬Ö and to be sure, a flawed hero too, like so many across humanity of all societies & across all time¬Öbut lovable & worthy of love too! yes, i believe in a christian god, but too, i acknowledge the rights & respect that should be due any human being of good heart, who would not or will not disrespect the rights of his fellowman without just cause. as such, i endorse this film & its presentation of a man of good heart & conviction in his belief in the sun-god he was devoted to. such people will always be welcome in my world vision, and hopefully, in many more beyond.so too, the drama in the ensuing movie i have watched often as surely as it has touched my heart & soul, as surely as it seems to have infuriated critics in its era. it is captivating, watching the struggles & grief & loves of sinute, the physician! when i watch it again, i am always reminded of my friend in heart bill, the film critic, who dared to oppose all the critics long ago who rubbished it. he added criticism of too many critics ¬Ö that they make statues to honour stars, on the screen or in history, but they do not make statues to honour critics! and beyond all this, i am reminded with each viewing of a superb & touching spectacle, of a beautiful & well-presented drama, that was not just relevant to the 1950s or some bygone era. it was meant for you & me, across time & place, to every man & woman & child & to their personal aspirations for love & freedom & overcoming obstacles to misunderstanding & gross injustice & tragedy appealing to those of simple faith of many religions, that it seems too many regard as cause for war! take a night off from invitations or unjust violence, from bigotry & judgemental attacks on others injustly executed & consider the merits of this offering. not to the sun god, or to power that proves time & again to be so transcient .. let this outstanding movie wash over you, like waves onto a beach, like the passing hands of time ¬Ö like life was meant to be. and maybe, you will find yourself carried into its world of possibilities! lost offerings no more! 9.9 out of 10!

i'll bet i watch this film 4 or 5 times a year, and will do so more often, now that the hollyweird moguls have seen fit to put it on dvd, because it's a classic with a capital "c"! this film is timeless! how can people pay $10.00 nowadays to see the junk that comes out of hollyweird with movies like the egyptian; the ten commandments; ben hur; captain newman md on tape; dvd; and cable movie channels; i could go on forever, but this film is so great, and for a relative unknown, edmund purdom carries the movie like atlas carried the world. the story is wonderful, the acting is first-rate, and the graphics at the end are so powerful, you sit in your seat for a few minutes, just trying to let the words sink in! really a knockout of a film. i'd give this one 15 stars if they'd let me! they don't make them like this anymore, but they should!!!!!

this was the second cinemascope spectacle that fox produced after the robe. notice how some of the roman sets are redressed to pass for egyptian sets. the film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (alfred newman and bernard herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). however, the principal acting is a bit weak. edmund purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. the best performances come from peter ustinov as the one-eyed slave and polish actress bella darvi as the babylonian temptress "nefer". i find this movie in general to be strong on plot which is rare for these large spectacles produced at the time. all in all, the film does an interesting and entertaining job of social commentary on what egyptian society might have looked like.

i saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with "valley of the kings." these movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in egyptology. (in 1975 i visited egypt!) seen today, "the egyptian" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the big screen.

i would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. i just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces sinuoeh, the lead character. i remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time i saw it. apparently, she was a holocaust refugee, discovered by a french husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. she died very young and under tragic circumstances. gene tierney is also outstanding in this film. like other neo-biblical films of the 1940's and 50s, "the egyptian" reflects the morals and values of that time, but is still great entertainment because the performances are terrific and the story so well told.

there are many film now on dvd, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. the egyptian, along with el cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. many people from my generation learn a lot about history of egypt, medieval spain and even the incas, (the first time i heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with charlton heston called the treasure of the incas), same happened to me with egypt, or rome seen many "bad" epics of the era. many production values, excellent use of color (the de luxe color was more brigit and sharp that the ordinary technicolor), maybe the cast was wrong but in any case, the film did man√®ged to give us idea of the life in ancient egyptin and was in a way the motor to go out and buy the novel, my mika waltari, one of the best, if not the best historical-novel ever published. also oust anding was the superb score by alfred newman and bernard herrmann. i saw this film many times when i was a boy, it was not the big box office hit that fox studios wanted to afther the robe enormous hit, in cinemascope and stereo was a wonderful eye popping sp4ectacle. i have the lasser disc version.m the only way to see ito its wdisescreen format. soon i hope will appeared.

"the egyptian" is set during the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of the ancient world, the pharaoh akhnaton, who, thirteen centuries before christ attempted to introduce a monotheistic religion, atenism, to ancient egypt. the main character, however, is not akhnaton but rather the fictitious sinuhe. as a baby, sinuhe is found mysteriously floating in a basket on the river nile and adopted by the physician senmut and his wife. when he grows to manhood, he follows his adopted father into the medical profession, initially working (as his father did) among the poor of the city, but he comes to prominence after he and his friend, the ambitious young soldier horemheb, save the pharaoh's life while on a hunting expedition in the desert. sinuhe is appointed court physician, but becomes obsessed with the babylonian courtesan nefer. sinuhe not only ruins himself in a vain attempt to win her love, but is also disgraced when his neglect of his duties means that he is unable to save the life of akhnaton's daughter.sinuhe flees into exile, where he achieves success as a healer in neighbouring countries, but returns to egypt when he learns of a hittite plot to invade. although akhnaton readily forgives him for his previous offences, sinuhe finds the country in turmoil. the pharaoh's attempts to introduce a new religion have led to civil strife between his followers and those of the priests of the old polytheistic faith, and he is too pacific by nature to take any steps to confront the hittite threat. sinuhe becomes embroiled in a plot by horemheb, now the general of the egyptian army, and akhnaton's sister princess baketamon to overthrow the pharaoh and replace him with a more effective monarch.the film's weaknesses arise mostly from its two romantic subplots. in the course of the film, sinuhe is revealed as the long-lost son of the previous pharaoh and half-brother to akhnaton and baketamon. it might therefore surprise a modern audience that she should fall in love with him; marriage between brothers and sisters were not necessarily considered as incestuous by the standards of egyptian royalty, but the standards of 1950s cinema audiences were generally less liberal on this point. in any case, the horemheb-baketamon-sinuhe love triangle is an unnecessary complication and detracts from baketamon's role in the film, that of the voice of cold-eyed, cynical realpolitik.the nefer subplot, which takes up most of the first hour of the film, is overwritten and excessively melodramatic. nefer is morally worthless but fascinating, and the role needed an actress of great beauty and also great dramatic skill to make her credible, especially as nefer achieves the difficult task of winning sinuhe away from a woman as lovely as jean simmons (who plays merit, sinuhe's rival for her affections). it is therefore unfortunate that the role went to an actress as comically inept as bella darvi, whose only qualification was that she was the mistress of the producer, darryl f. zanuck. darvi was not only a wooden actress, but also spoke with a thick foreign accent, made even more incomprehensible by a lisp. she was not even particularly attractive by comparison with the two legendary hollywood beauties in the film, simmons and gene tierney who plays baketamon.the film is better when it concentrates on its main political and religious themes. the other actors are better than darvi, although peter ustinov as sinuhe's servant kaptah makes the same mistake as in "spartacus", that of trying to bring comic relief into a film that does not need it. his voice, anyway, was far too patrician for a "comic servant" role.edmund purdom, a little-known british actor, was thrust into the main role when marlon brando pulled out at the last minute, but more than adequately fills the great man's shoes, even though his style of acting was quite different. he copes well with the challenge of showing the changes in sinuhe's character, from unworldly idealist, to lovesick fool, to embittered cynic to the enlightened visionary of the final scenes. victor mature was never the most expressive of actors, but he is well-suited to the role of horemheb, a practical, down-to-earth man of action. he is better here than he was in his other epic from 1954, "demetrius and the gladiators". simmons is luminously beautiful as merit.michael wilding (hitherto best known to me as the second mr elizabeth taylor) plays akhnaton as a would-be philosopher-king who ends as a sort of holy fool. his inability to make difficult decisions makes him an unsuitable ruler, but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice which lend him an air of moral greatness far beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne. although aten had more in common with the supreme being of the deists than with the old testament jehovah or the trinitarian christian god, there is a quite deliberate attempt to draw parallels between atenism and christianity. in the film the atenist symbol is the "ankh", doubtless chosen because of its resemblance to a cross, but in reality it was a common egyptian hieroglyph for life, not unique to atenism. akhnaton's language often has a biblical ring to it; his comparison of himself to "wind whistling in the desert" recalls john the baptist's "voice crying in the wilderness" (hence the title of this review). sinuhe's finding in the river parallels the old testament story of moses.at the end of the film sinuhe, who has become the inheritor of the spirit of the dead akhnaton, achieves a moral greatness of his own. the message of the film is that, while we may need practical men of action like horemheb, we also need visionaries and thinkers who are prepared to ask the question "why?" for all its faults, "the egyptian" is a film which is idealistic and humane in its approach to both religion and politics. 7/10

i was on my way out one morning when i was checking something on the t.v. and came across this film. i don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. what a fun and interesting one to watch. well, my meeting was pushed back, because i couldn't get out of this film. it had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. well, there was a lot of realism in it. the acting was good for a 1954 film. subtle and genuine actions on the part of the characters that had me watching what they were going to do next. that is why i ended up watching it. i don't know why they don't show it more often. i would rather watch this than some films they play more than necessary. for history buffs, people who like period films, and those that are in the film appreciation groups will like this one. "the egyptian" has a variety of flavors dealing with a lot of things to look at in human nature that has not changed since it's time. what does that say about us? those that don't like movies that take their time to unfold and tell a good story....are not into film.i haven't had the time to rent it if it is available, but if i get a chance to see it again, i would probably vote it a 10.

the cell is weak on plot, filled with holes and has pretty lousy acting as well. but none of this matters, for, director tarsem singh has given us one of the most visually stunning movies ever. the whole plot is just an excuse to let tarsem fool around and take you into the minds of a serial killer, bringing the audience some shocking, pleasing, breath-taking and mind blowing images.the images from this beautiful movie will stick with you for a long time to come. this movie is a perfect case for the "suspension of disbelief" theory. forget the silly plot, just let your senses be overwhelmed with the images. and j.lo looks stunning enough to add to the rest of tarsem's work. the cinematography is harrowing, the music haunting & the costumes just stunning. the movie is less of a movie and more of a work of art. its just that the medium is not canvas anymore, it is the big-screen and celluloid. one of the most refreshing movies of this decade. the cell is a must watch. a bold new step in movie making.an enthralling 8!!

if you are a fan of early duke movies, this lone star oldie is a good one. what more could you ask for than duke, yak, and gabby. lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! i found it amazing that duke's singing voice was bill bradbury, who is none other than bob steele's twin brother. it has been reported that bob steele was a high school classmate and friend of duke, so twin brother bill may have been too. anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one. we don't have to wonder about hidden meanings or try to figure out underlying themes. just sit back, relax and enjoy a western movie from a simpler day and time. it's called entertainment folks!!!

along with virtually every republic picture ever made, "murder in the music hall" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. a shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of radio city music hall. a murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious rockettes--among them, vera ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), helen walker, ann rutherford, julie bishop, and several other delectable b-movie starlets of the '40s. tall, blond and handsome william marshall (usually cast in musicals) hunts down the killer as the complex and increasingly creepy plot unfolds, against the swankiest settings you'll ever see in a film noir. the ending is as much of a surprise as is this sadly forgotten, classy murder mystery. well-worth restoring and reviving on cable-tv, vhs or dvd. republic sank a hefty budget in this grade-a production, and "murder in the music hall" is as slick, unnerving, and immensely enjoyable as any of the major studios' films of its era. possible spoiler: pay attention to the rhapsodic song composed by the victim just before his death. then, amidst the showgirls' incessant chattering in their dressing rooms, try to pinpoint the one humming that fatal melody. you'll discover who the killer is just as william marshall does. grand fun, the kind of movie they truly don't make anymore, and what a loss--both to movie-goers and actors alike.

please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the radio city music hall! as an archivist re: the music hall..i know what is and what is not associated with the new york venue. the film's theodore is just the "music hall." no rockettes are in the film. only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. just thought you would like to know. truly a wonderful film. you will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. what a superb plot and beautiful ice skating. one never sees that kind of performances any more. the roxy theater and the center theatres, in new york city, had ice skating performances on stage!

not since bette davis's 1933 vehicle "ex-lady" have i seen a film that was so much better than its star said it was! most of the bum rap "atoll k," a.k.a. "utopia," a.k.a. "robinson crusoeland," a.k.a. "escapade" has got over the years has come from the horror stories stan laurel told of its production. given that he suffered a stroke during filming, looked like death warmed over through much of it (from the opening two-shot of them together you'd never guess that laurel survived hardy by eight years) and was subsequently diagnosed with diabetes (once he adjusted his diet accordingly he restored himself to health), one can understand why laurel didn't think this film was the most pleasant experience of his life. yes, it's flawed: the cheapness of the production shows through, the dubbing is awful and laurel and hardy were too old to do the energetic slapstick of their greatest films. but it's still genuinely funny, and l√©o joannon's story introduces elements of political satire (sometimes libertarian, sometimes communalist) one would expect to see from more socially conscious comedians like chaplin or the marx brothers but never from laurel and hardy. the film deserves credit for being different (though its debt to the ealing studios' classic "passport to pimlico," made just a year earlier, is pretty obvious) and for integrating the laurel and hardy comedy into a rather edgy context completely different from anything they'd used before. this isn't a great movie, but it's certainly better than the eight dreary ones for fox and mgm they'd made in the early 1940's. i suspect only the film's technical crudity kept it from earning the cult following among anti-establishment baby-boomer youth the marx brothers' "duck soup" acquired in the late 1960's/early 1970's.

the movie is not halve as bad as people want to make you believe it is.what is the reason why so many people hate this movie? is it because it's laurel & hardy's last one together and it's not their best? or is it because of the lack of laurel & hardy regulars? or because it's not made by the hal roach studios or 20th century fox? definitely true that this movie is not a successful attempt to revive laurel & hardy and bring them to the '50's. it's also definitely true that the movie is far from their best but honestly, the movie still entertains well, making this movie also far from their worst. not the most worthy 'goodbye' movie imaginable but an entertaining and suiting goodbye nevertheless. both of them retired from movies after completing this one.the movie still features some great slapstick moments and the chemistry between laurel & hardy is obviously still very much present. it also makes this movie better than most of their movies together from the '40's. quite a surprise that the slapstick humor still works out as great as it does, considering that the days of slapstick comedy had been over, ever since the '30's.the story is perhaps not as entertaining as it could had been and it features too many sidekicks and characters, with as a result that the movie looses its focus on the boys at times. a shame, because they are still the ones that really carry and make the movie.sad to see in what poor form stan laurel was at the time of making this movie. he really looked ill and old, which he also of course was. he was well over 60 years old already. but after a surgery he fully recovered and still lived for another 15 years, before dying in 1965, 8 years after his good friend oliver hardy.an entertaining, though not perfect goodbye to the boys, laurel & hardy and the end of 3 decades of fun, humorous, quality slapstick entertainment of movies that are still being watched and loved by people all over the world.7/10

utopia, made in 1950 in france, was the last film laurel and hardy produced. with the bad reputation the duo have for their post 1930's productions i was expecting this film to be awful. although admittedly it isn't up to the standard of their "vintage" comedies i was pleasantly surprised. it's watchable, and in parts genuinely funny! and certainly the plot is of the same standard as you'd expect. some gags are derivative from their earlier work, but when you consider this film was their first for five years after their last hollywood produced film, "the bullfighters", the routines are executed confidently as you'd expect from these professionals. some scenes are not up to much, but the value of this film is that some scenes are funny, and as such, absolutely priceless. i particularly enjoyed the bedtime scene.i felt sad at the end of the film. our heros are left on their own desert island. it's such a metaphor for the real life truth. hollywood and audiences of the time had consigned the stars to a desert island of memories, and that was to become last image they portrayed in film. ollie died seven years later and stan died fifteen years later. stan turned down an offer to appear in "it's a mad mad mad mad world" in 1963. what a shame that was - a colour film, only two years before he passed. however, his health probably wasn't up to much.these boys are probably the greatest comedy performers of all time, and although the movie is far from their true potential, it's still an honour to watch them appear in film for the last time, and touching on the echos of their towering talent.

unfortunately, i've never seen the full version of this movie. i did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. even more floridly directed than is the norm with julien duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. beautifully lit too by photographer andr√© thomas, black jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including agnes moorehead and marcel dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations. george sanders gives a polished performance, whilst an eccentric millionairess (who turns out to be a rival racketeer) is admirably played by agnes moorehead. also realizing the most from her role, patricia roc. the film was made, on locations in spain, in 1949.

i saw this film when it was released to the minor cinemas in the uk some 50 years ago; and the memory remains of a great musical score, and the tragedy of the storyline. i saw it again on video recently. the sound track was poor and the picture grainy; but it is one of two films that i saw again the next day, the other being gladiator. the music theme is intensely tragic, and from the outset one knows that it heralds failure or death. certainly one of george sanders best performances; as a man working the black market to get pay back for what he lost in the war, but nemesis waits; patricia roc plays a refugee from eastern europe eaten with despair. he is attracted to her, selflessly wants to help her, and then falls in love with her, but she is too proud and hurt to accept help. their love destroys him, and inevetably the girl and the doctor (herbert marshall), who brought the nemesis. the storyline is of complex intertwining destinies, where subsidiary characters are not who they appear to be. this is as a film, which diappointed the critics and struggled at the box office; but for the adolescent who saw it, and the retired gentleman who saw it again it is one of the greatest films (taking into account its age)whose story is more akin to an opera.

i was really surprised, that my mom watched whole movie without leaving to iron, clean or some other things like these. and i was almost shocked, when she said, it was very funny and very interesting. and i think so.

how can anyone dare say anything bad about this film? pardon mel brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.the first time i saw this, i cried from laughing so hard. everything about it is funny.while "robin hood: men in tights" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by "real genius"), it ranks way up there in my book. so go see it! if you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over cary elwes.

this movie needs to come out on dvd cause that's the only way i will buy it. i thought it was soo funny because there was no real plot to it. it was not suppose to be an oscar winning film. i appreciate those films. cary elwes was a very cute robin hood. i can't even think of my favorite part of the movie because they are all pretty good. anyways peace out.!!!!

i cant believe there are people out there that did not like this movie! i thought it was the funniest movie i had ever seen. it my have been b/c i am mel brooks biggest fan... i know almost all the words and get very discouraged when they censor them, when it is played on a family channel. :) this is one of my favorite movies, so i dont know why any one would disagree! thanks kristina

this movie is one of my all time favorites. i have watched it probably 100 times (literally) and it is still funny to me. it seems that every time i watch it, i see something different. mel brooks is definitely the all time king of side splitting comedy.

mel brooks really outdid himself with this hilarious stand-up of the robin hood story. the cast is perfect, and cary elwes does a fine job at his role. in my personal opinion (besides the fact that i'm a cary elwes fan) this movie is the best, and funniest, i've ever seen! it will have you laughing every time you see it!

just like all of mel brooks' other comedies, men in tights is hilarious. but in seeing this as an outrageous comedy, i think many fail to realize that the reason the movie is so funny is that the characters themselves are acted so well. elwes is the well-spoken former british noble, lewis is an eternally annoyed king (i hope it's worth all the nooooooiiiise!), deluise is a fantastic godfather, roger rees is a worried and cynical sheriff.... the actors and actresses are so loyal to their parts that the jokes flow forth with ease. yes, we've seen this kind of comedy before, but the only comedy to achieve better character development, in my opinion, is the big lebowski. very very funny.

mel brooks has really outdone himself on this movie. no one can deny that blazing saddles was a classic, and a breakthrough in this style of comedy film, but men in tights has become the apex of his creative genius. this movie is a definite must-see. if you enjoy this movie, i would also recommend space balls and history of the world. the same goes in reverse. if you have seen any of these movies, then men in tights should be next on your list.

mel brooks is a great writer,director and actor, but once in a while even he can have a klinker. the beginning of this starts out almost basically just meeting one character after another.you have cary elwes who's charming and talented, but he can't do comedy. his expressions into the camera show that even he can't believe the inanities in the script. richard lewis looks bored and distracted throughout without much to do and amy yasbeck is stuck in high-school acting mode. dave chapelle shows great comedy range mugging and hamming for the camera and mark blankfield is mostly stifled in the role of the blind man, but then he does still manage to show great comedy range. eric allen kramer doesn't have much to do, but the few scenes he does have are binding. the best roles are those of roger rees, tracy ullman, megan cavanaugh and brooks for when he does appear. dom deluise has a funny turn as a mafia don employing a clint eastwood lookalike, but on the minus side, some of the jokes aren't very funny while some of the really funny ones seem stolen from mel's other movies.

this is my favorite mel brooks movie because it was the first one i ever saw. i was in the fourth grade when it came out and i watched it all the time. i saw the producers second and then blazing saddles. this is a sentimental favorite because it was my first mel brooks movie.

this probably ranks in my top-5 list of the funniest movies i've ever seen! i was not a big fan of robin hood, or robin hood: prince of thieves, but this movie was a lot different! it made fun of robin hood, and was hilarious! i was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! besides home alone, mrs. doubtfire, and houseguest, this was the funniest move i've ever seen! i especially love the song; "we're men in tights!" if you have a good sense of humor, you'll love this movie!

spoilers ahead------------------------- mel has got it going on. from the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. dave chappel shows why he is a comedic force. cary eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from robin hood. right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. if you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie. what makes this movie special you say? throughout the movie you see blinken and acuhu walk beside each other becoming great friends as robin hood's sidekicks. but, it blinken is never told or fails to grasp that he is black, until the crowd says " a black sheriff", blinken replays "he's black". that is a timeless scene. simple one of the most enteraining movies of our time.

i first saw robin hood: men in tights back in 1994 in the cinema. i went to see it because i always liked robin hood and i saw the trailer of this movie and thought it was hilarious. after i saw the movie i must say it was even better than i thought. not only is it very funny, it's also a very well made movie with beautiful sets and costumes and a very beautiful score by hummie mann. the acting in the movie is also good, cary elwes is funny as robin hood and also tracey ullman, richard lewis, mark blankfield, david chapelle, amy yasbeck, megan cavanagh, eric allan kramer, matthew porretta and mel brooks himself are funny. but the best part in the movie is played by roger rees as the evil sheriff of rottingham. he has the best scenes in the movie and also the best dialogue ("king illegal forest to pig wild kill in it a is", which stands for "it is illegal to kill a wild pig in the king's forest").he somehow mixes up all the words and speaks out a sentence that nobody understands. robin hood: men in tights is in my book one of the best mel brooks films to date and i can't say that i have laughed as much about a film as this one. it's just non-stop laughing.

there won't be one moment in this film where you aren't laughing. this is mel brooks at one of his high points, and cary elwes carries off the part of robin with convincing humour. every time you watch this film you will discover a new joke, but the ones you have noticed before will never grow old. highly recomended!

if you don't like mel brooks, you won't like this film. that's a given. why anyone wouldn't like his films is unknown to me, but for those who can't see the light, just avoid it.everyone else: this is a classic. the entire cast is perfect: carey elwes is a dashing, clever, british robin hood, amy yasbeck overacts appropriately as marion, richard lewis is his usual distracted, annoyed self, roger rees is a brilliant combination of fluster and violence as "mervyn" the sheriff of rottingham, and dave chapelle, eric allan kramer, mark blankfield, and the sadly underused matthew poretta are the perfect merry men.there are similarities to spaceballs, blazing saddles...and every other mel brooks movie. but why would you want him to change his style when it works so damn well? the pop culture references in this movie are old enough to be funny again...from the view of a 16 year old, at least. it's complete and utter parody, every second a play for a laugh. some of them don't work, but most do, and well. i discovered new jokes the fifth and sixth time i watched the film!of course, if being barraged by constant visual and verbal gags isn't your style, you wouldn't like this. this isn't an academy award winner, it's mel brooks. you know what it is when you're getting into it. if you want nonstop laughter, surprisingly well-developed characters, and catchphrases to last a lifetime, watch this.

i don't think i have ever seen a better movie parody. mel brooks is insane. every time i watch it i find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. cary elwes is perfect for the role of robin hood. it has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. every character is great from little john and will to maid marian and broomhilde. i laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. watch it!!if you liked cary elwes in this movie, you must definitely see the princess bride.

might contain spoilers.this is just a good movie. lots of good silly stuff to laugh at. however, do not watch the tv version, they cut to much out. dom deluise is rather awesome as the mafia don who is hired to kill robin. all i can say about his ten minutes: it's a long drive from jersey. also you gotta love them checking the script to make sure robin gets another shot. also: 12th century fox.any bad stuff? the rappers at the beginning and the end seem rather out dated. the songs were rather lame. one time while watching this movie, i could think out a few more times when they could have thrown in another joke or 2. on the whole, however, an enjoyable movie experience. a must watch for comedy fans.

"robin hood: men in tights" has received no respect whatsoever. it was hilarious! cary elwes was excellent as the "prince of thieves," and david chappelle, amy yasbeck, patrick stewart, richard lewis and mark blankfield as blinkin all did fine jobs. i will never understand the hostility toward "robin hood: men in tights," but i do know a great comedy when i see one."robin hood: men in tights" receives *** out of ****.

i can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but i can say that i enjoyed it. if there is a god, the sound track will be released, ilona sekacz' work is truly enduring. twenty years on i am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.the story surrounds the entry into society of catherine moreland. somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in gothic stories (early pulp fiction?), catherine descends on bath in the company of mrs allen where she meets henry tilney. she is invited to visit the tilneys at northanger abbey, the seat of the formidable (and somewhat financially challenged) general tilney, who has the unfortunate misconception that there is wealth afoot.where mutual attraction mixes with family finance, dispute is inevitable. this coupled with catherines vivid imagination, leads her to fear for her safety. her eventual departure is marred by accusations and counter accusations of deception and connivance.but the attraction between catherine and henry stands these trials. he returns to provide a happy ending. this final scene is especially compelling, given the incidental music of ilona sekacz.it may well be a "bad" production from the purists viewpoint, gaudy costumes and shaky performances not withstanding, but for me it's 88 minutes of bliss.

i got this movie with my bbc "jane austen collection" (5 dvds of old bbc adaptations) and didn't like it at first. it's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so i thought, one of the qualities that i enjoy in all other austen movies: cheerful common sense. the nightmare scene in which mrs. richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.i still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but i do love hearing mrs. r. saying, dreamily, while she sews, "my only acquaintance...tore my gown." this movie is now my current austen favorite. i've watched it 7 or 8 times so far. the acting, to my mind, is incredible. the way i notice good acting is when i find myself looking up from whatever i'm doing (sewing, though not my fingers together, hopefully, or boondoggling or whatever) in order to watch the character deliver his lines. it's the turn of expression, the cast of posture, that make the words come alive -- that's what makes good acting, as far as i'm concerned.well, i watch almost every part of "northanger abbey" because almost all the actors play their roles with such charisma. peter firth is amazing as mr. tilney, the perfect blend of bathian fop and real, masculine hero - you're not sure until the end whether he's after catherine's money or not. i love his touch of (welsh?) accent. mr. and mrs. richards are charming: the combination of their behaviors - especially mr. richards' high voice, lending counterpoint to his wit and wisdom - makes them so real. general tilney as the hard-hearted father who may possibly be a murderer is fascinating, too. and captain tilney, the grinning rake who is so clearly enjoying himself... and the moneygrubbing sister and brother whose names i can't currently remember - the two of them are so perfectly, at once, smart and smarmy.the other reason i love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all the jane austen adaptations. i know this was one of austen's weak points (well, it is as far as i am concerned): even though all her novels are love stories, it's hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are really in love at the end. and if they're aren't really in love, then what's the point? all the other adaptations i've seen (other than the early olivier/garson one) have pretty cold-fish kisses at the end, if they kiss at all. i don't at all like sex in movies but it really is necessary to have a heartfelt kiss in the end. and the ending kiss in northanger is a doozy.the over-the-top approach to costumes, music, and lighting work very well as far as i'm concerned. and the script is extremely clever - the way we are educated about gothic romance, highlife in bath, cathy's normal country upbringing, etc., is very well done, as they usually are in bbc productions. also, i like the part when the little black page does the cartwheels. and the marchionesse, i think, was an entirely appropriate and very clever expository device.some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what jane austen intended to do in northanger abbey - she meant to make fun of gothic romance, not promote it. but i don't think she meant to put "mysteries of udolpho," etc., down. she was just making the point that you need to distinguish between reality and fiction. and this point is made when mr. tilney chides catherine in his mother's room. besides, general tilney was a villain, albeit a prosaic one. that point was meant to be made, surely.

although it strays away from the book a little, you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings.the scenes in bath are just how they should be. although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, i like the scene where they are in the hot baths, but did the men and women really bathe together like that? you could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but perhaps this was the style at the time. the ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. i especially liked catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene.northanger abbey looked suitably imposing, but i enjoyed the bath scenes better.schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland. googie withers gives the best performance as mrs allen i feel.ugh peter firth as mr tilney, he just talks a load of rubbish, and is not a clergyman as he should be, it's hard to think of him being in love with catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either.general tilney is played reasonably well by hardy, and stuart also gives a sort of good performance as isabella. ingrid lacey did not give a good performance as elinor tilney. as for john thorpe, well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but i quite like it.i can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. the marchioness! i hate her. she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy.some of the script is peculiar. when catherine is asking elinor tilney about her mothers death she asks "i suppose you saw the body? how did it appear?" what a silly thing to say! elinor's calm response is stupid too.anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me

i'm a fan of independent film. dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. some of the other posts are right: "wannabes" isn't going to rival "the godfather" for best mob film ever. on the other hand, "wannabes" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. my problem with one of the other reviews:- conor dubin stands out as the only irishman in a cast of italians- dubin is a jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an irishman. he doesn't stand out at all, rather, delivers a great performance.this didn't win many awards, but it is deserving of a saturday night with a bowl of popcorn. i found it for 7 bucks at blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised to say the least! highly recommended.

heath ledgers acting in this film really bugs me, but overall its a great watch. bryan brown is excellent when i dont normally like him, but then his whole gang are a great piece of work. jimmy is a hapless wannabe gangster who cant seem to do a thing right (spoilers: loses pandos money, ackos car and nearly bumbles a bank robbery) but still comes out on top.didnt know what the two kids were in it for at the start but they ties some storylines together nicely.all in all a damn fine piece of australian cinema 9/10

the movie is made in a style that resembles lock, stock and two smoking barrels, with lot's of subplots, fancy camerawork, cool music and that great tongue-in-cheek aussie type of humor you'll find nowhere else. how this movie has escaped the european and american audience is a mystery!

a gritty australian film, with all the elements for success. two hands represents the ability of australian film makers and actors to produce top-quality, popular material. the film has a fresh angle, and uniquely incorporates drama, suspense and comedy.i found this film thoroughly enjoyable on so many different levels - but can also appreciate that it might not be everyone's 'cup of tea'. the film carries a distinct aussie humour, as it portrays the seedy underworld of sydney, and explores the lives of a young man (ledger) and young woman (byrne), swept up in the local crime scene.two hands deals with the theme of good and evil, both on an interpersonal and personal level and looks at the issue of consequences for 'our' actions.the camera work is snazzy and the dialogue humorous. with bryan brown who plays pando and heath ledger as jimmy, battling it out on-screen in the most bizarre situations - this aussie film is certainly not short of acting talent.this subtle action/comedy has become somewhat of a cult favourite, and one of mine also.

this movie gives you more of an idiea how australians act. even though the castle is a great australian movie, it's a bit out there. this movie is by far the best aussie flick i have seen (haven't seen dirty deeds yet) and probably would be my favourite movie. the point is, if you haven't seen it, go see it. if a crime/action/comedy is your thing.

before i start my review here is a quick lesson in australian slang which may help you with viewing the movie and understanding some of the other reviews from australia and overseas.in australian slang "thongs" are a pair of rubber sandals (not to be confused with the same american word that pertains to butt revealing underwear), "stubbies" are a brand of australian short, a "stubby" is a small can sized bottle of beer, and a "stubby holder" is a foam insulator for a small bottle of beer.if you love black comedies about smalltime criminals then you will love this movie, unfortunatley a lot of people on imdb with weak stomachs and no appreciation of dark humour have reviewed this movie which unfortunately makes this movie appear to be more mediocre than what it is. a lot of reviewers have also compared it to lock/stock and pulp fiction, while it is the same genre, it is a completely different and original style.a lot of reviewers have also panned this movie for using heath ledger's characters dead brother to open and guide the narrative for this movie, without watching the movie closely enough to realise that his brother was killed by the same villain that wishes to kill heaths character, this is explained midway through the movie but not clearly enough for most to understand.this movie is also reminiscent of lock/stock and reservoir dogs in that it is the director/writers debut feature, and for a debut feature it rates as well as these two movies, as a matter of fact like lock/stock and reservoir dogs i rate this movie as a 10/10 for a director/writers debut, unfortunately unlike tarantino and ritchie jordan fails to live up to expectations in his subsequent movies like ned kelly.this movie is one that you should definitely add to your dvd collection and is one that holds up to several viewings quite easily.

a good story, well-acted with unexpected character twists eg. vicious murderous gangster bryan brown teaching his son macrame. although it succeeds as an action drama where you hope the good guy (ledger) and his gilrfriend succeed, it also has some hilarious ironic black humour eg. the bank robbers who become radio competition "winners" and their reaction, the busker's revenge etc. well worth watching.

two hands restored my faith in aussie films. it took an old premise and made it fresh. i enjoyed this movie to no end. i recommend it to those people who like guy ritchie films. bryan brown was fantastic and just about perfect in a role tailor made for him. ledger was adequtely dumb and his performance anchored a very satisfying movie for me.

i saw two hands back in sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. it's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). like much australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and jordan should justly feel proud of his work.anyway, it was on tv just now on channel 4 in london, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out! so if you watch this movie, make sure it's the original version.

i'm afraid i must disagree with mr. radcliffe, as although he is correct in saying this isn't a comedy, it has many other merits. the plot is a little mad at parts, but i believe it it all fits together nicely, creating a satisfying, enjoyable film. the last scene was rather abysmal compared to the rest of the film, but the actual ending of the plot a few scenes previously is very interesting, showing just what someone will do under stressful circumstances.i would recommend this film to fans of thrillers and action movies, but if you're a fan of gangster movies then as long as you don't expect expect something as deep as goodfellas then you should still find it enjoyable.

brilliant film! i am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like pulp f. but thats how it is with post pulp era. many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. but this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from tarantino, which is a good similarity!anyway the film's about a guy bloke in australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it. to his assistance is his deceased brother (anyone remember val kilmer in true r.?) to pay of his debt and escape from the gangsters who are on his trail. the gangsters are cold blooded, but take the time to play chess and focus on the upbringing of their children! they also get served tea from their granny while planning a bank robbery and have trouble what to do with their kids during the robbery. so a humorous gangster flick with heath ledger in good form (though i'm not a fan) , and bryan brown in great action as a gang leader.

the creator of donnie darko brings you a twilight zone themed tale of the oddest fashion. the film centers on a middle aged young couple living paycheck to paycheck in 1976. one day a mysterious box appears with a red button. later on that day a spooky gentleman shows up and tells them that they have the choice to press the button and receive a million dollars but someone they don't know will die. it's a disturbing and provocative question suspensefully outlined in the trailer and tv spots. but let it be known that you just don't know what your in for until you see it. at times pretentious and a bit melodramatic the film is ultimately effective because of it's good performances and intriguing subject matter. it would be unfair to ruin any of the plot twists for you but lets just say the film will deliver on the aspects you expect it to and not completely fulfill others it begins to outline. there's a lot of apparent symbolism and subtext in the film which is both interesting and annoying as it wasn't so evident in his other superior film donnie darko. there isn't too much more to say without ruining the film for you. it's meant to inspire lots of cafe chatter afterwards. however, i'd also like to say it's shot well and has an appropriately aged look to it and it's worth a watch. check it out.

forget about donnie darko. i open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews i have read on the box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to darko. it isn't that i disagree with that necessarily, i just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. there are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. in darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential. in the box, the driving force of the narrative stems from a moral dilemma. believe me when i say that i understand the inclination to compare an innovative filmmakers'movies by looking for trends and patterns, but for me it is more important to approach each new film as a self contained entity first, and then broaden my gaze afterwards. the box is one of those films you get mixed feelings about because it seems to be in some sort of identity crisis. it isn't always sure what it wants to be. the twists are numerous, but easy to follow if not to predict. james marsden and cameron diaz play a relatively believable pair of newlyweds who are in financial straits. a box containing a "button unit" arrives on their doorstep and they are informed by a horribly burned man that if pushed the button will cause the death of one person whom they don't know, and they will receive one million dollars. one of the things the box achieves is to conjure up this invisible fear that somewhere out there our actions have moral consequences. before the button is pushed it has an eerie and seductive quality, alluring yet sinister. once it has been pushed, events are set in motion that make the two leads question their own morality and deeply regret their fateful decision. the notion that the box is an experiment is interesting because for me it provides the movie with a paradox. if there are external beings developing an "altruism coefficient" based on data gathered by couples pushing and not pushing the button, then as the conspiracy unravels, we notice that ultimately it is a forced altruism: be selfless or the species will be wiped out. i suppose the couples don't know the consequences of their actions when they are faced with making the decision, but they have no reason to suspect that the box can do anything, so why would they choose altruistically? is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care about it when presented with a problem in our own lives? the psychological hurdles in this movie are everywhere. push the button or don't, it's likely someone is messing with you. take the money or don't, no one gives anything away for free. search for the truth, the answers you find slowly reveal your demise. i propose that the box is an ironic work because it offers the false choice of free will while revealing that we are trapped in many metaphorical boxes. you can only choose to be free at the expense of another's life, is that freedom? no, it is only another box because then you become trapped in the consequences of your own morality. there is no escape for us because we live on earth and that is another box. this is precisely why the external beings in the film are ultimately antagonists. they demand we conform to moral standards which rob us of our freedom. we made it to mars, and we were burned for it and turned into slaves in a sick game. the references to jean paul sartre illustrate this point rather well. "you can only enter the final chamber free, or not free." sure, but no matter the form in which we enter the chamber, it is a chamber nonetheless. trevor nemeth

i'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but i clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. this is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even ms. diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) the sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. it's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's "running the show," so i'm glad the movie doesn't try. it's really irrelevant to the story, which is relatively long but quite compelling and summed up quite satisfyingly in the ending. before you decide this movie is terrible (or really, anything under a ~7.5) read some of the dozens of 1-star "hated it" reviews that are rife with misspellings, lack of punctuation and capitalization, and juvenile criticisms. maybe the trailer was misleading or something -- i didn't see it -- but some of these reviewers were apparently expecting terminator 4 or saw 5 (one reviewer actually compared this movie to saw! how utterly inappropriate and unrelated!) seriously, most of these reviews read like you-tube comments -- according to these "critics" this movie is too confusing yet too predictable, not enough action yet there's too much going on, too smart yet too dumb, explains too much yet leaves too much unexplained... oh -- and it's apparently a "waist (sic) of time." do consider the quality and source of the reviews before taking them to heart. i'm afraid these 1-star kids failed to understand the phrase "altruism coefficient" and were therefore utterly incapable of understanding the movie's premise (despite adamantly claiming that they "get it" right before explaining how confusing it was!) if you know what those two words mean you will have no trouble understanding (and enjoying) this movie.i really wish there were a reviewer reputation system here so i could be sure to ignore the rating of everyone who gave this movie 1 star forever.see it for yourself and enjoy the fine presentation of an interesting couple taking an interesting moral "test" and facing the consequences. it's a good time, in my opinion.

i'm not gonna lie. to say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. and if you've seen cult director richard kelly's previous films, "donnie darko" and "southland tales," you know that's gotta mean something. when i went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. by the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see. i for one could only comprehend roughly 40% of what i saw on- screen, and even then it can only be called interpretation. so why did i give this movie a generous seven stars? because for one, we get some spectacular performances (marsden's great and langella returns as a familiar creepy character), and most importantly two, because it's entirely original and richard kelly, undoubtedly one of the bravest directors alive, uses his creative vision to tell a story that dares to be different. quite frankly, it's the only way - only through kelly's unique style could this story be told the way it's intended.in the end, if you're not willing to spend some serious thought into an intelligent movie (and even then it may all amount to nothing), stay far away from this one. but if you want to watch a deep, rich, complex and thought-provoking piece on spirituality, existentialism, and the predictability of human nature, go see this. be prepared for lengthy discussions with your partner however.*note: if by chance you've read this review, taken my recommendation, have actually seen the movie and still believe you've wasted 2 hours of your life, i'd be happy to share my views on the whole meaning and plot of the film. see, that's why i liked it so much - it promotes discussion! as hard as it is though, i'll try summing it up by paraphrasing a rather depressing quote by langella's character, who explains the significance of the simple box to an employee: "your house is a box which you live in. the car that you drove to work is a box, on wheels. when you return home from work you sit in front of a box with moving images. you watch until the mind and soul rots and the box that is your body deteriorates, when finally you are placed into the ultimate box... to rest under the soil and earth."

the premise is rather original and well thought-of, but unfortunately, siding a good story is very low budget that doesn't even allow for decent special effects. jeff fahey does his best amongst a poor cast, as does the always beautiful linda hoffman. they should make more movies together. the movie, while not worth much praise, warrants at least one viewing.

i wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. it told the story more of robin williams, then mork & mindy. still, thought it was great. we got to see, robin always being 'on', no matter what. the performance of diamontopolous was awesome.the introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. roebuck as garry marshall was wonderful. he was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the williams energy. the little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (happy days, and laverne & shirley), was enlightening. i also thought richmond-peck's harvey was also a nice rock in the pond. (this is a good thing).this movie told the age old story of hollywood folks, going through the ups and downs of stardom. it kept me glued to my tv, and i learned to love robin, well hell, mostly everybody seem to be the super people i sometimes think hollywood is. go figure.i sometimes wonder why the network people are always played to be idiots. we never saw the head of abc. just heard him, like charlie from charlie angels (i wonder if this way planed?). it seems so sad, that a show at number 1, could be so destroy by their own network.i think this story could be told about anyone's life, as they climb the ladder of any job. movie, and tv stars are always loved or hated by so many people, that you grew up with, you just want to reach back in their past, to remember your own past. i remember watching the show, and always wondering what does happen in their personal lives.mork and mindy, will always be part of me, and i got to see part of them. it may not all be the truth, it's also all not a lie, but in the end, it told me a wonderful sad, happy story.

i just want to say that chris diamantopoulos's role as williams for that entire show, was emmy worthy. it was uncanny how well he did. and to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as robin williams really is....wow. there were scenes where diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like robin williams doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. its one thing to do a robin williams impersonation for a couple of minutes. its another to do it for a whole tv movie.i don't know how i felt about the whole show, and i don't know how much they played with the facts, but i do know that it was chris diamantopoulos that kept me watching. so for that, i give him a 10.

great, chris diamantopoulos has got to be the best robim williams that i have every seen.. he acts it up, perfectly. this was like watching robim williams as he really was and is.. it almost made me cry watching him.i had no idea that robin was as close a friend to john belushi as he was. the portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. very sad, what both of them went through.i really felt for both val and robin during his rough times. i am glad that they ended it in a high note!i hope robin puts a $100 bill in this guy's hat !!and it was great that it was filmed in vancouver!

i just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. i liked (not loved) "mork & mindy" as a kid, mostly for robin william's zany energetic performance. this movie made me remember why. was the original show great? not really, but robin certainly was. which brings me to this movie.i was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). but, of course, the real focus was on robin. it was interesting to see robin's journey from struggling street jester to national t.v star, and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife. and my hat is off to star chris diamantopoulos as he portrayed mr. williams with integrity, sensitivity, and heart; not just a cute impression, although it was even dead-on. (on an unrelated note, i noticed that robin's struggles were in some ways similar to andy kaufman, who was under-appreciated by network t.v. and held back creatively, but that's the "taxi" behind the scenes biopic.)all in all, this was a very enjoyable flick, in which i felt i got to know a little more of the man behind the orkan. the acting was solid by all- never melodramatic like i suspected- and the story moved along well. performances that were particularly good were by those who played garry marshall and john belushi (the scene in which belushi heckles robin was a hoot!). not a great masterpiece by any means (i would have liked to have seen a tad more about pam dawber), but definitely watchable, especially for those robin williams and "mork & mindy" fans out there. nanoo, nanoo!

after getting hooked on the mini series, "north & south," i could hardly wait for the continuation, "north & south ii." then years later, along came book iii, "heaven & hell - north & south - book iii." finally, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the maine and hazard families. i was so enraptured by this series that i taped each part off of tv and then managed to get family and friends hooked and i watched it again, each time someone new wanted to see them. my tapes are old and i crave this trilogy on dvd. if you missed book iii, you didn't get full satisfaction and you don't know how it all turned out. do yourself a favor and demand this set on dvd!

this is the best movie i have ever seen. it has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. and a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.the most splendid casting i have ever seen. patrick swayze and james read were top grade in this movie.if you see part 1 you will want to see it all. some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.i am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. any movie that can get children to learn history is great. i have books i, ii & iii and when the girls come up from florida each year they want to see north & south.

north and south is a miniseries from the "golden age" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. it is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although i personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.james read and patrick swayze deliver excellent performances--especially read, whose george hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story. the series also contains top-notch work from kirstie alley, wendy kilbourne, hal holbrook, lewis smith, genie francis, georg stanford brown and others. the costumes, filming, sets and music are all first-rate as well.don't take it as a history lesson, but take it for what it is--a well-made, sweeping epic from a bygone era. book 2, which followed a year later, is also excellent, but i would advise viewers to skip book 3, which came out 8 years after book 2 and was not nearly as good as the first two parts. books 1 and 2 are classics, though, even with their soapier elements, and they are well worth watching.

i really enjoyed north and south very much. i think it is one of the best and most lavish television series i have ever seen. the calibre of the cast is amazing, you have actors from "the golden age of cinema", people like james stewart, gene kelly, elizabeth taylor, robert mitchum and jean simmons with other actors who were the new faces of the 80's like patrick swayze, james read, jonathan frakes, genie francis, philip casnoff and lesley-anne down.at the heart of the story is the friendship of two completely different men,there is orry main (patrick swayze) who is from the south and george hazard (james read) who is from the north. throughout the series, their friendship is continually threatened with the differences in their backgrounds, particularly about the treatment of slaves in the south (especially at orry's plantation) but when each needs the other, they will forget the arguments and go and help their friend. i really liked the chemistry between the two men and was really interested to see if their friendship could survive the war.i liked how the series showed what life was like before the war so the audience could see what were the factors that lead up to the war, what was going on at the time, then the devastation of a nation that was being torn apart and then the nation having to rebuild the country again. the war scenes were very well choreographed and very realistic to me.i think what is great about it, is it has so many elements running through it, romance, history, battles that would interest most of the audience, there is something for everyone. i particularly enjoyed the romance between brett (genie francis) and billy (parker stevenson/john stockwell) especially when she stood up to her sister ashton for the first time. the other romances were interesting as there were not all the same, each had something different to the others which kept me watching particularly the madeline and orry story strand to see if they would be together in the end.it is one of the best american mini series that i have watched, the story had the right balance of romance and the more serious history side that was happening in the country at the time but it is paced just right. the characters are very watchable and the locations are beautiful and the music particularly at the start and end of the episode is so toe-tapping good and works with the mood of the story.

this is one of the century's best tv-series ever with all the great suspense,story,and a cast of absolutely fantastic actors and love and grief that really gets you involved and captivated in front of your tv. if you have seen it once, you will go back to see it again. i have several times and still do it. the 20 th century's best drama.

i first saw this mini-series as a child and though i am a child no longer, i still love it!!! professional copies are hard to find, however, when it's on dvd, it's mine!!! =]great casting, marvellous plots, and plenty of action, romance, and even quite a bit of well-placed comedy. i'm not a historian by nature, but i love this masterpiece of historical fiction!

i have 2 complete sets from time life, this is my favorite movies of all time. love all the actors and actresses.. awsome picture..love patrick swazy..this is the film, that showed his true talent. but yet, he does not get credit for the display he preformed! much credit has been missed in these films.love the way they portrayed the dry and dusty monologs of the civil war..making it into one of the greatest love stories of all time, and showing through all obsticals of life, what true freindship means..how 2 divided countries split.but yet all and all the freindship remained solid, even though the war divided kinships and freindships up.but through it all, till the very end, they remained and taught us the viewer, how true freind ships can still remain till present day! simply the best..gone with the wind doesn't compare to this film.patrick swazy at his best,.after seeing this movie for the one hundred thousand time. i became a big fan of swazy..and have followed his career ever since..have all his movies after he made north and south!

this is a great movie, all 3 were. the last one was not as good as the first 2 but it was made along time after and it was pulling at straws. but you want to watch it cause it tells the end of the story. just not how we might think it should end.these movies made me want to be there to be in all the hardship, love, tears, and laughter that the people in this movie go threw. it is one of the few movies that is good every time you see it no matter how many times that is.there are some parts in the movie that the little kids wont understand and the older ones maynot be old enough to watch. but it is a great movie, spanning over 20+ years.

i agree with with of the messages on here that the book is not like the movie. i read the book as a sophomore in high school in sumter sc. i instantly fell in love with the book and eagerly awaited the release of the mini series. as much as i liked the movie and thought it was very well done, i was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book. i was glad the orry was not killed off like he was in love and war or n&s ii.having grown up in sc and graduating from university of sc, i fell in love with southern history because of this mini series and book. i had the honor of meeting john jakes at a symposium in 1988 at usc. i stayed around afterwards and meet mr.jakes. unfortunately, i did not get to ask him a question. but meeting him was honor enough. i majored in accounting but got my minor in southern studies. in addition, i patterned a lot of my mannerisms after orry main. orry and myself are very much alike. i feel i was born 150 years too late. i am a southern gentleman and very proud of this.well i fell in love with 2 women in the movie....genie francis and wendy kilbourne. man, did i have the hots for wendy!!!! i never quite could find a real life version of her. i hope one day too!!!

north and south (1985): patrick swayze, james read, lesley anne down, wendy kilbourne, terri garber, kirstie alley, genie francis, phillip casnoff, jean simmons, john stockwell, lewis smith, david carradine, inga swenson, jonathan frakes, wendy fulton, erica gimpel, tony frank, jim metzler, olivia cole, andy stahl, william ostrander, george stanford brown, robert mitchum, morgain fairchild, johnny cash, hal holbrook, gene kelly, david ogden stiers, john anderson, lee bergere, olivia de havilland, elizabeth taylor, forest whitaker, robert jones, ....director richard t. heffron, teleplay...paul f. edwards, patricia green, douglas heyes, kathleen a. shelley.based on john jake's successful paperback novels "north and south", "love and war" and "heaven and hell", this was a mini series on television from 1985 to 1987. its success owed more to the success of "roots" a similar civil war era/slavery soap opera televised about a decade earlier in the 70's. patrick swayze, at the beginning of his career and at the time he was doing many films like dirty dancing which would make him famous, stars as orry main, a plantation-born young man from south carolina who sets off to west point. here he meets george hazard (james read) who is supposed to be the hated enemy, the yankee north, but with whom he bonds closely. soon, the mains from the south and the hazards from the north become friends despite the turbulent era leading to civil war. the theme of family, friendship and doing the right thing even when the nation was falling apart is at the heart of this otherwise soap opera full of action and romance. clariss and ashton (jean simmons and teri garber) portray sisters who become enemies when one of them marries yankee billy hazard (john stockwell. garber's bitchy, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and evil ashton is fun to watch on screen. though the series didn't cover everything in jakes' novels, what we see is a condensed version of it and they changed a few things to make it a sort of historical romance with history lessons attached. the characters find themselves in all the major civil war scenes - harper's ferry where abolitionist and feminist virgilia hazard (kirstie alley) loses the love of her life, the ex-slave grady, fort sumter, vicksburg, antietam, gettysburg, appomatox and we are privy to the white house where we see abraham lincoln (hal halbrook) battle out the war in his conscience, we meet all the prominent players including lee, grant, sherman, jackson and davis. several veteran hollywood actors from the golden era - robert mitchum, elizabeth taylor and olivia de havilland have cameos and it's interesting to see them. this is not historical fact, it's historical fiction and purely dramatized entertainment. but it's got cliffhanger endings and beautiful cinematography, costumes and locations. it is like watching an epic movie that runs longer than gone with the wind with with war scenes in it! the script may be bad at times and the acting may not be the best, despite the good casting. swayze hams it up as does terri garber but some performances, like that of kirstie alley, james read (as george hazard)and leslie anne downes as the beautiful and strong madeline are really good performances. they shot in sets and in southern locations.the music is enchanting and this is a feel good film in which we root for the good guys and watch the villains scheme and ultimately get their comeuppance. all fans of civil war movies and the jakes novels should watch this. it's available on dvd and vhs.

this is one of t.v.'s greatest mini-series! it comes to life almost as well as the book did. also the cast was outstanding to play the roles. i'd recommend this movie series for anyone who likes the civil war or the history leading up to it.

even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to dvd was a blessing for all time. north and south truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. i can still remember the first time i caught a glimpse of this series on tv when i was about 8 years old. i though wow this looks exciting. to bad i never had the chance to see book one and two on tv in the netherlands. when book three was broad-casted as a late evening series in the netherlands in the summer of 2004 i just knew i had to see the other two series. to most people book three was a big disappointment as far as i know. well since i have seen book one on dvd, i must say that until now it is the best of the entire 3 books. to all youngsters who just watch the fancy movies like the patriot "oh america for freedom" there is a more realistic view to see for them here.....

this movie is very long, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. it has an all-star cast, and if you are a patrick swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) my mother is a civil war buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off tv), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. we had every line in the movie memorized, lol. pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance. it's a great movie for those that like action, war, blood & guts, but also for those with a soft, romantic side. the clothes the women wore were gorgeous! sometimes i think i was born in the wrong era, lol.

whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. this is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. the story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. the storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie. there are characters you will fall in love with, there are characters you will hate, and you will find yourself emotionally involved.both my wife and i loved it, and we will watch it again in a few years, i'm sure.

having just watched this with my mother (who got it for christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. all of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. the cast is amazing, my personal favourites being james read and lesley-anne down, as george hazard and madeline fabray/lamotte/main. the whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.

perhaps one of the best movies ever made. orry and goerge's friendship runs deep, and the war puts a strain on their strong friendship. as a southerner, i can honestly say this epic is as accurate as it gets. brothers fighting brothers. can you imagine what life must have been living during those times? the best part of the movie, for me, was when the south surrenders; general grant is urging president lincoln to really stick it to the south, he says, "mr. president, a lot of folks want the south to bleed over what they've done..." president lincoln, turns to him and in a very tired voice says, "the south has bled enough...and so have we..." i burst into tears, and take a deep breath. what a president! it's like a father saying his son has been punished enough, and despite his anger he realizes his point has been made. this war was a very dark time for our young country, and it had to be fought. president lincoln knew this. i'm urging everyone who reads this to watch this movie, and add it to your dvd collection. then, thank god that our country was preserved. as jesus said, a "house divided against itself cannot stand."

for me, north and south (books i&ii) is the ultimate tv series of the 80's. just spotting all those cameo appearances was highly entertaining.gene kelly, james stewart, elisabeth taylor, olivia de havilland, robert mitchum, even johny cash¬° no series has come close to this achievement.have you ever seen anyone looking like lincoln? dick smith's prosthetics made hal holbrock's powerful performance even more so. the crafted costumes, the jaw dropping locations, everything. it's clear that nowadays there are excellent and bright tv series (desperate housewives, lost,24) but north & south was, and still is, one of its kind. don't miss it. only david carradine's portrayal of the ultimate villain (you may call him just violent husband) worths the viewing. maybe some characters and situations are too stereotyped, i admit it but the positive sides clearly cast a shadow over them. i'm so glad that finally is available on dvd in spain.

this comment discusses "north and south book i" dealing with 1842-1861 periodthe 19th century history of the usa is mostly identified by people with the civil war (1861-1865). this is a reasonable opinion because that was civil war which put the union under the severe test; that was the civil war which made americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. from the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen. d.w. griffith, in the early 1900s, made his unforgettable birth of a nation. yet, the most famous film about the north-south clash is still, i suppose, gone with the wind (1938). unfortunately, fewer people know the magnificent tv series based on john jakes' novel, "north and south." it is the very best tv series ever made and the time spent on watching it is really precious. i taped it on my video from polish tv many years ago and have come back to it with great pleasure many times since then. why? firstly, the entire story is deeply rooted in historical reality. the two families, the maines from south carolina and the hazards from pennsylvania, represent two entirely different ways of life. in spite of that, friendship unites them. yet, what they experience is the struggle all people do: friendship attacked by "truth" of "political correctness", love attacked by hatred of "legal spouses", gentleness by strength of "social heroes". orry maine (patrick swayze) is my beloved character - someone who finds love and who is quickly deprived of her; someone who cares for friends but political fanatics step in the way and ruin much. finally, he is someone who can see the tragic future for his land but there is nothing he can do about the south's inescapable fate. his friend, george hazard, is similar in most aspects but sometimes he appears to have a stronger character. it is him who shows orry that although there are tragedies, he must get up from despair and live since life is the most precious thing we have. although they represent two different lifestyles, their friendship occurs to be stronger than any prejudice, politics or conflicts.other characters are also particularly well developed. there are villains, like justin lamotte or salem jones who are really wicked but most of the people are ambiguous as the nature of humanity has always been. charles maine is, at first, full of rebellion, prone to fighting, later, however, he learns to be a true southern gentleman for whom southern pride is not courageous words but foremost courageous deeds. virgilia hazard represents the most fanatical side of abolitionist movement striving to condemn slavery and punish the owners of "black breeding farms." her marriage with grady appears to be a symbol of equality but also a symbol of saying "no" to the politics of the south. two interesting characters are orry's sisters, brett and ashton - sisters in whose veins runs entirely opposite blood. brett, in her gentleness but also naiveness, believes in absolute fidelity. she marries billy, even though he is a northerner, because she truly loves him. brett is the representation of all that is precious in any young woman. ashton, however, is a vamp, a tigress, a woman who does not hesitate to do the most wicked things. the clear picture of their world views clash is their chat about men and family...unforgettable moment and how universal! most characters head for their values...yet, war breaks out and they'll have to put aside a lot...secondly, the performances... someone said that not all people act naturally. i wouldn't say that. i'd rather say that all cast do very good jobs in their parts from the main characters who are portrayed by younger staff to the guests that consist of famous stars, including liz taylor, robert mitchum and others. patrick swayze as orry does a great job. i consider this role one of his best ones. lesley anne down as madeleine is also very memorable. her part, perhaps, entails too much suffering but she manages to express all sorts of feelings really well. kirstie alley is very appealing and truly memorable as the abolitionist virgilia hazard. phillip casnoff is worth consideration as horribly ambitious elkanah bent as well as david carradine as a monster husband, disgusting justin lamotte. and, in contrast to him, a mention must be made of jean simmons who is truly excellent as orry's mother whose heart beats for the glory of family life and concord of union. thirdly, memorable moments of "north and south" leave an unfading trace in one's mind. who can forget the first meeting of orry and madeleine - what charm, what gentleness there is in this scene! or is it possible to skip the moment when madeleine's father dies? i found it really powerful, there is a real drama in this moment, a drama of a woman being left by someone who really loved her. i also liked churubusco sequence and george hazard so worried about the life of his dearest friend, orry. then his meetings with constance are terrific. virgilia's speech in philadelphia is a masterpiece of performance. and the final moment of the first part: although north and south may separate, their friendship will never die. orry and george symbolically join hands as the train moves on. simply, there are so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it's impossible to mention even half of them here. and these gorgeous tunes by bill conti and shot in brilliant landscapes. the music in "north and south" is very touching and memorable.what to say in the end? "north and south" is a real must have on dvd, simply an amazing tv series about the victory of all that is precious in us: love, friendship, loyalty, honor, truthfulness, absolute fidelity. 9/10

sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances ¬ñ though some folks are channeling rhett, scarlett, melanie and even lady macbeth. patrick swayze and james read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. splendid villains ¬ñ you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. lots of strong female characters in this one ¬ñ both good and bad. secondary story lines also are well developed. several cameos by major stars of past eras. good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics. curl up on a rainy day with your dvd or vhs player and drink of choice with this one. a lap rug and a cat would be optional.

one of the best! as being a fan of the civil war, i was very pleased with the first installment of the north and south trilogy. patrick swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as james reed and leslie ann down. in watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. i was first introduced to this series when i was in the eighth grade. being a young boy, you would think that i wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap. to be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book. i bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome. i am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war. as a movie director of the future, i will always enjoy north and south: book one.

several weeks back i lost my beloved companion and friend of fourteen years, a golden retriever named sasha. when i came home from the animal hospital, alone, after having made one of the most painful decisions of my life, my teenage daughter sat by my side. . .and we talked about this episode of the twilight zone. i could be wrong, but i recall a line that arthur hunnicutt said, when satan was trying to trick him into hell, but his dog could not go with him. . .and his dog in turn was growling in defiance at the gatekeeper who was trying to trick the old hunter to "step inside,". . .that it would be "one helluva of heaven if dogs were not allowed," and the spirit of the old mountain man and his dog decided to turn away from the gate (of what they had thought was heaven, to wander eternity alone.) what a tearful moment when they meet a "good ole' country boy" on that eternal road, only to discover he is an angel, sent out to find 'em, and "sure neighbor, of course dogs are allowed into heaven." i'll confess i cried as i talked about this with my daughter while we mourned the passing of our beloved golden. rod serling was truly a genius, a voice that in the early sixties spoke out against racism, hatred, "know-nothingism," and was a profound inspiration to me to become a writer. this episode, across forty five years carried a message of comfort to all of us who have lost a beloved friend. i urge you to get a copy the next time there is a one of the twilight zone marathons or purchase it. there will be some tears, but comfort as well. as always, thanks rod, for all that you taught us. . .even now.

in this episode, a man and his dog go 'coon huntin' after eating dinner with his wife of 50 years. he's devoted to his wife and his dog.while hunting, his dog jumps in the river after the dog and he follows. the man dies and doesn't know it. he tries to talk to his wife and his grave diggers to no avail.what follows is a tug of war between heaven and hell for the man's soul and his dog helps make the decision. he's being tricked by the devil and won't go in to "heaven" unless his dog comes with him.it makes you wonder if all the animal lovers have the right idea and want to go to heaven with them.

pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. what a sad life he must lead!this movie has more to say about life and relationships than most i've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the "ordinary people" type of film. it is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.the whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps shakespear's "midsummer nights' dream." beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.i look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable. it's like re-reading a favorite, treasured book.

great fun for an evening on the sofa. don't expect academy award stuff with this but it will leave you with a smile. the performance by bruce spence is truly good. the soundtrack shows off some great old australian talent. check out this and other true aussie films.

this film predates the australian films road warrior and priscilla of the desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. the photography is notably confident. the direction is stylish and for the most part well done. if you liked the early australian films by bruce beresford, peter weir and george miller then you'll love "oz". the direction also reminds this reviewer of edgar wright's contemporary work. that similarity suggests that "oz" was far ahead of its time. the critics of 1967 hated it and the public stayed away - 1960s australia, like 1940s usa, was in some ways the sort of place where conformity was important, whereas this film is very different to what those viewers would have expected, especially after reading the promotional posters. this film will most likely have more appeal to contemporary audiences: it's still quirkily awkward and self-conscious, but in a contemporary european way rather than a 1960s australian way. joy dunstan (who later appeared in the australian tv series 'prisoner') plays her role with less raw passion than her contemporary jacki weaver might have done, instead dunstan's character in this film conveys some of the rather whimsical strength of australian women most famously represented by kylie minogue playing charlene mitchell in the australian tv series neighbours and further developed in later roles in her career. men will also enjoy this film, which presents various masculine issues in a different way than most other mid-sixties films from the usa or even australia. in particular, bruce spence (who later went on to play tion medon in 'star wars iii', the trainman in the 'matrix' films, and the chopper pilot in the 'road warrior' and 'thunderdome' films) plays a central and sustained role which solidly supports the rest of the cast. this film is worth seeing for bruce spence's performance alone. 7/10 for some minor continuity problems.

wow! an amazing, lost piece of australiana and a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. this film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. as a retelling of the oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. the chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in australia will delight fans of the genre. this film used to be double featured with the rocky horror picture show, an indicator of the type of film that oz is. while not as frivolous or well constructed as rhps it's hard not to have fun with oz.surprisingly, oz has aged well- perhaps a by-product of how determinedly set in the real australia of 1976 it is. the passage of history shows that many of the ideas being explored would eventually enter the mainstream. the willingness of the film to give prominence to gay characters is notable, especially as it dates to the 'revolution' period for the australian gay rights push.the performances range from flinchingly amateur to finely nuanced brilliance. the direction is lacking in subtlety and much of the dialogue may have benefited from an extra draft or two. somehow, these flaws add to the appeal of the film which is mercifully unpretentious. much like australia in the 1970s this film has a certain naive charm.there are several connections to the original australian stagings of the rocky horror show which will keep obsessives on their toes.oz is most certainly a minor classic and a potential cult favourite worthy of review. laugh at the atrocious 70s fashion, swing along with the ausrock soundtrack, leave any expectations at the door and oz is likely to delight.

i rented this obscure aussie relic a few years ago to show at a friend`s place and it was an instant success.the classic tale of the wizard of oz with a decidedly cornball 70`s australian twist.the acting isn`t exactly shakespeare society stuff here,but later ,"mad max"star bruce spence is a beautifully understated surfie/scarecrow and there are some wonderfull comic turns by gary wadell and robin ramsay as a deliciously 70`s camp fairy godmother/father character.also note the musical contribution from ex-daddy cool frontman ross wilson on the title song.in a similar vein to later-day aussie comedies such as "priscilla queen of the desert".good fun.

i watched this film during a special advanced preview in reading, berkshire.the two main characters, michael and rory strike up a friendship, when rory is introduced to the care home that michael already resides. michael is amazed to find someone who can finally understand him, as until now his cerebal palsey made people think that he couldn't communicate. rory introduces michael to the life that he's missing. rory is a feisty character, who doesn't let his condition (muscular dystrophy) get to him.they bond and apply for independent living, and find a lovely flat and assistant and have all the fun that they could ever dream of.don't go to see this film if you are after some "entertainment". do go see this film if you're willing to see something a little different.the storyline is strong, the actors are fantastic and despite the sadness that comes with the film the mood is uplifting.i thoroughly recommend it. though if you are anything like me and prone to crying - take tissues, as you'll need them!

this is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you. i found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability, this was represented in a great performance by both two michael and rory. whether the story is based around a true story i feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human. on the whole this film reach into my soul and i too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity. the whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience, but i feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama. certainly one not to be missed!

bring a box of kleenex to this funny, engaging, and moving weeper. the two leading actors give tour de force performances - there was considerable debate afterward about whether they are really disabled (they are not.) i appreciated that for once the filmmakers dared to be politically incorrect by depicting people with severe physical disabilities as fully developed people, character flaws and all. as a result, their believability engages us and makes us grow to like them and care about their conflicts. the story structure is formulaic, and many of the secondary characters are merely types, but the two central characters are so riveting that it doesn't matter. interesting - the original title, inside i'm dancing, reflects the viewpoint of the character michael, while the new title for usa release suggests that rory is the central figure.

a stunning film which brought into the open so much about disability that generally makes people afraid. it showed how minds can be captured by less than willing bodies and how difficult it must be to witness things happening to others that are wanted for the disabled individual.love, friendship, fear, frustration, joy, humour and so many others things were so well captured. the 2 lead characters were very well played by the 2 able bodied actors and invited your laughter, tears, concern, joy and dismay.i approached this film with a mixture of interest and trepidation worrying that it might be too much a play for sympathy or dwell only on negatives. it was however a beautifully crafted story of 2 friends.i loved it.

this is by far one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time. top 20 of my lifetime. i laughed more than i have since hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, and cried more than i have since i saw the notebook. if you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. it is real and powerful. see it and you won't regret it. i was reluctant at first and i only watched it because i had to do a school project about speech disabilities. but this movie is so much more than that. it is about life, free and independent from the way the world would have you held down. its about the disabilities that each of us have that keep us from see ourselves and what we miss but letting everything else get in the way.

this is definitely a movie that will make you think about the everyday struggles a person can go through every day. great acting by the two leading roles exemplifies this further, and you will not regret seeing this movie in any way.it's a heartwarming tale of two new friends exploring the ups and downs of everyday life seen from the seat of a wheelchair. their friendship is tested, as well as their spirits when they get their own flat outside the nursing home.i recommend this film to everyone who likes buddy-pictures or just wants to see a wonderful and heartwarming film that steers clear of all the clich√©s and pitfalls and not once gets soggy.

i was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. i was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. i guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. but i hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. the story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. this movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented. hopefully this movie will help us to understand some of their desires better and realize how important it is to have a friend in the world, especially when you almost unable to express that fact.

as a 'physically challenged' person (god, how i hate that phrase) i just happened to catch this on cable where there was absolutely nothing else to watch - overall, it was a fantastic movie. yes, i was a little disappointed upon finding out that neither actor is disabled, and yes, i was a little disappointed that more of the movie wasn't filmed from the 'true' point of view of the disabled (can you imagine what it's like always being the tallest person in the room and then having to live the rest of your life with a view of nothing but other people's asses and crotches? having to always wait for the idiot to stop reading the newspaper in the only handicapped stall, enduring everyone else's rude bodily expulsions while you wait?). and the scene with him driving the car was absolutely me! been there, done that, literally. but the movie was true enough to matter - while i've never lived in a home or assisted residence, there were plenty of times throughout the movie where i found myself nodding and saying to myself "yeah, that's true.... that's happened to me...." what impressed me is that some of the commentors on this board expressed the fact that the movie made them view life a little differently and with a little more insight as the lives of a silent 'minority' - can't ask more than that out of a movie, that it makes you think and view life differently, so by virtue of that alone, the movies was tremendously successful. should be required viewing of every kid in junior high school.pretty much for every person that's severely physically disabled, independence is one of, if not the most important focus of our daily lives, from working to socializing to recreating. for those of you who felt the movie was 'cliched,' try living our life for a single day - you'll see that the movie was 'cliched' because..... it's true. the challenges the actors faced only skimmed the surface of what happens to us every day - if we're lucky, we experience the same emotional and personal growth that the three characters (including the girl) did. every day presents obstacles for us to overcome - it's just that there's no swelling, dramatic music to accompany our lives, unless it's in our ipods.... lol!

alter egos do not come funnier than the creation of sacha baron cohen's ali g. completely misled by his delusional and non-existent sense of the middle england suburban surroundings that his social background consists of. he persists on living the style of a los angeles gansta. while still living with his gran in the london suburb of staines, he keeps tight control of his posse, the west staines "massiv".spending his spare time between me julie, his girl, the posse and teaching local eight year old scouts at "keep it real (advanced)" lessons at the government funded john nike leisure centre.this is where the story takes off, being told that the government funding has stopped, ali g then proceeds on a one-man quest "in the struggle for justice i iz willing to lay down me life, just like martin luther van dross did". being his reply to the local media crew when interviewing him on hunger strike while chained to a fence.charles dance here plays david carlton, the sinister and devious deputy prime minster, who is "even more eviller than skeletor". using ali g, unknowingly, to lose the prime minster 18,000 votes three weeks before the general election. seeing ali g as a bumbling idiot, his plan backfires. ali g suddenly becomes an over night sensation and a saviour of the people, working directly with the prime minster. the story becomes more sinister and with hilarious consequences.ali g indahouse is a great british movie that brings the hugely talented attributes of writing, along with dan mazer, executive production and acting of sacha baron cohen. charles dance and michael gambon, as the p.m. play their parts with great seriousness among the gags and hilarity that is ali g.ironically, seeing the parodies playing their parts in a world that really is real, and who are continually preaching "keep it real" from their own little world that is the west staines "massiv" is true comic paradox.directed by mark mylod, his first full length feature film since directing television work such as shameless, shooting stars, the fast show and the smell of reeves and mortimer to name a few.very real and very funny.

if you like his show you might be a little disappointed. this movie has some very funny moments and the laughs are pretty constant but none are very memorable or as funny as the things on the show. the beginning sequence is really really silly and funny, and a great start. yes! borat does make a cameo appearance.if you are a fan then watch it! if you don't know him or don't like him then don't bother. 6.5/10

no real plot, no character development, no scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? the only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as borat. sure, the ending drags a bit, but if borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. sacha baron cohen is possibly the greatest comedian alive, and here he gets more laughs than jude law on a nude beach. i dare you not to laugh.if you can pull the ten-foot pole out of your behind for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character, see this stupid movie. you'll be glad you did. keep it real!

the way i found out about this movie was when i watched american pie 2, at the start it had a trailer for ali g indahouse, i watched the trailer and it just forced me to buy the dvd, it looked incredibly funny! so the next day, i went to my local store and picked it up for ¬£3.99 (bargain!). the film is about ali g, who is a "gangster" of the west staines massive crew, who's rivals are the east staines massive crew. ali has a "cub scout" pack of children where he teaches them how to survive in the "ghetto" by teaching them how to swear and steal cars, after ali finds out the government are stopping the money coming to the leisure centre where ali teaches the kids, he runs for mp for staines and overthrows another mp in his attempts to get rid of the leisure centre to make room for an airport in staines. throughout the film there are laughs aplenty as ali gets up to some crazy stuff! borat makes an appearance for a few seconds in the film too, this is a definite must watch film for all you sacha baron cohen fans out there!

just before dawn is an excellent horror movie. it is atmospheric, filled with tension made of wonderful shots of wild nature, in which few young people meet their doom, in the shape of two crazed, fat bastards,who slaughter them. jeff lieberman is very talented and intelligent director,who is unfortunately underrated. he achieved to built tension, not with gore,but with showing menacing nature environment. lieberman succeeds to built a tension in a very linear, simplistic way, which is also the best way, not to show to the viewer the gore, but to let him to imagine the worst thing that happen to characters. just before dawn was always compared to texas chainsaw massacre, deliverance and hills have eyes. it is as good looking as deliverance, better than hills, i mean scarier and better crafted,and it is creepy as the texas chainsaw massacre.jbd is one of the best horrors of past few decades, who finally lives on dvd!

i didn't have very high expectations about just before dawn. i don't know why i keep buying these slasher movies when i know it's all the same every time. maybe i'm a bit masochistic? anyway, i'm glad i bought this one. yes, it's all the same. no, it has nothing original. yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. and you know what? it's just magic! it's one of the best experiences i had watching a slasher movie. the places where it's shot are so wonderful. you see mountains, waterfalls, rockies. it's just amazing. it takes a very long time (except for the opening scene) before the killer starts killing, but i didn't care! it was enjoyable to watch enough not to care. what i mean is, you won't be sitting there waiting for the murders to start because every thing that happens is enjoyable because of the beauty of the film itself. the ending is a bit weird, but i won't tell you anything more about it. you'll know what i mean. another thing i enjoyed: you care about the characters. they're not just a bunch of jerks who spend their time bitching each other. sure, they are pure stereotypes of usual slasher characters but, there's something special about them. anyway, it's a great horror movie and i hope you have a pretty good time watching it because i really did!

a quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. however, "jbd" delivers considerably more.rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. these feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil. oh yeah- george kennedy is here too and when is that not a good thing? if you liked "wrong turn", then watch this to see where much of its' methodology came from.

just before dawn really surprised me when i saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than i expected. instead the director jeff lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until i was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. the lack of action in many parts gave it a very deliverance mixed with the texas chainsaw massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory. the characters are about par for this kind of movie, though more sympathetic than some, and the bad guy memorably freaky. the photography and suspense are the real winners in this movie and they keep it from ever being dull (as has been suggested). i firmly recommend this one to serious horror fans. don't expect gore, do expect a creepy backwoods tale with several awesome moments and a great dreamlike ambiance.

for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to imdb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie. i still love it as much as i did all those years ago.buy this movie!!

just before dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! this movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job mr. lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. the opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! and the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars! if you are looking for a gore-fest, don't look here. but, if you want chills sent down your back, see this one. there are 6 deaths and one of them you don't see but, it leaves you mind to think "how was she killed?" the stranded theme reminded me of 1977's the hills have eyes, which followed kind of the same concept, but in the desert with canninbals. but, still slasher fans, give this forgotten gem, i promise you, you will be staisfied!

just before dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. the backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like friday the 13th, the burning, and madman. just before dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. the cinematography is gorgeous. the acting is top notch. the heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in. there's a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the final girls hidden sexuality - coinciding that alongside her will to survive.just before dawn isn't for everyone, but for the slasher fan, it's as close to perfect as you can get. the killer(s) are very menacing - almost like it's a game to maim and murder anyone who crosses their territory. the end scene is a bit off kilter. for the first time viewer, it may be a little shocking. i'd recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the backwoods slasher. even non-slasher fans will find something to like about it. the setting is eerie and makes one feel uneasy. the death sequences aren't particularly gory, but i'm not sure the film needed gore. see it!

ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! "just before dawn" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. it's a hell of a lot of fun.i enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. "wrong turn" ripped this movie off something fierce! there's plenty of blood and scares. my girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch. it's got that creepiness to it.i'd say that "just before dawn" is the best early 80's slasher out there. i really enjoyed it.8 out of 10, kids.

(warning: spoilers!)five young people ignore the warnings of forest ranger george kennedy and hike up to the misty oregon mountains where they are stalked and butchered by a pair of huge, deformed, in-bred hillbilly twins. when only two are left, warren and his girl connie, they resort back to their animal instincts to stay alive. the film ends with connie shoving half of her arm down one of the killers' throats, choking him to death. a very powerful, if somewhat overrated, backwoods slasher flick thats effective use of lighting, sound and photography make it a cut above the usual friday the 13th cash-in. lead by an attractive, likeable cast, especially deborah benson (where is she now?) and gregg henry, this nifty companion piece to director jeff lieberman's squirm (1976) and blue sunshine (1977) shouldn't be missed.

the mountainous woods, young happy campers, a warning by a park ranger and a lurking figure. the ingredients are there for a horror delight, and director/co-writer jeff lieberman does an adequate job at achieving it. it's formulaic woodland horror, but for most part the execution is at the top the game and the story (which is quite basic in a trimmed sense) is effectively told in certain realism. maybe a little more exposition wouldn't have gone astray, but lieberman's craftsmanship makes up for the material's flaws and typical details with rising tension, moody visuals and a smothering atmosphere created by brad fiedel's very ominously lingering score. whenever that very creepy whistling was cued in, it painted a truly unnerving sense that settled in with the beautiful backdrop. cinematographers dean m. and joel king do a striking job too. there's plenty of style abound, even with its minimal scope and the build-up is slow grinding. at times the pacing can become a stop-and-go affair. it's not particularly violent, but there's still a mean-streak evident even if some of it happens of screen. the latter chase scenes and escalating fear is well done, as it has the darkness coming alive with its burly killer/s and you get actor george kennedy riding his white horse in a slight, but wonderful turn. there's a likable bunch of performances; deborah benson makes for a strong, dashing heroine. gregg henry, chris lemmon ralph seymour, jamie rose, mike kellin and katie powell round off a modest cast of believable deliveries. the final climax is rather twisted, but the ending is one of those types that leave you thinking¬Ö "is that it?" a well-etched backwoods slasher item, which probably plays it a little too safe to truly set it apart from the norm.

five teens set out to do some camping in the oregon wilderness, and despite being warned by the park ranger, they soon realize that something is lurking around in the backwoods waiting to strike.when it comes to old horror movies, the only one that keeps popping up in every conversation is friday the 13th, so i took it upon myself to find those good old horror movies that fell short for simply being compared to friday the 13th, just before dawn just so happened to be among the ones i found, and was really very impressive, it wasn't as bland as some of the stuff you find today, it was very sharp in terms of character development as it had quite a few likable ones, and it has this very casual pace, its not in a hurry to get to the hack and slash bits, it takes its time to set the proper mood and tone and is very atmospheric and builds some killer suspense by letting you always have that sense of dread like, somethings out there but you don't know where it is or when it will strike.where i live its definitely an overlooked gem simply because people never heard of it or won't give it a chance, but i'll state that it is not a friday the 13th rip off, the two concepts don't even go near each other, but in my mind, it is overall one of the more impressive slashers i've seen in a while.

taking its cues from backwoods classics deliverance and the texas chain saw massacre, jeff lieberman's just before dawn might not offer much very new in terms of plot¬óa maniac stalks and kills a group of campers¬óbut still manages to be an effective shocker thanks to the director's deft handling of the material, great use of the stunning scenery, even greater use of women in hot-pants, a brooding synth score from brad fiedel and a nifty twist towards the end (although one that should be apparent to those who have been paying attention).thanks to solid performances from its capable cast¬óincluding oscar winner george kennedy as forest ranger roy mclean¬óthere is a sense of realism to just before dawn that is all too often missing from this kind of fare. the film also offers a pretty creepy maniac (who sniggers like dick dastardly's dog mutley and uses a nasty serrated machete to kill), and delivers a couple of very imaginative sequences which help lift it above many of its contemporaries: a topless woman (gratuitous nudity box well and truly ticked) in a lake discovers that the hand that has been groping her underwater doesn't belong to her boyfriend; and a shortsighted character makes out with his pal's girlfriend (as a joke), unaware that the person who is slowly approaching is not his friend but the killer.

well, sadly, i can't help but feeling a little bit disappointed after my much, much, much-anticipated viewing of "just before dawn". jeff lieberman is a terrific filmmaker and he can undoubtedly do great things with a tiny budget, but i nevertheless expected to see a far more sadistic and gruesome early 80's slasher. but actually i'm beginning to think that lieberman isn't the one to blame for this, but we gorehounds are! it's more than obvious that lieberman intended to make his take on the backwoods-slasher look like "deliverance" and absolutely not like "friday the 13th", which immensely popularized the sub genre one year earlier. the horror and constant sensation of menace doesn't mainly come from the demented maniacs with their machetes, but from the genuinely ominous and isolated oregon forests where this movie was shot. in case the film seems slow and uneventful, this is only because lieberman takes his time to introduce the dark woods and eerie mountains as extra characters in his film. we hardly ever see the killers in person, but there always appears to be someone luring from behind the trees or from underneath the mountain lakes. bearing this in mind, "just before dawn" becomes a highly admirable horror effort and actually a lot better than its contemporary blood-soaked colleagues. amidst a nearly endless selection of gory and sickening slashers, lieberman successfully puts the emphasis back on tension and character development. the plot revolves on five twenty-something friends heading for a camping vacation in the oregon woods, where one of them owns a small piece of land. the woods are deserted and, naturally, the campers ignore forest ranger roy's (george kennedy!) advise to return back to civilization. shortly after, they brutally encounter an inbred family of which the twin sons have murderous tendencies. all five main characters are surprisingly likable and convincing! no irritating stereotypes for which you don't feel sympathy anyway, like slutty girls or football jocks. as a result of this "natural" character, you automatically cheer for them, even when they eventually almost turn into savages themselves. the sublime camera-work supplies the film with an at times unbearable tension level and brad fiedel's chilling electronic score only adds to this effect. "just before dawn" is a fine slice of early 80's horror, as long as you don't desire blood to drip from your tv-set.

this completely forgotten slasher flick is one of the best horror movies ever made.very dark at times it reminds me a little famous thriller "deliverance".director jeff lieberman creates terrific atmosphere of dread and despair.all actors are decent and the climax is really exciting and memorable.so if you are searching for something creepy,try to find this little treasure.my personal rating:10 out of 10.p.s this one is even more chilling than "halloween".

this was a great 1981 film which had a great story about three men and two girls who go on a camping trip together and go through thick woods and high mountains with a great water fall. this group of people run into property owned by george kennedy, (roy mclean) who plays the role as a forest ranger and rides a white horse. roy mclean warns these young people that where they are going is no area for camping and they should turn back. of course these young people pay no attention and proceed to have a ball swimming in the nude near the water fall and playing great music and dancing by the fire and having plenty of beer and wine. there is an old wooden one room school house that draws the gals and guys inside and it is from that point on the film starts to get very scary. there is one occasion when a young girl has to climb a tree in order to get away from a human beast who desires her body and starts chopping the tree down in order to capture her. don't miss this film, there is plenty of everything.

one of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. yes it has a cheesy plot but i was pleasantly surprised at this film, because i thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.first of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. but when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway. it's a shame that we don't get movies like this any longer, and if we do, it's usually some boring terrible film.this movie more relies on tension and being scary than gore, because the gore factor is really low in this movie which i wasn't pleased with but other than that it's still a great movie.all in all you'll have to search long and hard to find this movie and if you do find it, you will like it and also watch out for ending with the final girl and the killer it's totally not what you'd expect.

29 sept 1990 marked a small but important milestone in my appreciation of horror flicks. this was the date that bbc1 broadcast (for the only time i'm aware of) jeff lieberman's super-creepy 1981 shocker just before dawn, and it made a huge impression on me. nearly twenty years later, i'm delighted to report that i've finally got my hands on the two-disc shriek show / media blasters special edition, and it's just as eerie and unsettling as i remember it, if not more so.the plot, as is usual for genre flicks (and this was lieberman's first film as a 'director for hire', though he did at least remove all the religious cult snake-handling mumbo-jumbo from the screenplay), is a bit thin - five likable twenty-somethings (including chris lemmon, son of jack, in a pair of uncomfortably tight white strides) venture into the dense oregon woodlands to do a spot of camping and to check out a patch of land that's been bequeathed to one of their number. but just before dawn stands out from a crowd of imitators because lieberman wastes no time in showing us just how deranged things are on this particular patch of mountain, with a complete innocent skewered and a drunk preacher's truck shoved down a hill and engulfed in flames within minutes of the film beginning. the youngsters come rolling into the picture in a snappy winnebago, blondie's 'heart of glass' pounding on the soundtrack, and before you can say "texas chainsaw massacre!" they've clobbered an innocent deer with the front bumper and had their first taste of aggro from the heavy-set maniac responsible for the opening catastrophes. forest ranger roy (george kennedy) warns them that things are likely to go awry if they go any further, but they go ahead with the trip anyway, refusing to give the sozzled preacher a ride even though he's understandably scared witless and finally pitching camp miles from anywhere. needless to say, things go downhill from here.although this film's not short on bloody horror and well-handled action scenes, the standout moments for me are those where lieberman lets his camera zoom out, long and slow, from apparently innocuous shots of the fun-loving kids larking around in the wilderness, or just lets it settle for a while on the dense, imposing, people-dwarfing woodlands. he makes the oregon exteriors as threatening and as ominous as kubrick made the overlook hotel's spacious interiors in the shining, and brad fiedel's score (discounting the horribly distorted racket that runs over the titles) stays the right side of intrusive, underscoring the slowly escalating menace with subtlety and flair. there are plenty of surprises along the way, nods to deliverance with the discovery of a backwoods babe and her freaky, disturbing family, and a truly bizarre kill technique deployed shortly before the film's end. i won't spoil it for you. i've said enough.quite why this undervalued horror gem fell through the cracks and became a cult item instead of a breakout hit is hard to ascertain, but hopefully it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years to come - it deserves to be.

it may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of "slasher" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. this is a great "rare" film from jeff lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films "squirm" and "blue sunshine".five young people head into the oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."just before dawn" is noticeably more ambitious, "arty", and intelligent than some slasher films. lieberman actually fleshes out the characters - well, two of them, anyway - as much as a 90-minute-long film will allow him. the film has genuine moments of suspense and tension, and actually refrains from graphic gore, save for one killing right at the beginning.there is an above-average cast here, including oscar winner george kennedy, as a forest ranger who's understandably gone a little flaky from having been alone in the wilderness for too long. jack lemmon's son chris, future brian de palma regular gregg henry, blonde lead deborah benson (it's too bad she hasn't become a more well-known performer, judging by her work here), ralph seymour ("ghoulies"), mike kellin ("sleepaway camp"), and jamie rose ("chopper chicks in zombietown") round out the cast.some of the shots are interesting, and the early music score by brad feidel (now best known for his "terminator" theme) is haunting and atmospheric.this is worth catching for the important plot twist at about the one hour mark, although a moment at about 75 minutes in involving the heroine and a tree and the killer is almost comical; it may actually remind a viewer of a cartoon! one of the most clever touches is the final dispatching of the killer, which i'd never seen before in a horror film and probably won't see again.i didn't give it 10 out of 10 because i can't honestly that i was that frightened. still, it's an interesting slasher that is worthy of re-discovery."that deed don't mean nothing, son. those mountains can't read."9/10

i'd been postponing purchasing this one ever since its dvd release ¬ñ for one thing, because i'd been somewhat underwhelmed by this director's two other horror titles (squirm [1976] and blue sunshine [1977]), but also the fact that the film itself is said to have been slightly trimmed for gore on the media blasters/shriek show 2-disc set! i now chanced upon it as a rental and am glad i did ¬ñ because, not only is it superior to the earlier efforts (at least, on this preliminary assessment), but i also found the film to be one of the better imitations of the texas chain saw massacre (1974). this factor, however, only helped remind me that i've yet to check out another such example ¬ñ wes craven's classic the hills have eyes (1977), whose 2-disc r1 edition from anchor bay i purchased some time ago but, after all, halloween-time is fast approaching... anyway, the film manages an effortlessly unsettling backwoods atmosphere (it was shot in the forest and mountain regions of oregon) ¬ñ with plenty of effective frissons throughout but, thankfully, not too much violence (even if the last of the villains is dispatched in quite an outrageous fashion!). the principal young cast here (one of them played by jack lemmon's son, chris) isn't quite as obnoxious as those we usually encounter in this type of genre offering ¬ñ despite freely indulging in the shenanigans one associates with teen-oriented flicks and which, by and large, persist to this day! george kennedy appears as a sympathetic ranger; though he doesn't have a lot to do, his characterization is decidedly enhanced by making him a lover of plant and animal life. also notable among the locals is familiar character actor mike kellin in a nice role as the drunkard who first comes into contact with the murderous duo of the narrative ¬ñ his warning to the teenagers, naturally, goes unheeded but he's later able to lead kennedy to them.the hermetic family the teens come across in the woods, then, is eventually revealed to be hiding a skeleton in their closet. while one of the girls displays genuine curiosity at the intruders' presence, the rest are openly hostile to them ¬ñ and, in the case of the burly and uncouth twins, appropriately creepy (one of them is even prone to maniacal laughter during his rampages); at a certain point in the narrative, the ranger even offers an interesting explanation as to the nature of their aggressive and generally uncivilized behavior.

jeff lieberman's "just before dawn" is definitely one of the most underrated horror movies ever made.the film,whilst a little bit influenced by "deliverance" and "the texas chain saw massacre",is extremely creepy and memorable.the suspense almost never lets up and the atmosphere is genuinely eerie.the cast is excellent,deborah benson and jamie rose are great female leads.the inbred twins are truly frightening and remorseless killers.the film is beautifully shot-it was actually filmed on location at silver falls state park in oregon.there is very little gore,but one killing,when verchel is stabbed in the groin,is pretty nasty and unpleasant.a must-see for slasher fans.10 out of 10-what else?

1981's just before dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. it's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like the final terror, don't go in the woods, or the prey out of the water.a group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. however they are not alone in the wild. a hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers. director lieberman, who gave us such great b films as squirm (1976) and blue sunshine (1977), does an excellent job with this smart thriller as well. the movie is nicely atmospheric, with a creeping sense of tension and some strong suspense. this film makes even the open wilderness seem frighteningly claustrophobic. the oregon locations are beautiful and well captured by the crafty cinematography. the music score is a true original and awesome in contrast with the scenic visuals. deborah benson makes for a great lead, her presence was captivating. gregg henry delivers a good performance as benson's lover and chris lemon provides some occasional charisma. the supporting cast, especially veteran actor kennedy, also does quite well. a true gem of the slasher genre, that needs no gore to thrill. definitely well worth seeking out for slasher fans and horror buffs alike. see it!*** 1/2 out of ****

the dvd release of this superior made for tv bbc drama is a more than welcome addition to my collection. great acting, gripping story, and wonderful direction all add up to one of the best bbc dramas in years.

what can i say? you expect only the best in drama from the bbc and messiah is not an exception to the rule.messiah is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. police officer red metcalfe (ken stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.but be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the uk), messiah is a bit of a gruesome film. some of the murder scenes are similar to those in se7en, and one or two can be really stomach-churning. but if you can withstand that, sit back in your chair and enjoy... although you'll most likely be on the edge of it or hiding behind it.rated '15' by the bbfc for moderate violence and strong horror.

when i read the synopsis for "messiah" in the television guide, i was not prepared for what was in store. the story follows dci metcalfe trying to solve a case of grisly murders being taken out across london. he soon realises a pattern, there is a serial killer on the loose, killing people with similar names and jobs to those of the 12 apostles and their killings are identical to their matching apostle. the two part series kept me right on the edge of my seat, with metcalfe closely pursuing the killer, but always missing him within a couple of seconds and discovering the gruesome mess he has left behind of his ill-fated victim. "messiah" is sure to cause a great deal of controversy, but nonetheless it is the greatest piece of drama the bbc has shown in a long time.

guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the cannes or other film festival and one said "hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria." welllll...it kind of sort of worked. clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example bjoreling's nessun dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the dvd you got more than your money's worth. not every director succeeded but more did than not and the flick seems to improve with each viewing over the years. my favorite is the eerily beautiful love duet from die todt statd; okay a young naked elizabeth hurley is eye candy but her husband singing to her, his wife's ghost, is incredibly beautiful with the love music second only to otello and desdemona's "gia nella notte densa" in all the operatic repertoire. could the flick been better, sure, what couldn't not have been but it's well worth a view especially of you're in a hyper-romantic mood.

i saw this movie in the early 1990's when it had been out on vhs for a little while. at the time, i found it to be interesting, and was especially struck by the ken russell segment, with the visions of the accident victim in triage and surgery.last night, at a 2nd-run showing of the latest indiana jones movie, the vision of john hurt prompted an unexpected flashback to "aria", which i had not thought of in years, and the sudden memory of the russell piece itself was enough to cause an outbreak of tears for a little bit.if i can make this observation, i note with interest the love-hate reaction that people have expressed to the russell segment, and i have found this interesting difference in other movies that delve into deep trauma and its aftereffects. some get it, others do not, interesting.i see by the comments and the rating that the overall work hit people in various ways. this is how it affected and affects me.

definitely worth watching.ten different directors each present a segment based on their favorite opera aria. you don't need to be an opera lover to watch this film. (although, of course, if you hate opera, you're really going to have a bad time with this!)not surprisingly the segments range from brilliant to only fair. most of the fuss seems to be over godard's contribution -- whether you think he's brilliant or pretentious, his segment won't change your mind.some of the pieces have a clear narrative; others are more a montage of connected images.none of the pieces is more than 10 minutes or so; if you're not happy with what's on the screen, wait for the next segment, and think about how much culture you're soaking up.keep your eyes open for performances by buck henry, beverly d'angelo, elizabeth hurley, briget fonda, tilda swinton, and john hurt. (the buck henry segment alone is worth the price of admission).

robert altman, nicolas roeg, john-luc goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? these and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. for those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--how often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? it is the mood that counts. this is what i believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. for the most part they succeed wonderfully. with all these operas, who is going to like them all. we could have used more beverly sills.finally, what is art (even opera) without a few naked women?

10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). i'll do each one separately:nicolas roeg (dir)--giuseppe verdi (music). a story about an assassination attempt in 1931 vienna. theresa russell (roegs wife) plays a man! not bad--very beautiful and exotic. russell is great.charles sturridge--verdi. no story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.jean-luc godard--jean baptiste lully. horrendous. pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing. filled with gratuitous female nudity. the worst!julien temple--verdi. buck henry, beverly d'angelo and anita morris star in this funny, if obvious, story about a cheating couple. pretty good.bruce beresford--erich korngold. short, lush and romantic. very good.robert altman--jean-philippe rameau. dull. a yawner.fran roddam--richard wagner. this has bridget fonda in her film debut. beautifully done love story with a fairly explicit sex scene. ken russell--giacomo puccini. really strange but ok.derek jarman--gustave chapentier. lyrical look at youth and old age. very sweet. the last is by bill bryden doing "i pagliacci". he has john hurt (!) dressed as a clown lip-syncing to caruso (!!!).when this came out it almost got an x rating (for the abundant nudity and the sex scene). it was given an r with a strict warning attached saying the r rating would be heavily enforced. after the film bombed that warning disappeared.the idea isn't bad and 6 out of the 10 segments were worthwhile. worth seeing even if you don't like opera. just avoid the godard segment. i'm giving it an 8.

i'm an opera buff, and operas are full of sex, blood and death. it may help to know the librettos of the operas the arias are from to really appreciate this film -- my mileage is very different than tug-3. i am a classical music lover, and i liked this film.i loved ken russell's "nessun dorma" segment, and would actually like to see him produce turandot, because opera is supposed to be overwhelming, truly multi-media experience , but then i loved lisztomania. i love *turandot* and knowing the libretto so well may be why i don't find this segment the travesty that tug-3 did.the buck henry/ rigoletto segment is probably the most approachable for the average viewer -- they are likely to recognize the tunes, and its a classic bedroom farce. i like bedroom farces, so the silliness didn't upset me.the "liebestod" segment is so outstanding that i recommend people watch this for that piece alone. "depuis la jour" was, for me, beautifully spiritual. and the caruso recording of "vesti la giubba" (aka i pagliacci) with john hurt as the clown was wonderful. but people just wanting naked women may feel there is too much music and not enough bare flesh and sex.

sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. omnibus films are always a problem, but i have always had a keen interest in them. i will now rate the segments individually.nicolas roeg - "un ballo in maschera" - this segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. it is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that). the photography is unaccomplished. the best thing about it is the bit of lesbian homoerotica that it never does enough with. this segment made me very nervous about continuing. 2/10.charles sturridge - "la virgine degli angeli" - an unclear segment, but it hardly matters. the film has the best cinematography of the bunch, mainly because it is in a stunning black and white. the segment is dreamlike and beautiful. 7/10.jean-luc godard - "armide" - i chose to brave this much-maligned film for the godard and altman segments. with godard, i was much more impressed than i thought i would be. i can't claim to have seen all that many of his films since he made so many that almost no one has seen, but, judging from what i have seen, this may be his best work since the 60s. it is the funniest segment in this film, and the most artistically accomplished. bravo, jean-luc! 9/10.julien temple - "rigoletto" - a very funny segment, it is also quite predictable. still, this story about a husband and wife who are cheating on each other at the same resort is wonderfully filmed with long, complex tracking shots that depend on precisely timed choreography from the actors. it also has a great self-referencing joke about omnibus films themselves. the final scene is very weak. 7/10.bruce beresford - "die tote stadt" - this short segment involves too lovers in (i think) venice. it is pretty, with some nice shots of doves flying about the city. it is slight, but nice. 7/10.robert altman - "les bor√©ades" - not one of the better segments, unfortunately, this is more of a music video than a concept short film. it involves the occupants of an insane asylum attending a theatrical performance. the music and images work well together, so at least i can give it credit for being a good music video. 7/10franc roddam - "liebestod" - somewhat unfortunate for beresford's segment, this segment is very similar to it. as you might assume from my phrasing, this one struck me much more. it is about a young man and his girl going to las vegas on a fatalistic voyage. 8/10.ken russell - "nessun dorma" - maybe the most visually striking segment, it plays in a fantasy world more than in reality. it is a beautiful tale of a fallen angel. 8/10.derek jarman - "depuis le jour" - i have heard a lot about jarman, and this is the first piece of filmmaking i have seen from him. hopefully, i'll see more in the future. this one is also music-videoish, but it is better than altman's segement. it mainly concerns an old woman remembering her younger days. the editing and the use of different film stocks to represent both time and emotion are very beautiful. 8/10.bill bryden - "i pagliacci" - the sad clown, possibly one of the most famous arias (particularly memorable from an episode of seinfeld), this serves as the material separating each segement and the finale. it is simple and effective. 7/10.overall, i give it a solid 7/10. it isn't anywhere near as bad as you've heard.

john barrymore plays a gentleman who is also the thief, arsene lupin. while no one knows for sure this is the case, the inspector (lionel barrymore) is sure of it but cannot prove it. so, lionel spends much of the movie following john--hoping to catch this brilliant and slippery thief.although i liked the film, i really think i had higher expectations for it and thought it might be better than just a very good time-passer. that's because it paired john and lionel barrymore in the film and since these brothers were such dynamic actors, i think i expected sparks and magic but instead only caught glimpses of it here and there. now this is not to say this is a bad film--it certainly isn't. it just didn't rise to the level of being unforgettable or a film i strongly recommend you see. thanks an adequate script, the film is pretty good but i was surprised to hear no french accents at all in the film even though it was supposedly about french people! also, there just wasn't much life in the film until it was nearly complete. the ending was indeed excellent and entertaining--so good that it elevated the film from a 6 to a 7. it's nice to see it ended on a high note.

a remake of the 1916 silent film, based on the 1909 novel by maurice leblanc. the detective series would be made into numerous plays, films and tv series in the uk, the us, and france over the years. this 1932 version starred the smashing barrymore brothers john (as the duke) and lionel (as detective guerchard). they would also star together in grand hotel, dinner at eight, and several others over the next couple years. sonia (karen morley) shows up in the duke's bed during a party in this pre-hayes code film; first the lights go out in the bedroom, then they go out in the main ballroom, then the search is on for the crook and the missing jewelry, as well as other missing valuables... you can tell talkies hadn't been around too long, as they still use caption cards several times. also watch for a new kind of safe that doesn't need a combination. well-thought- out plot, no big holes, but no big surprises here either. not bad for an early talkie film. clever ending.

believe it or not, the mona lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. in 1911, leonardo da vinci's 'la gioconda' (better known as the mona lisa) was taken from the louvre by a petty thief (and former louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native italy. his actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.) the mona lisa was quietly returned to the louvre on the very last day of 1913, remaining there ever since except for occasional loan-outs. when "ars√®ne lupin" was released in 1932 (twenty years after the theft), most moviegoers would have recalled that 1911 crime, and their knowledge would have lent some plausibility to this movie. "ars√®ne lupin" is quite enjoyable, with mgm's usual high production standards and jack conway's usual briskly efficient direction. this movie does not lack for pleasure; what it lacks is plausibility.john barrymore is the master criminal of the title: he specialises in perpetrating 'impossible' crimes, which he makes even more difficult by announcing them in advance ... but of course he always commits the crime and fools the gendarmes. tully marshall has a good scene as one of barrymore's victims. lupin has a penchant for elaborate disguises, which enables barrymore (a u.s. 'grade a' ham) to indulge his own penchant for tomfoolery. john's older brother lionel barrymore is guerchard, the javert-like surete detective sworn to catch lupin.karen morley was an extremely beautiful actress whose private life was filled with populist political activities; on screen, she was most impressive in working-class roles that fitted her own political beliefs (such as her fine performance in 'our daily bread'). in "ars√©ne lupin", morley's naturally dark hair is bleached a horrid blonde tone, and she's all tarted up in posh outfits that make her look uncomfortable rather than sexy.spoilers coming. eventually, lupin decides to steal the mona lisa from the louvre. he slits the painting from its frame, rolls up the canvas, and then smuggles it out in a flower basket. we see john barrymore casually brandishing a tightly-rolled piece of cloth which is allegedly the greatest work of art in all human history. i had to laugh at the filmmakers' error. in real life (but not in this movie), da vinci painted the mona lisa on a plank of poplar wood, so a thief would have difficulty rolling it up!eventually, guerchard captures lupin and hauls him off to le calaboose. the scene between john and lionel barrymore in the police car is sheer delight, as their genuine affection for each other spills out into their characters' dialogue. i would have found this scene implausible with any two other actors. as it is, i can't imagine anyone but the barrymore brothers playing these roles. well, maybe dennis and randy quaid, but just barely.don't look for a good plot line here, but "ars√®ne lupin" is a delightful example of old-style movie-making. i'll rate this movie 8 points out of 10.

a cranky police detective suspects a french duke of being the infamous thief ars√®ne lupin.john & lionel barrymore costarred together for the first time in a motion picture in this intriguing crime drama. alike and yet so different, they are the perfect counterpoint to each other. john plays his role with suave sophistication (when not in disguise) and lionel is earthy & common in his portrayal, each obviously having a wonderful time trying to out act the other. helped by a generous script, the outcome is pretty much a draw, with the viewer the clear winner.although upstaged by the two male stars, karen morley is intriguing as the mystery woman john finds naked in his bed. tully marshall gives a colorful performance as a silly nobleman with much to lose to the master criminal. henry armetta & george davis are very enjoyable as two seriously inept security guards. john miljan provides a sturdy presence in his small role as the police prefect.movie mavens will recognize an uncredited mischa auer as a guide in the louvre during the climactic scene dealing with an attempted heist of the mona lisa.

having reviewed 3 of the 4 perry and croft sitcoms, i thought i would get them all done now. dads army, is my all time favourite sitcom, it ain't half hot mum is also a classic as is you rang m'lord. i don't regard hi de hi as a classic, but it is still funny.it's about a holiday camp, similar to butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. it is ran by jeffery fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock. the staff include fun entertainment manager ted, his sidekick spike (he ended up being thrown in the swimming pool nearly every episode), yellow coat gladys, careless maid peggy who longed to be a yellow coat and the punch and judy man mr partridge who hates kids. situations occurred mostly round the swimming pool, where someone would be thrown in every episode (with there clothes on of course).not a classic, but still funny. jeffery fairbrother left half way through, so this, a bit like only fools and horses, outstayed its welcome. jimmy perry was actually a red coat at butlins.best episode: peggy's big chance, series 2, episode 2.

i very nearly did not see 'hi-de-hi!'. i think it must have been the title that put me off. in those days, the welsh language editions of 'the radio times' only used to print titles of certain shows without imparting a scrap of information as to what they were actually about. 'hi-de-hi!' suggested to me a bad quiz show hosted by leslie crowther or worse an inane u.s. import. but i managed to catch a later episode, and was surprised to find it written by jimmy perry and david croft.as was the case with 'dad's army' and 'it ain't half hot mum', perry based it on personal experiences, in this case his time at a butlins' holiday camp. before cheap air travel came along in the '60's, these camps sprang up along british coastlines, providing entertainment for working class families and earning millions for their owners.( as a matter of interest, i worked in one such camp in the '80's as a chef - barry island, south wales - known to all and sundry as 'shag land' for reasons i won't go into! )set in the late '50's, it began with university academic jeffrey fairbrother ( simon cadell ) taking over as the entertainments manager of maplin's, a job he was ill equipped to handle. his staff included resident comic ted bovis ( paul shane ), his sidekick spike ( jeffrey holland ), miserable punch and judy man mr.partridge ( leslie dwyer ), snobby ballroom dancers barry ( barry howard ) and yvonne stuart-hargreaves ) diane holland ), and the unforgettable gladys pugh ( ruth madoc ), who lusted after fairbrother at every opportunity. bubbly su pollard stole the show though as cleaner peggy ollerenshaw, whose driving ambition was to be a 'yellowcoat' ( all the important staff members wore them ). a number of sexy girls occupied these coats too, most notably nikki kelly's 'sylvia' and statuesque rikki howard's 'betty'. we never saw joe maplin, the owner. he communicated to his staff in the form of ungrammatical missives, which poor jeffrey was forced to read aloud. "hi-de-hi!" was the campers' greeting, usually met with the equally inane 'ho-de-ho!. one fan was the late sir fred pontin, who told perry and croft that he recognised most of the characters from real life.i always found bovis the most convincing of these as well as the most tragic, like archie rice he was the comedian whose big break never came, reduced to cracking corny gags for the amusement of drunken late-night audiences. he took advantage of his position to indulge in a few perks, and in one memorable episode fairbrother's patience snapped and he sounded him out: "lies, ted! all lies!".as with every other perry/croft series, the cast were excellent, particularly cadell and shane. ruth madoc's prissy 'gladys' got on my nerves ( no wonder anne robinson hates the welsh! ), but leslie dwyer's misanthropic 'mr.partridge' and felix bowness' jockey 'fred qulley' more than compensated. the visual gag everyone remembers is drunken mr.partridge spotting a pantomime horse riding a real one along the beach. looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand, he decides to stick with it and instead throws away the banana he had been eating! with its frothy blend of '50's nostalgia and saucy gags, 'hi-de'hi' was a big hit for b.b.c.-1 in the '80's, resulting in a massive increase in bookings for butlins and pontins. it went downhill when cadell left to return to the theatre though. i never took to his replacement, squadron leader clive dempster ( david griffin ). worse, leslie dwyer's death robbed the show of one of its best characters. kenneth connor was brought in to replace him as 'uncle sammy'.the period setting occasionally caused problems; in one episode, sylvia and betty had to dive into the pool to rescue peggy who for some reason was dressed as a shark. the revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that era. still they looked great in them so who's complaining? in another, ted sang the tom jones hit 'delilah' to campers. it was not composed ( by les reed and barry mason, incidentally ) until 1968.maplins closed its doors in 1988, and the last shot was that of peggy ( now a yellowcoat ) all alone in the camp, jumping into the air and shouting ( what else? ) 'hi-de-hi!'. i don't rate it as highly as perry and croft's other shows but its popularity is undeniable. it was probably one of the last british sitcoms to generate tremendous public affection, mainly because it featured likable characters in a recognisable setting. goodnight campers!

i get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. on the other hand, hi de hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. i have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and i am surprised at just how much i am enjoying it all - again. i have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait. the gems that have come from this series and the respect that the actors achieved through it speak for themselves. croft and perry created some pure gold some of which shines through hi de hi.

based to some extent on writers, david croft and jimmy perry's, own experiences as butlins holiday camp entertainers in the uk during the same timescale the programme follows, "hi-de-hi!" epitomises the 'slapstick, postcard humour" of post-war britain. set in the fictitious seaside town of crimpton-on-sea, "hi-de-hi" chronicles the comedic goings on within the maplins holiday camp - one of many dotted along the british coast owned by the mega-rich, but never seen (on screen) joe maplin.although the actual show began in 1980 with the pilot episode and ran until 1988 when the bbc deemed it too tame for it's cutting edge comedy department, seasons 1-5 focused on 1959 while seasons 6-9 spotlighted 1960 - a time when the old style british holiday camp began to fall into decline. during the first 5 seasons, jeffrey fairbrother (played brilliantly by the late, great simon cadell) was the camp's entertainment manager; a well meaning, yet slightly pensive ex-university professor breaking free of his upper class background and venturing into the "real" world to head his team of entertainment staff who were in stark contrast to his own laid-back personality. from season 6 onwards, fairbrother was replaced by clive dempster (played by david griffin when cadell quit the show at the height of it's popularity), an ex-raf war hero who, in many ways, was similar to cadell's character in background, but more a scoundrel than a gentleman.however, the real stars of "hi-de-hi" throughout the nine seasons were ted bovis (played superbly by paul shane), a stereotypical working class, ale drinking, bawdy comic - someone who could never resist an opportunity to fiddle the campers; gladys pugh (played by ruth madoc who's currently experiencing a career comeback with appearances in the hit bbc comedy, "little britain"), chief yellowcoat (what the entertainment staff were called because of their bright yellow jackets) and sports organiser - but more importantly, the one person who saved jeffrey fairbrother and clive dempster from embarrassment by covering up their inexperience in running a holiday camp; peggy ollerenshaw (su pollard), the slightly dopey, yet lovable lowly chalet maid with a burning ambition to become a yellowcoat, and spike dixon (jeffrey holland), ted's innocent prot√©g√© learning more about 'show business' than he hoped for.as usual with a croft & perry production, the assembled cast of characters were a bunch of misfits played superbly by the actors involved. mr. partridge (played by the late leslie dwyer, who was in his 70's by the time he left the show), the alcoholic child-hating children's entertainer; fred quilly (felix bowness), a former champion jockey with a dubious past; yvonne & barry stuart-hargreaves (dianne holland & barry howard), the snobbish former ballroom dancing champions who were in the twilight of their careers; and sylvia and betty (nikki kelly and rikki howard), the two main girl yellowcoats who were always looking for the type of fun joe maplin would never allow in one of his camps."hi-de-hi" typified the slapstick era of the late 50s with it's saucy and, to a certain degree, vulgar "tongue-in-cheek" humour (jokes about people sitting on toilets and anecdotes about 'women with big knockers' were the order of the day). but despite it's whiff of "carry on" funniness, it was always so innocent and became something of recommended family viewing back in the 80's. of course, the critics of the show remarked that the show had outstayed it's welcome by a good couple of years, but i disagree. while the early seasons focused mainly on bawdiness and slapstick humour, the latter series of "hi-de-hi" saw more thought put into the scripts and the main characters (especially spike dixon & gladys pugh) were able to grow with more sensitive story lines. that said, there were a few criticisms of the show. clive dempster was no jeffrey fairbrother, and the former didn't quite have the on-screen chemistry with gladys as jeffrey did (i personally think it would've been more believable if gladys had married jeff); five seasons dedicated to 1959 and four to 1960 caused more than just a few continuity errors (the disappearance of old faces and introductions of new characters weren't explained properly, especially with the yellowcoats who came and went with much regularity; and the character of gladys pugh, who, in the pilot episode was made out to be a free-loving man-eater that was suddenly transformed into a naive virgin like character! also to mention quite pedantically, most of the 1959 holiday season was covered in season one, so to stretch the rest of the year out in five further series was something bordering unbelievable. still, the show wasn't meant to be meticulously looked upon, and the comedy more than outweighed it's flaws.all in all, "hi-de-hi" was probably one of the last comedies from the bbc's golden period, and even if it never managed to rival such british comedic mainstays as "only fools & horses", "porridge" or even "last of the summer wine", "hi de hi" will be best remembered as a comedy the whole family could enjoy. if you haven't already checked it out for yourself, i implore you to do so.

bounty killer george hilton, smooth mexican bandit gilbert roland (who's great), and bank representative edd byrnes each try to outwit one-another while searching for a large amount of gold from one of roland's train robberies that was hidden by a treacherous member of his gang.though not the greatest that the genre has to offer, it's still breezy enough with a lot of light-hearted, action-filled fun and a satisfying finale.any gun can play is mainly remembered for it's opening gag where george hilton easily guns down three outlaws resembling clint eastwood, lee van cleef, and django.the next year, hilton and roland were reunited alongside van heflin and klaus kinski in the highly recommended the ruthless four.

"any gun can play" (1967), directed by enzo g. castellari, is a very good pastiche of spaghetti westerns, especially leone's. the first half is great, which, apart from the opening which is a direct nod to "for a few dollars more", with monco, colonel douglas mortimer and el indio lookalikes walking into a ghost-town and then promptly killed by a bounty hunter called "the stranger", is entirely serious, with great gunfights (especially the train-robbing scene), fast and furious action and nice performances from gilbert roland, george hilton and (who manages well, considering that he is badly miscast) edd byrnes. but then, when the film reaches the half-way mark, there is a jokey fist-fight between hilton and byrnes. it isn't very funny, and is the weakest part of the film, but it throws everything you have seen previously in a new light. you realise that in fact the whole thing is a spoof of spaghetti western conventions, and in retrospect, the first half is so well done that you completely miss this spoof undercurrent. what now follows is a more obvious parody, with even some acrobatic jumping around from brynes that predates all those seventies circus westerns. the ending, a complete send-up of "the good, the bad and the ugly" climax, is very well done, as in other hands it could have been very silly. so, a pretty fun spaghetti western, that doesn't take itself too seriously. i would recommend it to anyone who likes spaghetti westerns.

a train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker clayton, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit monetero. however bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. the only clue is that of a medallion, but monetero is captured and soon would be executed. a stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold. in exchange monetero gives him half of the medallion, but clayton notices it and discovers something is up. soon all three are crossing each other for the gold, but also the bank's insurance company and monetero's gang are watching on, waiting for their chance to pounce.just watching the opening sequence you'll know you're in for a spaghetti western with a tongue-in-cheek style and a reliance of sprinkling many references (some nicely realised) from other films (largely the dollar trilogy) of its sub-genre. director enzo castellari's sprightly direction is sprawling and mostly lightweight, but there's potential in many of his grand, showy set pieces and smooth rhythmic pace. largely there's a lot of tussles, fist-fights (and plenty of acrobatic stunts) taking place, compared with all-out vicious shootouts. however most of these stunts are very well done, and very enjoyable and when the guns are blazing there's energy to burn. the traditional story sticks close to conventional details, but since there's a lot of conniving and outfoxing going on, the spontaneous nature makes sure you're never quite certain how it's eventually going to play out between the three. this leads up to many effective suspenseful moments, clever twists, and plenty of wink, wink. the humour within the starch script is pretty sly. worked in favourably amongst the light and zesty style, is giovanni bergamini's dynamically taut framing and francesco de masi's impulsively rousing music score. the performances are extremely well tailored and form a striking rapport. george hilton's wry and scuffed turn is solid as the ambiguous stranger. gilbert roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable mexican bandit monetero. edd byrnes gives a poised performance as clayton, that holds up well. kareen o'hara doesn't get much to do, but is a worthy looker. gerard herter, pedro sanchez and ivano staccioli provide able support.a fun and worthy spaghetti parody/homage that throws one curve-ball after another and many fruitful down 'n' dirty antics.

this enjoyable euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that sergio leone wanted to shoot for "once upon a time in the west" but couldn't persuade clint eastwood to appear in. three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. one is dressed like the man with no name in a poncho. another is dressed like colonel mortimer from "for a few dollars more," and the third is garbed like django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. our hero meets them in main street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins. "any gun can play" is a spaghetti western with an in-joke on spaghetti westerns since the hero here wipes out the three killers. aside from a little too much comedy, especially in the acrobatic fight sequences, this is an above-average oater.the notorious mexican outlaw montero (gilbert roland of "barbarosa") and his gang of trigger-happy pistoleros rob an army train transporting $300-thousand dollars in gold coins across the frontier. director enzo g. castellari of "inglorious bastards" stages the hold up from a variety of camera angles that thrust you into the forefront of the action. the bandits seize the locomotive along with the coach carrying the gold and separate it from the rest of the train that houses the u.s. cavalry. while montero and his gunmen keep the cavalry pinned down, pajondo (pedro sanchez of "sabata") commandeers the locomotive, kills the engineer and his crew and trundles it away, leaving the other pistoleros behind to fend for themselves. essentially, pajondo double-crosses montero and steals the gold for himself. later, montero catches up with pajondo at the rio grande. before the bandit can reveal the whereabouts of the loot to montero, however, a cavalry sergeant shoots pajondo dead. before he dies, pajondo tells montero about a medallion that serves as a clue about where he stashed the treasure. the irate cavalry captain (ivano staccioli of "commandos") imprisons montero, but he cannot loosen the bandit's tongue even after he uses his whip on him. infuriated by montero's reticence, the captain threatens to have the mexican shot if he doesn't talk. meanwhile, the jailers let a priest speak to montero, but he really isn't a priest. the six-gun toting stranger (george hilton of "the ruthless four") masquerades as a man of the cloth and rescues montero from a firing squad. unfortunately, before montero is rescued, clayton (edd byrnes of tv's "77 sunset strip") takes the medallion away from him and keeps it for himself. clayton is the bank representative that was sent to safeguard the gold. he is horrified that the captain wants to shoot montero. clayton's career at the bank hinges on his ability to recover the gold. the stranger stages a fire at the fort to distract the firing squad and montero takes the captain as hostage and tries to escape, but the stranger shoots him off the horse. before the authorities can verify that montero is dead, the stranger claims the body for the handsome reward he will receive and he rides out with the captain's gracious thanks. no sooner have they left the fort than montero's men show up to rescue him from the stranger. from this point on, the stranger, montero, and clayton forge short-lived alliances among each other as they search for the gold. castellari and scenarist tito carpi, who has penned a number of spaghetti westerns such as "a few dollars for django" and another castellari oater "seven winchesters for a massacre," rely on clever humor and surprise reversals to keep the action fresh and fast-paced. one cool scene has clayton seated at a table about to eat his meal when he hears some suspicious sounds from behind him. clayton pours his drink on the table and sees the gunmen behind him with holstered six-guns."any gun can play" lives up to its title. in fact, many guns do play, and at least twenty or more corpses pile up before fade-out. this western isn't so much a parody as it is a knock-off of sergio leone's "the good, the bad, and the ugly." mind you, bad guys and good guys fall as frequently as ten-pins in a bowling alley, but their deaths aren't depicted in the brutal fashion of a leone western. "any gun can play" doesn't take itself as seriously as the aforementioned leone masterpiece. the three leads jockey back and forth for supremacy. each has a piece of the puzzle that will lead them to the treasure, but they refuse to share their information until the shoot'em up finale. lenser giovanni bergamini's colorful widescreen photography is spectacular, especially the opening shots of the train chuffing along railway tracks with distant mountain peaks rearing up dramatically in the background. another great shot occurs when montero tests the stranger's imperturbable calm. this scene happens after the stranger has rescued montero and the mexican's minions arrive to save their chieftain's bacon. confiscating the stranger's six-gun, montero takes aim at the poncho-clad tough guy and empties the revolver, placing his well-aimed bullets harmlessly in and around the unflinching gunslinger. bergamini, who photographed castellari's world war ii thriller "inglorious bastards," frames the scene with the stranger in the background and his pistol in montero's hand in the foreground for a pleasing, three-dimensional style shot. meanwhile, francesco de masi's lively orchestral soundtrack is as memorable for its own idiosyncratic melodies as ennio morricone's soundtracks were for the leone westerns. the opening song is reminiscent of a 1950's hollywood western with its catchy lyrics and guitar riffs. although it isn't a major spaghetti western, "any gun can play" is always entertaining nonsense with interesting plot twists and good performances, especially the indefatigable gilbert roland who was 62 years old at the time!

a gang of bandits lead by the shrewd, rugged, ruthless monetero (a perfectly imposing performance by gilbert roland) steals $300,000 worth of gold coins during a daring train robbery. but untrustworthy member bahunda (an amusing turn by jose torres) makes off with the coins and hides them. unfortunately, bahunda gets killed before he can tell monetero where he stashed the booty. so monetero has to join forces with cunning, cocky, enigmatic bounty hunter the stranger (smoothly played by the handsome george hilton) and cagey, corrupt banker clayton (a delightfully weaselly portrayal by 50's teen idol eddie "kookie" burns) to find the coins. skillfully directed by enzo g. castellari, with a clever, complex and twist-laden script by castellari, tito carpi, and giovanni simonelli, a playfully amoral and nihilistic tone (everyone keeps double and triple crossing each other with happily greedy abandon), a twangy, flavorsome, spirited score by alessandro alessandroni and francesco de masi, plenty of stirring shoot-outs and rousing rough'n'tumble fisticuffs, a wickedly sly sense of self-mocking humor, a steady pace, and a real doozy of a surprise ending, this giddy and often hilarious feature makes for an inspired send-up of sergio leone's "the good, the bad and the ugly." popping up in nifty secondary parts are the luscious stefanie careddu as monetero's fiery gal pal marisol, ivano staccioli as a hard-nosed army captain, and gerard herter as flinty lawman lawrence blackman. an immensely amusing and enjoyable romp.

"when i die, someone will bury me. and if they don't, what's the difference. who gives a damn, huh?" thus the philosophy of life (or lack there of) is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spin off of sergio leone's "dollars trilogy." in the opening scene, three obviously evil gunmen ride into a western town and, with menacing glares, they intimidate all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes. the observant watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from leone's for a few dollars more. there is one guy in eastwood's poncho, one in lee van cleef's black suit, and one seeming to act like gian marie volonte's indio. but this movie is not about these guys. no sooner do they ride into town when they are gunned down by someone even cooler than they, a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the stranger.no. this is an altogether different story.in an obvious copying of leone's the good, the bad, and the ugly, three gunmen are again vying for a hidden treasure. once again there is the bounty hunter and the mexican bandit. the stranger (george hilton) is a supercool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed up like a priest. he is after the reward for the bandit monetero (gilbert roland). but when monetero's gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins, the stranger gets sidetracked from his normal line of work.to round off the trio there is edd byrne's corrupt bank executive, clayton. he too wants the money for himself. but after the money is hidden away, the only man who knows where it is gets shot. now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest. the game is too find the treasure before anyone else does. and any gun can play.with plenty of gunfights, fist fights, and double crosses, the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff, a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala the good, the bad, and the ugly -- but with a twist.this movie is not as good as leone's films, of course, but in the end who gives a damn, huh? this movie is fun -- 60s nihilism, spaghetti western style. there are no rules, no enduring loyalties, and no right or wrong -- just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it. and, though the movie is not classic, the ending surely is. hey, maybe we all can get along after all, for a hundred thousand a piece.if you like spaghetti westerns, check this one out. it is fast, furious, and worth the look. my name is evren buyruk from crestline california

george hilton never really grabs me like franco nero or clint eastwood, but this is a great outing for him. basically rippin off the django/man with no name and doing a damn good job. the opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch. fans of the genre will be in heaven.

leonard maltin gave this film a dreaded bomb rating in his 1995 movie and video guide. what film was he looking at? kid vengeance or god's gun are bombs. this film is a delight. it is fantastic. it is literate. it is well mounted. it is beautiful photographed, making a brilliant use of colors. right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a well-done satire of the whole spaghetti western genre. the film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to douglas fairbanks, 77 sunset strip, and the famous showdown in the good, the bad, and the ugly. edd byrnes, george hilton, and gilbert roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work. it is too bad mr. maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved. one can only guess as to his reason. i suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be. kudos belong to everyone involved in this project. this film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire.

- a group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. in their escape, the bandits split up. the one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. three men have a different part of the "clue" that will lead to the gold. can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? or, will they kill each other first? - the plot is an obvious take-off of leone's the good, the bad, and the ugly. various scenes in the movie are also lifted from other films by leone, corbucci, and more. but, to me, it's done in a way that doesn't show disrespect to the original work. instead, any gun can play lovingly parodies some of the biggest films in spaghetti western history. the opening scene of three men riding into town and the final face-off between the three main stars are a wonderful homage to the sws that came before.- castellari adds a lot of nice touches of his own - the reflection in the spilled wine, the stranger's entrance with the vivid red background, and the playful way the gold is discovered in the end. although highly unbelievable, many of the fight scenes are well staged and directed. two fight scenes in particular (the market fight and the bath house fight) are very nicely done. he is also unafraid to try different things with his camera. tight close-ups, overhead shots, and shots around corners are all common in any gun can play.- another plus is the cast that castellari had to work with. george hilton is always good in these movies. gilbert roland is literally playing gilbert roland. and sw newcomer edd byrnes holds his own with the two sw veterans. the supporting cast features, among others, sw regular gerard herter.- any gun can play should not be taken too seriously. nice touches of humor can be found throughout the movie. if this is possible with an sw, it's more of a "feel good" movie - very reminiscent of some of the terence hill / bud spencer films.

oh yes! hollywood does remember how to use the good old formula, and when lightning hits, it's a rather wonderful feeling. rarely hollywood creates a masterpiece because lately, there seems to be more concern with hurrying up and getting the most rewards in a hurried manner, or there is the matter of too many cooks in the mix. usually good screenplays are the result of a talented writer who is in full control of his/her property, understand his material and is a good writer. then, there is a little important part, often neglected by the marketing geniuses that so often lack creativity and vision: a good actor.a good actor can make the difference between a mediocre, half-cooked try, and a fully realized film that might not be an important and relevant movie, but one that contributes to its genre and might eventually become a classic of its type. we get very few romantic comedies, and we are people who are starved for them. buried in the sexy humor of "sex in the city" is the romantic, yet stormy relationship of big and carrie, and people flocked to "mamma mia" because it had some romance, skillfully played by streep and brossnam. it could have a silly musical, but it did touch us because it was played with intensity and conviction. "nights" offers us more of it, with the amazing talents of a woman who does magnificent work in romantic films, ms. diane lane. ever since her days as a child actor, we could appreciate how her talent, combined with her appreciative soul allowed us to see into the hearts of the story's protagonists. a few years back, she teamed up with mr. gere, giving us a tormented, romantic, and sexy performance as the wife who is not too sure of her actions' consequences in "unfaithful", work that should have garnered her at least an academy award. she is back, doing more formidable work in this romantic gem as a woman who has given up on her romantic prospects, and suddenly she realizes there might be another chance around the corner.ms. lane makes this film pulsate with intelligence and passion. her facial expressions communicate volumes about the different emotions her character undergoes. we can read frustrations, yearnings, desperation, anger, hope, loss, and a range that is way out reach for a lot of the marketable types that hollywood constantly push down our throats. here is a mature performer who has the gift to project real emotions and allows us to connect with the material in such a way that we are moved as we become part of the experience.ms. lane is such a triumphant joy to watch as she goes through transformations from the first scenes of the film until the very end. her discoveries become ours as we celebrate with her the power of hope and love. she is able to bring back the unsurpassed joy of a person in love, much like a teenager does, and yet she never lets you think of her character as silly or irresponsible. her eyes are expressive gems that can move even the cynical in the audience. she is one of the stars that can do wonders with just one look. in her the classic feel of those grand movies of yesterday are back. her work recalls the passionate and intelligent work of hepburn, davis, garson, women who played everyday types and made them memorable because they created complete characters.we admire those superb actresses who recreate real life legends and are rewarded for it. half their work is done by the mystique of the figures they impersonate; however as much as anyone might make you think, it is the roles such as lane's in this movie that are a more impressive achievement because they are created from scratch, given a personal imprint and are able achieve heights without any previous theatrical material support, such as plays, and the background of a famous legend whose life is paid tribute on the silver screen. lane's character is one woman whose experiences could be any of us. she represents our dreams and emotions with much quality, class, and just the right amount of sentiment. it is quite a remarkable achievement, and we should be grateful that we are still able to find such a remarkable performance nowadays.there are a few adjectives i could use to pay tribute to her work, but i can only say that in my humble opinion every single frame of her work in this film is testament to one of the greatest performances ever put on celluloid by a living performer. thank you, ms. lane.

dr. paul flanner (richard gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited james franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. adrienne willis (diane lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. they both need to get away. she watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in rodanthe at the same time he books a room. they're all alone together. you can pretty much figure out the rest.this is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film. it's beautifully shot with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes. there's tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an uplifting ending (sort of). the great acting by gere and lane helps disguise the fact that this film isn't really about much. every single bit of the plot is predictable. i rolled my eyes a lot at some of the events. also it's far too short--i didn't believe the romance between gere and lane for a second. if comes out of nowhere and moves very quickly. still the movie does work. the inn itself is absolutely gorgeous and i was in tears by the end along with most of the audience. so it's a predictable but gorgeous movie with some wonderful acting. it doesn't deserve all the criticism it's getting. i give it a 7.

before i talk about the ending of this film i will talk about the plot. some dude named gerald breaks his engagement to kitty and runs off to craven castle in scotland. after several months kitty and her aunt venture off to scottland. arriving at craven castle kitty finds that gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). gerald does not want them to stay but, kitty insist on staying by making excuses. one night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall. it scares her so much that she faints and (another excuse) they must stay longer. kitty becomes more worried about gerald after she tries to go in the maze but gerald catches her and is even meaner to her. kitty then sends for reinforcements, she calls their doctor who is actually their friend and his wide. then to make things not look suspicious they invite a couple other friends(who don't really do anything). blah,blah, blah kitty and her aunt end up in the maze where the most suspense of the story is. they somehow get separated and they try to find each other. but the aunt stumbles upon the creature...here it is the moment we've all been waiting for, what is the creature lurking in the shadows?...it is a giant frog!!! omg what is better than that! after seeing the aunt the frog literally goes crazy and runs, oops i mean hops up the stairs to the top of the castle. the frog then leaps out an open window. we then go on a shot from the ground and see the frog gall towards us (oh yeah this movie was in 3-d). but you want to know what is funny is the frog that falls out the window is actually a toy because it is 1/10 the size of the frog before it takes the leap. it is then revealed that this was all evolutions fault, blah, blah and kitty and gerald get married. then the last shot of this masterpiece is of the grave of the frog in the maze, the only place where he was ever really happy ;).

i really enjoyed this movie and i usually don't like animated pictures. but i thought the cats were appealing and the story line was charming. there is a good song called "everybody wants to be a cat," that is a lot of fun. it has some comic moments and is an interesting adventure. i think it helps to be an avid cat lover to enjoy this film.

this is a funny, clever film and well worth your time. in my opinion it is much better than american pie and other films of the same genre that seem to get knocked out all the time. i hadn't heard of this film, so i guess it didn't get much press, which is kind of a shame. it doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time delivers a serious message to people about life and life experiences and what is important...as opposed to a film about a bunch of desperate guys trying to get laid for the first time and one dude sticking his d**k in a pie, but in the end everyone gets laid and whoop-de-do... one thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was pretty awesome and not the usual cheesy american pop-punk...they actually had real punk from back in the day like the ramones...that in itself made the film better! to be honest i wasn't expecting much from this film and i was pleasantly surprised at how good a comedy it is.

this movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. accepted, is the story of a kid named bartleby (justin long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. his parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. so, bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. but behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the american educational system. the college they create "south harmon institute of technology" accepts those who did not get accepted anywhere else. the message is that you do not need "money, tradition, or fancy books- you just need a desire to better yourself." they are a completely unorthodox school, but what the movie teaches is that thats still ok- and different (whether its a person or a school) is not necessarily bad, and that every one no matter should be given the chance to better themselves- despite whether they are 'weird.' its a message of non-comformity and has traces of anti-authority sprinkled in as well. but not only are messages great- its hilarious! haha i laughed very hard. the humor can be subtle but can also be blatant as well, and is a great mix. fraternities beware.

when the trailer for accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. who could blame them, it looked like fun. but that's exactly the thing. people went into accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. it's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. that being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one. think that, and you will truly enjoy the film (because you'll rid yourself of your idea that the movie will be fantastic.) bottom line: watch the movie, and have fun, but don't look for anything groundbreaking.

if i had watched this movie when i hit rock bottom i probably would have sunk into the deepest depression of my life, and may have been nearly desperate enough to try it, the only thing is in the real world, when you rob millions of dollars from unsuspecting individuals, everything doesn't come up roses (unless you are an investment banker or government affiliated) so how does that matter? i had been rejected from school after school, and it stings, so it is a brilliant topic for a movie, and when you give yourself over to the imaginary to let yourself watch this movie without applying real world ramifications, it can truly touch someone in that situation, and let them know they are not alone. overdone soliloquy completely tears apart the established educational system as we know it. really, all i can say is that as i am in college now, looking back on where i was, and watching this movie, i can truly appreciate it in a way i never would have been able to otherwise. it is juvenile and contrite yes, but it is an emotional and uplifting fantasy about freedom, and i cant think of a better way to end my night.

accepted...let's see. the only reason why i had chosen to see that movie was the hot dog shown in commercials when shrader(sp?) said, "ask me about my weiner". after that i had to see that movie and i watched it with a couple of my friends...and wow amazing. one of the best films of the year. the entire movie i was laughing like crazy! the plot in this story is that bartleby (justin long) doesn't get accepted into any of the schools he applied, so he makes another fake college for him and his friends so that he can fool his parents that he did make it into college. so he makes the finishing touches and he fools his parents...until, more students look at the website and see the clicker (acceptance is one click away) and all these rejects come to this school. they face many problems and they just cant seem to get anything right 10/10 loved it now watch it

diora baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. but really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch.(minor spoilers) as per usual, the main character, b, is the sane one of the bunch. b has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. he's known for making fake ids. so an acceptance letter is no problem.because b's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, b gets his friend sherman to design a website for the university. sherman has been accepted to a great college and is in fear of being arrested for fraud. he's very quick with witty lines but his flaw is he wants to be accepted socially too much.glen, hands, and rory are the three stooges that follow b along. glen got a zero on his sats and has no thought process. he's constantly proposing battle royals, but he's very good at making smoothies, which gets him a lot of hot girls, somehow. hands was a great football player who didn't receive the scholarship he was counting on, and turns to crafts to cover his lack of athletics. rory was preparing to go to yale since the 1st grade, and was not accepted. she spends her time meditating.uncle ben was my favorite character. picture lewis black playing himself. if you have no reason to see this movie, then see it for lewis black and jonah hill. they're amazing.monica is a b's love interest. as most of these stories go, she's more popular than him and doesn't even notice him until half way through the movie. unlike many other stories though, b actually gets her and keeps her until the end. monica is actually a good character on her own, but of course she's primarily there for b to adore.there are more supporting students at the made-up college who are fun to watch. a.d.d.'s name is self explanatory, and funny enough he ends up in the meditation class. kiki is a hot ex-stripper who falls head over heels for a chance to go to school and eventually gets a crush on glen. maurice is an ex-military idiot who got his g.i. bill and wants to study rock n' roll in college. the final guy is only known as freaky student, who thinks he can blow things up with his mind. ye who have little faith in him wait until the end of the movie.of course the villains are the dean of an opposing university, his university's student body president, the president's girlfriend, and their circle of friends.every character is lovable. i believe this movie has a good plot and is well done, despite what a lot of people say. even thought the overall story is predictable, the characters keep you guessing and make the movie great. go see this film. i give it 9 out of 10.

when i saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy american movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. i was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. the movie centres around bartely or b who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play b is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. however loads of people see his fake website and join. feeling their sorrows b can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate. the college is the ideal place with you learning what you want or doing nothing. the school faces opposition from the proper college which ends up closing it down. the film ends on a high and i recommend you watching it. its does have it flaws but it is a feel good cheerful film with a few unpredictable twists.

accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and pc ads. the movie is about bartelby .b. gaines a guy who has rejected from all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it, problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school. the movie is hilarious and i was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and i have always watched it since. overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up. i rate this movie a very fair 78%. go accepted make a sequel guys but make sure it is not crap.

accepted is one of the best teenage comedies i have seen in a long time. it has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.it tells the story of a high school graduate bartleby "b" gains (justin long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. in the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school. everything goes smoothly until a lot of other "accepted" students turn up on his doorstep. now he and his friend have to figure that collage thing out not only for themselves but for the others too.justin long as a lead man is absolutely brilliant, his character is as natural as he can be and the supporting acts are outstanding- jonah hill as sherman schrader, columbus short as hands, maria thayer as rory, adam herschman as glen and lewis black as uncle ben.the humour is fresh and simple and most importantly funny, right from the start to after the credits .the plot develops so easy that by the time you stop laughing at the last joke you start giggling at next other. along with all the fun the movie brings a very common subject to our attention i.e. the collage education. if usually the students in the movie are united against the school government, in this case they are united by the mutual desire to go to school and learn.yet the movie doesn't brand all other schools as wrong, it just shows that there is another way. you what they say "if there is a will there is a way.and may be sometimes the children know better what they need than their parents.this movie is an unmissable little story about the great opportunities in life wrapped up in the best format possible.

on the face of it, any teen comedy runs the risk of being sophomoric and obvious, and fair enough, most of them are. there are a few that have risen above the usual banality of the source material (bring it on, eurotrip), and they give me hope that others can join that depressingly rare crowd of teen comedies that are actually funny and not just an excuse to flash some starlet's boobs or be a vehicle for some never-was like tom green.enter accepted, directed by john cusack pal steve pink and led by the likable justin long (the smart nerdy kid in galaxy quest and more recently featured in apple computer ads), about a bunch of kids who don't get accepted to college and decide, as disclosed in the trailer, to fake a bogus one to get their parents off their backs. when they go a little too far with the website and other kids end up enrolling, the kids have a few problems to solve.okay, the set-up is obviously preposterous, but most comedy lives or dies in the execution, and here, accepted does pretty well. long's bartleby gaines (mostly shortened to 'b') is accompanied by enough well-meaning comically acceptable friends to help him share the load, but probably the best supporting character is 'dean' lewis (no doubt named as an homage to rodney dangerfield's dean martin), aka uncle ben, lewis black, who is wisely restricted to short spurts where he can rapid fire his unique brand of cranky observational humor. black is terrific here, frankly telling the kids what life is really like (his expletive-laden final line is hysterical) and providing the adult face to the bogus university for the parents.but long has to carry most of the film, and he does so, in spades; bartleby is easily identified with and we take to him almost immediately. a nice twist was provided by columbus short's character hands, an athlete who loses his scholarship due to an injury and ends up becoming the de facto art faculty at the fake college. also noteworthy as bartleby's hyper-intelligent and sarcastic little sister is hannah marks.yes, the film does feel familiar in some spots; there's a debt here owed, of all places, to revenge of the nerds. those who are rejected by everyone else find a home with bartleby and his cohorts, and of course the villains are steroid-enhanced conformist master race types who run a fraternity (well, okay, frats are evil) and seek to humiliate and bury the oddballs for the ¬ñ gasp ¬ñ crime of being different. but that aside, accepted has fun with the material, and even asks a few decent questions about the expectations on college kids and the course of higher education. not that it's a brain teaser by any means, but accepted isn't just another mindless teen comedy (or owen wilson vehicle). it's a funny, clever 90 minutes that, while not a great departure from its genre, is intelligent and creative enough to be very enjoyable.there is at least one moment of unadulterated brilliance in the film, when bartleby checks out a nearby college in an attempt to harvest ideas for his own school's curriculum. when he sees that the kids are all stressed out at the other school (several refuse to even talk to him during class for fear of missing something), he shakes his head, thinking that there must be a better way. as he moves to leave he is met by a stream of kids going the other way, one person moving against a human tide, while in the background, the opening lines of eleanor rigby play. perhaps an unplanned moment of brilliance, but brilliance none the less.

from the creators of bruce almighty and liar liar! the film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as i expected this was a run-along america pie flick. but it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his own college, running it accordingly. as you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. bartleby gaines (justin long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.' the humour was varied which i loved. all the cast delivered fantastic performances-- hire this one out with a friend, it's a bloody crack up!

i went in to this thinking another gross movie with gross humor. telling from my first sentence i don't like that humor and this movie had it's moments but i loved it. justin long has really never done comedy like this, where he's sarcastic and clever and i loved it. lewis black....enough said. the ending i really did love because it had to take itself seriously i mean how else would you end it? yes it's another underdog story but not in your typical format and the movie wasn't their ups and downs, it was people coming together for one common goal, to go to college where they were accepted. the cast was amazing and yes i did laugh at loud when i didn't think i would and the laughter lasted longer then i thought to. the parents and sister played their roles well but their characters are put in when necessary. the movie was not focused around them but at the same time they showed up when you expect and not expect them to. they played in to the story very well, and i loved the familiar faces anthony heald(boston public), jeremy howard (i) (galaxy quest with justin long) ross patterson (the new guy)and sam horrigan (brink). blake lively added her certain something to the movie which made it even more enjoyable, as well as b's friends. i recommend this movie to whoever hated those gross comedies of the last 4 years and really want something with humor and an actually story line!~!

an interesting movie based on three of jules verne's novels. considering the special effects and computer enhanced animation of today, this movie stands as an historic marker of cinematic resourcefulness and imagination. karel zeman has brought to life the lithographic images of the original jules verne texts. this is a must see for classic science fiction and history buffs.i give this movie 9 out of 10. enjoy!!

like the first film in this series (slaughter, 1972), i think it would be a mistake to just label this a "blaxsploitation film". sure, slaughter is a tough, gun-toting, black man but it's more of an action picture regardless of the color of the leading man or the bad guys--and a very good action picture at that.for the second and final time, jim brown plays the title character. the film begins with one of the goofiest scenes i can remember in a film. as slaughter and his friends are enjoying an outdoor party, along comes a biplane and begins spraying the group with machine gun fire! no, slaughter isn't so tough that he then shoots down the plane with his .357! but slaughter is ticked and no one is sure why this hit was happened--however, slaughter is going to get to the bottom of it! well, it turns out that the hit was attempted in retribution for the last movie. in it, slaughter takes on the mafia and kicks lots of butt down in mexico. now, in a horribly bungled and clumsy attempt, the guys in the plane kill and injure quite a few people but miss slaughter. and, because the job was bungled so badly, the mob boss (ed macmahon!!) orders the pilot and gunman killed by his brutal assassin (don stroud--in a very typical sort of role for him). stroud is great--scary and nasty to the core, but ed macmahon as the boss?! wow, that's an interesting twist! slaughter is now stumped. he figured out who the two guys were in the plane but by the time he got to them, they were dead. so, to help him along in his own private vendetta, brock peters (who plays a cop) tells him who the mobsters are who ordered the hit and got slaughter to agree to help by doing some illegal undercover work. so, slaughter and his pimp friend break into the mobster's mansion and steal a list of payoffs to key government and police officials. and, naturally, there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in the process.stroud isn't about to let slaughter get away with this and kidnaps slaughter's girlfriend. now it's a standoff--slaughter has the list but if he doesn't give it back, the lady is dead. being a tough but gallant man, you might just be able to guess much of what happens next.the action is very good in the film and jim brown is menacing and tough. the only negative i noticed was that while having macmahon play this nasty boss, at the end, he simply folded--and way too quickly. when slaughter catches up to him, macmahon becomes a wimp and all the previous nastiness disappears--and this is too much of a clich√© and inconsistent. still, despite this minor quibble, it's an engaging film that is not for the kids due to all the violence and boobs.

this film promises much but delivers little. the basic problem has to do with the inclusion of charlotte gainsbourg's character in this film. immigrants from sicily did not need a redheaded anglo in any way--the movie may have needed her, but new citizens certainly did not. in my opinion,the decision to include her destroys the continuity of the film. this is particularly troubling since it seems to demean not only the characters in the movie, but also the history of immigration itself. immigrants themselves were heroic figures, fully capable of getting along without having to satisfied what i believer to be a veiled image of "the white man's burden." i wonder if someone will make a movie of irish immigrants which will include a sicilian woman as a major character. the left elbow index considers seven aspects of film--acting, production sets, dialogue, artistry, film continuity, plot, and character development--on a scale from high of 10 for excellent, 5 for average, and 1 for needs help. both film continuity and plot rate a low of 1. the continuity as discussed above is further degraded by the surrealistic ending. does not a film of such important historical significance deserve more than a conclusion which reminds one of marc chagall? the plot is simple enough, until it seems to become entangled with too much time in the old country, too little time on the ship, and too much emphasis on the ending. the acting and character development is average since all the characters are fixed throughout the film, and the inclusion of the anglo-saxon speaking perfect english almost turns the movie into a satire. where's groucho when you need him? the production sets, the dialogue and the artistry are very good, each rating a 10. the sets in sicily, on the ship, and on ellis island are as good as one can find. the dialogue is marvelous, and the ethic singing is superb. i agree with scorsese that listening to the sicilian dialect is a pleasure. note that the immigrants speak of "america", not the "united states"--the ideal vs. the political reality. the are many good artistic scenes, with dreams of america, gold coins raining, and giant veggies among the best. the average left elbow index is 5.25, raised to a 7.0 when equated with the imdb scale. one other notion seems to run through ellis island experience: the tribulations of pass immigrants was grueling, later, in 2006, one only had to pay a coyote or boat owner and sneak into the county under the darkness of night, no questions asked! the movie is worth seeing, but it appears that what one sees is problematical.

this film played in lexington ky for 7 days. i saw it on the last day of its run & regretted that i could not recommend it to others because this is a film that cries out for the big screen experience. the aerial shot where the crowded ship pulls away from the equally crowded dock is a masterpiece as is the scene where the two lead characters flirt on deck--almost a ballet and sexier in its suggestiveness than so many more explicit films these days. i just cringe to think that more people won't have the opportunity to see this fine film in a theater; the dvd experience will not be the same. here's an idea: if you live in a college town, see if you can lobby for it to show up in a campus film festival.

this is a film notable for what is not shown as much as for what is. what is shown is the incredible poverty in sicily as the 19th century gave way to the 20th, a life style that made people dream of the 'new' world of america. the mancuso family live in a place that is not even a hamlet, just a stone cottage set amid the harsh, unyielding stones of a country that cannot offer even a single blade of green grass. an opening sequence sees the mancuso males scrambling barefoot up a craggy hillside, stones in their mouth to offer at a shrine at the top in exchange for a 'sign' that they should set out for the new world or remain where they are. it further shows life aboard the liner, huddled masses indeed, yearning to breathe free, and conditions in ellis island where, their journey still not over, they are interrogated and examined to prove their 'fitness' to enter america. what is not shown is the ship in longshot, or indeed any shot that would identify it as a large, ocean-going liner; what is also not shown is anything that would identify america, no clich√© view of new york harbour and the statue of liberty, so that ellis island could be anywhere in any country. perhaps the most remarkable shot is the one from a camera crane looking down on hundreds of people jammed together; slowly, almost imperceptibly two thirds of the people at screen left begin to separate from the third at screen right and we realize that those on the left are actually aboard the ship and those on the right are on the dock, a powerful statement of society being fragmented. there's a strong documentary feel throughout as though we were following an actual ship full of immigrants even though it has been carefully scripted and is clearly an amalgam of typical families/conditions at the time. with almost nothing happening in dramatic terms it's not for the popcorn brigade at the multiplex but for the rest of us it's a very fine film indeed.

"nuovomondo" was a great experience. many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. emanuele crialese directs his film very visually driven. for everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. particularly european cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young us-american directors are strongly influenced by that). crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me. it has also a very interesting topic that is wrapped up in a quite unusual story and told with humour. vincenzo amato is outstanding as family head salvatore, as well as the amazing charlotte gainsbourg, who i enjoy watching in every single one of her movies. there are many great sequences in this movie. just to pick one: when the ship leaves italy and the people just quietly stare. this scene is great, particularly if you consider the pop cultural references that go with it (titanic!).

the golden door is the story of a sicilian family's journey from the old world (italy) to the new world (america). salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. in short, they believe that by risking everything for the new world their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. the imagery of the new world is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative. silver coins rain from heaven upon salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he'll be in the new world; carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health, and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the new world will yield. all of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience. the contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the sicilian people helps provide hope while they're aboard the ship to the new world.the voyage to the new world is shot almost in complete darkness, especially when the seas tempests roar and nearly kill the people within. the dark reality i referred to is the old world and the journey itself to the new world. the old world is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive. this is shown as salvatore scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has left (donkeys, goats and rabbits) in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the new world. i thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the new world; it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit. the most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the new world. this shot shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another, depicting the separation between the old and new worlds. this shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar, wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were desirous to enter a world that held more promise.as later contrasted to how the new world visually looks, the old world seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy new world. i thought it was particularly interesting that the statue of liberty is never shown through the fog at ellis island, but is remained hidden. i think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the statue of liberty stands for: "give me your poor, your tired, your hungry" seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the new world. once they arrived in the americas, they had to go through rather humiliating tests (i.e. delousing, mathematics, puzzles, etc.) in order to prove themselves as fit for the new world. these tests completely changed the perspectives of the sicilian people. in particular, salvatore's mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the new world, feeling more violated than treated with respect. where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the new world would provide, the reality of what the new world required was disparaging and rude. salvatore doesn't change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the new world would be like versus what the new world actually was seemed disappointing to him. this attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him. their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted.the film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society. cleanliness, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. adhering to these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. perhaps this is a commentary on how america has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct. though the rules seemed rigid, they were there to protect and help the people flourish.

"nuovomondo (2006)" (shown in the u.s. as "the golden door") was written and directed by emanuele crialese. this film is different--and, i think, better--than most movies about impoverished people who leave europe and come to the united states.the film begins with scenes in a poor, rural region of sicily. we always hear that sicily is a rocky island, but you won't really understand the implications of that phrase until you see the first half-hour of "the golden door." the middle section of the film is devoted to the long voyage to the u.s. most immigration films show us ten minutes of people in the third-class section becoming seasick, and then show us the statue of liberty. not this movie--we get a sense for life below decks, and it isn't charming. (we never actually see the statue of liberty, either.) finally, the typical movie will give us another ten minutes of ellis island, and then the immigrants are walking through new york's lower east side. not here--the ellis island experience occupies about one-third of the footage. vincenzo amato is outstanding as salvatore mancuso, who is bringing his two sons and his mother to the new world. charlotte gainsbourg is equally good as lucy reed, a mysterious englishwoman who also speaks fluent italian.there are some strange touches in the movie, especially the sound track with songs by nina simone. there must be some symbolism there, but i couldn't make sense of it.another reviewer has already pointed out that this film will do better viewed in a theater rather than on dvd. still, large screen or small screen, it's worth seeking out.

some days ago, in rome, a young romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. a romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.i'm only 15, but i thought: what idea of affluence does italy give to these poor people? how ever do they regard us as the land of plenty? yesterday evening i finally saw nuovomondo, and my question had an answer. when you have only a donkey and some goats, those propaganda postcards showing united states as a land with milk rivers and huge vegetables, makes such an impression.nuovomondo is really a must-see film. it balances an ethereal symbolism (milk rivers, glances' play, hard and rocky mountains, the name and character lucy/luce) and a cruel realism (the mass of hopeful people on the ship, the procedures at ellis island). there's a mixed cast, going from the angelic charlotte gainsbourg to the realistic vincenzo amato, till a bitter and smashing aurora quattrocchi as the mother. but was it really so hard to enter in the new world?

sadly, this movie is relegated to 'curio' status it seems. many people that i've asked "did you know the monkees made a movie?" usually answer 'no.' that being said, if you are one of that large number, i recommend you see it, but with the following caveat(s): if you expect monkey style humor, it is in there. it's just not all over the place like the tv shows.yes, they are trying to break their tv mold a bit by poking fun at it like a bunch of no-longer-teenagers who have been on the short end of a lot of sticks.no, you don't have to be inebriated to enjoy it.no, you don't have to be inebriated to understand it.if you like classics, you'll love the interspersed clips throughout.if you like the psychedelic era, you'll love some of the cameos.if you are a monkees fan, you might recognize some of the jabs they are taking at the heavy commercializing of the band.in the nigh-immortal words of one of my best friends after seeing 5 minutes of it: "this is a weird movie, man." in fact it might be better if you don't try to understand it, just sit back and react to it. it's weird, it's funny, it's a bit surreal, it's experimental (still)...it is many things. overall, it is an experience.

to experience head you really need to understand where the monkees were when they filmed it.this was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. their inventive and comedic series (sort of an american idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.this is their take on their "manufactured image" and status as the 2nd tier beatles. they always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.it is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (i have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.see it with an open mind.

i can't believe this isn't a huge cult hit. perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the monkees as a silly factory-made pop band rip-off of the beatles, refused to see it. that cynicism probably covered it from sight ever since. don't make this mistake. _head_ is an amazing film that most open minded people will appreciate. it is very funny and very intelligent (and very trippy).

the cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. starting with both "breathless" and underground american cinema (such as kenneth anger), films became more and more experimental. all of this accumulated when hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with "easy rider". one of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially. "head" was made when the monkees career was seriously waning, which is what damned one of the best psychedelic films ever made.the plot? well, there really isn't one, as many have said. it involves the monkees going from one surreal scenario to the next one. however, these sequences are all obviously lsd-tinged and basically mock how the monkees were sick of being confined to their light pre-fab reputation. its a shame that the film found no audience. the teeny boppers who loved them had moved onto a new fad as they always do. the psychedelic / haight-ashbury crowd to whom the film was garnered would never be caught dead at a monkees movie. its all their loss. this film may be plot less, but it is certainly not without meaning and is very intelligently put together. the crew later made both "easy rider" and "five easy pieces". the film was later revived at a 1973 raybert retrospective and it gained a very positive response, which granted it the cult following it had deserved for a long time. ironically, the monkees would fall victim to the same commercialism they protested in this film with their later 80s reunion. (10/10)

this all-but-ignored masterpiece is about the monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie (head), and that everything they do or say had already been written in an (unseen) script they seem to be following. head was written by jack nicholson, rafelson, and peter tork during a three-day lsd trip in a suite at an expensive hollywood hotel. the other three monkees only acted in it.they fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script. they deliberately flub their lines, walk off sets, tear up scenery, punch other actors for no reason; and ultimately, commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. for instance, in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene, if you watch frame-by-frame, you can see rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman, very deliberately shooting into a mirror. he is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the director yells "cut!"the monkees, however, never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are. that ends up being the core of the revelation soon to come.at every turn, they realize their increasingly-bizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they can't escape being in. you say they went crazy and walked through the sky (which turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the set's background)? no problem! hey, hey, they're the monkees, and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around! in the end, even their deaths did not set them free. that was how the movie was supposed to end, and their motionless, waterlogged bodies are fished out of the river, put in another box, and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio production.this is made all the more poignant by the fact that the monkees really are fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world. they did it through the power of their music.ironically, near the end, peter tork has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem, but unfortunately, no one listens. peter realizes: "it doesn't matter if we're in the box (the film)". he means that it doesn't matter if will is free or illusory, and that "the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur... you need to just let 'now' happen, as it happens", without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is "valid" by some abstract definition.when you can't even tell the difference, will being free or not doesn't matter--tying to figure out if you are the "real" you is just a pointless waste of time.i saw this film at a very important time in my life. i was trying to figure out how to escape being just "that geeky, creepy nerd girl" by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun (i.e., sex) like everyone else did. but the revelation in head broke my self-imposed recursive trap and helped me more than rafelson or nicholson or tork will ever know.for decades, i've watched "head" and wished i could thank pete.was this a good movie?uhh, how about, like...==< yes >==

forget easy rider - head is the film about the 1960s.almost laugh: as the monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute tv commercial about dandruff! see: the 50 foot victor mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film! hear: frank zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell davey jones "your music is awfully white"! experience: the monkees' only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (circle sky)! listen: as davey jones sings a harry nielsen song about having a transsexual father! be confused: be very confused, as confused as terri garr is when mickey dolenz makes sexual innuendos about her in her film debut! witness: futile protests against the vietnam war leap out of nowhere and just as quickly disappear! watch: mike nesmith spit on christmas while wearing a velvet victorian smoking jacket in a cobwebbed gothic horror-movie sound-stage! let yourself drift: into the karmic bliss inspired by a comic-book version of indian mysticism delivered by a hammy white character-actor in black-face, while peter tork pretends that he knows how to play a guitar! discover: academy award winning director bob rafelson's first feature length film, as written by academy award winning actor jack nicholson! pretend it's not happening: when the monkees commit group suicide by jumping off the golden gate bridge! take drugs - take a lot of drugs: take as many drugs as the cast and crew evidently did while making this film!with head, the monkees revealed themselves as the angriest, snottiest entertainers in hollywood history, bar none. it is bewildering to discover that they blamed the failure of this film on bad promo. to be sure, the promotion was virtually non-existent; but did they not recognize how angry, how down-right depressing, how self-destructive this film actually is?! i mean, this film is a trip - on bad acid - to the suicide ward of a mental hospital. the only film i know to be this depressing is terry gilliam's brazil; and like brazil, this film reveals why life in the later 20th century was almost unbearable - if you were lucky. it's not simply that western culture was suffering from serious information-overload, but the information itself was just bad, bad, more bad, and dismal. in fact, it was the overload effect itself that kept people going, since this allowed people to keep distracting themselves with one crisis or another - if news from vietnam became too much to bear, they could turn the channel and watch a documentary on the rising unemployment rate.the "positive" response to the reality revealed in head was woodstock - three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and bugs and bad food and dirty drink and poop and pee and bad acid and peter townsend almost killing abbie hoffman. all taking place behind a steel fence, under the lovingly watchful eyes of a veritable army of ny state troopers - meaning that the "freedom" of woodstock nation was as illusory as the song john sebastion thought he was singing while so strung out he could barely speak. "500,000 assholes too stupid to come in out of the rain," was one critic's judgment on woodstock (i think it was andy warhol). the one good thing occurring there was jimi hendrix's star spangled banner. two years previously, the jimi hendrix experience had gone on their first national tour of america, as the warm-up band opening for - the monkees. see, it's all connected somehow.you owe it to yourself - nay, you owe it to your unborn children - to see the real 1960s, only to be found on film in this bizarre, miraculous, and utterly absurd tribute to one of the more interesting capitalist scams of the later 20th century.

the beatles had just done 'magical mystery tour.' there was the general feel that performance, peace and drugs went together naturally. in la, there was a film subculture that knew something was up. nicholson was in several of these gangs.before he decided to seriously become an actor, before 'easy rider,' before 'pink flamingos,' before 'day for night,' there were several experiments with what to do about this. an important one is 'saragossa manuscript.' this is another.jack writes. he plays with circular narrative, self-reference, film reference, performance self-loathing, the pain of creation, all on the outskirts of safe kiddiepop. you must see this, if only to know something about jack.certain actors act by digging into themselves. it is a common technique. some dig deep, but after a while, they become boring because they are incredibly shallow people. there isn't just enough stuff in there to sustain a career. think of deniro and hackman.others are pretty interesting people, who seem to become more interesting over time. when they dig into the barrel, they put stuff back in because of the pain of the digging. think sean penn and jack. at the bottom of jack's barrel, at the end of the thread he spins, as the base of every character is this experimental, risky writer/filmmaker.who cares if it is a bad movie? it is bad because it took risks. watch when a tear is wiped from annette's cheek by the director. it is a loving goof on the whole brando thing, something that i heard marlon laughed about. that is one of the richest moments in hollywood film history.there's another reason to watch this. music in film is has a strong root in dance. revolution in film often relies on music. whole cultures are thus swept along.an unsung giantess in inventing how billions now dance is toni basil. she was as influential in pop choreography as the beatles were in music. she was already well into her career when called upon to work on this. but this is one of her earliest screen appearances. you can see her work throughout and she herself in the pretty cool 'daddy's girl' segment, over one of nilsson's better songs. (followed by the frank zappa cameo.) mccartney would reference this scene in his teevee special years later.a third reason to watch is early (about 6 1/2 minutes) in the film: a character named 'lady pleasure' kisses each monkey in a long continuous shot and then dismissively departs. she is credited as i. j. jefferson but is really mimi manchu, nicholson's lover at the time and lsd partner. red hair, psychedelic demeanor. lovely. that scene says it all for me, about how jack feels about the boys.ted's evaluation -- 3 of 3: worth watching.

i will admit, i had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, i felt like many did. i was expecting a monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead i was given... well, i didn't know what i was given to be honest.however, after finally watching this film, i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, i also found myself watching it over and over again. it's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as i try to attempt to decipher it's meanings. and just when i think i've figured out something in the film, it's answer is destroyed once i watch the film again. brilliance indeed.it seems that most people who disliked this film are wanting to watch a film with primarily a clear plot. they want everything explained and all questions answered in the finale. well sorry, if that's what you're wanting, this is not the movie for you. but if you liked movies like the matrix (and better yet, their sequels) i think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.think of the film being like a dream. in our dreams, things make no sense, things we expect to happen don't, people places and things don't speak, act or function in the same way they do in reality. to complain about "head" is like complaining about a dream you've had that you felt you could not understand. the mind is a complex system, and being that a film titled "head" is just as complex, is it that difficult to relate the two?the music (and musical numbers) really stand out, especially peter tork's two compositions, which remain the best tracks in the film, "can you dig it?" and "long title: do i have to do this all over again?"this film proves that the monkees were much more than just four zanny guys in a 'pre-fab' group (as their critics called them) on a television show, but that they are actually much more intelligent and talented than the world would give them credit for. there's so many messages that can be derived from the film, both in regards to the monkees and to the 'entertainment industry' in general, that it stands as a masterpiece of film-making that was far ahead of it's time.i feel, had this film been released as an independent piece at this point and time, it would actually garner the respect and admiration it deserves.and one finale note:one could compare this to the beatles "magical mystery tour" film, since the beatles film appeared to be just as strange and bizarre. however, in my opinion, "head" stands far above anything the beatles put on celluloid.

you would really need to remember the monkees and have a clear understanding as to where and how they fitted into the second half of the 1960s in order to fully appreciate this movie.there is no plot as such. basically, it's a crazy, mixed up pastiche of various, unrelated sequences. but, it is interesting and entertaining in its own peculiar way once you get onto its wavelength. in short, it was a classic, cleverly conceived and well crafted example of late '60s experimental cinema. it contains some good songs, some ultra-groovy cinematography and plenty of other worthwhile ideas in terms of film technique.i give it 7 out of 10 for several reasons. first, it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox movie in the commercial mainstream where both its stars and its producers were firmly ensconced at the time. if a feature movie flops at the box office, the consequences can be dire for all concerned. secondly, it was, for the most part, a creative success. and, finally, as already mentioned, it is, unquestionably, a classic of the genre and, as such, it is now historically important.unfortunately, "head" came too late in the monkees career. but, there again, they would not have been allowed to make it earlier on because it was essentially a very pointed and cynical satire of their own image. clearly, the members of the group knew, only too well, that the whole monkees juggernaut had just about run its race when they started work on this project. in a way, it was to be their swan song and they were determined to let it all hang out. they were tired of being treated like mere pawns in the high powered corporate game in which they had been manipulated and exploited over the preceding few years. in short, they "wanted out" and they were going to say a few things before they left.history, however, has vindicated the band. let the critics be damned. the monkees, left behind some of the best, most polished and successful pop records of the decade. yes, they had plenty of help. but at the end of the day, they stood in front of the studio mikes, they fronted the movie and tv cameras and they did the concerts. they were fun and just a little bit crazy. but, unlike some of their contemporaries, they were never threatening. you could safely introduce a monkey to your elderly aunt."head" probably borrows a bit too heavily from the beatles "hard day's night" but it's still worth another look for those who were around at the time or for younger retrophiles who have the ability to appreciate its significance.enjoy!

"i am ... proud of 'head'," mike nesmith has said. he should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.yes, it's unconventional. to many, frustrating. it's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: "you figure it out."you probably already know that the monkees tv show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. tv shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain. that the monkees broke out of the box for a short time to make "head" is a testament to the group's popularity and importance in pop culture, despite where your head's at. get one thing straight: "head" is not the monkees tv show.so what we have here is a "psychedelic documentary" about western pop culture from a source that has authority on the subject. "head" is a movie that could only come from those "inside the box". by 1968, the monkees' cast and crew were seasoned and weary professionals who had seen their share of promise and disappointment. the movie was a deliberate attempt at market repositioning. so, it did three things: make a film the way the monkees envisioned. most importantly, reinvent the group to one not subservient to it's old bosses - and yas, hipper than before. make a film that exposed american attitudes of information dissemination."head", therefore, really is about media manipulation and its net result: deception. the mass media is supposed to inform, educate us on the happenings in the world at large, and ultimately asks us to form opinions of these events that can shape thought into positive action. thus we assume the information we absorb to be complete and unbiased - otherwise, how can one establish a valued conclusion on any one idea presented by a book, newspaper or tv show? in one of the street interviews in "head", a guy admits, "i haven't looked at a newspaper or tv in years." is he lesser or better the man? even the drug parallels are a soft veiling of "things are not as they seem." remember the old joke, "everything you know is wrong"? the screenplay starts with the monkees' public admission of it's own "manufactured image" and runs with the football - literally. is the football scene in the movie a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind "head"? is the film a stream-of-consciousness exercise? is the film the culmination of pot smoking marathons? there are too many coincidences that occur in the film that suggest otherwise. my guess is that "head" is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intended and unintended.largely, the insiders responsible for "head" seem to enjoy themselves in the revelries that take place in the film, but there is anger - anger at the chaos that characterized the late '60s and anger at the way the media, television especially, had changed culture in negative ways. drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late '60s and still are, but the producers of "head" want you to know that poor "information" is a far greater danger.wars have been attributed to hoaxes and lies. what perfect way to spread disinformation than through tv? repeatedly, the mysterious black box is seen as an obstacle to the monkees and seemingly, all of us as well. in one scene, peter is sullenly sitting in a saloon holding a melting ice cream cone, and is asked by a fellow monkey, "what's wrong?" "i bought this ice cream cone and i don't want it." the movie suggests that the first purpose of the media is not to inform, but to sell en mass blindly. "head" goes further: put any idea into someone's head, and merrily goes he.the filmmakers know this, and the danger is real. "head" is either a movie that creates itself "as we go along", or is a deliberate statement. perhaps, perhaps not. maybe it is just "pot meets advertising", as critics scathed in 1968. the jokes are on the monkees and us. be careful what you ask for, you may get it.cheers: a true guilty pleasure. very funny. intelligent. will please the fans. find the substance, it's there. unabashedly weird. bizarre collection of characters. good tunage. length is appropriate. lots of great one liners, including my all time prophetic favorite: "the tragedy of your times, my young friends, is that you may get exactly what you want."caveats: dated. drugs. no plot. no linear delivery of any thought in particular. at least twenty-five stories that interweave in stop-and- go fashion. so, may easily frustrate. may seem pretentious to some. people who can't stand the monkees need not watch, though that in itself is no reason to avoid it. the psychedelic special effects may kill your ailing picture tube or your acid burnt- out eyeballs.match, cut.

"head" is one of those films you'll have a lot of trouble convincing your friends to see, but once they do they'll fall in love with it. i don't know how many times this has happened to me. this film is just so funny and bizarre, really a deconstruction of everything the monkees had been up to this point in their career. a lot the credit goes to bob rafelson who pretty much ended the monkee's career with this film. my guess is he wanted to get out of directing the tv show and get into features, which he did in a big way after this one. micky dolenz is absolutely hilarious. i can't believe he didn't have a second life as a comic actor after this film. this film has a lot of great cameos and a lot of wonderful psychedelic nonsense. i feel like the reputation of this film is continuing to build and it wouldn't surprise me if it eventually becomes a full on cult classic

this is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. my wife has never seen it, and when i just rewatched it last night, i waited until after she went to bed. she might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but i know she would have had enough within ten minutes.head has nothing like a conventional story. the film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. it could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres. if you're not a big fan of those things--psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernism and the "acid trip aesthetic" (assuming there's a difference between them), you should probably stay away from this film. on the other hand if you are a fan of that stuff, you need to run out and buy head now if you haven't already.oddly, the film has never received much respect. that probably has a lot to do with preconceptions. after all, it does star the monkees--micky dolenz, davy jones, michael nesmith and peter tork--and the monkees were a musical group of actors put together by producers bob rafelson and bert schneider to be a kid-friendly, bubble-gummy beatles for a television series. in their era, they had as much respect as, say, menudo, new kids on the block, the spice girls, and so on. as a fellow imdb reviewer rightly notes--"perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the monkees as a silly factory-made pop band rip-off of the beatles, refused to see (head)".the monkees and head have never been quite able to shed that negative public perception. it's a shame, because there was a lot of talent, both musically and otherwise, in the monkees. it's probably odder that rafelson, who directs here and co-produces with schneider, and jack nicholson (yes, _that_ jack nicholson), who wrote the script and also co-produces, decided to take the monkees in this unusual direction. it's as if new kids on the block suddenly put out an album equivalent to pink floyd's ummagumma (1969) or atom heart mother (1970). in fact, the songs in head, written by the monkees and frequent collaborators such as carole king and harry nilsson, have a floyd-like quality, somewhere between the syd barrett era and the immediate post-barrett era. this is much more prominent than any beatles similarity. some people have complained about the music in the film, but to me, all the songs are gems. for that matter, some people dislike barrett era (or other) floyd, which is just as difficult for me to empathize with.but what _is_ head about? the basic gist is just that the monkees are taking a trip through various film genres--there are war scenes, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comedy scenes, drama scenes, western scenes, sci-fi scenes, romance scenes, and on and on. except, in the film's reality, this turns out to be happening primarily (if not exclusively) on a studio lot. at root, we're watching the monkees shoot a film. of course all of the scenes in the various genres have something surreal and self-referential about them, and they, and individual shots within a scene, tend to lead to one another using dream logic not dissimilar to the monty python television show. as a dream, head tends to vacillate between a good dream and a nightmare, while often being one that would cause you to laugh in your sleep (something that i frequently do, by the way).technically, rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to realize the above. there are scenes with extensive negative images, there are a lot of very fast cuts (including a great sequence that features davy jones and tony basil dancing alternately in a white and a black room, wearing a combination of white and black reversed in each, that occasionally toggles back and forth as quickly as two frames at a time), there are a lot of bizarre segues, there is an animated cow mouth, there are odd editing devices, and so on. for my money, i wish this stuff wasn't just a relic of the psychedelic era. this is the kind of artistic approach i relish. it seemed like a good idea back then and i still think it's a good idea. i'd like to see films like the life aquatic with steve zissou using (2004) using these types of extended techniques. now that would make that film surreal.interpretationally, some folks who aren't so in tune with the acid trip aesthetic have complained that it's basically b.s. to offer meanings for something intended to not have any. i disagree with such a pessimistic/nihilistic view; head was intended to have a lot of meaning(s), and it's not just films without conventional plots that have multiple interpretations. nicholson, rafelson and schneider have a lot of interesting things to say about the monkees--the film postmodernistically comments on their manufactured status; pop stardom--way before pink floyd, head conflates pop stardom and violence, from images of war to images of fans cannibalistically dismantling their idols; and na√Øve u.s.-oriented ideas of international perceptions and respect--well-armed foreigners in a desert surrender to micky dolenz just because he's an american, then later they blow up a coke machine (again in the desert) for him because he's thirsty and can't gain access. the film comments on many other topics--from big industry to police, surveys, spectatorship (especially in relation to tragedies), and on and on. head is full of ideas, appropriately enough, with intelligent, multifaceted things to say about them.head deserves to be considered a classic--it's basically shooting for the same vibe as the beatles' yellow submarine. both premiered in november of 1968, interestingly enough, and both were intended as something of a summation of the psychedelic aesthetic. yellow submarine wasn't quite successful. head is everything yellow submarine should have been.

after winning a championship fight, boxer john garfield (as johnnie bradfield) celebrates with a drinking binge, which leads to the manslaughter of a pushy reporter. although his manager killed the man, mr. garfield is blamed. when the manager dies in a car crash, wearing garfield's stolen watch, authorities think the boxer is dead. still a wanted man, garfield changes his identity to "jack dorney" and moves to an arizona ranch. there, garfield meets "the dead end kids": billy halop (as tommy), bobby jordan (as angel), leo gorcey (as spit), huntz hall (as dippy), gabriel dell (as t.b.), and bernard punsly (as milt).garfield bonds with the young "dead end" lads, who were sent to stay with sweet "grandma rafferty" (may robson) as an alternative to reform school, courtesy of her brother, deceased priest "father rafferty". garfield falls in love with halop's sister, pretty "peggy" (gloria dickson), who is there to keep any eye on the kids. of course, garfield's past comes back to haunt him¬Ö "john garfield and the 'dead end' kids" make beautiful (max steiner) music together, thanks to effective direction and photography, by busby berkeley and james wong howe. the story is predictably comfortable, with the warner brothers support team in fine form. garfield and the "dead end" kids are a winning combination; although garfield made no further movies with the "east side" gang, the studio had him re-team with both billy halop and bobby jordan, almost immediately, for "dust be my destiny".the boxing scenes are nicely staged. but, the most exciting sequence has garfield and four of the new york "kids" (halop, jordan, hall, and punsly) climbing into a giant water tank for a swim - which unexpectedly puts their lives in danger. other, more brief, highlights include floozy ann sheridan (as goldie), boozy barbara pepper (as budgie), and young ronald sinclair (as douglas) losing at strip poker.******** they made me a criminal (1/21/39) busby berkeley ~ john garfield, billy halop, bobby jordan

this is one of those movies that you just don't want to end. the characters are rich like a well woven tapestry. colorful costumes, music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a boarding house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the vietnam war. a young man is taken in by a dynamic, big-hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on his experiences.i couldn't believe this was a made for television film. it was so well executed. s. epatha merkerson is wonderful as nanny and she brings so much life to this role. you want to be right there amongst her boarders.i enjoyed this film so much i bought the dvd.

i had heard of john garfield, but, didn't know him. i loved this movie. i had never heard of it. i just picked it up randomly. john garfield is a boxer in the movie. he had been in real life also so he knew his part. he was a fugitive throughout the movie. someone else killed a man. he character was blamed. he is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. all sorts of minor plots ensue. my favorite was the scary swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and one dead end kid couldn't swim, and none of them could get out.john's character saves the day. the dead end kids were great as his friends and followers. one of them right to the very end. ann sheridan played the family's daughter and john's eventual love interest. she was believable, but not lovable in my opinion-the only weak link in the movie.

whoever plays the part of j. douglas williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. he apparently received no credits. too bad.all the dead end kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. it is odd to watch them in a western setting with their brooklyn accents ( i guess that should be bowery ). they even show some swimming abilities.i think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. my favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film. busby berkeley shows his dance movie expertise when john garfield shifts his feet and as we watch that move, the camera moves up to his face. i will not give away why or when, but the look on his face at that point probably brought the 1939 audience to its feet in the theaters.some will think john garfield looks a lot like frank sinatra in many scenes. just his face. actually frank was not yet making movies so maybe frank looked like john. the boxer named smith in the movie looks like a clone of ed begley, jr.now i must tell you something that is not a spoiler, but if you watch the movie, watch grandma's hands. may robson does her part well. she seems to have hands that wander a bit. in a scene where she and a crowd go into the boxer's (john garfield) dressing room, watch where she touches the reclining john garfield while he is wearing only his trunks.a great ending. lots of wonderful characters.best line might be at the gas station, "...eight gallons, that's a dollar twenty-eight..." tom willett

very good 1939 film where john garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he has committed a murder. trouble is that the killer and garfield's girl, ann sheridan, in a brief but good performance, get killed while trying to elude the police.a crooked attorney persuades garfield to flee n.y. he lands in arizona and meets up with the dead end kids.. they've been sent there by a funding program to keep them out of further trouble.of course, garfield finds a new love interest but must conceal his identity as everyone thinks he was not only the killer but was the victim in the car crash.may robson is fabulous as the grandma type running the place for the wayward youth. claude rains is also effective in the role of the detective who suspects that garfield is still alive and pursues him when a picture is snapped of him in arizona.the film really deals with garfield's relation to the boys. while the ending is good, you want to see garfield go back to n.y. to proclaim his innocence.

as a fan of old warner brothers gangster movies i had to check this out,its the 2nd best movie in the adventure classics dvd set that also had one of my favorite movies;scott of the antarctic on it.this was made in 1939 a good year for a lot of warner brothers movies,it boasts a great cast;john garfield,claude rains,ann sheridan,and the dead end kids,who would be later known as the bowery boys at monogram pictures. well a boxer(garfield)gets framed for a murder he did'nt commit and is on the run and being tailed by a tough new york detective(claude rains) he ends up at a fruit picking place run by a pretty woman(gloria dickson)and the dead end kids(huntz hall,leo gorcey,benard punsley, billy halop,bobby jordan,gabreil dell)he later returns to boxing but tries to keep a low profile.this was directed by famed director busby berkley who directed timeless classics like 42nd street,goldiggers of 1933,and 35,footlight parade and many others.i would like to give a shout out to platinum dvd/video for putting out a lot of good budget priced dvd's like adventure classics(see my scott of the antarctic review)i give they made me a criminal 10 out of 10,great movie. ill have to point out that i have only seen 2 john garfield movies,this one and body and soul.i thought he was a very good actor.

i wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. it's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, john garfield.garfield plays jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. he must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with gloria dickson and the dead end kids. here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? garfield was an actor ahead of his peers. before the term 'method' was even coined and before brando ever screamed 'stella!' he brings 'natural' to the screen. his earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production. also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that 'golden boy' role he so desperately wanted to covet on screen. garfield looks the type and goes the distance as a boxer, proving his acting worth.ann sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as jack's trampy girl goldie. i haven't ever thought much of sheridan, but i liked her here. she plays well off garfield. dickson's' performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with garfield. the dead end kids are here, and garfield seems their natural idol (even more so than cagney). claude rains is miscast, and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene. strange, as he always was such a reliable actor.also interesting to note is the director- busby berkeley, best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images, directs a different genre here with remarkable ease. he maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirably.a very good film that deserves greater attention 8/10.

the early films of the dead end kids (before they were re-christened "the bowery boys") were all very entertaining and well-produced films from warner brothers. despite their being rather formulaic, they still had excellent writing, acting and hold up well over time. do not confuse these with the cheap bowery boys films from monogram pictures--despite the presence of huntz hall and leo gorcey, these films were several notches below the earlier films in regard to quality.the film begins with tough-guy john garfield winning the lightweight boxing championship. unfortunately, shortly after this he's on a drunken binge and is blamed for a murder he really didn't commit. the problem is that he was so loaded that he wasn't sure he didn't kill the man, so he runs away and lives the life of a hobo. eventually, he meets up with feisty may robson and the dead end kids--as well as a lady you just know will become his girlfriend given time.where the rest of the film goes was not all that surprising, but because of the quality of the film, it doesn't seem to matter. garfield and the kids are at their best and this is a film sure to please all but the pickiest of viewers.

another enjoyable warner flick. i really liked john garfield in this, though i'm wondering why cagney wasn't in the role. perhaps it was too similar to angels with dirty faces? i mean, it's another dead end kids story of sorts too, but i really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. the boys work great with garfield. a nice sequence was the whole "swimming" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.one negative comment: claude rains was grossly miscast. as the detective, the fine actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a whorehouse.

***spoilers*** even though the movie "they made me a criminal" is nowhere as good as the later john garfield anti-hero classics like "body & soul" in 1947 "force of evil" in 1948 and his last and very underrated "he ran all the way" in 1951 it's the film that defined his career from that point onward until his untimely death on may 21, 1952 at the young age of 39. garfiled plays the part of light weight champion johnnie bradfield and later the fugitive from the law jack dorney who's innocent of the murder that he's charged with, even though he's been declared officially dead. jonnie's manager doc ward, robert "doc" gleckler, who during a drunken victory party killed reporter charles mcgee,john ridgely, who was going to expose to the public his fighter johnnie bradfield lies about him being a one women guy as well as non drinking momma's boy. doc gleckler smashed a bottle over mcgee's head killing him as jonnie was almost dead drunk with a number of women partying in his hotel suite. doc was later killed in a car crash with johnnie's girlfriend goldie, ann sheridan, but doc burned to a crisp and with johnnie's watch on him was mistaken for johnnie. told to stay dead and buried by his lawyer malvin ,robert strange, who took $9,750.00 of the $10,000.00 of johnnie's money that he had for this great piece of advice. malvin told johnnie to take on a new identity and call himself from now on jack dorney and get the hell out of the state of new york; talking about sleazy shysters. johnnie now jack dorney travels the rails from new york down to arizona ending up at the rancho rafferty date farm where most of the film takes place.if it wasn't for john garfield in the lead role as both jonnie bradfield & jack dorney the movie would have long been lost and forgotten. garfield who was only 26 at the time brought the best out of everyone in the movie. even the transported dead end kids, i guess we can call them the arizona kids here, acting were notches above what you would have expected from them and they came across as real and sensitive persons not a bunch of slap stick clowns like in almost all of their movies. all that due to being on the same stage, or filming location, with john garfield. "they made me a criminal" is a good story that has the undercover champ acting like anything but not to draw any attention on himself and end up not only behind bars but in the electric chair. in the end jack showed just what kind of man he is by not fighting the big fight and against all the odds dramatically winning at the last moment but by going four brutal rounds to get the money for his new found family at the date farm including his girl peggy, gloria dickson, to open up a gas station with it. giving the european champ gaspar rutchek, frank riggi, the fight of his life and getting $2,000.00, thats $500.00 a round, for doing it jack showed everyone who looked up to him like the "arizona kids" that sometimes taking a punch is far braver and more courageous then throwing one.the fact that jack could have easily clobbered rutched but didn't in order not to expose himself to the police, as on the loose killer johnnie bradfield. but instead went as far as he could taking everything that rutchek could throw at him to help out his friends showed more then all the fights that he won in the boxing ring put together. i for one didn't find the ending of the movie contrived at all but fitting right in with the story. the cop morty phelam, claude rains, who came to arizona from new york to arrest jack had to live with for years the fact that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair. we were told all this right at the start of the movie. why knowing that jack/johnnie was innocent of the murder that he's charged with and not knowing for sure if he'll be found innocent of it in a court of law would he want to make the same terrible mistake again? i can easily see this happening in real life why not then in the movies.

the young john garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 "they made me a criminal." celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer johnnie bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. and the whiskey.a problem develops when another couple arrives. the guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose bradfield's phony life on the front page. the manager kills the reporter and he and the floozy depart. the murder discovered, cops, later, are on the lookout for the now somnolent boxer whose car is driven by the manager with his new girlfriend-johnny's now instant ex. a police chase ends with a fiery car crash. manager and girl are dead and unrecognizable.johnny discovers that he's supposed to be a killer. but he's also presumed dead. seeking advice from a lawyer, he entrusts the counselor with the key to a bank deposit box holding his sole savings, $10,000. the lawyer later gives johnny $250 and tells him that the balance is his fee for giving him professional advice: get out of town, fast, and go far away. (i would never charge a client more than $5,000 for such pithy, succinct and wise direction.) johnny, now a freight train hopping hobo, winds up conveniently passing out at an arizona date ranch where he's nursed back to health by beautiful goldie west, ann sheridan, a fine actress whose career was in the ascendancy. taking jack dorney as his moniker, the pugilist loses some of his rough edges as he falls in love with goldie. he becomes a mentor and pal to - the dead end kids. familiar screen characters to pre-war moviegoers.a chance to make money arises when an exhibition boxer shows up challenging any suckers to last several rounds in the ring with him. it's a natural temptation for bradfield/dorney but there's a fly in the ointment. who should show up but new york detective monty phelan, the laughing stock of the department? he's been on morgue duty for ages because of a slight mistake early in his career that sent an innocent man to old sparky (we all make mistakes, don't we?) phelan recognized bradfield from a news photo and he's there to watch the fight and make the pinch. claude rains is the cop who's endured slights and barbs from his fellow officers for years.what follows is predictable but it's well acted. i hope this was a main feature when it was released-it's too good to rank as a "b" second on a marquee.busby berkeley, best known as an outstanding choreographer, directed "they made me a criminal" and max steiner, one of hollywood's all-time prolific score composers, wrote nice but not extraordinary music for the film.now available on dvd from alpha video, the movie set me back a mere $4.99 and gave me real pleasure. i'll view it again.8/10

a beautiful film.john garfield's character is a distant relative of "les miserables"'s jean valjean while detective rains recalls victor hugo's javert,the ruthless arm of law.like in many films noirs,the city epitomizes evil whereas the country and the nature represents sanctuary,redemption,and a second chance for those whose life seems forever doomed.but even in the luminous daylight,danger may appear suddenly,as the excellent scene at the reservoir shows.john garfield -an actor who,as leonard maltin points out,should be rediscovered:i've never been disappointed by any of his films except for his supporting part in "gentleman's agreement " but it was not his fault-gives a heartfelt sensitive performance and the audience sides with him as soon as he is unjustly accused (the first sequence shows a rather unkind hypocrite person,but all his trials redeem him and how do we feel for him during the last scenes with detective rains.colorful characters (grandma and the kids ) add a lot of joie de vivre which is necessary .humor is also present in the strip poker game as the dead end brats fleece a rich kid.i recommend this movie.

this is breezy highly entertaining drama with an excellent cast. garfield is fine as a boxer hiding from the police with that motley crew the dead end kids. most notable of these is the beautiful billy halop who has some very moving moments. gloria dickson, who in real life died very young in a house fire, is strong and very attractive as halop's sister, and in the early scenes ann sheridan, on the brink of stardom, is a knock-out. may robson is very funny as a crusty old granny, but claude rains proves here that even a great actor can flounder if mis-cast (whoever thought of casting him as a tough new york cop?).busby berkeley proves here that he was a fine director with or without musical numbers. the film moves at a terrific pace and the water tower sequence is very suspenseful and well photographed. the ending is contrived, and the plot nothing startling or original, but i still found this a highly enjoyable experience.

they made me a criminal is a remake of an earlier warner brothers film, the life of jimmy dolan which starred douglas fairbanks, jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.even with the restrictions now upon production by the hays office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. douglas fairbanks, jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. john garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.they made me a criminal was directed by busby berkeley who jack warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. berkeley in fact would soon be leaving warner brothers for mgm. berkeley does do a fine job here, keeping the action flowing at a good pace. i particularly like the scene where four of the dead end kids and garfield are swimming in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down. they get it out of it quite narrowly and with some good ingenuity.other performances besides garfield and the kids to remember are may robson who runs the summer camp for the kids and claude rains as the obsessed detective on garfield's trail.

it's always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods when you weren't expecting it. the dead end kids/bowery boys found themselves in a lot of uneven films, and usually did better when in a support role, as in "angels with dirty faces". here, their presence as a backdrop to the story of a boxer framed for murder gives them a lot of screen time without distracting from the main action.john garfield is light heavyweight champion johnny bradfield, a southpaw hitter who's a lot different from the image he portrays to the sports world and the press. when a newspaper reporter inadvertently learns that johnny's a party loving womanizer, his plans to spill that information in a column is interrupted by a whiskey bottle to the head from johnny's manager doc ward (robert gleckler). in turn, doc talks johnny's girlfriend goldie (ann sheridan) into running off with him to avoid the legal hassle of dealing with the reporter's death. as both flee, a police chase winds up in a fiery car wreck, and doc's body is misidentified as johnny from the gold watch he was wearing.claude rains adopts an edward g. robinson sneer that doesn't quite work as a detective who's been reassigned to morgue detail after a bad arrest years ago. his character is monty phelan, and he has a pretty good hunch that the body in the car crash wasn't johnny. he pesters his boss to hand over the closed case to him, and is given the assignment to get him out of town and out of the way.meanwhile, johnny looks for advice from his lawyer, and winds up being screwed even worse when he gets conned for most of his ten thousand dollar savings. making his way cross country, johnny winds up at the rancho rafferty date farm in arizona, run by a crusty granny rafferty (may robson). the farm is the legacy of granny's brother, a deceased priest from brooklyn, and is now the home of a band of rag tag street boys (the dead end kids) who work the farm. billy halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this one, and his sister peggy (gloria dickson) becomes the romantic interest for johnny, now going by the name of jack dorney.i get a kick out of the historical perspective offered in these pre-war era films. when johnny and the boys take a joy ride in the farm's truck, they fill up at a gas station for a $1.28! tommy (halop) gets the idea that a gas station on the farm would be a good way to earn some extra money, and with that thought, jack dorney decides to take on a barnstorming boxer offering $500 a round to anyone who can stay in the ring with him. the clich√©d premise is turned on it's ear somewhat when jack gets knocked out in the fifth round, but by then he's earned enough to give the fruit farm a fighting chance of it's own. maybe grandma rafferty should have been in the ring, she just about took out everyone sitting around her at ringside. as johnny/jack comes around in the locker room, detective phelan is on hand to take him into custody. knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this collar, it's a toss up as to whether phelan follows through on his arrest - you'll have to watch the film to find out.i like the dead end films where leo gorcey's in charge, but he doesn't have a lot to do in this one. however he does a great film flam on the ticket taker at the gate of the boxing match. another thought - wouldn't it have been great if the ever present picture on the wall of the priest had been that of pat o'brien?all in all, this is a pretty good entry in both the john garfield and dead end kids filmography, and an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half. if there's one downside, it's not enough screen time for pretty ann sheridan. the film might have wound up even more satisfying if the roles of sheridan and gloria dickson were reversed, as the on screen chemistry between dickson's peggy and jack seemed more forced than natural.

i must have been around ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to see this martial arts movie at the " drive in " at the circle drive in in long beach. the title was " hammer of god " from which i can never forget for some reason, but what i do remember are the different scenes that have left an imprint on my mind forever.my brother always reminds me of the movie although it has been forever it seems since we seen the movie. from time to time throwout the years i would look for it at the rental stores and from time to time i would check on the web and for some reason it appears like it is never available or no one knows what movie i'm talking about.if i only knew if and were it was available i would love to purchase that movie. if anyone is aware of its availability please inform me.

jimmy wang yu, an authentic asian superstar, directed and wrote this film which i have only seen in a dubbed videotape version. the widescreen (shaw scope!)shape was lost and the original actor's voices absent but this is still good to watch. the story is the usual martial arts school fights villains from japan plot with our young hero winning out in the end by beating up loads of assorted thugs.the combat gets better as the film unravels. early in the film it looks stiff and dull but later there is a great scene where wang yu fights hordes in a gambling joint then walks out into a snowy scene and takes some more villains on with knives, sword and fists. that part is very exciting.quite good then but it would be interesting to see a non dubbed widescreen version if there is one.

i will be honest, i rented this movie solely on the fact it was part of the "child's play" series. i was expecting a boring dull 4th part too the series, but i was surprised. this movie was surprisingly good, and i found it to be quite funny. there was a lot of dark humor, and the idea to have two dolls was a good way to spice things up. the two dolls worked well together and added a bonnie and clyde type fell to the movie. overall it was very good for a 4th movie in the series, with some gruesome death scenes (just watch the marilyn manson type get killed at the beginning, not to mention john ritter getting a face full of nails). applauds to the writers for spicing things up, and the ending although i found it a bit strange leaves room for yet another sequel...maybe "son of chucky"!!!

it's just that. chucky 1 was good. chucky 2 was better. chucky 3 sucked. now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. jennifer tilly was just great in this movie. for dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (freddie prince jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies i've seen in the past.the plot wasn't great, but i really didn't care about it. just to see chucky and tiffany bicker and fight each other. and the ending leaves it wide open for a 5th sequel (which i hear is in the works). idle hands premiers next week and looks to be another horror/comedy, but i doubt it'll top this one.

in this 4th child's play film, chucky gets lucky. it's very funny and there are some enjoyable parts. very good direction. not as bad as it could be. the best one in the series since the first. three stars out of four.

the movie was surprisingly wonderful especially considering the last sequel. the third was dark, and semi-interesting but it wasn't nearly as fun or enjoyable as this. it is filled with comedic lines about martha stuart, doll's anatomy, masturbation, and it was actually done effectively during gruesome and disturbing images. the movie wasn't scary or suspenseful and i'm sure that it wasn't the director's intention. it was fun because of the silliness, jennifer tilly's over the top and sexy performance. the puppetry of the dolls were so well handled, the movement of mouth, lips, tears in eyes, knife in chest, and the costumes. the dolls were just marvelous and it made the gruesome deaths more enoyable considering the fact that they were done by wonderful dolls. the new chucky look was great and tiffany was very cute. a few scenes with chucky hugging the human tiffany even made my father smile. jesse and jade were surprisingly well- very attractive and the special effects were cool. the ending was so unsuspected and the fact that they could make another as good is quite unlikely. it may not be as suspenseful as movies like halloween h2o or urban legend, but it is certainly more fun!!!!

i know this movie isn't for everyone, and i won't push my opinions on you, but what i have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...it was the best i have ever seen!!! it was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie i had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because i didn't know what was gonna happen next. if you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!

it's unbelievable but the fourth is better than the second and the third. after the third that was awful, it's incredible how they could have an unexpected sequel with new ideas. chuck is the same nasty doll of the previous movies. interesting the final that lets know that a fifth can be done....

this is the funniest sequel i have seen in a long time it is much funnier than the other three and not a bit scary. it has some very gory pieces in the film, but not bad enough to make you sick. in this one he has a female doll companion, hence the name. if you liked the first three then you'll love this, go watch it!

i'm warning you -- this movie is not scary. if you're a horror movie fan, especially a child's play fan, you'll think it's incredibly funny, but you won't be scared. it's not a bad movie, but it's not scary.

the success of scream gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. i'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and i liked most of those new horror films. boc is a one big pack of horror. colorful, fast paced and original. i see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like episode 1 and aliens: resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. we have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers. very inventive!

great movie. i thought it would never be as good as it was. great special effects, great story, big laughs. it didn't take itself seriously, which is why i think it worked so well. even the acting was surprisingly good. overall a very funny and sometimes chilling story.

this new installment to the child's play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing chucky giveing him the finger and saying "rude f--king doll" and lots of references to the series: "you can kill me but i'll come back. i always come back". the movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. this is totally different from all other films in the series. it doesn't even have andy, the central character for all the previous ones. chucky seems to interfere with characters from another movie, a soap opera about two teens running off together to get married. there is one cool elaborate death scene involving broken glass and water spilling everywhere. the movie is very gory, very funny, and has pop culture references from martha stewert to jerry springer. do not see this one before you see the other three,. it will really ruin the effect since the first one is truly scary. lots of guilty pleasure fun and silliness. 

this is a great installment in the child's play series. it brought back some bang to the series. great comedy, boy this movie is funny. also there are awesome homages to other horror celebs. beautiful cinematography. great ending! bring on seed of chucky!

this movie exemplifies a certain brand of comedy horror of a strictly adult kind but quite different to the troma movies (with which it shares certain qualities). the humour is rough and ready but fast and furious. if the idea of hideous dolls with evil powers and twisted minds don't make you shrug with boredom, reach for the six-pack of beer and enjoy the best "chucky" film yet.

the child's play series isn't a favourite of mine, but bride of chucky is actually an okay movie. this time we have two dolls chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) tiffany. together they go on a journey to find an object. there are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between chucky and tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre. this made the movie better like comedy does do with many horror movies. all up even if your not a child's play fan give this one a go.

i was expecting this to be just like the others, tries to be scary- ends up looking silly. somewhere along the line the writers must have realised this and so took the film in a totally different direction basically ignoring the other films. this feels like a different film rather than the fourth entry in the child's play series. the new idea works making this the best in the series by far.

seen all 4 installments, this one is by far the best of all. i did'nt have much expectation when i got the dvd(3rd was such a drag), but to my delight this one was fast paced with some slick punch-lines.don't miss this one.

the first child's play was an original and effective little horror movie. as expected though, the 2 horrible sequels seemed to spell the end for this franchise.well, when i heard they were making a 4th one called "bride of chucky" i just rolled my eyes and muttered a "...when will they ever learn."but when i heard that they had gotten a great director, ronny yu and a solid cast including the awe inspiring jennifer tilly my interest in it perked up.this film is extremely well done. it has a great sense of humor, highly stylized graphic violence, great cinematography and the stunningly sexy jennifer tilly strutting her most impressive stuff during the first half. (i should add that she is also a fantastic actress as well.)it keeps it's tongue firmly in cheek without veering into campy territory. the doll effects are great and the verbal interplay between them is priceless. it's more of a horror/comedy than straight horror but the humor is welcome and well integrated. i've already heard that they're planning a son of chucky. if they can match the quality of this film, than maybe this franchise will have made a legitimate comeback.rating:8.5

i¬¥m from germany so please excuse my style of writing. as i¬¥ve seen chucky 4 for the first time i was a bit surprised, i knew chucky as a usual 80s scarymovie, but bride of chucky was very different from the old ones. first there is the artwork of the very good director ronny yu, who we still have in mind from a chinese ghost story. his visual style is in a wired kinda way comparable to francis ford coppola. also the voices of chucky an tiff are very impressive. i¬¥ve also liked the screenplay very much, especially the scene in which tiff throws the champaignbottle in the ceilingmirror.i give it a 9.0 vote for funny, gory and progressive entertainment. if you have any comments on my opinion, just send me an e-mail. mfg schawez

chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!when chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. tiffany and chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk!!don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. it is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!my rating : 9/10.

chucky (the murderous doll from "child's play" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. but his ex-girlfriend tiffany (jennifer tilly) gets his remains and (using "voodoo for dummies") revives him. then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, she is killed and has her soul put into another doll! together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (nick stabile, katherine heigl) to take them to chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make chucky and tiffany real people again...a lot better than it sounds. after the last two sequels to "child's play" (both of which were horrible) i was expecting the worst, but this actually was lots of fun. the movie doesn't take itself seriously for a second (seriously--how could it?) and the lines and situations are actually quite funny. also there are a few very gory murders thrown in to satisfy us horror fans and the film never stops moving. the movie also has a few things usually not found in a horror movie--a gay best friend (gordon michael woolvett) who is intelligent and not played for laughs and a sequence in which stabile has his shirt off just to show his muscular body. john ritter has a nice cameo too as a sheriff.the acting is good--stabile is young, very handsome and likable; heigl doesn't have much to do but pulls it off and brad dourif (the voice of chucky) and tilly are hilarious as the murderous dolls. my favorite part is when the dolls have sex (don't ask) and she asks for a rubber and he responds, "but i'm made of rubber!" the special effects are good (no lousy cgi here) and this is one of the few horror films to mix humor and violence in an entertaining way. well worth seeing. i give it a 9.

bride of chucky starts late one night as officer bob bailey (vince corazza) sneaks into the evidence room at his police station & amongst all the horror film in joke props he steals the remains of the chucky doll that serial killer charles lee ray possessed way back in the original child's play (1988). he drives the remains to an isolated area where ray's ex girlfriend tiffany (jennifer tilly) slashes bailey's throat & takes the remains back to her trailer. there tiffany stitches & staples chucky (voiced by brad dourif) back together again & using a 'voodoo for dummies' book brings him back to murderous life. thing don't go as tiffany had hoped & chucky turns out not to be the man of her dreams after all so she locks him in a play pen at which chucky is less than happy. while tiffany takes a bath chucky escapes, electrocutes her & using that book brings her back to life in the shape of a female doll dressed as a bride. neither want to be stuck in plastic bodies & have to work together to get to a cemetery in new jersey where ray's natural body had been buried with the amulet needed to switch their spirits back into human bodies. the bodies of tiffany's neighbour jesse (nick stabile) & his girlfriend jade (katherine heigl), who are both on the run from jade's corrupt uncle chief of police warren kincaid (john ritter), will do nicely...directed by ronny yu i love bride of chucky. the script by don mancini is great fun, very fast moving, highly entertaining & references plenty of other horror film with good affection. from the opening sequence where we see jason voorhees hockey mask from the friday the 13th films, freddy krueger's razor blade glove from the a nightmare on elm street series & michael myers mask from the halloween franchise. to the clips used from bride of frankenstein (1935) when it virtually recreates the same scene. bride of chucky never takes itself seriously which is just as well, there are lots of one liners, self referential gags that scream (1996) made trendy a few years earlier & it doesn't seem afraid to poke fun at itself & the horror genre in general. i love the scene when jesse & jade are having a clich√©d slushy romantic conversation that chucky hears & he makes funny derogatory comments & gestures throughout. that's not to say that there isn't a damn good film in there as well because there most certainly is. director yu manages to create good atmosphere & a real sense of fun, both human & plastic sets of characters are likable & shine as each pair suffer their own sets of domestic problems that the trail of corpses that they are leaving behind would obviously cause. technically bride of chucky is great for the most part & has that big budget polish about it & at about $25,000,000 i should hope so. the only thing that i will say is that some of the puppet effects by kevin yagher are a little stiff & unconvincing, i can't remember any cgi scenes in bride of chucky either. thankfully the film doesn't neglect the blood & gore with a cool slit throat, nails blasted into someone's face in presumably a hellraiser (1987) homage, people impaled on shards of glass, someone being bloodily obliterated by a huge truck, a ripped off lip piercing & various stabbings & gunshots. the acting is pretty good & dourif as chucky is very funny as he spouts the one liners out. i also like the scenes with tiffany at the beginning & find her very sexy when she's wearing all that fetish gear, i can't be the only one surely? i personally think bride of chucky is a fantastic film, total entertainment from start to finish, great humour & horror in equal measure & at only 85 minutes long it never becomes boring or dull. a personal favourite of mine, watch it as soon as you can!

"bride of chucky" is one of the better horror movies to come out in the past ten years and could be one of the best horror films of the 90's.**spoilers**chucky's girlfriend, tiffany (jennifer tilly) manages to find his battered remains after being sucked into the fan at the end of part 3 and brings him to life in her trailer park. her neighbor, jessie (nick stabile) and his girlfriend jade (katherine heigl) are being tormented by her uncle. (john ritter) tiffany upsets chucky when he refuses to marry her, so she buys a doll for him to play with. chucky kills tiffany, and then transfers her soul into the doll she got him. in order for them to be placed back into human bodies, they have to travel to new jersey to retrieve an amulet to do so. jessie sees this as an opportunity to escape from ritter, and they set out on the journey, but not before ritter is killed by chucky and tiffany. along the way, several bizarre incidents force them to stop at a bed and breakfast. when several more people are killed, they call up their best friend (gordon woolvett) to straighten out the situation. they convince him neither one of them are the killers, as the police have began to solve the crimes. he finds ritter's body in a trunk in the back of the van. thinking he has been set up, he confronts them about it. chucky and tiffany then turn real to prove they did it, which gets woolvett killed. the group steals a motor home and arrives at the cemetery. jessie and jade get chucky and tiffany to turn on each other, giving them enough to escape. chucky recaptures jade and forces her to get his amulet. chucky and tiffany restart their feud, which gives jessie and jade enough time to kill the both of them as the police arrive and clears them of the crimes.the good news: i have to give the most amount of props to the fx department, as chucky and tiffany as dolls look completely convincing. the scenes with them together are the movies main highlights, including a hilarious conversation where tiffany advises chucky on how serial killers in the 90's work. that being said, the amount of one-liners in this movie that are actually funny is incredible. chucky gets the most of them, but tiffany cracks a few gems as well. it is actually funnier than what hollywood calls comedies these days. the gore is plentiful and shockingly realistic. several deaths in this movie are actually original and creative. turning ritter into a new form of pinhead was a totally brilliant scene. the honeymooning couple was a nice death scene, as well. for teenage love, the pairing of stabile and heigl works great. they have a great chemistry together and actually behave like a normal couple. i also have to admit that the first time i saw this movie, i did jump during certain scenes, and that shows what an incredible job director yu did. he learned enough, apparently, to do the same thing with "freddy vs. jason." he knows how to stage set-ups and pay-offs, and here he shows some great skills that have a hong kong influenced look and style. he could be the next great horror director if he keeps filling up his resume with films like those two. nice soundtrack, too, like "freddy vs. jason."the bad news: for fans of cheesy movies, this will be a great find. however, this film has a high cheese factor that may prevent the serious horror movie fan from having a good time enjoying this film. the film knows it is a cheesy movie and revels in it, making a serious fan turned off because of things like the one-liners. it isn't all that bad of a movie, but it has to be watched in the mind frame that it is a cheesy movie, and that the cheesiness of certain scenes add to the movie, not to take it away. remove yourself from that state of mind and you may find yourself enjoying this movie.the final verdict: fans of cheesy movies and the other "child's play" movies will find a lot to like about this movie. for serious horror fans, take a look at it, but keep in mind that it isn't a serious movie and that the cheesiness is supposed to be there and you might find yourself liking it.rated r: graphic violence, graphic language, brief nudity on a doll, a shadowy puppet sex scene, some drug use, and numerous drug references.

well, what's wrong with the title "separate lies" (accused elsewhere of not being "exciting"). it's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (of course there's a phil collins song and a james belushi film called "separate lives", which are alluded to here.) but the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. ok, it's not an "in-your-face" hilarious title, but then it's not an in-your-face hilarious film. please give british films like this a chance. they do try to make people think about important things, as here: how far do you go to protect your life (even if it is a bit rotten) against unexpected disaster. maybe you tell lies. maybe you ignore your loved ones' lies. that can wear a lot of people out. american movies on this theme are abundant, but they usually go much further by involving the use of firearms, which are not a part of everyday life here in europe. maybe we're not so "exciting" over here, but we don't expect slogan-like film titles for films that are not aimed at a massive public.

i wish there were more films about middle aged people. the intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. there seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. amy watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. if she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce. the country and london scenes are wonderfully authentic and rich while the autumnal weather adds to the melancholy background superbly. the ending is perfect, so in tune with real adult life.

separate lies is such an elegant, intelligent and thought provoking film and i could have watched tom wilkinson forever on the screen. the locations in the english countryside, the marvelous london locations, the interiors, smart wardrobes and of course, the writing and dialog made separate lies a thrilling adventure.with that said, and perhaps this is just an american viewpoint, as the british are so much more sophisticated in handling sexual escapades, i found it hard to watch tom wilkinson just stand by, as his wife goes merrily on her way in a sexual journey that really brings her very little joy, creates much despair for her husband, with the cad that is rupert everett. yes, i saw the failings of wilkinson's character-his aim for perfection, the desire for everything in its place-but in emily watson, she should have looked deeper into his true character and solid goodness, to realize what she has thrown away.tom wilkinson makes separate lies into a powerful film by watching him experience all the pain, embarrassment, and despair on the screen as his wife goes off with another man. and he himself makes the journey in separate lies by understanding his faults, embracing his wife, despite all that has gone on, and leading her back to london. bravo, tom!

nigel balchin's maze-like novel 'a way through the wood' has been adapted by julian fellowes who also directs this 'terribly british' drawing room suspense piece. it is a film whose effect relies on the cast portraying the varyingly benign/malignant characters and it is here that fellowes' directorial choices are superb. the story has a linear line that is easy to follow, but the beauty of the film is the metamorphosis of each player as a single incident ignites a minefield of disasters.james manning (tom wilkinson) is a successful business obsessed solicitor in london, married to anne (emily watson) who needs more in her life: the couple being childless live in the country in a beautiful estate, assisted by their long term 'cleaner' maggie (linda bassett). they attend social outings and meet, among others, william bule (rupert everett), the passively lazy wealthy neighbor. anne decides they should entertain their neighbors and against gruff james' protestation anne proceeds with planning: james arranges to 'not attend due to business'. on the night of the party there is a hit and run accident in which maggie's husband is accidentally killed by someone in a range rover (she observed). when james returns home he sees a scratch on william's range rover and suspects william to be the perpetrator. anne discourages james from going to the police with the information -'what possible good can it do but ruin bill's life as a socialite and father and son of an important scion?'. from this first 'lie' the virus spreads: james confronts bill who talks james out of going to the police, anne confesses it was she who was driving bill's rover and is the one responsible, james convinces anne to keep it quiet because it would ruin his reputation, anne confesses she is having an affair with bill, and the three of them concur that they will stick together on their big lie for the sake of the greater good. anne eventually succumbs to the guilt of not telling her beloved maggie that she is the one responsible and maggie, herself guilty of a previous theft whose life was saved by anne's mercy to hire her anyway, is the agent who draws the story to its surprising conclusion. lies begat lies that begat lies, et cetera.the major impact of this intrigue is the manner in which the isolated tragedy impacts each of the characters involved. each changes in a dramatic way. tome wilkinson gives the finest performance of a career filled with brilliant performances: he is able to say more with his posture and facial expressions than about any actor before the audience today. likewise the gifted emily watson adds yet another fine role to her repertoire as does the surprisingly smarmy rupert everett who, despite being yet another wealthy british 'gentleman', gives us a man both arid of spirit and yet ultimately needy. and the always-fine linda bassett takes a small role and finesses it making her character quietly central to the chaotic web of lies.the cinematography by tony pierce-roberts and the musical score by stanislas syrewicz add immeasurably to the multiple atmospheres the story encounters. this is ensemble playing at its finest, which always means that the director (julian fellowes) has a fine grasp on the piece. the interplay of these fine people makes the dodgy story work very well indeed. grady harp

one of the best,lackawanna bluesgreat movie,great cast,great music,this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another 90 minutes,i will w3atch this one many times. this is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature. the cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role. you get the sense that you're really there taking all this in. a great deal of care was given in the sets, costumes and music of the period. the relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie goes on, but the steady performance of ms. merkerson is so powerful that the movie ends before we've had our fill of the wonderful misfits. to single out anyone other than "nanny" is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors including:jeffery wright, jimmy smits, terrence howard and delroy lindo. but it is marcus franklin, macy gray and ms. merkerson that makes this a wonderful experience.the movie moves rapidly and is short by todays standards, but it is without question one of the best movies you're going to see this year. if you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally, tug at your heart, lift you joyfully and have you tapping your feet at the same time, then this is the movie for you. i've shown it to several friends and they all want my copy, that says it all, the movie is that good. check it out for yourself.danceability-1, amsterdam holland

this is a stunning movie. raw and sublimely moving. it felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences. all of the main players are mesmerising. tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. julian fellowes has triumphed again. he's a national treasure. gosford park, vanity fair, mary poppins... and now this. can he do no wrong?! go and see it! this is a film for real grown-ups.

this was one of the worst columbo episodes that i have seen, however, i am only in the second season.the typical columbo activities are both amusing and irritating. his cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before, and the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer--in this case cooking ,tho the scene on the tv cooking show distracted from the main theme.also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer. the reason was never explained ,nor did it serve any purpose. but the part i disliked the most was the death of the bride to be . this was never explained and it is the main reason why i give this episode such a low grade.

this is a well directed columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a columbo movie. this also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. it's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out. perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. at least when compared to different columbo movies.for instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the columbo character himself. it makes the movie an enjoyable one to watch but it also gives you the feeling they sort of overdid it times, also mostly since it doesn't correspond with most other columbo movies.the characters are good and it helps that it features martin landau in a double role. it's always funny to see how much different he still looked as a young man, while for instance a person such as peter falk hardly changed any over the years, he only got grayer. the movie also features julie newmar among others, who is best know for playing catwoman in the '60's "batman" life action series. it's funny how she still moves like catwoman in this movie. intentional or is this just her way of acting?it's an enjoyable and good to watch columbo movie but it also gives you the feeling that it all could had been a lot better with a better thought out script.7/10

what a cast of actors and actresses in this columbo episode, beside peter falk, you have julie newmar, jeannette nolan, martin landau as twins. anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fianc√©, julie newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. jeannette nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. martin landau plays identical twins in this one. each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money. well, you'll just have to watch and see the outcome but i can assure you that it's always worth watching this one for the cast and the crew.

this is my favourite columbo. martin landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. this columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! peter falk is on form as usual in this episode written by steven bochco (who also wrote 'murder by the book', my second favourite episode). the supporting cast are great especially julie newmar (very under-rated) and jeanette nolan as the house keeper that columbo just keeps on upsetting. the surname of martin landau's characters in this is 'paris'. that was the surname of leonard nimoy's character in mission impossible. coincidence? or a steven bochco joke?

double shock is one of the many good columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.it has all the elements we like in the columbo episodes. we get the laugh when columbo makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in double shock. i can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.we also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles columbo. the end is the usual, we get the story about how columbo solved the mystery.this is another good columbo-episode, and i will rate it 7/10. it is close to 8/10."just one more question" - the acting? peter falk is very good as usual.

this columbo is unique in that we don't really know the exact outcome until the very end. our favorite dark horse detective suspects a pair of identical twin brothers of killing their rich uncle; each points the finger at his brother. in a mystery series in which the crime is shown at the beginning of the drama, this twist could reasonably be used only once or twice, and this was columbo's time. other than that wrinkle, this episode fits in well with others of the series. it has a lighter tone than some, with a very funny performance by jeanette nolan as the fastidious and loyal housekeeper who takes an instant dislike to columbo.

do you liked "dead man don't wear plaid"? what about "top secret" and "a chorus line"? well m√ºllers b√ºro is a fantastic melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. very funny "tongue in cheek" movie noir hommage with stunning songs and great dancing. you have to have a little odd humor for this movie, but it is very well worth seeing it. i've voted it a nine, if the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten. thats how good that movie is.

"m√ºllers b√ºro" is a movie which many will watch and enjoy until the end, while others will stop watching it within five minutes. it is a parody of detective movies with all the twists and turns; the action takes place only at night in the dark corners of a city which resembles batman's gotham city (look carefully at the streets, buildings, the police car chasing the criminals, etc.). it is also a parody of musicals with its really funny characters such as m√ºller's secretary and vitasek's (the actor playing m√ºller's assistant) lover who do their best to sing, albeit not very successfully.the spaces occupied by the characters have their own presence in the film such as the decadent blue box (there is a real club with this name in vienna) where one can see a sailor hitting on a girl in the background, m√ºller's apartment with the black paint smeared on the walls and the dirty kitchen, m√ºller's bureau with the sweet picture of his assistant, etc.the humorous moments in the movie are many and include "flat in the face" type of humor such as m√ºller farting in his assistant's face, the prostitute charging m√ºller extra for orgasm, the ridiculous outfits of the female thugs of montana, etc.a legendary film from the 80's especially for those interested in austrian or german-speaking cinema.

if you haven't seen this film, do it. its a genremix as i've never seen another. some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny stuff, a film noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (the 2nd best played orgasm on film, bested only by sally), a pitch of orson welles blended together into a work of art. as an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end, at least not logical for everybody ;-). i owned an tv copy on vhs but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back. but the film should be out on dvd in austria on 10.06.03 and be sure, i will buy it.

a unique blend of musical, film-noir and comedy - with a few sex scenes thrown in for good measure. the only other film i can think of with a fairly similarly wild and madcap mixture of themes and clich√©s is the french movie billy ze kick - but that has a more surreal and quirky approach.not that this film would not be surreal or quirky. the humour is at times quite subtle, at other times blatantly in your face - and often crossing the border to offensiveness. to give an example: in the post-coital chit-chat with a prostitute our hero max m√ºller encourages her to reveal who was responsible for a recent murder, using the words "schiess los!". literally, this phrase means "shoot!" in german, and that is exactly what a hidden assassin does in response. in other words - this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a pun.m√ºllers b√ºro is also one of the very rare examples of films with funny sex scenes. larry's romance is accompanied by the song "ich will mehr" (i want more) - while the song perfectly underpins the action, the meaning of its words changes a couple of times, hinting at the end at larry's inability of providing any further service. the film's main love scene between max m√ºller and bettina kant lacks such subtlety - this is jaw-dropping stuff, especially when bettina's singing slowly transgresses into moaning, of course all in the rhythm of the music.unmissable, unless you are one of the easily offended.

nicely filmed, a little uneven, "nobody" is a good evening's entertainment. the plot is simple enough--three yuppies get into a scrap with a group of strangers in a bar, and it turns out to be much more than they bargained for. the acting is decent, and there are a few unexpected twists. watch for the completely unbelievable (like the 10 shot revolver, and 25 shot semi-automatic handgun).

it's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some shadowy people, and can't deal with. very, very disturbing portrayal of japan, the arbitrariness of modern life... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboilerthe spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on english sub titles. obviously, i don't know japanese.the only other japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa, who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre. so, can't really compare. otherwise, it compares better with most hollywood "blockbusters" for story plot and buildup.taptieg24

nobody (1999) is a fantastic piece of japanese noir. it's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p*** off three other guys one night in a bar. when these three mysterious strangers, who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know, beat the living daylights out of one of our "heroes", the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally kill one of the other guys! the remaining two baddies then begin the systematic destruction of everything these poor schmoes hold dear, including their fast-dwindling sanity. phaedra video's dvd sleeve features a critic quote calling the film "a paranoid street crime freakout!" or some such, and the term more than applies here. brooding, tense, very violent and low-key (but still pretty slick), shot largely at night with many deliberately vague moments and character motivations that keep the audience guessing right along with the besieged protagonists (who, to some degree, deserve everything they get!). i give it a 10.

for me this is a good series. i am kind of disappointed that ana lucia and libby died but more upset that micheal lied to everyone about who killed them. and if any one can answer this what was that guys name who was supposedly "henry gale" he was like the leader of the others (or was that ms. clue??) anyway if you know his name cool. well trying to think of what can possibly happen next after they finally didn't press the button. does that mess up the whole darma project thing and i personally thought it was cool how they had that key thing underground that desmond used to shut off the magnet thing, yeah and what was the whole point of that? i am just glad they didn't press the button finally, but what happens to the people in the hatch? like mr. echo, john, charlie and well desmond probably died but what about the others? i think they survived, i forget? well this is just my little thing on what i thought about this season finale!!!

the show start out with the boat. desmond was i it. then they went to try to save walt. and lock things that the button pushing is a big joke at the same time desmond found out that hes the one that crashed the plane. eko tries to open the door that jhon locked on him, and charlie helped him find the bomb. while sayid and jack plan is that, sasyid is to find the others first and see who and what the other are. and find if there armed and have any weapons. micheal takes jack, swayer, kate, and hugo in a trap. and they get caught.after the show there were more questions then answers, but that what makes the show great. and can't wait until season 3

indeed, cynthia watros is in this movie as elizabeth talking to desmond. though i'm just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient'(?) where hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (as seen from the previous episodes).anyway, this last episode is really suspended. the ending is not so understandable. i think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming.i just hope the next season will give light to more unclear/hanging events that were happened.just can't wait further for season 3.

watching the last 2 episodes i remembered a tv add from my childhood. it showed the wild west, very dusty and dry, and there is a small saloon, a man enters the bar/saloon, he is thirsty as hell, lips cracked etc...., he has just walked through the nevada desert and hasn't drunk water for days. he croaks to the bartender "gimme a packet of potato chips" while he is eating it we can feel how thirstier he is getting, we hear a voice in the background saying.... "keep building that thirst, build it till you cant hold it any more............. then blow it away with team" the man drinks team (a soft drink) it feels like a few dozen bags of potato chips the thirst is so intense that i cannot hold it any more, season 2 has even more twists and turns then season 1. the ending answers a lot of questions but asks many many more questions hopefully we will know the answer in season 3, but i doubt it because i feel lost has the momentum go a lot further then 3 seasons, if the people behind the camera keep up their good work.i for one will keep watching.from pakistan with love

a very good episode, although not as devastating a finale as the end of season 1. the idea to make it a desmond flashback worked very well, and henry ian cusick was fantastic, perhaps putting in the best performance of this entire series, but my only complaint would be the michael plot line felt very much like a subplot, and after three minutes the previous episode, i thought it would feature more. but the strength of cusicks character and performance pulled it through. the plot developments, as always, left more questions then answers, like who are the others, something we still don't know, and where are they taking jack, sawyer and kate. what was the white light, what impact has it had? are locke, eko and desmond dead? as the hatch destructed around them. if they are it would be a major mistake, because these three are the most interesting characters and the series would suffer without them and terry o'quinn has been fantastic throughout both series as locke. a fitting finale to a better series then the first.

"live together, die alone" is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. so when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. it was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the past of the island & the swan station itself and honestly moving. desmond and penny seem magically connected to each other, even when they are on opposite ends of the world, and both characters are beautifully acted (it's hard not to cry when desmond reads penny's letter). the action inside the hatch is edge-of-your-seat tense, as locke is determined not to allow the button to get pushed again, convinced it was all just a psychological experiment, desmond gradually realizes the consequences of this decision, and eko is locked outside and tries desperately to get back in. the melting of the clock and locke's "i was wrong" are unforgettable moments. the outside action has jack, kate, sawyer and hurley captured by the others due to michael's betrayal (after they make a puzzling discovery connected to the pearl), and "henry gale"'s game-changing return as the others' leader. even the least important plot line, sayid, jin and sun sailing to the beach where the others are supposedly camping, contains one of the greatest mythological mysteries of the show, the giant statue that's almost entirely missing except for a foot with four toes. in short: emotion + history + mythology + adventure + suspense + the threat of annihilation + a ray of hope = a classic lost episode. ***1/2 out of 4.

*could contain spoilers, read only after seeing last episode season 2* think about it. the guys on the north pole? center of the earth? looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? they also said something about: "did we miss it again?" so there was another abnormality? of course that was when the plain crashed! i think this whole island is a setup. set up by her daddy. she found out about it and is looking for her desmond. how else can she know what to look for.so basically it's an island in a magnetic shield. all of it is fake. all the signs are there. fake beards, fake doors, fake medicine, fake observations stations, with fake air shafts that lead to nothing. it's a project indeed, and because of the final scene in the season 2 finale i know it has to do something with desmond, his chick and her dad (and probably libby, she's weird, maybe she actually has something to do with the plane crashing, ok now i'm drifting off).also in this episode, henry gail tells michael to go to some coordinates, and he'll find rescue their. this is probably some sort of door in the magnetic shield. "once you're gone. there is no way back".i think it's pretty obvious, despite of the numerous questions i still have and hope to get answers for in the next season. if you think back on what we've learned in season 1 and 2, i'm sure we'll get loads of answers in season 3.can't wait.can anyone agree on this theory? hope to hear from you...

the writers of lost have outdone themselves. season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one. locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself, but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island? he will have to if he wants to stay alive. i don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge. this finale has left more questions than the previous finale; and i can't wait for fall.a side note: what is the point in posting a review just to write out all the spoilers? where is the pleasure in ruining the surprise for everyone else? the current review on this page is nothing but a big fat spoiler fest, poorly constructed in barely readable english with the express purpose of making someone mad. good job.

this episode so far is the best of the series. the story was told perfectly. i especially liked how the writers made it a desmond episode; it was his best performance to date and he definitely deserved the emmy for his performance.we had some of our questions answered in this episode, but since the show is called lost we know there will be more questions brought up too. first the answered: walt is reunited finally with his father michael, second, michael's betrayal is exposed to jack, sawyer, kate, and hurly and because of this betrayal kate, jack, and sawyer are all taken captive by the others. this was a great way to end the show.on the other side of the island we see locke going through a mental breakdown with the button. this leads to another answered question about how the plane really went down. however there are some unanswered questions: first, what happened to locke, eko, and desmond when desmond turned the failsafe key and what was the deal with the scientists in the arctic searching for electromagnetic annamolies. guess we'll find out next season, however great ending to the best show on tv.

woaww is it only now that you notice the links between all the characters ?? of course it's libby ! and for the guy in the hatch with desmond, any deja vu ??? yeah !! he was the "same" guy that gave money to sayid after he's killed or tortured the other soldier in the episode 14th of the 2nd season : one of them. well actually it's not completely the same guy, he's named joe in the 14th episode and kelvin in the last 2 episodes. twins ?? :) who knows ?? jj abrams ... mmmm i'm not even sure of that :) there are hundreds of links like this one between all the characters.but that was just in response to the libby comment.i found those 2 episodes far more interesting than the whole season 2. during all that season i felt that there was lots of things i've missed and very few things i've learned. especially at the very beginning, the 1st episode of the 2nd season is excellent, and then the 2nd one is a kind of flash back of the 1st one ... i found that disappointing even if i'm pretty sure that everything in lost tend to have a meaning. that was just an example of how i was frustrated watching those episodes.let's go back to the last 2 episodes. i think we've learned more new things in those 2 episodes than in the entire season. but all we learn are little pieces for the next puzzle, like the involvement of desmond's "relatives" (sorry if i spoil too much, believe me or not i'm trying not to) for example. so lots of things evoked in the past 2 seasons are still unclear or have been developed once then nothing. and still, there's new material as if all the holes in the picture were not enough. we all want to see the big picture of all of it of course, but i think we'll have to be very very patient. i hope there will be only 3 seasons. i'm not sure i will watch more than 3 seasons anyway. there was also lots of actions in the very last episode. and a good cliffhanger at the very end.so basically, yes i loved that last episode ... and yes i want to see the third season.

first of all, i just have to say that i'm a huge lost fan. everyone who makes the show, i love 'em. it's got everything in it, really.i'm glad that they have great people making it, for instance jack bender is the greatest director, well, maybe after j.j. abrams. and of course, full credit to damon lindelof & carlton cuse. they're geniuses.anyway, the season 2 finale is definitely one of the best episodes of lost ever!!! live together, die alone focuses on desmond david hume's story of getting to the island, and henry ian cusick is so great playing that character! the makers of the show would have been very stupid if they would've let old'des die on us.so, in lost, the plane crash survivors have been there for 65 days.. 65 days, man. whileas rousseau has been there for sixteen years, and the others have been there for god knows how long. referring to jeffrey lieber, lindelof & abrams. anyway, i hope we'll get the answers we need, in season 3. can't wait! my vote is nine.

lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience i've ever seen. not only it's the mother of coincidence, but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction.take this casualty for example, the us marine, whom gives sayid the way to become a torturer, is clancy brown, playing a character named joe inman. in the last episode, he is playing kelvin inman, the desmond partner in the hatch. destiny, uh? yeah right!i guess that all of us will have to wait, to see what's next in the life of the wonder people in that strange island, in the middle of nowhere. knowing that several of my favorites characters, desmond, sayid and mr. eko, have an unclear destinyi believe that along with 24 and the shield, this is one of the best tv shows ever, of course, keeping twin peaks at a special place.

it was libby talking to desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how did she end up in the same hospital hurley was in) then you should know that despited libby dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her.btw, great episode. it had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions...like what happened to eko and lock and what about the four toe statue?i cannot wait till season 3, lost just rules!!! i hope all the unanswered questions will be answered. i loved how they explained why the plane actually crashed. desmond did it when he did not manage to type in the numbers in time. 4 8 15 16 23 42

what's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... here is my forecast: 1. the hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. buts lets see about that. 2. the episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on desmonds boat by penny. now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3. after the destruction of the hatch, the island is not isolated any more, and other ships/airplanes are going to arrive 4. the others are finally going to share their secret with us poor observerswas it actually confirmed that there are going to be 4 seasons of lost?cheers mike

jack, sawyer and sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted desmond. his traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. sayid plots a plan with jack to surprise "the others" in case michael is double-crossing the group. john locke convinces desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by mr. eko, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.this episode is one of the best of the second season. unfortunately, we lovers of "lost" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans. in the usa, the air date of this episode was 24 may 2006. therefore, along this period, fans have to wait for the third season in a very suspenseful situation, with jack and his group surrounded by "the others" and finding the truth about michael and the death of ana lucia and libby; john locked inside the hatch without the intention of pushing the button and mr. eko in despair outside the hatch. i hope the fate of "lost" be better than "angel" and its very disappointing conclusion (or lack of conclusion) after five seasons. my vote is ten.title (brazil): not available

after spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode ("three minutes"), the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is. with the use of the boat, jack and sayid come up with a plan to confront "the others". however, when jack, sawyer, kate and hurley follow michael to "the others", jack is forced to reveal michael's deadly secret whilst they are in the middle of nowhere.meanwhile, locke decides that the time has come to find out the time has come to find out what will happen if "the button" is not pressed. however, mr. eko's resolve to continue pressing "the button" is surprisingly strong. so, when locke concocts a plan to lock eko out of the hatch with the help of an ally, eko goes to surprisingly desperate lengths to stop locke from making what he believes will be a big mistake.this is a classic episode of lost, full of secrets, suspense and very few answers to the many questions it poses to its viewers. however, some of the secrets this action-packed episode reveals will be truly shocking to the fans. there is also a trademark end-of-season cliffhanger, which achieves the feat of being both shocking and extremely confusing. one thing is guaranteed, it will keep you guessing right to the very end, and you will still be frustrated with more mind-boggling questions as you wait in agony for the third season to begin.

this is probably the second best of the death wish movies. death wish 5 is the best one.death wish 3 reminds me of "west side story" with a new twist. not even the recent flick "gangs of new york" can measure up with one new york neighborhood in death wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. a gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.deborah raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence. so, like geri nichols in death wish ii, death wish iii scores with its gentle, romantic moments as well as its violent moments. only the james bond love-interest scenes would do much better.and, in addition to his .38, kersee plays with this new gun called the wildey .475 magnum. it reminded me of the dirty harry movies when callahan used his .44 magnum in magnum force, sudden impact and dirty harry. the wildey gun packs a big punch and when kersey kills with it, he doesn't care if the gun has a big kick in it.and that antitank missile that killed off the main gang leader? well, that is something. kersey would not use an antitank missile as his regular vigilante weapon....that is way too military for him.

"death wish 3" brings back charles bronson as one time vigilante paul kersey,now retired.yeah,right.before long kersey is back to his old ways.but this time,its not just a few muggers at a time,its a gang who have taken over a run down part of the city(new york again,by the way.)this time its war,so kersy hauls out the big guns(literally) for this.the body count int his one rivals anything stallone or schwarzenegger have come up with.this movie is actually somewhat fun to watch,particularly for a few one liners and of course bad guys die,or get severely injured in creative ways,which is always a good thing.the violence is not as personal in this one,its,obviously on a much grander scale,sort of like bombing your victims from afar,rather than one on one combat.this movie is lighter in tone than the 1st 2,making it easier to watch.there's not much import to this film,its more escapism than anything.its also cheesy at times and pseudo-inspirational,but hose scenes fall flat. they should have left the original "death wish" on its own without sequels,but since they didn't,they should have stopped here. 8 /10

lackawanna blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people. it's editing and soundtrack really pulls you in to the story and lets you experience the film the way the writer really meant for it to be seen.the music really tied into the story, which made the characters come to life. the editing made the story more progressive and captivating. i was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast, most notably s. epatha merkerson's.i can't wait to see the one man show featuring this films writer, ruben santiago-hudson.

on march 17, 1974, a man is found dead in the toilets at manhattan's penn station. although well-known, he cannot be identified because he scratched out the personal information in his passport and his body lays unclaimed at the city's morgue for three days. it turned out to be the body of what many consider one of the greatest american architects of the twentieth century, louis i. kahn. he died at the age of 73, on his way from india, where one of his greatest projects, the institute for management in ahmedabad, was nearing completion.one of the most influential post-war american architects, louis kahn's architectural legacy includes the house of parliament in dhaka, bangladesh, the kimbell art museum in forth worth, the yale art gallery, the salk institute in california and a kind of mobile "music boat", designed to give concerts in harbours in various cities around the world.while celebrated as an architect, very little was known about his private life. in addition to his wife esther, and their daughter, sue ann, kahn was survived by two mistresses, harriet pattison and anne tyng, and their two children. all three families lived within miles of each other in suburban philadelphia, but their paths never crossed until the funeral. his son, nathaniel, the director of this film, was only 11 years old at the time, and had only a few memories of his father's weekly visits at harriet patterson, nathaniel's mother, in philadelphia. twenty-five years later, he sets out on a journey to confront his father by visiting kahn's buildings, talking to relatives and colleagues and visiting the places that played a role in louis kahn's life.one of the most moving confrontations is when nathaniel asks his mother, a landscape architect and mistress of louis kahn, why she kept up with playing second fiddle to his wife and never confronted him with this. tears shed her eyes, but she has no regrets. "it was worth it." it's such an intensely sad moment. she's obviously shattered, treated as an outcast at his funeral, which she was forbidden to attend, it's almost as if she led a substitute life. it all feels strangely unreal. another interview with edward bacon, kahn's architectural nemesis, who was in charge of the rebuilding of his native philadelpia in the fifties and sixties, almost suffers a stroke on the spot, when he is reminded of kahn's unsavoury ideas about architecture. his son, nathaniel, listens uncomfortably when a very senior bacon literally screams with anger whenever kahn's name comes up. the final scene is reserved for kahn's grandest creation, the capitol in dhaka, bangladesh. it took 23 years to complete, a vast and extraordinary building, of which the bangladeshi are extremely proud. it's one of the very few national symbols with stature in this impoverished nation. some of the interviews with the locals brought tears in my eyes, especially when they find out they are talking to - god forbid - the architect's own son!the film is as much a personal journey as it is an account of kahn's grand architectural legacy and is above all about the fruition of the film itself and film-making in general. perhaps louis i. kahn faltered as a father, but these shortcomings in his personal life make for an all the more interesting portrait in this extraordinary film.camera obscura --- 9/10

this is a profound and moving work about the creation of art, that which is uniquely human and cannot be produced by nature, the cost of genius and the search for transcendence and what in the end constitutes family, i.e, all of us. i was very much moved by the family discussion that nathaniel had with his sisters about the shortcomings of their father as it was set in a beautiful home that seemed to radiate warmth that lou had created. and although esther seems so cold in her discussion about lou's inability to make money you can appreciate how she at many points in his life must have been a counter-weight to his impulses. nathaniel did a great job of showing how all of the people in lou's life fit in and completed it and became as much a part of his work as his own genius. yes even, or maybe especially, our failures make us who we are. and of course there are the buildings. i had only known lou kahn by name and did not really connect his name to his work, they are evidence of grace. perhaps someday there will be a building where we will all fit, and it will certainly resemble a lou kahn building, perhaps the unbuilt temple in jerusalem. perhaps there is salvation

when nathaniel kahn embarked into this voyage, he hardly knew who his father really was. by the end of the film, he found him and comes to terms with the strange life he lived as a child.louis kahn was the father. he was an architect's architect. his designs were perhaps too complex, as he tried to create buildings that didn't conform with trends popular at that time. it is ironic that he never achieved the fame that came so easy to some of his contemporaries. he had a vision and he never strayed from it. we can see characteristics of his unique style in the buildings he left behind as a legacy to humanity. every one of his creations are unique in that they don't imitate works from other architects.louis kahn's life was rather complicated. he was married, yet he had affairs with two of his assistants that produced a girl and a boy, besides the legitimate daughter he had with his wife.as a boy, nathaniel kahn's life was lived in a secluded area, away from his father, who only visited late at night. louis kahn never recognized these children, although it is very clear they all knew about the others existence. it is tragic that louis kahn died alone in grand central station when he was returning from a trip without making peace with the women and children he never acknowledged as his own by his side. he probably cared a great deal about all his children, but he remains an aloof figure throughout the film. we never get to know the man, although at the end, nathaniel, in his quest to discover his father's life, finds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle.this is a personal account on the life of an artist. thanks to that son, who has the courage to tell the story, we are almost prying into the lives of louis kahn and his extended family.

nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's academy awards, my architect follows filmmaker nathaniel kahn in his quest to find out about his father, the legendary architect louis i kahn. lou kahn died in 1974, when nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. my architect follows kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings, and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius. as the son which lou never publicly acknowledged during his lifetime, nate has delicately placed himself in the story without overpowering the main focus. when examining the magnificent salk institute in california, nate evokes his father's mythic use of space and light in his buildings, making it a peaceful and fascinating experience for viewers. the shot of nate rollerblading in salk's smoky white central meeting place emphasises the building's harmony with nature. it's breathtaking. my architect also covers the difficulty louis kahn had with getting his designs accepted. several fantastical buildings exist only on paper, dismissed by more practical architects and property developers. it wasn't until louis kahn went to the east that his visions were enthusiastically embraced. in india, where he built the indian institute of management, a former co-worker describes him as a guru. in bhangladesh, where he built the magnificent national assembly building, citizens consider him a father of democracy. watching my architect is a wonderful way to begin or continue learning about architecture and the importance of space. but it's the irony of lou kahn's egotism combined with the transcendence of his work that will inspire you. 4 stars.

what a tribute to his father! he set out on a quest to learn more about a man whom he knew little of, and by the end of the journey, i believe nathaniel kahn is content with what he learned and personally felt. the film is 5 years in the making, and a quarter of a century after his death, louis i. kahn's total commitment in his work - consistent strong desire to build buildings that are meaningful to humanity and timeless to the whole world, with insight into his life is proudly depicted by his son nathaniel in the documentary "my architect: a son's journey".the film is by no means an anthology of louis' work. there are plenty of books and archived materials that have records of louis kahn's projects and buildings. this documentary works like a mystery, writer-director and co-producer nathaniel kahn was searching for the man whom he briefly knew as his father. the film is in chapters. in "heading west," we're at the salk institute for biological studies at la jolla, california. it's a sight worth beholding - kahn's integral concept of building and environment, optimizing light for the scientists at work is amazing. from a former colleague who worked with 'lou' 35 years ago, we hear about his meticulous attention to detail, also how 'rambunctious' he could be - certainly didn't mince words in his criticism. a memorable scene is when the camera pulled back wide and we see nathaniel skating around at the plaza area of the salk institute - a tiny figure, like a child happily playing in the bowl of his father's hands. the "immigrant" segment brought us to meet anne tyng, the architect who collaboratively worked with 'lou' and also bore him a daughter, alex. now at 80, tyng's return with nathaniel's film crew to the bath house project at trenton, new jersey, was nostalgic. in "go to sea," we get to see the barge for american wind symphony orchestra - all made of steel, and meeting robert boudreau, who was surprised by nathaniel when he finally told him he's 'lou's' son. boudreau was touched, he said he had seen nathaniel when he was six, with his mom (harriet pattison), and he was not to tell anyone that lou had a son. it was a 'chokingly' emotional moment of reunion.like his father "the nomad," nathaniel traveled to jerusalem, and learned about the synagogue project that his father began but not realized. he visited the wailing wall, and seeing his yarmulke kept falling off/being 'breezed off' his head gave me a sense that he need not be 'totally' jewish to be his father's son. we continue with sitting down with his two half-sisters at the "family matters" segment. we also hear him conversing with his mom at maine, and from talking to previous office personnel at his father's office, we come to know how his father intensely worked and practically lived there, sleeping on a carpet on the office floor, weekends and all. "the end of the journey" brought us to ahmedabad, india, to the indian institute of management building. talking with architect b.v. doshe was a revelation. in the end, nathaniel found a very much alive louis kahn, his father - his spirits live within him. this documentary is very much a tear-jerker for me. i was teary-eyed most of the time - it was very touching and am in awe of the man, the architect and his son, and the women in his life besides his famous works and buildings. louis i. kahn wanted to give his love to the 'whole world,' juggling work and three families (you might say he has three women in his life to keep his inspiration going). as shamsul wares, the architect at the capital of bangladesh complex (completed 9 years after 'lou's' death) so poignantly noted: louis kahn has given the people of bangladesh a lot, spending time at bangladesh, understanding the culture of the place and people - as well as giving them democracy through what he has achieved, and for such a dedicated man, usually the people close to him he'd often miss seeing. it seems the price of being great comes with inevitable personal sacrifices. this film reminds me of king vidor's "the fountainhead" 1949 (good dramatic story in b/w with music by max steiner), based on ayn rand's novel, with gary cooper as the uncompromising architect who stands by his own ideals, and patricia neal as the parallel supportive woman in his life.

just a great soundtrack. really enjoyable music. outstanding cast, great lead performance. worth watching.doesn't really explain what happened to the neighborhood. you are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegrated.this movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted. i especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like jeffrey wright.the cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively, engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music, food, drink, dancing, gambling and sex.

i just saw it at an advance screening i haven't read the book, but heard many good things about it.the movie was absolutely fantastic, very moving. with a roller coaster of emotions you totally connect with the characters. shaun toub was great, it was a complete departure from his usual roles, and his acting for those who understand persian/dari was incredible.one thing to notes it that khaled hosseini actually loved the film which is unusual for book adaptation movies. even after seeing the movie several times "he was sobbing".also the animation from the intro was exquisite, with names displayed as if it were persian calligraphy, very unique! at times the translation was not clearly conveying the message efficiently, but all in all this was a great movie.

the kite runner was beautiful, poignant and very moving. i particularly loved the two child actors in the film as well as the actor portraying the father. it really made me want to go back and read the book again.the music was a wonderful part of the fabric of the movie. if there is a soundtrack coming out for the film, i will buy it to accompany my second reading of the book. it is also a visually stunning film. the cinematography was gorgeous and really added to experience.the brazilian word 'saudades' is very descriptive of how i felt at the end of the film..."it is a deep feeling of longing for someone or someplace, which is very sweet but also tinged with an inescapable sadness" (definition provided years ago by antonio carlos jobim).saw it at a small cinema here for an advance screening. i would love to see it again on a really large screen with a tricked out sound system.can't wait for the formal release. i will definitely recommend the film to friends.

holy schnikey! this movie rocks! the duo of chris farley and david spade are great together. my favorite parts are "fat guy in a little coat, oh my gosh, room service and more scenes that will be remembered for years to come. this movie has a huge cult following, i wonder why, which proves that even eleven years after chris farley's tragic death and he still is popular. he plays tommy which will make you laugh every time you still watch it. he is a great comedian and is missed. mr. spade reminds me of dan akyroid while chris farley reminds me of john belushi. they done more than 2 movies together. this movie is a must buy and should be in every snl fan's collection.

this is one of my favourite comedy films. chris farley is hilarious as the accident prone moron and david spade is perfect playing the straight-man to farley.the dialogue between the two of them is brilliant. the scene where the two of them are in the car singing along to superstar by the carpenters is a classic.chris farley was a great comic actor who had amazing potential - he will be sadly missed.

for only doing a few movies with his life the late great chris farley. farley died at the end of 1997 and will be missed mostly by his co actor in tommy boy, david spade. from the lame police academy 4 spade really has done good with his career in films. tommy boy is a classic and we will always remember chris farley when we watch it. from appearing on saturday night live to doing tommy boy, black sheep, beverley hills ninja, almost heroes, billy madison, and dirty work. i think chris farley had a short and successful career. tommy boy was his best in my case and i would watch over and over again and laugh at the same part each time. thank you chris farley.

this is one of my most favorite movies of all time. pretty pathetic you say? well, yeah it is. but chris is incredibly, incredibly funny. his innocent brilliance comes out in this film more than in any of his other films. look at both motel scenes, when spade gets caught with his zipper down, and the other: "just go away for the love of god!!!"

one of the funniest movies made in recent years. good characterization, plot and exceptional chemistry make this one a classic

the one-liners fly so fast in this movie that you can watch it over and over and still catch new ones. by far one of the best of this genre.

farley and spade's best work ever. it's one of the all-around funniest movies i've ever seen. watch it once and you'll be hooked and soon have all the lines memorized. no sleepy for tommy boy!

for fans of chris farley, this is probably his best film. david spade plays the perfect cynical, sarcastic yin to farley's "baby huey" yang. farley achieves strokes of comic genius in his monologues, like the "let's say you're driving along the road with your family..." bit, the "jo-jo the idiot circus boy with a pretty new pet, (his possible sale)" speech, or the "glue-sniffing guarantee fairy" brake pad sale. the sappy moments in the film contrast sharply with farley and spade's shenanigans. even after many viewings, it's still fun to see farley pour everything he had into the role. "richard, what's happening to me?!?!"

this movie probably isn't the funniest i've ever seen, and it certainly doesn't have much redeeming value. in fact, it is really nothing more than a collection of vignettes tied together by a loose plot. however, this "make-it-up-as-i-go-along" attitude actually works to the film's advantage. "tommy boy" succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that the snl skits farley and spade starred in succeeded: their well-timed extemporaneous silliness and mayhem makes them humorous despite their immaturity.

well, of course the critics hated it. this isn't a movie that's going for the big-time critical acclaim. but the fact is that it's really very good.sure, if you don't like that chris farley brand of physical comedy, or the exceedingly dry wit of david spade, you're not going to like it. but for the rest of us, the movie has many hilarious, and for that matter quotable, sequences, and the plot isn't half as dumb as that of "black sheep." the parts that aren't meant to be humorous are actually done well, not what you'd expect from a movie of this ilk, and the acting is really pretty good."tommy boy" is without question chris farley's best movie. i give it an a and suggest you give it a view.

out of the many films i've seen, tommy boy is a rare film where i can watch it over and over and it's still funny. david spade and the late chris farley do their best in this film and is a must-see by anyone who's a fan of the spade-farley duo.

i have seen several yul brynner films--yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls, smiles, and laughs. brynner might have been equally arresting in ten commandments, taras bulba, the magnificent seven, the brother karamazov and the mad woman of chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one. he is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shot.equally fascinating and sexy, without removing her clothes, is deborah kerr. the script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive--she reprised this sort of role years later in the night of iguana. the film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the russians in fact she is shown as running away from the russian major (in contrast to the maupassant story or the isak denisen story). yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the kerr character.kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view, but she is a superb actress. she puts her soul into dignifying the characters that she portrays, which often clashes with the spirit of the character. it is this contradiction that makes her roles in the journey, quo vadis, and the night of iguana memorable.why is this an unusual film? it is not easy in hollywood to see russian characters portrayed as good people--dr zhivago was an exception. brynner's romance of a horse thief was again great cinema by abraham polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards leftists in the post-mccarthy era.the film is also unusual in its casting--great french actors gerard oury and anouk aimee--rub shoulders with jason robards jr and british actor robert morley. in many ways the film is international than american. all four are great actors and add to the entertainment.those who have read maupassant and denisen's works will find the film is not true to either work. yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized (censored?) version has a dignified charm of its own--provided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group. i think litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film, while entwining bits of both written tales (e.g. the last bus ride and the final kiss)but i do have one grouse--why do hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories? only recently (e.g., insomnia) have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits.

set during the hungarian revolution of 1956, this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigners attempt to smuggle jason robards out of hungary into austria. however, three things complement the story, making this an extremely good movie.first, the actors use the actual languages of their roles. the russian soldiers speak only russian; the hungarians only hungarian; the germans only german, except to the minimal extent to tell the story. since debra kerr is english, she speaks only english, and, of course, yul brynner and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily accented english. as a result, the empathy of the audience to the travelers becomes paramount. the viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when he/she cannot understand any of the languages spoken around them. very powerful feelings are aroused in the audience, and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign languages, the audience is never at a loss for following the film. no subtitles are necessary.second. i was in hungary in 1995, and i'm telling you, this movie has it right on. from the gypsy music overpowering the dinner meal to the underground caverns in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes, the realism is incredible. if i didn't eat in the actual restaurant in the movie, i ate at its double. i thought that i actually walked down the main street in that village. (actually, the film was shot in austria).third, and most important, this movie reunites deberah kerr and yul brynner (after the king and i) and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of oscar qualified. of course, yul already received an oscar for playing that relationship, so the acadamy wasn't going to give him another one, but that is the quality of the film. don't miss this one.

yes, i know that this movie is meant as a comedy! and the humor is over the top! but the theme about people getting less intelligent in future time might not be so far fetched! i cannot say that it will happen,but if we don't take proper care of our educational system than this could be a possibility! i have noticed that some schools aren't teaching facts anymore! (like history,geography,basic stuff). the focus is more on learning practical abilities! the theory behind most subjects may be boring but is essential in understanding how things work! in the movie there is this ridiculous example of people growing crops with gatorade in stead of water! well,we can laugh about it! but if you never been taught that water contains minerals necessary for plants to grow so how would you know! to me this is a scary notion! so now you understand why this subject isn't funny anymore! it could be that mike judge is making fun but at the same time is warning people for a real disaster if education doesn't improve fast! am i taking this movie too seriously! yes of course! to each his own fun! i loved mike judge's work (beavis and butthead and office space)! in these he was able to be critical and funny at the same time! in "idiocracy" i missed this! most of the events are too absurd and as i said earlier very scary! i do think if you are in the mood you will like this movie!

this must be the dumbest movie i've ever seen and therefor it deserves a special award. ok, so it begins pretty good, logical, humor and then rapidly changes to complete and utter uh f@rt,@ss, f√∂ck stupidity that makes total sense. the strange thing is that i hardly laughed at it, though i guess it is supposed to be funny, with a very serious message. after a moment of thought why i didn't laugh, the answer was pretty clear... this movie is a lot more realistic then i would like it to be. so it is extremely dumb, yet very wise if the object was to reach people which aren't 'blessed' with a whole lot of neurons and synapses and electrolytes (huh, electrolytes?). this movie might actually be understood at some level by a big audience!although they probably just laugh.ah well, nice try...i am now editing (well adding to) my comment, cause i read some of the other comments. first i noticed some people see racism in this movie. well, that did not at all cross my mind when watching it. however, i can imagine if you are looking from that perspective, you will see some. we could of course debate the link between intelligence and race, but i think this is not the place to do so. i wonder, if we were to rate the huxtable family here, would you complain about them all being black? i don't think so, but i guess you could... (aside from that, from the 2 wisest people in the world, half, the woman, doesn't seem totally caucasian to me, so 'what the problem is?')secondly the movie gets very mixed ratings; from 1's to 10's and everything in between, but a lot of polarisation there, which means the movie does its job very well! it stirrs people up, makes them want to speak about it and judge it. that means it is a good movie, whether you like it or hate it. after 5 minutes it becomes very predictive and boring even, yet you keep watching this utter crap. i guess you keep hoping that it isn't so. or maybe it's our sick way to look at terrible accidents. well, this is one for sure.

i had never heard of this film when a good friend recommended it. i trust this friend's taste, so i purchased the dvd. my wife and i sat down to watch it with no knowledge of what it was about. i thought it was the funniest film i have seen in a long time, mainly because i saw the truth in the satire. i strongly recommend this film to all my friends.this is not a film for everyone. some people will see the crass humor and aura of stupidity, and find idiocracy to be one of the stupidest movies they have seen. what these people don't seem to understand is that the crass humor is there, not to amuse the audience, but to show what appeals to the morons in the future.luke wilson is well cast as an "average joe." he is mainly there to be a foible for the biting commentary about society that is spread throughout this film. many of the funnier bits are in the background, so it is easily worth seeing several times. what makes the movie even funnier, and more scary, is that i see elements of it in every day life, in people i meet or on the media. then, i go back and re-watch idiocracy, and realize how good it is.the few people who have seen and enjoyed this film are able to be part of an elite club. i'll see an advertisement for some product with some breakthrough new ingredient, and turn to my wife and say, "it's got electrolytes!" she knows exactly what i am saying.

i am rating this an 8 because of the premise of the film. the acting was fine, there wasn't anyone that stood out as amazing or appalling. it is disturbingly true that intelligent people are having less and less children, or choose to have none at all...whereas dumb ass "w in '04" supporters are procreating like rabbits. and, though i don't believe the earth will actually exist in 500 years, i can see mike judge's parodied prophet coming to be, as life imitating art. the world is being run by idiots, and it will get worse as the intelligent free-thinking people become the minority and the "git 'er done" fans outnumber them. the proof is our farce of an election.but i digress. if you are fortunate enough to have this playing in your city, go see it. i have paid my $7.50 plus popcorn to see far worse rubbish than this (date movie or napoleon dynamite anyone?). there are laughs, there are cringes, but overall this is entertaining. if you have half a brain, you will think to yourself how this movie, though funny, is spot on (accurate) and a *tiny* bit uncanny. i'm not surprised at all that this movie is almost completely unknown, as fox was the one distributing this, and they wouldn't want any of their sheep to see this and think "maybe i will read a book, and not watch 'next', or 'cheaters', or 'ow my balls'." if our society doesn't stop the dumbing down of everything,and the bastardisation of the english language (ahem, mr. bush), then this really is where we are going.

this movie is brilliant.i don't remember this movie even being in theaters, so thinking it was a "straight to dvd" i have fairly low expectations, even though i am a big fan of mike judge. it has some of the same kind of comic future satire as "brazil" and "demolition man", but taken to the next level.then i saw the cast; luke wilson, maya rudolph and dax shepard, who were all brilliant in their roles.needless to say, this movie won me over in the first 5 minutes, where it shows above-average people having fewer children and the poorest, stupidest, trashiest people having lots of ignorant children, and how this is leading to a kind of reverse evolution. it takes that concept, and then shows where we are headed with this pollution of the gene pool.sadly, i don't think it will take the 500 years as depicted, but probably only about 50. i already see the shocking rise of "mild retardation" in the general populace, media and culture. people who like classical music and art are ridiculed instead of respected. the lowest common denominator seems to rule, especially in hollywood and on tv (eg, "jackass the movie" and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or humiliate yourself for money).all of the political/social satire aside, this movie is also just laugh out loud funny! and i don't say that lightly; few movies make me actually "lol", but this one did.a lot of the best jokes are word/sight gags in the background, so you really have to pay attention to get some of them. i even had to pause and zoom in for a few of them (like when joe got his government id and for "hair" it said "yes" and for "eyes" it also said "yes"). also, the prison has engraved on the front "house for particular individuals", since the cops in the movie (much like real life cops) call everyone "individuals" instead of people, etc. again, this was on the screen for just a moment...this is one of those movies you can watch again and again and dissect it to get through the layers of funny.also, i normally watch movies with the subtitles on, and that clued me in to some jokes that might pass by your ears in the dialog mix, for instance, the police constantly talk about people "excaping" instead of "escaping", and there are many other mis-pronunciations that just cracked me up. but again, i might not have picked up on them just by the dialog mixed with music/sound effects; it is very subtle but still hilarious.additionally, the special effects were really good for a sci-fi/social satire.i could go on and on, but overall, i think this is one of those movies that if you don't think it's funny, it's probably making fun of you! i plan on recommending this to many, many people!

you can read all kinds of references into the world of idiocracy. a futuristic world populated by pampered, self-indulgent morons spoon-fed by the technology of a bygone era: this idea has its precedent in h.g. wells' "the time machine" and aldous huxley's "brave new world" amongst other satires.early in the film, a narrator explains the quick degradation of humanity over five hundred years, but does not fill in the gaps of where all the futuristic technology came from in the meanwhile. most of the criticism of this very fun (and funny) film seems to surround this omission, and the resulting complaint that the world isn't "realistic". as if "realism" has ever been a necessary quality of satire. is "brazil" realistic? how about "futurama" or "transmetropolitan"? hell, how about "gulliver's travels"? i thought not. "idiocracy", while maybe not as pointed as the best of the genre, hits the same notes and generally does so successfully.besides, i didn't find the futuristic technology to be a problem. it is pretty easy to figure out that mike judge is satirizing the current trend toward automation and simple product interfaces, so that even total idiots can use them. as in "brave new world", the society in the film seems to have reached a point of automated self-sufficiency at some point in the past (apparently created by the now-extinct 'smart people' in order to placate an increasingly stupid populace), leaving the remainder of humanity free to indulge all the worst, most selfish impulses they can come up with, and grow even stupider. the film just happens to take place during the last gasp of humanity, as everything begins to fall apart for good. it may still be "unrealistic", but if so, it's a remarkably well-presented brand of unrealism.the stupid people take up most of the screen time, of course, but they're just the victims -- they don't know any better. mike judge saves his real hate for the intelligent people in power who are dead by the time the film begins, but who are very much alive right now, in the 21st century. people like scientists who chase "hair growth and prolonged erections" for no other reason than the possibility that they'll turn a profit on their snake-oil treatments. people like politicians who let corporations simply purchase the fda and fcc. people like media executives and their yuppie stooges who promote stupidity -- who enable the destruction of all culture, morality and health to make a quick buck.after all, who is really to blame, the morlocks or the eloi? the paris hiltons of the world, or the brilliant executives and advertisers that put her on tv and lowered our cultural standards enough to leave her there? this is all implicit in "idiocracy", though. a line here, a hint there (witness the hilarious auto-doctor which literally does all the work in the health care system). it's one of the few aspects of the movie that's not pounded into the ground by the unnecessary narrator. it's just there for the viewer to pick up, or not, but it is one of the most interesting themes in a movie that's much smarter than any other comedy of the year.pity that so many people will leave the film thinking it's just an excuse to show rear ends farting and people being hit in the groin. not that that stuff isn't funny too, and maybe it is a little pandering. but in "idiocracy", it's just not as simple as it seems.

mike judge's idiocracy is an interesting film, and one that his fans will undoubtedly track down and see.before i start the review, i would preface it by saying that if you get a chance to see it, definitely do, as it is worth watching, and isn't the easiest film in the world to track down.let's start with the premise - luke wilson is private joe bauers, an army librarian who is deemed to have absolutely no outstanding attributes or glaring flaws, making him totally average in every way. this, along with the fact that he has no living relatives, makes him a standout candidate for an experimental cryogenics procedure. also frozen with joe is a prostitute named rita who was pimped to the project by upgrayedd, her abusive pimp. unfortunately, a few days after they are frozen, the top secret project is abandoned, and they are forgotten about.they wake up in 2505, and find that with the dumbing down of society following the trends of recent times, everyone on earth is only slightly more intelligent than a chimp. the way that "everyman" joe bauers talks is seen as being "faggy", much as someone speaking like shakespeare would ridiculed now, and a former professional wrestler is the president of the united states (actually, this one probably isn't that outrageous really). the best show on tv is called "ow! my balls!", which admittedly sounds pretty good, and not only is everything spelled wrong, but signs seem to have run out of space for the wording, leaving them to be bunched up at the end.it's a funny premise for film, but this is the problem - aside from the initial premise, not that much in the movie is truly funny. what i mean by that is that the ideas that come to mind from having read the premise of the film are probably about as funny as the film itself. obviously, it's not terrible, but it probably could have been funnier.there are some winners in the script, such as starbucks now offering "happy endings", and people placing their blind faith in the universally misunderstood "electrolytes", but they are just too few and far between, so unless you are going to laugh hysterically every time one of the idiots of the future slurs out a slack-jawed, profanity laden sentence with little to no logic and/or intelligence, then the laughs might be pretty well spaced.it's unfair for everyone to be comparing it to office space, because it's a very different film, but as a film, regardless of what came before it, idiocracy is a funny concept that will probably have you laughing a lot more in the opening 15-20 minutes than in the rest of the film.i give it 5 out of 10 because it is enjoyable, but doesn't do enough to raise it above middle of the road.

most people are totally unaware that this movie exists. fox, which paid judge to make it, has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it. i guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer. well, i am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe. basically, judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin. then these stupid are getting more stupid, by basically spending all of their time watching tv and having sex, which produces more stupid people. by 2500, a person of average intelligence today, will appear to be a genius, that talks "all faggy." seriously, is this really that hard to believe. oh sure, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. luke wilson is great as the time traveling army guy, hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time. where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one-liners, like "can we family style her" and "hey man, i'm 'bating here!" this is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an american society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure, comfort and stupidity, and i guarantee you that i will be buying this on dvd the first day it comes out and watching it over and over.

"the journey" is a romantic version of the cold war. it's about an english woman (deborah kerr) trying to smuggle her former love, a hungarian scientist (jason robards, jr.), out of hungary during the hungary revolt in 1956. she's on board a bus with thirteen other international people who are trying to get out of hungary through the austrian border.of course, the bus gets stopped by the russians for a security check. the russian officer-in-charge (yul brynner) becomes attracted to the english woman (deborah kerr)and delays the trip. of course, the russian officer knows the truth about the hungarian scientist posing as a british citizen, but he decides not to arrest the scientist because he is waiting for the english woman to come to him. of course, this all sounds absurd, but it is a fun movie to watch. despite the romantic flow of dialogue between mr. brynner and ms. kerr, which seems inappropriate in the situation that they are in, the movie becomes suspenseful and interesting. the good acting overrides some of the silly dialogue. perhaps, some people involved in the hungarian revolt would not appreciate this movie; they would consider it a piece of fluff. this is my favorite yul brynner role. he speaks with his own, masculine voice and is very attractive, especially when he becomes vulnerable. this is deborah kerr's second time working with yul brynner since they made "the king and i" in 1956. they make a very attractive couple. too bad they never worked again. this was the second sexy role ms. kerr took since "from here to eternity". despite the fact that ms. kerr was wearing heavy winter clothes throughout the movie, she was very beautiful and sensual. the fine supporting cast was headed by jason robards, jr., in his first film role. some of the international cast were recognizable, like for instance, robert morley from england. however, the rest of the actors, i have never seen before or since, were just great in the movie. in the background, it was fun to see senta berger, as one of the maids, speak a few lines of hungarian. a few years later in 1966, she was in a movie, "cast a giant shadow", with yul brynner as his leading lady. she is still working today.

we just saw this movie in austin texas at the alamo south lamar yesterday afternoon. it had me laughing out loud many times! the scene about albert einstein's thoughts on humanity hit me over and over and i couldn't stop laughing. it's too bad it's not in more theaters, i know a lot of friends that are dieing to see this movie! "welcome to costco, i love you." ... great work to all involved! also, if you see it, make sure to stay until the end of the credits as well! i'm going to take my family to see it again this weekend for sure! if you're a fan of office space and beavis and butthead then you have to go see this movie. it's a classic and no one knows that it's out! so if you're in the mood to see something funny this weekend, definitely check it out.

there is a lot wrong with this film. i will not lie. i will say that most of the problems feel like they stem from a budget that was chopped out from underneath the flick, and some bad hack job editing.this is not office space. do not go in expecting office space levels of comedy. it is very funny though. it is a mess, but very funny at the same time. a funny mess of a film. in the way that caddyshack is funny. a mess of unrelated funny scenes filled with some very annoying unfunny scenes.it works as a whole though, and it certainly deserves a wide release. this is the best commentary on the wal mart/ starbucks/ mtv nation you could hope for. the very fact that a film is exploring the idea that dumb people are breeding at an alarming rate while the intelligent people are not, is great in my book. not very politically correct but worth at least some debate.

this movie is "the" stupid comedy of the year, and quite possibly the best thing from mike judge since "office space". if you are a mike judge fan, or enjoy shows like futurama, then you are doing yourself a grave disservice by skipping over this little known, limited release. although the dvd touts very few "bonus features", this film is certainly funny enough to make up for it's perceived "lack of value".this movie is about an army grunt by the name of joe bowers (played by luke wilson) who is part of a top secret army experiment designed to preserve army personnel in peace time so that they can be thawed in war time to fight for our country. however, things take an interesting turn as the general in charge of the operation is busted in a prostitution ring and the experiment is all but forgotten. bowers, and his sidekick rita (played by maya rudolph) both find themselves awake in the year 2505, where through the course of natural selection, the population of america has grown increasingly stupid. now joe and rita have to find their way to a time machine to get back to the year 2005 with the help of frito (played by dax shepard).what i really enjoyed about this movie was mike judge's comedic satire on the course of us history over the last 50 years, and how mankind progresses over the subsequent 500 years. this is most evidenced by the advertising in the movie, which has become a staple of the american culture. with shows like south park in the mainstream media, it's easy to see how conclusions could be drawn that in the future, profanity has become a marketing tool. this is portrayed in the film humorously with subtle things such as "fudd-ruckers" changing their name to "butt-f###ers", and a billboard which displays the advertisement "if you don't smoke tarryltons... f### you!". i also cannot stop laughing at carls jr.'s role in this future, with their slogan "f### you... i'm eating", and their automated kiosks self-advertising their "extra big-a## tacos". (with more molecules)! this film contained everything i go to the movies for. excellent, sharp, witty comedy, as well as an engrossing plot make this dvd one for the ages. be warned, however. if you are not a fan of mike judge, did not care for "beavis and butthead", or do not have a sense of humor, then this movie probably isn't a good match for you. otherwise, i would say this is probably the funniest movie to come out of 2506... i mean 2006.

first, let me say that although i generally appreciate mike judge's work, i've been merely tepid in my response to office space, king of the hill, and beavis and butthead. i generally prefer more intelligent comedy, and therein lies the irony with respect to idiocracy.in a future world where the embodiment of beavis and butthead's views, basest instincts, and intellectual capacities are the framework of a chaotic, messy, semi-mad max semi-blade runner society, where every trailer-trash guy's fantasy becomes reality, a man with even average intelligence is threatening and accused of talking gay, and the mob mentality takes over. and this world is also incredibly funny.yes, it's obvious that carl's jr., starbucks, costco and fuddruckers executives will be horrified at the twisted values given their products in the year 2505.there were some missed opportunities with the film, and the relationship between the time travelers - the other being an average intelligence woman who's worried about her boyfriend's (pimp's) retribution - could have been stronger; the chemistry is there. and there don't seem to be too many women in the future.i did leave with a grin on my face, but the experience is a bit better than the memories. thus, it's my kind of popcorn film, and it will be fun to revisit on video. recommended! fyi stay through the credits for an extra scene.

"idiocracy" is the latest film to come from mike "office space" judge, and it certainly follows a similar theme of that film in the fact that it is an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity... relatively speaking. it is a story about joe bauer (luke wilson), who is, quite literally, the most average guy in existence. joe, and a prostitute named rita (maya rudolph), become the test subjects for a military project of a hibernation chamber. they were to remain suspended for only one year, but due to lack of oversight, joe and rita are forgotten about and accidentally wake up 500 years in the future.here's the scary part: this film explains, in a very realistic and plausible way, how the entire population of 2505 became absolutely retarded. with no natural predators, the evolution of the human species does not necessarily favor the quickest, smartest, and strongest people for progression of genes... just the people who breed the most. unfortunately, those people happen to be welfare-sucking, trailer trash idiots who breed like rabbits. this abundant reproduction of the stupid people has caused an adverse effect on societal growth and now joe and rita are the two smartest human beings on the face of the planet. if it helps, imagine the entire population as just a hybrid of rednecks, jocks, cholos and hoochies. seeing this nightmarish dystopia, joe learns of and attempts to track down a time machine to see if he and rita can get back to when they came from, and that's basically the whole plot.but despite how one-dimensional i may make it sound, this movie is higher brow than you can fathom. nuances are everywhere and anyone can see glimpses (warning signs, if you will) of modern day dumb-ciety permeating facets of everyday life and turning it into the train wreck on display in "idiocracy." the film has some truly awesome showcases of realistic retardedness put on a pedestal. i don't want to give anything away and ruin jokes for you, but let's just say that it is pretty thorough. i can see how some would say that it is just a lot of toilet humor, but it, odd as it may seem, has a purpose; to show how dumb and crass these people are.this film, unfortunately, is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor, "office space"; no one will see it in theaters, but everyone will brag about discovering this awesome/funny movie when it comes out on video. my only complaint for the film would be that the flow of the narrative sometimes gets broken so they can do a hitchhiker's-guide-to-the-galaxy type exposition on how things got to be where they are, but it is a necessary evil and is implemented better here. other than that, good characters, funny jokes, and better-than-average social commentary wrapped up in a funny bow.final note: if seeing our youth becoming gang-banger wanna-be's, acting like redneck/ ghetto trash and being proud of it... if you are educated and cultured in anyway and can see how our country is spiraling out of control into an abyss of stupidity, for god sakes, watch this movie.

i've never seen a movie get a worse release then this. and that's a shame, as this is the funniest film of the year! you would think an ad with the line "from the director of "office space"" would be enough to warrant a big release! but there are no ads, no posters, no website , i doubt the stars even knew it came out this weekend. what is 20th century fox thinking? mike judge's sci-fi comedy is set in 2505 but it could come true in about 10 years (if things continue as they are.) luke wilson and maya rudolph get frozen in a top secret army experiment and wake up in a future full of consumer zombie inbred retards. the film reminds me of woody allen's "sleeper" ,"robocop", "planet of the apes", "blade runner" and "network" and the late great "futurama". try to see it before fox burns all the prints!

a lot of things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically funny than actually funny (though it does have some laugh-out-loud moments) but a lot of that is because it seems to have been cut by the studio to better appeal to exactly the idiots it's mocking. many situations aren't allowed to develop, there's obvious overdubbing of expository material, and worst of all a narrator explains everything (most of which needs no explanation), probably because some preview audience didn't understand what was going on. in other words, a movie about dumbing down has been... you guessed it.one hopes that a longer, better version of this comedy will eventually surface on dvd, and it will become the cult fave it deserves to be, but even in this mutilated and somewhat comic- spirit-diminished form it's one of the more memorable films of the year-- a screech of disgust against our culture and all the ways it's become trashified, stupidified and uglified in the name of appealing to the yahoos. i watched it right after land of the dead, george romero's latest milking of the single idea that consumers = zombies, which is basically the same point judge is making; yet where romero's counterculture viewpoint (now zombies = underclass that needs to revolt against the rich) seems hopelessly out of date, judge's take is fresh, dead-on and far more disturbing. just listen to the yahoos in your movie audience whooping it up for president camacho's state of the union just like their counterparts on screen, and you'll know that we're all doomed.

as social satire, idiocracy is just as good as office space, but with a wider scope. to criticize this film as too puerile due to potty humor is to kind of miss the point, i think. there are certainly fart jokes etc., but they're not really intended to be funny to the audience - they exist to define the state of "culture" in the world of 2500 ad visited by joe, as a background to the bizarre state of affairs in which he awakes. the real humor of the film lies in the many sight gags and attitudes present in this future society that are just a shade off of what we encounter in our daily lives, and which should serve as a warning. my personal favorite is the depiction of fox news. the subtle brilliance in the film lies in the fact that it also digs at "smart" people, and average joes like the protagonists. note the times in the film when joe and rita almost subconsciously conform to the idiots around them, and you realize that idiocracy is not created to pick on any group of people in particular, but on the culture of idiocy in general. i don't know what to say about the "made for conspiracy theory" behavior of fox in releasing this film, but if it's not playing in your local theater, demand it. we all need to see this film, if not for the social commentary, at least for the fart jokes...

i'm not sure why there are no articles or posters or anything about this film because i just saw it and thought it was awesome. i guess it's not for everyone because it's basically kafka's "the trial" meets "beevis and butt-head", which is a pretty tough combination to swallow. still, i thought it was great. if you're going to see it because you want a sequel to office space you're probably going to be disappointed. but if you want to see one of the most brutal, acid-tongued, and hilariously honest looks at where our society is headed you're in for a treat. i just saw the 8pm show opening night in los angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater, which means the film will probably be gone in a week. that's really a shame because, in its own way, idiocracy is one of the best satires to come along in quite a while. but then again it's basically making fun of the people who make up about 99% of the movie-going audience so i guess it's no wonder the studio panicked and tried to dump it.

shame on fox for dumping this movie. it was a total riot and i only hope that it will find a second life on dvd and cable.this is a hilarious satire. it takes the "what if" situation to an extreme and it doesn't pull any punches (or kicks to the groin). it makes you think... what is to become of this empire once we've gotten totally to lazy and stupid? everyone gets hit in this one esp. a number of major corporations, and even fox news takes a punch(which is probably why the movie never had a proper release - other than the marketing department over thinking the campaign and not knowing how to market it "so we'll just give up!") some may find the movie sophomoric, due to the groin kicking, and farting, but the movie is much more than that. you either get what mike judge is saying, or you don't. most of the negative reviews i've read seem to come from people who just don't get it or are film snobs.it'll probably play for one week in the selected markets so if you miss it, keep an eye out for the dvd, it'll be worth the rental and i will eventually have it in my collection.good job mike judge, it's a shame that you got screwed, but you made me laugh out loud and i look forward to the next movie you do.

i have watch this movie almost every night that is was on hbo. it is of my opinion that it could have been successful in the theater, providing the advertisement leading up to it was top scale. i was thoroughly impressed with the actress who played nanny. she is an outstanding actress. of course, my favorite actor is terrance howard. he is a very understated actor and he deserves much more credit than he has received. ebony magazine did do a nice article on him, giving him some of his due propers. lakawanna blue, gave me a understanding of the stories my parents use to tell us. they were from a similar town "philadelphia, pa" were they had to have their fun in the junt joints and such. i also like to say that mos def is a incredible actor. he has found his calling. i've seen him in several movies where he has played a variety of roles, from thug to doctor and he has the stuff! overall, please put lakawanna blues on video for rental.

set in hungary in november 1956, this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to leave the country at the time of the uprising.once the airport is closed, the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to austria. as would be obvious, they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost faultless yul brynner whose military power as a red army major was marked with loneliness, his internal struggle between right and wrong, his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings. he was saddened by the fact that his job had alienated him from his friends and enemies alike and he yearned for social contact.robert morley plays the quintessential stiff upper-lipped englishman who, no matter how serious the role, manages to maintain an almost light-hearted logical outlook on life while jason robards has a stunning movie debut which enforces the reason why he had so many roles throughout his career. deborah kerr, as the leading lady, exhibits the grace and femininity we have come to associate with her yet manages to bring over the strength and resolve required for her character.the film deals with a very tempestuous time in european history but it never ceases to remind us that there is good in all of us and you can never completely judge a book by the cover. fabulous scriptwriting ensures that for all the seriousness of the subject there can still be great one-liners and comedic instances that add to, rather than detract from the movie. the chemistry in the cat and mouse game between kerr and brynner makes you understand why they appeared in more than the one film together.all in all, a thoroughly engrossing movie which i would definitely watch again. 8/10

let me start by saying that if you're expecting subtle humour, you're in the wrong theatre. it's low-brow and heavy-hitting. but he's not out to tickle your funny bone. he's got the sledgehammer out and he's drawn a bead on the side of your head. but fear not. as movies go, this is a fairly gentle education. oh, also, heavy on the swearing, but once again, mike judge, not fred rogers.was this movie called 'intelliocracy'? f*** no. the gem, the essence that is mike judge is that he has the ability to make people laugh at themselves. beavis and butthead was most popular with teen-aged boys, the very people at which it incessantly poked fun.with that in mind, i don't think the humour in this movie is aimed at the super intelligent. maybe you are all too smart to get it. but he's not aiming at you. he's aiming at your average joe. and he's got a message: get your act together and for god's sake, study botany! it is a little disjointed and the narrator gets to be a little irritating after a while, but once again, this movie is meant for people who need a lot of narration ;-) it's funny. it has a message that it wants to make sure that we all understand.i question the casting of luke wilson in the role of a man with a 100 iq. sometimes, he's not able to play down (what's he got, like, a 104?) to the level of his character. slightly forced at times.kudos on dax shepard in this one. i remember seeing him in zathura and thinking, "this guys looks like an idiot." in this movie, he makes a great idiot. maybe i'm psychic.it took a while to warm up to maya rudolph, but i gave her a little leeway. after all, she did have to play straight man to an entire planet. but once she got a little screen time, she made a solid contribution.terry crews played the same psychotic, aggressive character he's played many times before, but he makes a first-rate president none the less.another bonus is that the place was practically empty. counting my girlfriend and i, there were literally six people in the theatre. we could've had a barbecue pit and a mariachi band. so, no annoying people talking, as appears to be the norm in the 'talking-to-the-tv' age.all in all, a good premise and a competent delivery, given the intended goal. lots of laughs sprinkled throughout.what made this movie scary was the fact that when we walked out of the theatre, it was sort of like the movie was still playing. we saw a lot of idiocy in the people immediately around us, maybe made more apparent by the dose we got in the theatre....they're all pods, all of them!

this movie was quite a pleasant surprise. i had anticipated it for a long time, and was afraid going in that it couldn't possibly live up to my expectations.it exceeded them.i adored this movie.hilarious from start to finish (stay until after the end credits!), it is absolutely remarkable how a movie about dumb and annoying characters can be so intelligent, witty, and engaging.with it's obvious matte paintings, the movie's future earth recalls the planet of the apes series and other sci-fi movies of that era.in fact, this movie is essentially planet of the apes, but with people who are the mental equivalent of apes.it moves at a fairly brisk pace, and luke wilson carries the movie quite well, with a character that recalls the one he played in "bottle rocket." (there's even a not-so-subtle nod to "bottle rocket" in an early scene).maya rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former "painter" who was frozen as well.despite all its strengths, "idiocracy" has the distinct feel of a movie that was taken away from the director/editor before it could be fine-tuned.i cannot for the life of me understand why a movie this funny would just be dumped into a few theaters with no advanced screenings, no trailers, no marketing whatsoever.it's as if the studio decided they were not going to spend any more on it and just walked away.or maybe they thought the movie had the makings of a cult classic, and the only way for it to become a true cult classic was to set it up to fail? whatever the case, it is a shame, because mike judge and this film in particular deserve better.i predict this movie will have real legs on dvd, and word of mouth will propel it to the success it deserves.perhaps the fox executives saw themselves in the characters, were confused, and thought it was a documentary?

there's no other word for it...fox dumped this out, with no marketing of any kind. nobody in the country, other than those who have been looking forward to this film, know anything about it. all the red flags have flown. it has to be a mess, it can't be anywhere near as good as office space, right? wrong. though office space it ain't, this film definitely has satirical bite and wit. it's a misfire on certain levels, but who's to blame is left to mystery.based on what is currently showing in theatres, i can say idiocracy is a good movie. it's funny, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. it's effective, sometimes ingenious. what it isn't as far as i can tell, is finished. we will see something come of this film again, whether it's an extended cut or reshoots. alone it can be hilarious. it's ballsy at times.leaving the theatre, looking around at the mall, i was surrounded by advertisements and billboards, commercialism and stupidity. it's not quite as damning a dystopia as 1984, but this movie paints an ugly future for our culture. and there doesn't seem to be much anybody can do about it. anyway, go see this if you can and try to find out what happened that it was so specifically buried.

a good x evil film with tastes of "james bond", "romeo and juliet", and, maybe, even "star wars".the evil count von bruno receives an english gentleman as a guest for a very dangerous hunt. elga, the beautiful simple and well intentioned lady that was forced to marry the count provides the love triangle. the count missing eye points to a terrible past. the englishman is not what the count thinks and is a terrible treat to him. there is also the terrible hunchback, crocodiles and even the side appearance of some torture instruments.boris karlloff, here in a support role, makes an strong, but somewhat stiff, presence. the other actors (and direction) are the symbol of an era the strong representations of black and white movies. since the beginning there is no doubt of who is the evil guy, who is the good one. even traitors and stiffs can be identified somewhat easily.

the black castle is one of those film's that has found its way into a boris karloff collection and is mistakenly expected to be an outright horror movie. whilst some horror elements exist within nathan juran's movie, this really is a multi genre piece that's tightly produced and effectively portrayed. joining karloff, in what is a small but critical role, are richard greene, stephen mcnally, lon chaney jr, rita corday, john hoyt & michael pate. it's produced, unsurprisingly, out of universal international pictures. the plot sees greene's english gentleman travel to the castle home of the sinister count von bruno {mcnally}. he's following an investigation into the disappearance of two friends, an investigation that is fraught with danger and surprise at every turn.this has everything that fans of the old dark house/castle sub-genre could wish for. genuine good and bad guys, a fair maiden, dark corners for doing dark deeds, devilish traps, ticking clock finale and we even get a good old fashioned bit of swashbuckling into the bargain. the cast are all turning in effective performances, particularly greene and the wonderfully sneering mcnally. whilst jerry sackheim's writing is lean and devoid of the pointless filler that has so often bogged down similar film's of this ilk. a very recommended film on proviso that karloff fans understand it's not really a karloff movie, and perhaps more importantly, that horror fans don't expect blood letting to be the order of the day. a fine atmospheric story with a sense of dread throughout, the black castle is a fine viewing experience. 7/10

when i saw lon chaney, jr. and boris karloff in the cast, i was expecting to find a typically "schlocky" 1950's style horror movie. the opening scene (a graveyard with a wolf howling in the background) seemed to confirm this. once i began watching it, though, what i discovered was a nifty little mystery about an englishman (richard green) seeking to discover what had happened to two of his friends who had disappeared in the black forest and, if necessary, to take revenge against the evil count (stephen mcnally) who ruled the territory. chaney, as the voiceless gargon, had a rather limited role (one which reminded me of the hunchback of notre dame, actually) while karloff had a somewhat more substantial role as dr. meissen. in fact, meissen was one of the more interesting characters in the movie, and it was difficult to know until the very end whether he would be established to be a good guy or a bad guy! the castle set was magnificent, and even the limited depiction of the black forest was real enough. it certainly didn't come across as low-budget, compared to other movies i've seen anyway. the only disappointment, i thought, was rita corday's performance as the countess. she seemed somewhat dry and didn't seem to put much passion into the role.that aside, i found that this movie held my attention throughout, and there was enough suspense about how this was all going to turn out to make it well worth the watching. definitely recommended, with a 7/10 rating.

this is the ultimate, and i mean the ultimate, adventure classic! the plot is good versus evil. there have always been an abundance of films that depict gray areas, and not enough on the basic good against evil to account for the real cases of good against evil in the real world. only recently have film makers tried to even the odds. in real life well over half of situations are black and white, but only a fraction of movies make it seem that way. this movie is the best example of a back and white look. it is best seen in black and white. the hero is in the worst situation. he is in the territory of a man who wants to murder him, and among various enemies. the movie gives the feel that he is hopelessly outnumbered, and can't count on help. his enemy (the count), has numerous resources. the count's wife was forced into marriage with him, and she knows from his past history that sooner or later he will kill her as he does all his wives. she and the hero become allies and fall in love in away that could win over anyone watching (unless that person just wants to be a contrary brat). anyone who helps them is killed. they have no escape. the situation is hopeless. so will they survive in the end? you won't guess unless you've read spoilers. the movie also has a lot of great atmosphere, adventure, and intrigue, along with lon chaney as a bad guy, and boris karloff in his best role ever, as a decent guy. usually cast as a bad guy, karloff was at his best when presented with more complex roles such as this one. chaney was rarely given a complex role, although he strutted his stuff in a few movies such as "of mice and men." this is little more than a cameo for him. still, the tension never stops. there is suspense and danger throughout. perfectly written, perfectly cast, and perfectly directed. this is what a movie should be-pure escape, pure adventure.

the best thing -- and that's pretty good -- about the black castle is that it's a black-and- white forties' gothic grabber featuring a murderous mad count which was somehow made in 1952. the star ostensibly is the british actor richard greene, a capable leading man who reminds me of an earlier version of roger moore. the villain is a mad count played by stephen mcnally, who does a credible job except when he's called on to laugh maniacally. skulking around in the shadows is a long-gowned boris karloff in a decidedly secondary role of an aged doctor who may or may not be the salvation of our hero. it's the middle of the 18th century in austria and sir ronald burton (greene) is determined to find out what happened to two close friends. they disappeared in the vicinity of the castle belonging to count karl von bruno (mcnally), deep in the black forest. it seems that sir ronald and his friends had been instrumental in defeating a brutal plan of von bruno's in africa three years previously involving slavery and ivory. the count was left not only with failure, but with a scar on his face and a black patch he now wears to cover a ruined eye. von bruno vowed revenge, and it seems he might have been partially successful. so under a false name, sir ronald arranges for a hunting invitation from the count, and off we go by carriage through a dark journey of storm and howling wolves to the count's castle. it's a hulking mass of stone turrets and corridors, shadowy stairways, huge fireplaces...and creepy passages that lead to dank dungeon cells, a torture chamber and a great pit filled with snapping, thrashing crocodiles. it also is filled by the count's lovely, blond, sensitive wife, elga (paula corday, who sometimes is billed as rita corday), and by the count's two close friends played by those two actors we know from the fifties who specialized in being slime in costume, john hoyt and michael ansara. there is a dangerous leopard hunt, forbidden kisses, knuckling servants, wooden signs creaking and swaying in the cold wind and poison in a cup. not the least, doctor meissen (karloff) has a special vial filled with a drug which will so slow the bodily functions that death will seem to have occurred. the risk is that...well, when the person awakes ten hours later, he'd better hope he's not already nailed shut in his coffin. surprisingly, for all the clich√©s, the black castle keeps moving merrily along. the movie takes itself seriously, but it's competently enough made to keep our interest, even if we wind up sitting back with a smile while we watch. it's even reassuring in a way to realize there are strong echoes of the most dangerous game. when burton realizes just how crazy von bruno is, he becomes even more determined to bring von bruno to accounts. and, naturally, he has fallen for elga. von bruno, crazed by vengeance yet crafty and capable, is a man who loves the hunt and is engorged by the kill. hollywood's second creative rule has always been, "if you're going to steal, steal from the best." it's first creative rule, of course, is "if you're going to steal, steal from the best and then turn it into liverwurst." the black castle is a nice bite of austrian braunschweiger.

universal studios. the name conjures up so many memories to horror fans of beautiful matte paintings...er...landscapes, fog-enshrouded countrysides, full moons, howling wolves, taverns and torch wielding mobs. yet, it is quite strange looking back on those films, how little the era which produced the true classics lasted. the '30's had it's masterpieces, but those were mostly from the same directors and many of their films are mostly of historical interest today. the '40's produced more mindlessly fun matin√©e films than it did high art, and most fans agree that the classic era of the gothic horror films ended in 1945 with 'house of dracula', bumped around with the abbott & costello comedies, and was officially dead by the 50's and the coming of the atomic age.so it's strange that perhaps one of universal's finest gothics was made in the '50s! that alone makes the film an oddity, since costume dramas were on their way out everywhere. it may not be comparable to the all time classics like the james whale films and 'the wolfman', but damn does it condense all the fun elements of those films into one delicious treat! get ready for nothing but pure entertainment! since various social mores had changed, the film also indulges in violence that would not have been allowed in earlier eras; there's no blood, but we see characters shot and stabbed directly, and there's even a burning torch to the face!the film may not really be a horror film, but it sure has the atmosphere, look and feel of one! it begins in the dead of night with howling winds(and wolves) as two men seal the tombs of two apparently dead young lovers, but wait! one of them is not dead, but he can't move! he's trapped, but talking silently in his own mind, unable to communicate! what is his story? now that is how you start a horror film....english businessman sir ronald burton(richard greene, giving one of his best performances)sets out under the alias of richard beckett to investigate the disappearance of two friends of his who disappeared at the castle of one-eyed austrian count von bruno(did sacha baron cohen see this?). it seems many years ago von bruno posed as a god to the natives in africa to steal ivory, he was exposed by burton's men, and the natives disfigured him. now he is lusting for revenge.the film has all the clich√©s, a jonathan harker-style ride to the castle, an inn full of wary villagers, death traps, and a hulking manservant(lon chaney jr.). the torture chamber scenes are genuinely suspenseful, including a panel in the floor that activates a dungeon door(which makes for an ingenious getaway scene later on), a hunting expedition involving an imported panther(!!!??)and even an alligator pit! and then there's the romeo & juliet-style fake death that leads to the film's prologue....the plot is clich√© and the world-view is black and white. but it's still incredibly entertaining, with director nathan juran making every scene pile on the atmosphere and seem fresh and new. there are several plot-holes, too. why does ronald attempt to leave the castle so early? and he never does solve the mystery of what happened to his friends even though it's obvious, but he doesn't know that when he gives up, and he seemed so sure earlier. weird.all of the actors are great. despite being a rude upperclassman, richard greene makes burton one of the most likable protagonists i've ever seen in a horror film. rita corday is excellent as the count's 'peasant wife' who becomes burton's love interest, she may have the stereotypical 'falling in love with just a glance' problem of all film heroines of this era, but her portrayal of a long-suffering woman in a loveless marriage to a sadistic monster is very convincing, she also shows a suspicion and wit few film heroines of this era do, even seeing a forced attempt by burton to quiet her(and to paw at her necklace, although it is simply to analyze it as it has an important clue) as a rape attempt, yet she never seems nasty in her paranoia, the audience sympathizes with her. even though he fails to make von bruno seem truly foreign and otherworldly(he is a villain in a horror film after all), stephen mcnally gives a truly chilling performance as the sadistic nobleman. when he reveals his burnt eye, and laughs maniacally, it is truly scary. lon chaney jr. is also great as his mute henchman gargon.but the best performance is undeniably by boris karloff as the mysterious physician dr. meissen. he has little screen time at first, but steals every scene he is in. it is a performance that is both creepy, sad, mysterious and ultimately, heroic. as he leers evilly as he applies leeches to one of bruno's henchman, spies on our hero and speaks in that famous 'you know i'm up to no good' voice only karloff could make, you wonder whether if he is a hero or villain, always skulking about. and although he does function as the main agent of our hero's escape, he still shows human frailties such as greed and fearfulness for his own life, even cold-bloodedly poisoning a man for burton's benefit before he even gets burton to agree. his plan to help our hero & heroine escape also puts them directly in the clutches of von bruno as he arranges an amazingly sadistic(if unbelievably flawed)death for them that had to have inspired similar scenes in corman's poe series. he may not have much screen time, but this is easily one of boris's best performances.while the ending may seem abrupt and anti-climatic for some, half the fun is getting there, and there's much excitement to be had. kick back and relive the days when heroes were heroes and villains were villains. it's no masterpiece, but it's escapist fun at it's best.

all boris karloff fans will love this classic film, where karloff is the castle physician and gives his patients excellent attention. sir ronald burton,(richard greene), an eighteenth-century english adventurer, believes his two friends have been murdered by count von bruno,(stephen mcnally) on his black forest estate. arriving at von bruno's castle to accumulate evidence, burton learns von bruno's unhappy wife elga (paula corday),. and dr. meissen(boris karloff), the castle physician, are virtual prisoners. suspecting burton's motives, von bruno and gargon (lon chaney jr., ) a giant, mute scarred henchman, discover the englishman was responsible for their being captured and tortured. you will definitely have to view this great classic karloff film to enjoy the ending.

very literate, intelligent drama about a group of international travelers held virtual prisoners in the hungary of 1956 by invading russian communist regime. kerr and robards play lovers, she a british baroness, he a hungarian freedom fighter trying to do his bit for his country. other new york theater stars of the period anne jackson & e g marshall play an american couple traveling with their two young sons, including ronny howard in his screen debut. jackson's character is hugely pregnant and not anxious to give birth in a soon-to-be communist country; she gives an impassioned plea in the third act of this film which presages the naturalistic acting styles we've come to know today from redgrave, fonda, & streep. leading the pack of soviet wolves is yul brynner, magnificent as a commandant and at his sexiest since he played opposite kerr in "the king and i". he is mean and nasty and terribly conflicted by his attraction to the lovely, patrician, & heroic kerr. this is one of the great transition films of the latter part of the golden era of american film. do not miss it.

the british noble sir ronald burton (richard greene) decides to search his two best friends that have disappeared after visiting count karl von bruno (stephen manally), an evil and powerful man who lives in the black castle. sir burton travels undercover with another identity, since he fought against count von bruno in afrika with his two missing friends and the count lost one eye in a battle. when he arrives in the castle, he is invited to hunt in the black forest around the castle with the count,.while he looks for evidences that the count has killed his friends. later, he and the count's wife, countess elga von bruno (rita corday), fall in love for each other and with the support of dr. meissen (boris karloff), sir burton and the countess try to escape from the claws of count von bruno. "the black castle" is an excellent movie from a romantic time, with action, romance, mystery and even horror. the story is gripping, and is a great entertainment for any audience. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "o castelo do pavor" ("the castle of the fear")

this is a prime example of uninhibited filmmaking at its best. richard greene (who does good in the role) search for his two missing friends takes him to the black forest domain and castle of one-eyed count bruno (stephen mcnally), a past enemy of his whom he has never seen face to face. incredible film has so many awesome elements combined (for once) into a single film--a crocodile pit; a hulking mute (played by lon chaney, jr.); a crafty doctor (played by boris karloff); a leopard hunt (very well done and very atmospheric); a love story; a castle; a swordfight; a sadistic, one-eyed count and his two evil accomplices (played by john hoyt and michael pate!!!); an intriguing background story which makes the film even more interesting; and more!. jerry sackheim's script doesn't allow itself to be bound in--making a film that comes extremely recommendable to anyone who is into unlimited filmmaking with a touch of horror and atmosphere to it.

a powerful debut film from murali k. thalluri that explores events in the life of a group of high school students, each of them in crisis in one way or another. the film starts with the discovery of the body of one of the students, then traces the lives of the group over the previous hours, leaving the audience in suspense until the last minutes as to the identity of the deceased. each of the main characters is facing major stressors which we could see as potentially precipitating a suicide. the cast of unknowns provide performances full of power and emotion. fantastically well done, especially considering the youth of the writer/director who was 19 years old when he wrote the script.

good grief sethrp-1, you completely missed the point. the girl was only seen briefly specifically because she was the one who was going to kill herself...everyone else was so wrapped up in their own stories they didn't notice her, nor did we. as one of the other students says at the end - we're all so wrapped up in our own problems we don't notice what's going on for someone else. the director himself said if he had killed off one of the others, it would've suggested their problems were worse than someone else's. the whole point of killing kelly was that she was unnoticed by all of us. get it now??

in this flame of emotion we are introduced to several different high-school youngsters during one eventful day at school. all of them struggle with belonging,finding them selves and keeping their painful secrets from being revealed.has the feel of a coming of age documentary focusing on students inner landscape and their way of dealing with everyday challenges.gets of with a powerful opening and develops like a hymning requiem.thalluri moves the camera with great skill and invites us slowly into the youngsters minds and hearts. a fictional reconstruction that enlightens us all and reminds us of the frailty of youth.one of the most important films of today. every teenager should be given the opportunity to see this moving piece of film.

2:37 is an intense and fascinating drama which has some similarities in tone and subject with films like bully, elephant and kids (although, by my point of view, 2:37 is a superior film to those three ones).before watching this movie, my expectations were neutral, but i ended up taking a very good impression thanks to the intelligent screenplay, murali k. thalluri's perfect direction and the excellent performances from a group of young actors.the sporadic instances of school violence around the world have inspired many movies, tv programmes and books which pretend to find and predict the external or internal reasons of those unbridled expressions of rebelliousness, discontent...and specially madness.some people may say that 2:37 arrives too late to that artistic movement; however, i do not think like that, because that delay permitted the movie to make a more artistic analysis, focusing on the situation with more subtleness and intelligence instead of the obvious reaction of cruelty and anguish which impregnated other movies with similar stories.on the characters from 2:37, we can find clich√©s from the juvenile cinema (from director and screenwriter john hughes -rip-'s movies to the teen horror films): the beautiful "princess", the clumsy "nerd", the antipathetic athletes, etc.it would have been very easy to make them become in hollow caricatures defined by their function in the screenplay; but it is something admirable that the screenplay transcends the stereotypes to make them real people with credible problems which, in more or less degree, any person can find on his/her road to maturity.2:37 is an excellent movie, whose only fail is that the ending feels a bit affected, but which compensates that with a lot of positive elements.it will be very interesting to see thalluri's next projects, since he has had a great debut with this movie.

i would love for members of the cast and crew to sit down and do an audio commentary on this movie! all of the different places that they went to film this movie! should provide for some very good anecdotes! fans of this movie would love to know:what kind of permission did they have to get to film at certain locations?were there any memorable outtakes?were there any scenes that were deleted?what challenges did the cast and the crew face?did any actors have stunt doubles?what was it like to work with other members of the cast?were any of the scenes ad libbed?what are members of the cast and crew up to now?what locations are still there, and what locations are no longer there, or are now a different business?it is one thing to read trivia about this movie on this site and other web sites. but there is just no comparison to getting it straight from the horse's mouth!come on, guys! get together and do a commentary! never walk away from a challenge! go for the gusto!

twenty years after watching this, i still find myself quoting things from this movie like "look between the two giant melons", or i'll start to sing the "pabst blue ribbon theme". on the other hand, 20 years later, i can now make sense of the "meat machine", as there's still a lot of the stereotypes like this out there that they used for this movie. those are signs of a good movie to me. i could say this movie stands the test of time, which i can't really say for a lot of 80's movies. i continue that this movie is still on a list of a lot of people's favorite movie as a kid growing up in the 80's. if you like games, and have dreams of becoming a "game master", or find yourself dorking out over these 80's movies to relive your childhood, you need to watch this. also, it's sometimes sarcastic, and funny. but one thing's for certain about this movie, if someone ever invites you to a "great all-nighter" they don't mean an x or acid trip party, they mean, get ready for some midnight madness! oh, you'll see. everyone will be dying to play! hehehehheh.

a rather silly little film you just may love.although rather corny and clich√© at times, it nonetheless works and makes for good clean fun. five teams are engaged on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest - just for the sheer joy "knowing yours is the best team."notable for several screen debuts including david naughton's first film role after his dr. pepper "be a pepper" commercials and before his major 1981 hit "american werewolf in london". also features paul ruebens in what i believe is his first pee wee herman-esquire roll a year before he became known for it. and last but not least, mr. spin city and alex keaton himself, michael j. fox gets his first film role here. fans will remember stephen furst as flounder in animal house. outside of that, no names, but all funny characters.doubt it has ever made it to dvd, but there are still probably some vhs copies floating around and you might even catch on a late, late show sometime. if you do, is worth your watch. you may hate it, but it may also become a quirky little movie you come to love.

what can i say about this movie that hasn't been said hundreds of times before? it's an american classic. it has spawned dozens of imitators. or none. midnight madness is one of kind. from the ridiculous opening montage/music to the bonaventure hotel, i was hooked. leon made us all feel so young and carefree. one question though, how did he have those two hot hookers with him all the time? and how did have the time/money to arrange such an event? the cast is top notch. david naughton is at his best here. his tight yellow sweatshirt is disturbing. his little brother michael j fox(in his first starring role), is a real brat. there is also naughton's love interest and a dork and the obligatory black dude in a fisherman's hat on the yellow team. michael j fox does bad things like try and steal cups of beer at the pabst blue ribbon brewery and runs away to flounder's van. flounder's team gives us the most comedy. what exactly is the deal with the blond on that team? is she dating flounder? or melio? or blade? yes, the mexican gentleman's name is blade. the other guy on the flounder team has the best lines of the movie, i won't pomp them here. the meat machine team is a bunch of drunks. my personal favorite is armpit. but the silent black man is great too. the other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians(two of which are 450 lb twins).you know the ending from the start. but that doesn't matter. this is the 80's me-genre at its finest. don't rent this one, buy it. and buy it now.

i had completely forgotten about "midnight madness" until just now when i found it while surfing the imdb. now, it's all coming back to me....it was one of naughton's first movies (as well as fox's) and sharp-eyed connoisseurs will also pick out kaplan (henry from tv's "alice"), fiedler (he does the voice of piglet in the "winnie the pooh" cartoons) and blocker (son of dan "hoss" blocker from tv's "bonanza").but the two that stand out in my mind are furst (from "animal house") and the superdude himself - eddie deezen. furst plays a baddie this time out and has one of the best scenes when he asks his dad, "why can't you just accept me for who i am?" his dad looks over his obese, slovenly frame and gives a simple, one-word response - "yuck!"and deezen... well, he's a show in himself. as a latter-day jerry lewis he stumbles around, wades through mini-golf ponds, puts melon halves on his ears and ends up having maggie roswell fall for him. my hero.as for the film, it's typical early-'80s stupidity with college kids staying up after curfew and going on a city-wide scavenger hunt to prove which division of students is the best on campus: the jocks, the nerds, the rich kids, the feminists or the group made up of a little of each. who wins? who cares, you'll have a lot of fun watching disney pictures' first foray into pg territory before creating touchstone pictures.seven stars. catch "midnight madness" any way you can!long live leon!

somewhere in the dark recesses of my brain cells a song plays in my head. i can't forget it no matter how hard i try. it's midnight madness and it's gonna get to you! wish i could find a copy of this on a 45rpm record. five disparate teams head out one night in l.a. for a scavenger hunt for clues instead of physical objects. an unkempt game-master with two gorgeous assistants is the mastermind of all this insanity that's about to be unleashed on l.a. all the teams are stereotypes (this movie being from 1980, before political correctness screwed everything up): the "good guys", the "nerds" led by eddie deezen, the dumb beer-loving "jocks", the "we-don't-need-a-man-type ladies", especially the redhead. the giggling twins are a scream, too. and finally, the "bad guys" with stephen furst as the leader. furst is hilarious as the overweight slob harold, whose attempt to use a computer to decipher the various clues leads to a gooey mess. movies like this aren't made anymore. these days, movies have to have an "edginess" to them with some dark characters and other nonsense. go back to the days when the "good guys" led by david naughton were still good and not hopelessly conflicted. so dump all serious pretensions and go back to 1980. it's midnight madness . . .

i have no idea what the budget on this movie was, but whatever it was they made it work! i have seen movies that spend 100x the amount (pearl harbor anyone?) and sucked 200x worse. this movie has everything. david "makin' it" naughton in the lead role as adam, an average college student who gets wrapped up in a game called the great allnighter" run by leon! this guy rocks! a "genius" with nothing better to do than come up with an elaborate game for a bunch of people to play. but he doesn't just pick his friends. he has a team of jocks, nerds, fatties, average kids and of course, flounder's team who are the "bad guys". but this movie has no black and white. there are many shades of gray. adam is not the altruistic hero with no faults. he treats alex p. like crap. and flounder is the way he is because of pressures from his dad and a cranky stomach. the jocks play dirty, but so does everyone else! this movie rocks! the scene at the pbr factory? classic! "johnny's obese male child?" can you write a better clue? this stuff is gold jerry! gold! maybe i am from a different generation, but i love movies that seem far-fetched but still have roots in reality. this never happened...but it could. eeeee-gypt.... eeee....easter bunny....easter parade! oh and watch for a young paul rubens still working on that pee wee character. ps that devra clinger was/is hot! she must have been one bad actress not to work in hollywood anymore. see this movie!

weee this is still jolly good fun! as with most of my friends, we had seen this movie on hbo when we were young, and then had been searching ever since for a copy of it. when they finally rereleased it a few years ago, we had a midnight madness party... and the movie held up well. sure, it's pure cheese, but it's still a lot of fun. if you didn't see mm when you were young, you might not appreciate its value today.

they don't make movies like this anymore ¬ñ though some may say that's a good thing. although this was amongst the first of disney's pg rated films, it has more of the feel of the g films their studio turned out in the¬ë70s (i.e. "freaky friday," "the world's greatest athlete") than the pg films that came out in the early ¬ë80s (i.e. "watcher in the woods," "tron," "something wicked this way comes"). because of disney's backing, "midnight madness" obviously had a large budget. a huge cast and a ton of diverse locations go to show that. but zaniness, a madcap scavenger hunt, and spectacular visual style weren't enough to save the film from being an enormous flop... a failure at the box office, most of us were introduced to the film on hbo in the early ¬ë80s, back in the days when the same films would be shown 29 times a week (oh, wait ¬ñ they still do that!). essentially hbo did for this film what cbs did for "the wizard of oz" ¬ñ they created an enormous cult audience for a sugary-sweet mega-flop....the biggest problem that makes this a "bad" film is that there's too many characters and very few of them are fleshed out ¬ñ eddie deezen's "squad" don't even have names! the blue team, although they're the villains, are the most endearing and have the most work put into their characters (with the exception of the girl, who can't act & doesn't have enough to do). harold, perfectly played to the hilt by stephen furst, is really the only one whose character is fully realized in the film. the other standout character is goof-off melio, played with tons of charm by now-director andy tennant. although then-dr. pepper spokesman david naughton was supposed to be the star, his character often comes off obnoxious, particularly when pitted against his brother adam, michael j. fox. while everyone has favorite characters, i don't think anyone who loves the movie could disagree that furst and fox are the only two characters that you really learn anything about.despite the film's many flaws and bad actors (most of whom fell off the face of the earth after this movie) it still works because the actors appeared to be having fun -- and fun on the set equals fun on the screen. come on, what college jock doesn't dream of floating around in a beer vat and what zoftig girl doesn't dream of stealing the show at the local discotech... er... i guess it would be at a rave nowadays... campy, squeaky-clean fun for anyone who was young in the ¬ë70s & ¬ë80s, it's only fitting that this has finally gotten the massive video release that it deserves. but where the hell's the widescreen dvd release with the commentary, trailer and the full version of the song that plays in the disco?

well i just discovered imdb from my twin sister, carol. carol and i played the "fat identical twin" in midnight madness. we didn't have to prepare much for the fat part, that came with us, and well and the rest was natural. ;) it was our first major film role and we had a blast making it. we were 21 at the time and lived about an hour and half from the disney studio in burbank and the hollywood, california area. we grew up in front of the tv and probably some of the first generation of latch-key-kids. twenty years later, we still have lots of fun and are still 'heavy' or what ever is politically correct these days. we don't pursue acting any more but have been know to 'come back' when the right opportunity arrives. carol is a chiropractor in our home town of southern california and i am in the information technology field in georgia.i maybe bias, but i thought the film was cute, clean and fun. we knew it wasn't a master piece or an oscar nominee, however, it was and still is a movie the whole family can watch and have fun together. it's nice not to have to worry if your young children can watch a video without having to fast forward certain parts. and no one was more exited when it was released on video as carol and i were. carol found it at kmart for $6.99! now that's an inexpensive way to capture one's memories and share it with others.sincerely, betsy lynn and carol gwynn; the thompson twins

**warning! slight plot spoilers ahead!**"the italian job" is not the best movie you'll see all year, or probably even this summer. but it is a worthwhile two hours because it colors within the lines, knowing its limits and not attempting to exceed them.what carries the movie is the work of the cast. in a movie about a crew of thieves, the individuals must have a good rapport with each other. without that cohesive feel, the audience doesn't believe in the characters collectively or individually, and the movie never has a chance. but from the first scenes, in which the men joke around and rag on each other while infiltrating a venetian palace, the proper chemistry is in place.the characters themselves aren't anything novel; they're your basic gang of criminals, containing about half a dozen players, each with a specific and defining skill. but each actor brings the proper goods to the table for his or her part. mark wahlberg's understated acting and humor fits well with his part as the mastermind planner. edward norton provides attitude and twirls his mustache well in his dark role. donald sutherland is the father figure of the crew, and he looks the part of the suave and old-fashioned thief, who is still mentally spry. jason statham, seth green, and mos def don't do much beyond their character's abilities, but they each nail those parts. statham as the smooth-operating driver; green as the tech whiz geek with a chip on his shoulder; and def as the demolitions man. charlize theron slides in well in a part that doesn't ask too much of her. she is primarily asked to to drive fast and look good. that she does. none of the characters are that deep or three-dimensional, but in this familiar sort of movie, two dimensions are all that is required. as the title implies, the movie has a european feel to it, a la "the bourne identity," in part because it was shot on location in venice, along with philadelphia and los angeles. also contributing to the euro flair is the rhythmic, bouncy music, which adds to the upbeat nature of the flick and complements the rapport of the cast. the look of the movie is also a perfect match. the bright colors of all locales enhance the mood and add to the attitude. the minis not only provide a fun variation on the car chase, but also work as a necessary plot device. the plot is more or less straight-forward. there are a few surprises, but they are more of the swift-and-smooth-turn variety, as opposed to the drop-your-jaw hairpin curve. even with those, the movie speeds along. once the foundation is laid by the first act, everything continuously progresses. thankfully there are no breaks in the action for a romance, something the movie wisely avoided. there aren't even any breaks for 'real life.' the story has its purpose and runs that course without distractions. the lack of character depth prevents "the italian job" from being more than a good popcorn movie, but with all the complex details of the heist-planning, such superfluities would have dragged down the pace and quality of the flick.there are a number of implausibilities that i thought of both during and after viewing. but the movie is so enjoyable that i didn't and don't care. in the real world, most of the movie probably couldn't have gone off that cleanly. but "the italian job" doesn't take place in the real world. it occurs in a stylish and light-hearted criminal world that appeals to the rebel in all of us. "the italian job" is a movie, in the true sense of the word. it has no pretenses of oscar and contains no deep moral message. it provides pure escapism entertainment and does so quite well.bottom line: maybe the best popcorn movie of the year so far. 7 of 10.

under the assured direction of f. gary gray, "italian job" never loses its grip on being cool and fun. although the material is rehashed and average, the film itself is masterfully executed and is satisfyingly good. the tone could easily have been much heavier, considering the murder-revenge plotline but f. gary gray keeps the tone light by good humor, snappy dialogs and pulsating music. it is a pleasure to see these would-be-bad guys form a great bond and stick to eachother through deceit and murder, while never forgetting to have fun. this one is 7/10.

as a movie, the italian job is ok at best; good (not great) acting,nice visuals and pacing, a mediocre plot, but nothing bad enoughto walk out on. but as a car commercial for the new breed of minicoopers, this film is spectacular!*spoilers*ok, it's a typical heist film with the odd twist (the underwater safe- cracking was nice, if not improbable), and the cast was fairly solid(with the exception of a putrid wahlberg), but when it all camedown to it, the real "stars" of this picture were the three minicoopers, in all their high-flying, speed-racing, ramp-jumping,bullet-taking, gold-lugging, shiny new glory. the audience i wassitting amongst actually "ooed" and "aahed" when theron's littlered number first hit the screen (strangely enough, neither she norwahlberg garnered the same reaction).the film starts out promising. mos def, seth green, donaldsutherland, edward norton and jason statham all begin as aninteresting and humourous band of characters, with the only realuninspired performance being that of the usually good markwahlberg. why he claims this is his best film i can't imagine; hischaracter is completely one-note, and he plays him so blandly itwas as if mr. rogers came back from the dead and was inhabitinghis body. charlize is fine as sutherland's daughter, thoughnothing magical. seth green's character is perfect and therunning napster jokes (including a cameo by napster founder,shawn fanning) are hilarious; he and some of mos def's earlylines add some much needed sparks of humour. unfortunately,edward norton and donald sutherland don't get near enoughscreen time.you can see most of the plot coming from a mile away, and thedialogue is rife with bad one-liners and give-aways, but i doubt thefilmmakers were out to re-invent the wheel here, so taken as atypical action/suspense flick it comes out alright. worth seeing oncheap night i'd recommend.7/10. not worth it's weight in gold, but makes for nice fillings.

*spoiler alert!! please don't read if you don't want the movie spoiled!!*i was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend, but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it. so me & my friend made plans to see it after school today. boy, are we glad we did. the movie starts off in italy, with a planned heist with a group of guys (charlie croker [mark whalberg], steve frezelli [edward norton], lyle, also known as "napster" [seth green, you'll get the nickname later], handsome rob [jason statham], left ear [mos deaf], & john bridger [donald sutherland]) plan a heist to steal 32 gold bricks. this leads to the whole opening, which is a good 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a boat chase, which opens the movie up right. while driving away in their get away van, steve frezelli turns on the group, steals the gold, and kills john bridger, who is pretty much the (retiring) leader of the group. fast foward to a year later, where where stella bridger (charlize theron), john's daughter, is one of the top safe-crackers that anyone can ask for. charlie croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for her father's death, as he called him out of retirement for the heist) says that they've found steve (who has gone into hiding), and want to get back at him for what he did. she at first declines, but later agrees, and the teamgets back together, along with getting the help of wrench (franky g), a mechanic, to carry out the perfect heist, while creating one of the largest traffic jams in los angeles history. this movie is a perfect mix of action with funny bits thrown in throughout. there's an on-running joke about seth green's character, lyle, creating napster and how shawn fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while he fell asleep, and eventually lyle will only answer if refered to as "napster". there's even a funny line in the movie by seth, who goes "he said in an interview he called it napster because it described his hair, like it was nappy. he callled it that because *i* was napping when he stole it!" the begining and ending sequences are pure genius, and everything in between fits perfectly. the only negative thing i can think of with the movie is that edward norton's acting was a bit weak. he wasn't a big, tough bad guy. he acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare-minimum (which is a fact, as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation). but, even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film, the movie is still very enjoyable, and i definetly recommend seeing it. and even if you're not interested in the actual movie, go to see seth green shine in the comedic role. he's perfect. rating: **** out of *****

the italian job requires daylight hours and no experience is required. this is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies. the plot is good, but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process. it's car chases, explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating "the bad guy" played by edward norton. for norton, it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as "the score". mark wahlberg and charlize theron deserve better scripts. warning: if you've seen the trailer, then you have seen the movie. if you're looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need the italian job.

especially after watching the matrix reloaded!! *spoilers*after seeing the matrix with all it's ridiculous fantasy make-believe-robotic characters with their super powers, it was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in situations that involved actual risk! i cared about these people, and even though some of the stunts seemed a bit much, it still left me feeling like "it's possible" verses "what a stupid video game" (like the matrix)this movie isn't brain surgery, it's very straight forward. some things are predictable- like knowing that someone is going to be a back-stabber and that someone early on is going to die. pretty obvious, but so what? the first 15 minutes sets up our reason, our motive, our main objective.i like that theron and walhberg didn't have any make-out scenes. i am glad that they didn't go there. they kept it about funny dialogue especially seth greene. that guy is funny!this is a movie that i would buy when it comes out on dvd. it's fun, fast and entertaining. the only thing (and i guess it's a big thing) is that we are really - rooting for the bad guys. this group of protaganists are already on the wrong side of the law. not a good message for the kiddies - parents, please explain this to them.

here's another pleasant surprise. whenever i hear a movie is being remade, i cringe. movies such as gone in sixty seconds, and the day of the jackal, get remade and the results are less than stellar. so, when i heard that "the italian job" was getting remade, i expected it to be bad.well, i had the opportunity to calm down, read some reviews, and finally see the movie, and was proven wrong. granted, it's not original, and predictable, but it's sure fun. from beginning to end, you are taken on one very fun ride. the scenes with the minis are great, and the characters actually enjoy themselves.so, even if there are some flaws, who cares as long as it's fun?overall, 8 out of 10. the only points lost are, maybe, the a few details and a slight lack of realism. but, you'll be having so much fun you won't even be given a chance to stop and notice.

not the film to see if you want to be intellectually stimulated. if you want to have a lot of fun a the theater, however, this is the one. lots of snappy banter(and some really cheesy banter, too). mos def and seth green are very funny as the comic relief. exciting and creative heists and chase scenes. mark wahlberg and charlize theron(sexy)are appealing leads. and donald sutherland!

i have some great memories watching "robin of sherwood" on tv as a kid (but i think i only saw michael praed¬¥s episodes, by some reason). and recently my brother bought the new released dvd-boxes of the complete series. it was great to see it again, and it is the best of all the robin hood movies and tv-series. the cast is great, and the locations mixed with clannad¬¥s music adds this very special feeling. i personally think that praed is the best of the two robins, but jason connery was a great choice to continue the series with. ray winstone, nicolas grace and robert addie is terrific in their roles as will scarlet, the sheriff of nottingham and guy of gisburne. it¬¥s a pity that a fourth season never got made, and i¬¥ve also heard that the writer richard carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series. robert of huntingdon (connery) could finally have married marion (judi trott), or maybe herne the hunter could resurrect robin of loxley (praed), and he could take his revenge against the sheriff. as have been mentioned before; if the producers of "robin hood: the prince of thieves" would have been smart, they would have got the cast from "robin of sherwood", and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series. as ray winstone puts it in the dvd bonusmaterial, it would have been great to see them as old men, just like in sean connery¬¥s "robin and marian". who knows, maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. in any case, we can now watch our favorite series over and over again!

some people don't appreciate the magical elements in ros,but they are what sets this series apart, that and the fact the producers actually decided to dress the actors in proper period clothes and armour--not anachronistic feathered caps,multi-coloured tights and plate armour!but i am really writing to comment on an earlier poster's article. um, michael praed did not leave ros to do jules verne! there are 15 years between these two series. yup, i agree and michael might well agree too that leaving ros was not a good move--but it was a coveted broadway role that tempted him in '84 and then dynasty with its megabucks paychecks....

this htv series is beautiful. i strongly recommend watching the movie. it has got everything it should: remarkable script, strong characters, beautiful scenery and exceptional atmosphere. add some ambient score from clannad and you receive unforgettable picture. i love every adventure movie from htv i saw: return to treasure island, smuggler, adventurer, but robin of sherwood beats them all. i would like to thank the whole htv production team and richard carpenter in particular for giving me plenty of adventures and excitement. i have got the dvd release in my little movie collection. i regret very much movies like these are not made anymore.

by mistake, i ordered a series from the bbc, their new version of robin hood. very disappointing in comparison with ros. terrible costuming and backgrounds. while i enjoyed the sheriff, who took cues from the nick grace character, the rest of the cast left much to be desired. as a "for instance", marion's costuming looked suspiciously like it came from walmart. and sir guy, well, he looked a bit like a character from an outer space movie! ros has stolen the spotlight, probably forever, in the telling of this tale. cast, costuming, story lines, scenery, filming and soundtrack by clannad are all superb, as is evidenced by all the continual feedback some 26 years on. ros is a timeless classic. my thanks to all who made the series.

to quote jason connery and mark ryan on one of the many dvd commentaries, that "wobbly music" over the htv logo was enough to get me jumping from whatever i was doing to glue my face against the screen for an hour. the individual stories contained within the series were excellent and the character development was wonderful. robin of loxley goes through a very convincing journey over the two series he appears in, even though his departure from the programme was unplanned. marian also develops her relationship with both of herne's sons very well.after languishing for many years in tv wasteland, i re-encountered the series on sky 1 in the uk in the mid nineties and was even more impressed that the series seemed even better than i remembered. this is no children's television programme, it deals with witchcraft, treason, rebellion and injustice. and, it manages to do it without showing too much blood. as far as i can recall, you only see a bit of the red stuff in the pilot film (episodes 1 and 2 on the dvd set). the dvds are great, containing a wealth of extras including cast commentaries on series 3 only (the jason connery robin) and crew commentaries for series 1 and 2. the picture quality is very good and the remixed and remastered surround sound is amazing.the idea of freedom is important, freedom prevails. nothing's forgotten. nothing's ever forgotten.

this is one of my favorite series, all categories, all time.i was fortunate enough to get a hold of the whole series on vhs a few years ago. i loved it when i saw it back in -91 -92, when i was about 12. i love it as much, or more, today, which is remarkable considering my (hopefully) improved film appreciation and criticism skills. most of the movies i liked back then i'm not that fond of today, besides for the nostalgia factor. that factor is present here as well, but there's so much more to robin of sherwood than nostalgia.there are only a few bad things about this series. first, the picture and sound quality is so-so, at least in the first couple of episodes. fortunately, it gets better. secondly, you could have wished for a bit more blood and realism in the fighting scenes, although i know that was not an option in this case.so, on to the good things! and there are a lot of them. first of all, michael praed is robin hood. i don't think i have seen him in a single role since then, which only strengthen this fact for me. he delivers such a believable performance as robin. jason connery had an impossible task replacing him. the fact that michael praed hasn't become a bigger name as an actor is unbelievable. or perhaps that was his fate, to do this one role perfectly, then disappear.i love nickolas graces sheriff of nottingham. he is really not a complex character, but totally rotten. the relation between him and gisburne is just hilarious. actually, just looking at de rainault sitting in his throne, bored, glaring, makes me laugh even before he has said anything. another actor that deserves extra praise is ray winstone as will scarlet. you can really feel the sadness inside of him as well as his hate for the soldiers who killed his wife. winstone is an actor that finally has gotten his well deserved hollywood breakthrough (in films as the departed and beowulf). there are a lot of other great actors here, too.i love the portrayal of the robin gang. they are having fun, playing, laughing, you really get a feel of the camaraderie between them, the closeness that comes from a tight bound group such as this. those bonding scenes are so important.i think that it being uk produced with british actors really made it better, compared to for example the -92 feature film version with kevin costner, that just feels fake, fake, fake. (christian slater as will scarlet, come on..) the cast being able to speak english with british accent makes it more believable, and i get the feeling that the actors, as well as the director and writers, behind the series can put themselves much more into the shoes of the robin hood gang than an american crew could have. the music is wonderful, clannad is perfect for the feel of the series. the music is another of those things they just nailed.an exciting addition also is the fantasy and magic spice that is put in there. it's not over the top, but believable and just makes the whole thing better and more interesting. i also love how nicely the mix of comedy, adventure and drama is blended.those are a few of the things that makes this series so alive and so genuine. it's by far the best robin hood version i have ever seen. i won't wrap up with the "nothing's forgotten" quote. but one thing that never will be forgotten, for me, is this fantastic robin hood retelling. see it.

fantastic series, one of my few favorites (miami vice and tour of duty are the other two, and this series is right up there with them).these guys aren't into wearing frilly tights - they dress more like woodsmen. everything about this series breathes an aire of realism, artistic license or not.it paints a picture of a europe only slightly out of the grasp of paganism, as most of the villagers still have their local deities, and there are satan worshipping nuns, and magi, witches and sorcerers casting spells.however, what comes to the fore most, is that it's a series of it's time. rather than the version of the fifties, which was a lament against centralized government and the mccarthy era persecutions, this series is thoroughly grounded in the 1980s, thatcherist bleakness, and has a strong environmentalist leaning. robin's protector is a nature worshipper called hern the hunter, who often appears wearing the head of a deer, and is a personification (as is this robin) of the green man, an alternative version of osiris (the egyptian god of vegetation and resurrection - it is interesting to note that in these series, robin in the hood isn't a person, but a concept; when the old one is killed, a new one is summoned telepathically by hern - the person may die, but robin in the hood will live forever, hence the concept of resurrection).the music and score are really outstanding, and performed by the irish formation, clannad. when watching it, i couldn't help but think how _boring_ authentic medieval anglosaxon folk music would have been. :-)all this is beautifully shot in the lush forrests of wales, which pass for the new forrest.the only down side is that in the initial episodes of both series, the actors have to overcome their own skepsis, and convince themselves that this really is a serious work. after that, they get into it and the acting is great! michael praed as the first robin (the second is played by sean connery's son, jason), judi trott makes a beautiful and fragile redheaded marion, phil rose as the portly and really kind-hearted friar tuck, ray winstone as the volatile and lovelorn scarlet, clive mantle as the giant shepard little john, peter llewellyn williams as little john's bumpkin friend and fellow shepard, and mark ryan as the ex-hashashin/assassin nazir - all of them giving great performances. also great are the steady bad guys, nicholas grace as the bug-eyed, scheming sheriff of nottingham, and his aristocratic, bumbling sidekick (and robin's half brother, as it turns out) robert addie as sir guy of gisburne. really cool too is fashion designer richard o'brien, as the evil lord owen of clun's (olliver cotton) magician gulnar (he appears near the end of the first series and later in the second).the tithe barn in bradford on avon stood in for the sheriff's castle. (check it out on bradfordonavon.co.uk under "places of interest".)so, if you're at all into mythology, the middle ages, romanticism, don't waste your time on xena or hercules - this is the real thing, so go out and watch it!alex

as listed and stated in many previous comments, this unique series has many excellent elements and ingredients to its credit. indeed, more than 20 years after it was originally transmitted, it is still watched, and watched again, and has a huge global fan-following, something which must indicate that the makers of this series undeniably got something right.the root of the series' brilliance and remarkable appeal has however got to be that it rests on wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters ¬ñ all of which are brought to life by marvellous actors. the characters are wonderful in particular because of their complexity. in contrast to many other robin hood adaptations, and indeed many other film and tv-productions in general, the good guys in this series often make mistakes and can be seen to have apparent flaws, while the baddies, although put forward as evil and ruthless, frequently can be understood and even on occasion seem quite sympathetic. this very much makes robin of sherwood into a story about multifaceted, real people ¬ñ rather than of good and bad people ¬ñ something which very much adds to its uniqueness and remarkable appeal. also, although very much being an action-packed series featuring numerous amazing stunts (which are remarkable in themselves seeing as this was made long before today's computer animation, green screens, and so forth. thus, behind every one of those endless guys falling off castle walls, horses, and catching fire, there actually is a real person who at some point did fall off a castle wall or a horse or catch fire), there is always amazing dialogue going on between the different characters in each episode. in the final analysis, however, it is generally the series' baddies ¬ñ nickolas grace as the sheriff of nottingham, robert addie as sir guy of gisburne, and philip jackson as the abbot hugo de rainault ¬ñ who get the very best lines and who more than often steal the show with their arguments full of wit and cant. "it's a wedding, not a celebration!" is just one of their many timeless "pearls of wisdom" which seems to follow one through life :-).20 years after the fact, it is indeed hard to believe that robin of sherwood was originally something made for television ¬ñ and apparently not with a great deal of money ¬ñ in order to provide fleeting saturday afternoon amusement for small children in great britain. filmed in beautiful locations, with clever, amazing scripts and featuring remarkable stunts and fantastic actors ¬ñ many of whom give the performance of their lives in this show ¬ñ this in numerous ways seems to be more professionally made and have more production value than many a hollywood film.

i have some great memories watching "robin of sherwood" on tv as a kid (but i think i only saw michael praed¬¥s episodes, by some reason). and recently my brother bought the new released dvd-boxes of the complete series. it was great to see it again, and it is the best of all the robin hood movies and tv-series. the cast is great, and the locations mixed with clannad¬¥s music adds this very special feeling. i personally think that praed is the best of the two robins, but jason connery was a great choice to continue the series with. ray winstone, nicolas grace and robert addie is terrific in their roles as will scarlet, the sheriff of nottingham and guy of gisburne. it¬¥s a pity that a fourth season never got made, and i¬¥ve also heard that the writer richard carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series. robert of huntingdon (connery) could finally have married marion (judi trott), or maybe herne the hunter could resurrect robin of loxley (praed), and he could take his revenge against the sheriff. as have been mentioned before; if the producers of "robin hood: the prince of thieves" would have been smart, they would have got the cast from "robin of sherwood", and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series. as ray winstone puts it in the dvd bonusmaterial, it would have been great to see them as old men, just like in sean connery¬¥s "robin and marian". who knows, maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. in any case, we can now watch our favorite series over and over again!

lackawanna blues is and excellent movie. the casting was perfect. every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played. their chemistry together was amazing. the acting was superb. i felt as if i knew the characters. i could almost 'feel' them. they reminded me of people that i knew as a child growing up in the 50's and 60's. oh, the memories!! my personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see. i have watched this movie so many times, that i can almost recite the lines as the characters are saying them. i can't even list my favorite part, because i have so many favorite parts. thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that i never see in this day and age...and that is black people loving each other, looking out for each other, respecting each other, caring about each other, and doing all we can to help each other. gotta go now. i have to go watch it again.

"sister helen" is a superb documentary about a rigid, intolerant, foul mouthed, bitter, oblate (civilian) nun who runs a shelter for drunks and dopers in a very rundown neighborhood in the south bronx. all but one of the 21 residents are gutter drunks/addicts. robert, the only middle class representative ¬ñ he had a real job, house, and even a bmw ¬ñ regrets she died before he could tell her off. why? robert, like six of the residents, was on parole. he complained that helen wielded a huge stick over him and constantly threatened to turn him in if he didn't cow-tow to her. in an "extras" interview he said helen ran the center to compensate for the deaths of the three men in her life ¬ñ her husband and her two boys. the husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at 55. one boy died of a heroin overdose and the other was stabbed to death at 15. helen was left with one daughter, who she abandoned to run the center. the daughter was not pleased. she wanted her momwhat's fascinating is how little helen changed. outwardly it seems she made a huge sea change. but after seeing this riveting and disturbing video a few times -- once with the directors narrating -- it became clear that helen substituted 21 male addicts to boss around to replace her three dead males. helen admits she ignored her kids and spent every day in bars. but her bossiness, intolerance, and sharp tongue didn't emerge at age 56. living with her must have been extremely difficult. even robert says he stayed clean in spite of helen. the film opens with helen abusively demeaning a man who wants to live at the shelter. supposedly she is showing off her street savvy. another time she publicly demeans mel, her "assistant" for not bathing for a year. then she waves his filthy pillowcase in the air. the film is viscous with helen threatening and demeaning people. her signature song is "my way." her favorite phrase is, "i'm going to be totally honest with you." often, people who use such phrases, turn out o be the opposite. the residents are really down and out. only robert has any marketable skills beyond pushing a broom. they all desperately need a roof over their heads, and helen, since she runs the place on her own, has the power to admit or evict whoever she pleases. she has no governing board to answer to and gets no public funding. it is her show. helen believes in the cookie approach to sobriety. she stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else can too. she blames substance abuse on the drug or booze, and not the underlying issues that drove the men to drink and drug. she's no therapist, just a landlady who dyes her hair, wears a habit, and wields complete power over her tenants, and stopped drinking. helen also lords it over her inmates by demanding urine (ureen she calls it) tests on requests. twice major, a very solid and respected long term older resident -- who she trusted -- failed his tests. helen was furious and evicted him. major stood his ground and said the results were wrong because he never did heroin. helen didn't yield and failed to consider a mistake could have been made. this was especially troubling since she knew major for a long time. yet she discounted her relationship with him, assumed he was a liar, and relied completely on the results. major eventually discovered the codeine in his cough syrup showed up as an opiate. helen never apologized publicly, but supposedly made up with major privately.helen also had a very tainted reputation in her old neighborhood. she tacitly admitted to robert she once stayed up very late one night to slash someone's tires. the person wronged her and certainly deserved to have his/her tires slashed. she was not a nice woman. so eventually, she decided the only way to keep the travis name (her last name) alive ¬ñ since the three male travises died ¬ñ was to start the travis center.for some of the residents it was a great deal. they complied with helen and in exchange received a cheap, safe, sober, and structured place to live. one however, said he preferred jail. addicts and drunks don't all need to be treated like children. helen employed "old school" techniques which have been discredited. however, no one was forced to remain at the center and for some, it was definitely a positive experience. the travis center is not a treatment center. it is a residence for alcoholics and dopers who what to straighten out their lives. to receive the full sister helen experience, see all the extra interviews plus the audio version in which the two directors share their experiences living with sister helen and her guests.

this tearful movie about a sister and her battle to save as many souls as she can is very moving. the film does well in picking up the characters and showing how sister helen deals with each.a wonderful journey from life to death.

oh so beautiful, oh so tearful and so gut-wrenching. makes everything seem so superficial, so pale, so meaningless in comparison. sister helen is not a real saint. she is a real human - flawed, raw and blunt, but passionate and with a heart of gold.what i found most interesting is that this handful of wretched, miserable people found meaning and laughter.what i loved most is how the documentary portrayed the polarity of human nature.

i went into a screening of "sister helen" at the sundance film festival and did not know what to expect.i was riveted by the people in this documentary. sister helen is an incredible character!!! the filmmakers captured the essence of sister helen's amazing soul and took me into a world unknown. i was thoroughly satisfied by the journey and was completely caught off guard by this film's ending.this film speaks to those who desire a second chance at life.

this is truly a documentary of love about a fascinating character, her outlook on life and her extended family. the filmmakers spent three years taping sister helen at her halfway house and managed to capture so much wonderful material that you can not help but feel you know sister helen and her "boys." the house holds 21 recovering addicts each with a story almost as involving as sister helen's. the ending scenes are particularly involving and emotional.sister helen's story of marriage, addiction and loss reveals a very complex character who's tough love is at all times funny, touching and endearing.the film is a amazing in the way it tells its story in wonderful slice of life sequences which develop into a story that is almost as clear as if each scene were scripted and acted by the best. the honesty (and obvious dishonesty) of the "clients" is very involving as you learn of their fears and watch their attempts to grow.you will never forget sister helen, robert, moe or poor ashish(spelling?).

i got a chance to talk with the co-creator, rebecca cammisa at the 2002 high falls film festival in rochester, ny. she said that her style is to be completely open and uninhibited in filmmaking but was very happy to be so severely constrained in the tight quarters of the group home. the narrow hallways and small rooms were expertly shot with a realism that would have been lost with more controlled and deliberate camera work.sister helen herself is a remarkable character, coming from tragedy in her own life to being an unusual combination of caring, tough, and street smart. the way the film introduces us to her past is excellent, spending only a few carefully selected minutes sprinkled throughout.in all, i can't begin to correctly heap on praise for this film. it really is a treasure of cinema and the subject a treasure of humanity.

i first was made aware of this film when i saw a preview before another movie. i was intrigued but it didn't get to see it before it's short run in theaters was done.it is not an easy movie to watch multiple times. there is much violence inflicted upon unarmed civilians. there are lessons to be learned here. one of patricia arquette's lines sums up on. "to americans if it didn't happen on tv it just didn't happen" there is a lot of truth to that.another is that at one point she thinks that just because she announces she is an american citizen that soldiers will part and let her pass. it doesn't work that way.the scenery is beautiful. the acting is all decent. the professor is especially good. mainly though i care about these characters. francis mcdormand and spaulding gray are fine but their appearance is short, so they don't matter much. patricia has guts. in the hands of a lesser actor this could have turned out very badly. as it is love or hate the movie you should still come away with the idea that there still exist military dictatorships in the world in this century, and until one of our own is hurt we ignore their oppression.aung san suu kyi, is the female political leader in the movie. in real life she won the nobel peace prize. she was only recently released from house arrest. the w. bush administration, as of the date i write this, is attempting to pressure the military government to engage in talks with her and re-form the government. the burmize government was under such scrutiny that is changed the name of the country to the maynamar republic. the u.s. government has yet to recognzie the new name.if you don't wnat a message in your movie don't watch this one. if you don't mind a little educations with your entertainment then it's a fine one.

i would give this movie a good strong 7. while it definantly isn't the greatest movie, or even one the best movies of it's kind (the killing fields is better) it does at least attempt to tell a necessary story.i think the method of introducing laura into burma was a bit contrived. first of all, burma isn't exactly the easiest country to visit, especially in the late 80's. secondly, if you did make it burma, your passport would not get lost. a sane person would make darn sure they knew where their passport was at all times. with that in mind, i'm sure the screenwriter knew that was weak, but needed something. patricia arquette's performance was understated, and i just didn't buy that she was a doctor. however, at least she didn't overact the role, which often happens in movies like this. u aung ko was good, but also understated. the end is hard to follow, since most of the dialogue is in burmese, with people translating for laura. it would have been difficult for laura, and is difficult for the viewer as well. another plus is the strong se asian scenery in the film, which was enjoyable to see.

my ex wife and i saw and were intrigued by the trailer for this film. we waited for it to come out but when it did it didn't stay in theaters very long. several years later i bought it on vhs and i am transferring it to dvd so i can preserve it.i found it to be very moving. it is about real events in a real country. burma got such a bad reputation for the political oppression it created that they changed their name.i find women with little make-up on to be very sexy. patricia arquette is in this movie. frances mcdormand and spalding gray are in it only briefly.after coming home to find her young son and husband brutally murdered laura (arquette) is afraid of blood. a bad trait for a doctor. her sister (mcdormand) talks her into going on a vacation to burma. while there she witnesses a peaceful demonstration and has her passport stolen. in a bold (or stupid) move she asks a tourist guide to show her something off the tourist track. her guide is injured by soldiers and she spends the rest of the movie trying to get him and herself to safety.every time i watch this it reminds me that we in the united states forget that to a peasant living under military rule, socialism, where at least eating is virtually guaranteed, looks pretty darn good.

certainly this proves beyond a shadow of doubt that patricia arquette is what she is promoted to be: an actress! this is undoubtedly her finest moment of acting and she certainly deserves the credit for her work. never in any of her other movies, with the possible exception of holy matrimony, has she been totally believable and authentic.plot: a young woman finds herself in southeast asia and is suddenly thrown into the political havoc of the countryside. she witnesses mass murder and totalitarianism and escapes.it is one movie that you must see or you have not seen all of hollywood's finest. i rank it 58 in the top 100 films of all time.thanks bob

lush cinematography, beautifully written and edited, john boorman's beyond rangoon is a must-see for anyone interested in world politics and the arc of personal transformation. it interweaves a personal and political tale that continues to haunt me, popping up in my mind's eye with frequency. the story line is gripping, and the inner and outer journeys are paralleled carefully and delicately both cinematically, and in the story line. i've watched this film at least six times, and it really holds up to scrutiny. it is particularly relevant today, given world events. check it out, you won't regret it! btw, netflix does not yet carry it, but you can request that they do.

i am afraid i will have to add my name to the long list of people who remain flabbergasted that this film has still not ( sept 2007 ) been issued on dvd. it's one of those mysteries that makes the mind boggle, especially when you consider the amount of dvd's available today containing material that should have been binned years ago. still i have an excellent digital vhs copy in english with subtitles and nicam stereo so my qualm is more one of principle than a frustration at not being able to view the film. as to the film itself, this is an excellent all-rounder with good picture quality, more than satisfactory soundtrack, lively plot involving suspense, emotion, sadness, frustration, feeling good and exotic surroundings ( for a european ). how true the film fits in with the reality in burma i have no idea, indeed, that is less important, the essential thing is that entertainment-wise, it is a success. one soon becomes attached to each of the main characters and i admit to having my heart in my mouth during the final crossing-the-river scene. it's a shame we hear so little about countries such as burma and this film at least gives some insight into the country. has the situation changed since 1995 ? the events which are to occur later this month seem to answer this question with a resounding "no" and the regime in place seems to be as brutal as ever, not even sparing the lives of monks, let alone women or children !

i always wanted to see this film and when i finally got to i knew i was in for a nice surprise when john boorman's name appeared on the screen. known mostly for his epic films (he directed the first conan and wrote apocalypse now) put together in the classic hollywood structure, this one fits nicely with his catalog.i also can't express how perfect the timing was considering that myanmar (burma) is once again experiencing an uprising by monks and students against the military "junta" run government which is the very same one (there has been a change of leadership since but it's essentially the same) depicted in the movie from 1988. now more than ever this film needs to be aired on television (caught it on ifc) because of recent events.

a powerful movie that has recovered much of its meaning in this second half of 2007 after the new desperate movements of the burmese people against their tyrants. i felt a complex mix of feelings about the people there, something like compassion and admiration at the same time, together with a bit of rage because i feel that no one, neither the countries of the world, nor themselves, is doing anything effective to end this shame. i think these feelings became directly from the movie, and that they were intended when it was made, so it is a successful movie. the desire for peace, the quest for enlightenment, the respect for life sometimes leads to subjugation. in fact it is the buddhist burmese culture who has left the doors wide opens to their dictators. but, how can you feel angry about these poor people?

i came across this movie on tv. i hadn't heard of it before and almost changed the channel, but it quickly hooked me.the story of the struggle of the burmese people against a military dictatorship was provoking. the level of brutality that some are willing to use to hold onto power is hard to believe. it makes me thankful to live in a country where the government isn't likely to shoot people in the streets.the story of laura bowman was a good thread to hold the story of political struggle together.

based on an actual story, john boorman shows the struggle of an american doctor, whose husband and son were murdered and she was continually plagued with her loss. a holiday to burma with her sister seemed like a good idea to get away from it all, but when her passport was stolen in rangoon, she could not leave the country with her sister, and was forced to stay back until she could get i.d. papers from the american embassy. to fill in a day before she could fly out, she took a trip into the countryside with a tour guide. "i tried finding something in those stone statues, but nothing stirred in me. i was stone myself." suddenly all hell broke loose and she was caught in a political revolt. just when it looked like she had escaped and safely boarded a train, she saw her tour guide get beaten and shot. in a split second she decided to jump from the moving train and try to rescue him, with no thought of herself. continually her life was in danger. here is a woman who demonstrated spontaneous, selfless charity, risking her life to save another. patricia arquette is beautiful, and not just to look at; she has a beautiful heart. this is an unforgettable story. "we are taught that suffering is the one promise that life always keeps."

i saw beyond rangoon about 20 times, it was that good. at first when i watched it, i saw the story of laura bowman, but later, after multiple showings, i realised that this also was a parallel documentary. it came to be in my mind, a story about aung san suu kyi, and the struggles of women to remain strong in the face of uncertainty, danger, and sadness. i also would put history, and politics on the list after further viewing, since i did learn a lot about burma's past, and present, and could only guess at it's future. this movie is not only one you will want to see, it's also one you will definitely want to own a copy of. it's a movie that could easily been seen by the whole family, although not for children under thirteen. however, the educational benefits of this movie can not, and should not be understated.

this is a great film in many different ways...perhaps the most important is that it introduces western audiences to the remarkable, tragic story of aung san suu kyi and her fight for freedom and democracy. wonderful acting, gorgeous cinematography, breathtaking action and suspense: "beyond rangoon" has everything. i've seen this movie several times over the last ten years and each time it means more to me. not everyone will like it (hence the relatively low rating on imdb), but that's because it is not conventional hollywood dumbtainment; rather, it challenges the viewer on several levels. i've never watched it without sobbing at the end and promising to live a more meaningful life.

i watch lackawanna blues every time it comes on. it brings back happy times for me. i grow up in a big city in the mid-west. it reminds me of when i was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same. it makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost. the big mama's of day are under the age of 55. will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other. i hope that i was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past. the music was great in this movie. i truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters i would have paid to see it. as i viewed the movie for the second time i figured out who life this movie was about. he did an superb job in writing and producing this film. i guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you. as soon as i can i will be obtaining a copy for my home use. i alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than. thanks for such a great movie.

lackawanna blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy. the film clearly supports "it takes a village to raise a child" and reminds of an important time in black history and culture. i gained an incredible amount of respect for macy gray as an actress. her character was a little crazy, yet lovable; clearly we all have known someone like macy's character. s. epatha merkerson is absolutely fantastic as nanny. i never realized that epatha was such a great actress. law & order never showcased the depth of epatha's acting abilities like lackawanna blues. i was pleasantly surprised and amazed! the music and the characters reminded me of my own childhood...it was a sweet nostalgic walk down memory lane. i truly enjoyed the film and eagerly await the dvd release to add to my collection.

what starts as a homespun comedy-drama and then halfway turns into a melodrama made a major star of john garfield - and justly so. but jeffrey lynn is not to be dismissed as the object of affection of the four daughters. lynn is very handsome and is so charming it's easy to believe that all four daughters could fall for him. although garfield received most of the kudos, lynn became a major leading man at warner bros. as a result of this film.michael curtiz insisted on location shooting for the picnic scene, making it the highlight of the film. throughout, the craftsmanship is enough to inspire awe. a soap opera by fanny hurst has been turned into a cinema masterpiece.

story about a widowed father (claude rains) bringing up his four daughters. emma (gale page) is loved by big hunky ernest (dick foran). thea (lola lane) is romanced by an old but wealthy man. kay (rosemary lane) wants to become a singer. ann (priscilla lane) is a romantic. drop dead handsome felix deitz (jeffrey lynn), a business associate of their father, comes to stay with them. all the sisters fall in love with him. then tough cynical mickey (john garfield) enters the picture...very entertaining movie was a big hit and nominated for five academy awards. it's beautifully directed by michael curitz, has a pretty good (if predictable) script and a very attractive cast (especially lynn). also this was john garfield's first film and made him a star. this was so popular there were three or four sequels (which i never saw). this is an engrossing, entertaining, big budget soap opera--well worth seeing.

warning,contains spoilers!this is one of the best italian sleaze films i've seen.the plot has a teenage girl who is interested of occultism and has supernatural powers.her mother is a member of satanist group and is afraid what influences it'll have on the girl.no need to worry, the girl knows just what to do and there's no return,she belongs to satan..during the film odd things happen in typical italo way,there's not too much logic,but that's only good thing.it's amazing how entertaining these films are.. on the final battle we see her and her mother fighting each other (nude off course) and doing some mysterious rituals,you might guess who wins... the films final pictures leaves your mouth open and wandering why can't there be more films like this?there's superb music through the whole film and the actors are quite good,better than usual in these type of films.specially anne heywood looks and acts good.it also has some unusual camera angles and stuff like that, so it's not boring at all.my rating is 10.hopefully someone releases this on dvd.

you've got to think along the lines of last tango in paris for this one because the mood and emotion runs along the same lines and maintains the same heights - the difference being that in this exceptional, intense and torrid depiction of love among the ruins of a dostoyevskyian dispossessed the setting is a gay-subcultural milieu - perhaps even one that is set to vanish in time, and not the equally arresting but heterosexual context of bertolucci's own film.the last third of this film depicts a passionate love never seen in gay cinema. to talk of pornography or gay self-effacement misses the point and intelligence of this work. this film, though on first impression appears to take us into the familiar & often depicted underworld of gay street-life, then precedes to subvert the rules of this genre by exaggerating it to a super-real degree. the result is a hyper-charged emotional heightening - an exceptional strategy that elevates the drama to one of big universal themes and giant gestures.this film snatches the high ground because of the brilliant performances by it's actors, notably a young jean hugues anglade and the directing. a tour- de -force of cinema. outstanding in ambition and it's unceasing plummet into the depths of human emotion. as a contribution to gay cinema, this film conquers this difficult ground and makes it it's own triumph.

a fine performance by vittorio mezzogiorno and a masterful one by jean-hugues anglade adorn this stange tale of lust, desire and alienation in france. the work of the two lead performers is striking--subtle, intense and passionate. alas, the script is deliberately turgid and sordid, and the overall effect leaves one with a downcast spirit. still, those who can appreciate fine quality acting will be able to savor the courageous work of the leads in this often difficult film journey of gallic low life.

when this showed at the seattle int'l film fest i was the only person standing and clapping and cheering. the rest of the crowd booed or was silent. it is a well played small film that reaches deep into the reality of a young gay man's humanity. it is about a real man; and does not play to the insipid hyper-buffed muscular "gay paositive" that passes for the genre of non-porn gay cinema (and that is why so much of contemporary gay genre movies are so dull). this movie is intense passsion and great tragedy. the acting and directing and cinematography is fantastic; it all keeps the film clastrophobic and tense and passionate. don't miss this if you can find it.

l'homme blesse is not for an impatient, adventure-seeking audience. there are no explosions nor is the drama straightforward. like the films of lynne ramsey, the director is working more deeply with mood than with storytelling in a manner that is effective and incredibly moving. because it does not rely on gratuitous nudity, or superficial pop-cult. story lines, this is quite frankly one of the best gay foreign film i have seen (also, see francois ozon, pedro almodovar). nicolas roeg's "don't look now" gets a lot of bad press because it is sold as a horror film. that film, like l'homme, is more than what the box might lead you to believe. if you are in the mood to sit back and be absorbed by the subtle, transformed powers of cinema, you'll love this movie.

though for most of us, sexiness is a variable quality, i cannot recall a movie that did for me what this one does. it transported me into an awfully familiar realm of longing and desire. all the compulsive attraction, uncertainty over the outcome, the palpable fear and excitement so attendant to that state of arousal were brought to fever pitch by this flick. so french and what i consider daring! no matter what your orientation, i think that the danger of chasing your desire is brought full-front and center here...much more so, say, than with kubrick's "eyes wide shut".

i gave this show a chance because of jaleel white, not for his urkel character, but mainly for the sonic the hedgehog voice xd so anyway, like i said, i gave it a chance, and i was very fond of it. i never cared for the urkel character, so i was pleased to see mr. white in a role other than the ever-so-annoying nerd. and his calvin j. fraiser (first called calvin, but come the second episode, everyone started calling him "j") was very entertaining and interesting.i think my favorite episode was when j was dating the ex-cowboys cheerleader with the snobby kid. ("don't you talk that way 'bout my momma!" "this is grown-up talk, you stay down there!") the only beef i have is that the show was suppose to have 3 main characters, but mr. white's character always seemed to have the most attention and the other two (who are married) always had the back stories... it isn't exactly a good thing when a story about those two possibly being pregnant takes backseat to j. having to babysit his girlfriend's dog.....other than that, i really wish this show could have lasted a little longer. unfortunetely, it seems that people weren't interested in jaleel white as something other than the god-awful annoying ass nerd known as urkel....hope they at least put it out as a dvd box set.

to be honest fellow imdb reviewers, i enjoyed this show a lot. the reason? well, it didn't try to be more than it is; i mean, a sitcom with regular expectations, with a well known and repeated plot, funny and talented actors, and clever jokes oriented for a post college audience.this is what grown ups is all about: trying to be mature but in a funny way.jaleel white is funny as always and delivers some witty, and hilarious sex oriented jokes. the humor is very 90's without taking in account the tendencies of the new millennium and that's the main reason in my opinion why the show didn't have success. it got stuck in the 90's.oh and mrs. ribisi was really funny and perky.my favorite show has to be the one that deals with karma biting the ass! not a cult classic but i'm sure it's part of regular early 2000's nostalgia.

when i first viewed the trailer,i have to decide if this series would be perfect for my collection. but after hearing about it,i decided to buy it. when i bought the entire collection in a box set,it was absolutely what i wanted to see. it was very funny,and the characters were pretty cool. favorite characters in the show are:marion,carrot,the haze knights,big momma,and dotta. i also liked the opening and ending theme songs. the show also has some great voice talents from tiffany grant,jason douglas,and others. but however,this show is one of the greatest. so if you want to see something cool. then this show is the one.

this is a classic animated film from the cartoon series! most of the major characters get alot of screen time plus do extra characters aswell! the film`s focus is on the superstar characters vacation and each one has his/her very unique summer fun! its very funny from beginning to end! it has excellent color, great music and believe it or not i have seen this more than any movie. its that great and in my opinion its perfect!

as a big fan of tiny toon adventures, i loved this movie!!! it was so funny!!! it really captured how cartoons spent their summers.

i watch this movie at the start of every summer, and it never ceases to amuse me. here the jokes are packed in near every line of dialogue, giving you more bang than the average simpsons episode. some of the jokes fall flat or will only elicit a slight chuckle, but others will leave you rolling and then there are those that stick in your brain... "the audience is now deaf."the video knows it's a video, and makes no pretensions about being anything else. it's easy to sit back and let the bombardment of humor begin. a good mix of slapstick, pop culture, and tongue-in-cheek comedy ensures there's something for everybody. i was in sixth grade when i first saw this video, and i have to admit i still find it as hilarious now that i've started college.this is a good movie to watch over the summer, much in the way you might watch "it's a wonderful life" at christmas or "ten commandments" at easter/passover. more than that, it's just funny as hell.

while not the first movie i've purchased for myself, this is almost certainly the one i've watched the most. the animation is well-drawn by the experts at tokyo movie shinsa, and the animators frequently made use of clever techniques such as having the sun cause "lens flare", having the camera get soaked (and having the "camera operator's hand" clean the lens!) etc. while the film avoided becoming a an "animator's gadget-fest", the judicious but generous application of such techniques gave the film a much more "realistic" feel than the typical cartoon.the story has many interweaved plots which don't seem to have much to do with each other until everything comes together at the end, in a manner even the writers self-effacingly admit is contrived. each of the major plot lines has its own musical theme, ranging from "pop goes the weasel" [hamton & plucky], to the love theme from "romeo and juliet" [fifi & johnny]. the transitions between plotlines are slightly varied, but consistent.truly a wonderful film; there isn't much original music, though the new lyrics to "spinning song" are clever and enjoyable. highly recommended.

you don't have to be a fan of the cartoon show to enjoy this film. i watched it for the first time when i was nine, having been a fan of the t.v show, and my parents laughed just as hard as i did. it is done in the classic style of bugs bunny cartoons from yesterday, and considering todays vulgar cartoons, i would think anybody would appreciate a cartoon movie that relies more on "wackiness" then on vulgarity, to get a few laughs.

i love this movie... it can make me laugh! =^_^= which is kinda hard to do. this movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations ever. it doesn't warp the characters like other movies out there. everyone is in character and has a role to play!the movie focuses around buster and babs going down river after a flood (courtesy of buster), to plucky going on a trip with hamton (hilarious stuff), elmyra running around torturing animals (as usual), fifi following her crush around for an autograph, and shirley and fowlmouth going to the movies.in my own personal opinion, i didn't like the buster and babs segments that much, although they had some notable dialogue and jokes. i have got to say the plucky and hampton 'vacation' parts were the best! hamton's family is hilarious! i especially like uncle stinky. fifi in the hotel was also hilarious. i love the actor cameos during this scene. :dprobably the most famous part in this movie, again imho, is when fowlmouth and shirley are in the movie theater... lol! you've got to see it to appreciate it! and when hamton and plucky go through the tunnel to make a wish... :)although this movie moved slowly during the buster/babs parts, the rest is pure gold! i rate this movie 8/10. show this to your kids one day... or even adults yourselves - watch this movie! you won't regret it.

caution: potential spoilers ahead!"steven spielberg presents tiny toon adventures" was always one of my favorite cartoons growing up (heck, it still is). and this movie perfectly captures everything i love about the show and puts it in full-length form.beautifully animated by the tokyo movie shinsa studio (wb outsourced every "tiny toons" project, and this was the best studio to handle the show), the movie starts at the end of the school year at acme looniversity, the renowned cartoon college where buster and babs bunny (no relation) and their teenage toon peers learn from the masters of animated lunacy, the looney tunes. after the final bell, the movie splits off into five different plots. buster engages babs in a water gun fight that culminates with a bursting dam and a tidal wave, sending buster, babs, and elmyra's dog byron downriver on an overturned picnic table in search of adventure in the deep south. plucky duck talks hamton pig and his family into letting him come with them to happyworldland, "the happiest place in the western hemisphere", but he has to put up with an excruciating car ride and the threat of a chainsaw-wielding hitchhiker. elmyra's cat furball finally runs away, but she isn't daunted...not when there are plenty of "aminals" to play with at the acme safari park. fifi la fume devotes her summer to hunting down her heartthrob, movie star johnny pew, in the hopes of getting an autograph. of course, the hotel he's staying at is nearly impenetrable. and shirley mcloon sets up a fortune telling booth on the acme acres boardwalk...and lets her guard down on her day off when fowlmouth takes her to see the horror flick "skunkophobia".all these story lines are sidesplittingly hilarious, and some of them even overlap in the end. the only complaint i have with this movie is that it doesn't make full use of the tiny toons roster - dizzy devil and mary melodie have only one scene, gogo dodo only appears at the beginning and end of the film, and montana max, sweetie, calamity coyote, and little beeper are nowhere to be found. still, they're excusable flaws in an otherwise perfect film. this movie is pretty rare today, since it's over 12 years old and has never been released on dvd to my knowledge, but i highly suggest you track it down - anyone who's a fan of warner bros. animation, either classic or contemporary, needs to see this movie.

tiny toons is the first cartoon i remember watching as a child and i loved every minute of it. when i was four or five my parents purchased the video how i spent my vacation. i watched it over and over again until i new every word. well a few days ago my three year old cousin came over and i had to entertain him. i decided to show him this old relic of my childhood. i new he would laugh but i was surprised how much i laughed. like every tiny toons film and episode the humor is based more on wackiness and slapstick humor and succeeds tremendously. bugs, babs, plucky duck, maton pig, and fifi all endure amazing adventures from bugs and babs white-water rafting with a little help from superman, plucky duck and maton pig travel to the greatest amusement park only to ride the monorail, and elmyra goes on an odd quest to find cute kittens in a safari land.some of the classic humor stands in this tiny toon adventure and is some of the best wacky comedy i've ever seen. my favorite gag had to be the monorail thing when hamton and plucky arrive, ride the monorail, and leave )much to plucky's dismay). no matter what your age you'll laugh yourself to tears while not having to deal with language and nudity.tiny toons adventures: how i spent my vacation. starring the voices of: charles adler, tress macneille, joe alaskey, and don messick.5 out of 5 stars.

this was one of my favorite movies from childhood. i watched it so many times,eventually my tape wore out. i was a huge fan of this show and still am.the thing i love most about this movie is that it appeals to so many people, both young and old. i watch this movie now and laugh just as hard as i did the first time i saw it. i am now able to appreciate all the adult jokes that i never got as a child. my favorite characters are elmyra and foulmouth. almost fifteen years later, my dad (a huge fan of the movie as well) and i are still quoting lines from this movie. i love the part where foulmouth and shirley go to the movies. "you save the seats, shirl and i'll snag the dadgum snacks." i also loved the storyline of plucky and hampton and his family going to happy world land. wade pig reminded me a lot of my dad. i love the part when they finally get to happy world land and all they do is ride on the monorail. this movie is hilarious and appeals to children and kids. the animation, jokes and everything about it are top notch. if you have not seen it, rent it. you won't be sorry.

tiny toons:how i spent my vacation, has always been my favourite animation movie and loved it since i first watched it when i was 7 or sumthing,now i'm almost seventeen and i still love this wonderful work of art..i really like the idea how we track what each of them did in their vacation, and there were really some funny quotes said, that really made me laugh a lot...in this movie u'll never get bored and once u see it u'll want 2 c it again and again, because believe me it's really wonderful and it's suitable for all ages..

it is in the opinion of this reviewer that the best time to be a child was in the 1990's, a period when cartoons were not heavily censored and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment to hit the air-waves. the best producers of saturday morning animation were at warner brothers television, who experienced a major golden age with the dream-team of steven spielberg, tom ruegger and paul dini. along with serious and dark series like batman, they also revived zany, outlandish cartoons made famous by the looney tunes. animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark adult humour and homages to the celluloid of yesteryear and today, but tiny toon adventures was equally popular by re-inventing the looney tunes for a new generation, while still keeping that crazy cartoon violence and intelligent comedy that can hold onto any age group, no matter how old. even when the tiny toons were stretched to a feature-length with how i spent my vacation, it did not feel like a longer episode of the television series, a curse that so often plagues other feature-length adaptations of popular animated shows.the tiny toon gang are young off-springs of the classic cartoon characters who made audiences laugh back in the 1940's and 1950's and are currently learning cartoon comedy to "earn their toon degree." summer vacation has started and each character has their own idea of what to do. buster bunny (charles adler) and babs bunny (tress macneille) start a water gun fight which ultimately leads to acme acres getting flooded and them both sailing down the mississippi. plucky duck (joe alaskey) joins hamton pig (don messick) on a cross-country car trip to the happiest theme park in the world, but hamton's family proves to be more difficult than he imagined. meanwhile, in other stories scattered throughout, elmyra duff (cree summer) tries to find a cat to hug and squeeze, fifi le fume (kath soucie) attempts to go out on a date with her favourite skunk star and shirley the loon (gail matthius) goes to the cinema with a loud-mouth fowlmouth (rob paulen).while the premise sounds thin for a feature-length film, the many directors and screenwriters make all the stories work well together. the best of these is plucky's unfortunate road trip, which utilises a golden comedic opportunity very well: feeling pity for somebody, while also laughing at their predicament. plucky's annoyed reaction to all the bad things that happen to him are a perfect blend of script and animation, all in the confines of a small car stuffed with pork. elmyra's story definitely ranks second just to see how a little, almost innocent girl can cause fear into so many jungle animals. the aforementioned cartoon violence definitely comes to the fore-front with buster and babs' story, which makes us smile not only due to the hilarity of the outcomes, but also nostalgically, since ruegger and company would probably not be allowed to show half of what they do in that segment. practically half of that segment plays as a parody and homage to deliverance, including a clever twist on the dueling banjos scene, featuring the unforgettable tiny toon adventures theme song.part of the universal appeal of the tiny toons is that the humour proves to be very intelligent as it targets subjects with a ferocity that proves that it does not at all deserve the title of "children's fare" that people seem to slap it with. an entire segment featuring fowlmouth's poor etiquette at the cinema pokes fun at yappers in a note-perfect way, along with an additional jab at lucasfilm's thx logo. that scene is done so perfectly that it should be featured before every cinema showing. there are also a couple of moments that poke fun at disney world, cinematic plot holes and even warner's legal department. the fact that today's cartoons are bland and un-creative makes those intelligent moments even more treasuring as there probably will not be another animated series that will come close.after watching how i spent my vacation for the first time in many years, i can say with all certainty that they do not make cartoons quite like they used to. with the ongoing censorship that today's family entertainment receive, one wonders whether anything like this will ever be made again. this review is not only a recommendation of a truly smart film, but also a plea for spielberg, ruegger and dini to team up again and bring forth a magical creation to our minds once again. lord knows that the children of the twenty-first century is in need for something with the intelligence of tiny toon adventures. this is not a simple cash-grab, it is a wonderful film with full of spirit, madcap mayhem and hilarity.

when i was a kid, i loved "tiny toons". i especially loved "tiny toons: how i spent my summer vacation". i thought it was laughs on the floor funny. a few years later, my friend had the video. and i figured i'd watch it for the good old days. i was still on the floors laughing. my opinion, the plucky and hampton skit is the best. they decide to go to "happy world land". and they end up having a crazy adventure to get there. all the skits are funny. i'm still looking for the video. so, if anyone has any tips. please write me. this is one of the funniest cartoons i have ever seen.10/10

how i spend my vacation puts closure to the television series that aired from 1990 to 1992. i've always enjoyed the series for what it is. i've never compared the series to the looney tunes of the old days. the video release was split up in four or five episodes (i can't remember as i'm writing this) for television and it's included in the episode list of the series. what's good about this series is that all the main characters of the show have a major role in the story. we see what they all do during their summer vacation in different parts of the world. elmyra is with his parents in a safari, plucky and hampton crossing the country with hampton's parents, fifi is in some beach, etc. the climax is very good and at the end all tiny toon characters reunite for the start of a new year in the "looniversity", thus practically ending the good run of this tv show.

this is a great flick! it is funny for everyone, even adults. we got jason voorhees/leatherface like killer in this, along with other wacky characters. very funny flick, for children of all ages. must of rented this every time we went to the video store! buster and babs make a good pair, and gotta love the duck. he is probably my favorite character! i was never big on the tv show but this movie just brings back so many great memories. must see for families, fans of the show, or anyone! enjoyable no matter how small or old you are! rent it now at your local video store!p.s. needs a dvd release!

before watching this movie my thoughts were like "another israeli typical movie" but i was suprised to watch i great israeli drama. the plot is really good and the actors act great. one of the best isreali movies i saw... so at the bottomline i really recommend this movie. :)

one of my favorite movies of all times, have seen it three times already. it does a great job of summing up the isrelai walks of life, israeli humor, and seriousness, and much of the problems israelis go through. universal theme of wanting to be accepted, and be accepted for who you are. good subtle humor, and it's the charisma of the characters, that makes this movie magic, and says a lot about isrlaei culture, and the irnonicness, contradictions, and humor, with a great actor in it, oshri cohen. i highly recommend it to anyone, and it's a movie perfect for practically anyone, family movie, boyfriend/girlfriend movie, and also says apart from israeli culture, wanting to be accepted, most of all, how important family is, with all its diversity and imperfections.great great movie.

over the years some of them most enjoyable films have been about dysfunctional families.bonjour,monsieur sholmi is such a filmthis is an isreali film about a moroccan jewish family.this could be about any family, in any culture. we all know or would want to know people like those in this comic gem.this 2003 delight was written & directed by shemi zorkin. let us hope he a long career.the movie is seen through the eyes of the 16 year old son,who seems to be concerned with everyone in the family. heis brilliantly played by oshri cohen (he was 18 when he made the movie.he has been in a few since & i know i will hunt them up. hopefully this young man will become an international star.the entire cast is magnificent,i do hope i see them again.i loved every person in the cast to some degree.i think all who see this will agree.it has been nominated for many international awards & has won 8, it deserved every one.now being a film in a language besides english it had a very limited run in the usa, which i feel is regrettable.rent this film you will be glad you did.ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 95 points(out of 100) imdb 9 (out of 10)note: since the story is not new, this is as high a rating it can get.

this is a great movie to watch with a good friend, boy/girl friend or family. basically one of those feel good movies you want to share with your loved ones....without all the girlie crap you find in a lot of american feel good movies. this movie is light hearted but makes you think, and will make you laugh. just a really simple but universal plot. would think most people could relate in some way to this movie. the characters in the movie are amazing and the actors do a great job in sucking you into the movie. and the movie is topped off all along the way with hilarious true to life jewish humor. i watched the movie for the first time last night, and now i want to own it. :)

fantastically written, acted, and produced! loved seeing this gleaming, talented cast -- every single one of them -- give a such great performance. this movie thoroughly warmed the cockles of my heart! great storytelling!this is a great movie for black history month. full of an accurate portrayal of recent history and very real characters who weathered incredible pain -- with dignity and a belief in a better future. it is so easy to see how these diverse adults all affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually fuel the talent of his adulthood. the next time you're in the company of a listening and observing child, remember; show or he may be a writer-in-the-making!

this movie is an all-time favorite of mine. i'm sorry that imdb is not more positive about it. i hope that doesn't keep those who have not experienced it from watching it.i've always loved this movie. i watch it about once a year and am always pleased anew with the film and especially the stellar performances by entire cast.i've always wondered whether jean stapleton actually did the ending dance with travolta???? if anyone knows this piece of trivia, please leave a comment.thanks and enjoy!

wow, i think the overall average rating of this film on this site is incredibly low. there's really no reason to dislike this film. "michael" is a simple, but fairly original, and easily enjoyable romantic comedy. the plot involves a group of reporters/experts going to examine the mysterious appearance of an angel (john travolta) in the midwest. the angel proves to be less saintly and more worldly than we would expect, and that's what makes it entertaining. his interest in women and the beatles takes a new spin on the angel thing. the romantic side of this film involves michael the angel trying to get andie macdowell and william hurt together. the two of them may not have the all-time greatest on-screen chemistry, but they certainly have enough to make it work well. everyone who has rated this film so low (a 5.4??), come on! the film is not that bad. in fact, i found it quite funny and memorable. sure, it's not the best thing you'll ever see, but it's still good. this is a film i feel has been remarkably underrated. it's fun, romantic, and recommended by me.*** out of ****

i have done a lot of international travel, both on business and as a tourist. for both types i assure you the best advice is also the oldest: always drink the wine of the country. in this movie the archangel michael comes to earth on business, wraps it up quickly and decides to hang around for a little touring. boy! does he "drink the wine of the country."could man be drunk forever with liquor, love and fights he'd lief rise up of mornings and lief lie down of nights.these are things you can't do in heaven so he enjoys them while he's here! of course it turns out he had a couple of other jobs to tackle and, if he is less direct about them than he was about the first one, he is just as successful. the final scene is a little schmaltzy but it is also wonderful. jean stapleton gets to dance with john travolta.

warm hearted flic depicting arch-angel michael as a brawling, overweight, cigarette smoking slob who loves to dance and cavort with the opposite sex. he does have a good side, however, as he strives to set things right in the lives of a couple of burnt out losers before being recalled to heaven. funny, well played out film; very enjoyable although somewhat irreverent.

an off beat but very delightful performance by john travolta sets off this very funny comedy. his interpretation of the archangel is as a scuffy, womanizing, overweight, ladies man. and, he certainly has a mesmerizing effect on the women he encounters on his trip to chicago. john hurt is very low keyed in his role as chief reporter for chicago tabloid owner, bob hoskins. angie macdowell plays role much as she did her role in "four weddings and a funeral." maureen stapleton is neat in a cameo. her comment, "michael doesn't suffer fools," is just one of many memorable moments. bob hoskins is the only one of the lead performers who fails to connect, a little to off the wall. mainly you're there to see michael take on a bull, mesmerize the waitresses and lady dancers at a western style restaurant, and fully demonstrate that he is complete free soul. it is a memorable comedy that is worth more than one viewing.

i found the movie to be very light and enjoyable. one knows that the story is not real life like, yet the depiction is superb.lyrics are really good and john travolta in his usual style. i like the scene wherein he as an angel gives up his own stuff to bring life back to the dog.

honestly, i loved michael. although there were "give me a pillow i need to take a nap" parts, it was cool. i think everyone did a great job in this film. and nora ephron is in my "ok" list of directors.it's nice to see john travolta as a pot-bellied angel. it's not very often i see one in a movie. some people might call this a boring movie, but for me i loved it. angels and all.

i enjoyed this film which i thought was well written and acted.there was plenty of humour and a thought-provoking storyline. a warm and enjoyable experience with an emotional ending.good fun.

that pretty much sums it up ... corny. macdowell's inability to act is at times painful, and hurt must need money to take such muted roles, but i still enjoyed it.why? in a single word, travolta. he is great in this movie. still, i can't give the movie too high a score, but it certainly deserves better than it seems to be getting.

as an earlier reviewer said, travolta stole every scene he was in. recognize the character? it was vinnie barberino, all grown up and still a bit sleazy, but still likable, oh yes! disappointing were william hurt and bob hoskins, perhaps because their characters were badly written, or they just didn't care. i kept seeing one of the baldwins (never can remember which) in the hurt role so hurt's incredible talents weren't wasted. andie mcdowell is a sweetie, but not very believable; partly the writing. character development just wasn't a big thing in this film. just watch it for travolta, sit back and enjoy.

chicago reporter frank quinlan decided to go to iowa to confirm the existence of a so-called angel. he was not alone. his partner huey driscoll and new colleague dorothy winters also joined him. when they arrived at the destination, they found that the angel michael was quite different from what they expected. however frank still persuaded michael to go to chicago with them. so an interesting journey began.although michael did not look like a saint, he was a kind and funny angel. in fact michael owned irresistible charming for women. even due to jealousy of other men, he was involved in a riot. the climax appeared in the pizza restaurant. dorothy sang lively country songs for frank. that was just what michael wanted to see. but the next day huey 's dog was crashed to death by a running car. michael was asked to save it. that would be used to verify whether he was a real angel.andie macdowell shined in this comedy. she also showed her singing ability. john travolta proved his comedian talent again. of cause pulp fiction still was his typical work.a comedy that will warm your heart. 8/10

though this film doesn't stand out particularly from the movie crowd, its still a very nice film to sit down and watch with your feet up! there maybe the odd one or two mistakes you catch, and the cinematic are a little slipshod, the film itself is very enjoyable and has a wonderful atmosphere to it. the music contributes a lot to the mood of the movie.the acting is none the less impressive (especially the dog he he!) with john travolta taking the lead of the fun-troublesome-loving michael. other characters feel very genuine and perform very well within the film.so after a long day at work, stick "michael" on in the evening with some ice-cream and enjoy a very quality film in its own right :)

michael is probably too cutesy for most action movie fans and too hollywood for the intellectual crowd but i found it both extremely funny and very touching, despite it being both cutesy and formulaic.when three skeptics are sent to investigate a man claiming to be an angel they end up escorting him on a grand tour of the mid-western country side only to find that it is each of their own hearts that need investigation.when taking this film apart, as with most films today, there isn't a lot of new material but when taken as a whole it has a refreshingly original approach and is off-beat enough to entertain one all the way through.while not being a "family" film it is suitable for all ages and a good film to share with the whole family or that special someone."michael" isn't a great film but it certainly is a good film, a touching film, and well worth seeing.kwc

continuing his comeback, john travolta played a mildly twisted angel in "michael". he may be a messenger of god, but he's not the nicest guy, as reporters andie macdowell and william hurt discover. when i first saw this movie, it was before i had started watching "all in the family", so i didn't recognize jean stapleton as edith bunker. now that i recognize her like that, i try to imagine archie snapping at her for harboring an angel (whom he would probably rank alongside blacks, jews, etc).i know, that doesn't really relate to the movie. but i just like to associate things that way. anyway, it's a pretty interesting movie. also starring bob hoskins, teri garr and richard schiff.what john and paul said...

this is another of john travolta's "come back" movies, and if he continues on with characters and movies like this one, his come back will take hold.this is so sweet...sickeningly so if you're not into the romance comedy scene. if you are, this is one innovative romcom. every performance (including that of skippy the dog) was beautiful, without much more than a trace of the irreverence found in "dogma." (although, as movies go, i loved dogma!)travolta is not nearly as brash in his performance as the previews would lead you to believe. he is an angel and if you consider yourself to be well read, then you understand that angels were far from perfect. you will not, therefore, be insulted by this film. even those who are overly sensitive to such things shouldn't be insulted by this work, as nora went to great lengths to see to it that it was the least abrasive as possible, given the subject matter.i love this, and love it more each time i watch it. it's beautiful and sweet, engaging, and endearing.it rates a 7.3/10 from...the fiend :.

caught this movie on tv and i watched it again. i said to myself, it's been a long time since i watched this movie, so why not. and once again this movie thrilled me. it is so easy, so watchable and so human that i don't know why some people dislike it. john travolta shines as michael (his dance and every move), angel that can hardly be related to this word. he smokes, drinks and he eats like some savage, but he's got big heart. on his way michael helps all people he meets. dorothy winters (andie macdowell) in her singing and finding a right man. frank quinlan (william hurt) in developing himself as a good and decent man. michael even helped dear old pansy milbank (jean stapleton) - that last scene is beautiful when they dance on the street.travolta had great help in other actors. andie macdowell is so beautiful and likable, william hurt is great as usual, late robert pastorelli shows his talent. jean stapleton and teri garr are also good, but my favorite supporting actor in this movie is bob hoskins as the tabloid owner.so we've got here a solid movie about people with a warm story also and attractive cast. just don't take this movie seriously and i can guarantee you'll have fun.

this is one of my favorite "capra-esque" comedies. this movie is just meant to be enjoyed, not deconstructed, microscopically analyzed. it's not religious commentary. it's fun. it's fantasy. the surprisingly negative comments (imho) reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think must be a part of every movie.others have described travolta's role (it's the reason you'll watch the movie over and over) and the excellent supporting cast (including sparky!).sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; sometimes a movie is just fun.enjoy!

john travolta was excellent as "michael" in the movie by the same name. i don't think a better portrayal could have been done. the movie was funny, yet touching. michael is a very "human angel" (if their is such). andie macdowell is superb in her role as a reporter, as she goes from disbelief to belief. bill hurt and robert pastorelli are great as fellow reporters, each bent on proving the hoax of the angel on earth. each of the supporting cast is wonderful, especially the older woman (i do not know her screen name), who plays michael's mother! one of the cutest movies i have seen in years... i could watch this movie dozens of times!

i really enjoyed this movie for what it is: a funny little film that doesn't take itself too seriously. plot summaries are available everywhere so i won't go into details. michael isn't about a complex plot anyway. it just builds on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful road trip.john travolta's performance as a chain-smoking, lady-loving, bar-brawling, pie-eating angel is just perfect. and who doesn't love sparky?watch this if you want to have a few laughs and a overall good time. highly recommended.

angels are a bit of an american obsession, but are often rather boring. they are the messengers of god, and also the arc angels are great warriors (lucifer being the toughest and best looking until he was kicked out of heaven).so what happens if you don't believe in anything, let alone angels and you are sent to investigate an angel story, only to meet one with wings and less than angelic attitude.maybe that is what america needs, being a puritan is different from being good. michael is a rude, obnoxious, womanizing messenger of heaven who will fulfill your wishes, and make you care enough about the world that you will be touched.funny, but not greatly so, touching but not overly sentimental, intelligent without being clever...it is just a good simple, small comedy. watch on a lazy sunday afternoon.

possibly the best john travolta role ever. saturday night fever was a great movie & role, but a long time ago. i can't think of many of his movies or roles i've even liked, and it's easy to think of rotten ones. he can do meanies like in pulp fiction, but he makes the perfect funky angel, and it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better (equally slobby) job with it. plot summaries are available everywhere, but the plot isn't the point. just go for the ride and enjoy the cleverness of the little funnies along the way. there is nothing to dislike about this movie, unless one is searching for something profound. i wish there were more movies like this. we need a break from deep or awesome or grisly or complex or hysterical.

1996's michael is warm and winning comedy-fantasy that features one of my favorite performances from the john travolta library. travolta gives one of his breeziest and most likable performances as michael, an archangel whose quiet existence at the home of a lonely innkeeper named pansy (jean stapleton) is disrupted when pansy reports michael's presence in her home to a "national enquirer"-like newspaper and the editor (bob hoskins) sends reporters (william hurt, andie mcdowell, robert pastorelli) to the motel to check it out. hurt, mcdowell, and pastorelli are quite good as the jaded news staffers who have a hard time accepting they've met an angel but this is travolta's show and he rules as the pot-bellied, sugar-eating, cookie-smelling, pie-loving, aretha-loving, bull-chasing michael, an angel who just isn't what you think you of when you think of angels. and you have to love the scene in the bar when he and the ladies dance to "chain of fools". i love this movie more and more every time i watch it and it's mainly because of the completely winning performance from john travolta.

the title of the film seems quite appropriate given the persona of the lead character, fanda. he's an older man living in the late autumn of his life, yet frolics about as a jubilant school boy who's just entered a spring meadow. the frailties of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions to him. his wife supports this idea when she observes, "fanda laughs at funerals and death." in other words, death is not something fanda takes too seriously; he has more important things to do than worry about what already is inevitable. life, however, and the pursuit of living life to its fullest, is the philosophy that governs fanda's existence. he is not one to merely exist, but must live for each day and each passing moment, for tomorrow is not guaranteed. the film seems to make a strong commentary about living as though there is no tomorrow, let alone death. too many people take life much too seriously and consequently miss out on the actual living part of life. fanda's wife for example; she's so worried about preparing for death, not in some religiously connotative way, but in a far too practical, even lifeless way that she forgets how to smile, laugh and just have a good time. her humanity seems to have transformed into zombie auto-pilot mode. fanda, to the contrary, is perhaps too blithe and absent-minded for his own good. he needs a person like his wife, emilie, to help balance him. it's as though fanda possesses the invincible spirit of a child, like a kid trapped in an older man's body. he is introduced as the adventurous type; he pretends to be people he's not in order to get gain, squanders money, factiously lies and is always up for a good laugh. deep-down, though, he is a kind-hearted and gentle old man who wishes to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife. the two off-set each other quite nicely, though neither one of them truly appreciates the binary quality of their relationship until they metaphorically chance upon death: meaning, their divorce. it is during this courtroom scene that fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love. his wife emotionally recalls all of his flaws, yet is tenderly drawn to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior. in this moment of her forgiving him, fanda realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife bonkers and makes an internal commitment to make her happy. ironically, though, after making this commitment he becomes what his wife later calls, "a living corpse." the life-blood within him drains away as he becomes more like her¬óa zombie going through day-to-day motions. he doesn't seem to live anymore, but exist. for example, he gives up his zany pranks, doesn't squander money, quits smoking on account of his wife (not his health), and overall, just acquiesces to whatever she wants of him. succinctly put, he changes on account of wanting to make her happy. thus, the binary quality of their relationship begins to slowly vanish. realizing that her husband is not who he used to be, there is a part of emilie that misses the old fanda. she misses her husband's aloofness and the fights they used to have, because it was in those moments that they were truly living, not just simply existing. i believe the filmmakers were trying to get across a specific message here; that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient, but often times will take sacrifice and endurance to wade through the seemingly bad times. the possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live for every moment. life is often taken for granted, but when threatened with death¬óbe it literal or figurative¬ópeople awake from their ungrateful slumbers and are aroused to start living life to its fullest. it's as though they are scared that they'll never live again, so they better make the most of it while they have it. fanda and emilie had been married 44 years with fights along the way, but it wasn't till they were both threatened with the possibility of death-like-separation that they began to show their true colors. as the old maxim goes, "love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation." they both begin to see what matters most in life and that is the people they meet along the way. more importantly, the intimate relationships they make with their significant others.

the main cast:vlastimil brodsk√Ω .... frantisek h√°na stella z√°zvorkov√° .... em√≠lie h√°nov√° stanislav zindulka .... edadirector vladimir michalek gives this charming story of elderly folks enchanting twists that make the characters appealing, really universal.frantisek hana is retired and on a pension, his previous occupation unknown. he lives in a very nice apartment with his wife of forty-four years, emilie. his son jara covets the spacious apartment as a problem-solver as he needs to house one of his ex-wives and several of their children. the son isn't a vicious schemer, just a guy with one past spouse too many and a blind eye to the attachment his dad has for the flat (which he moved into after relinquishing a previous residence to the son).hana and his also elderly close friend, ed, spend there more than ample free time doing small con jobs not for money but for the pleasure of putting one over on easily duped folks like estate agents. a favorite ploy is for hana to act the part of a retired divo of new york's metropolitan opera returning home in need of a sprawling mansion. ed is his companion as gullible realtors fall all over themselves proffering chauffeured limousines and fine french restaurant meals in hope of a lucrative sale.when not engaged in well-planned scams, the duo engage in quick ploys such as pretending to be railroad security agents so as to snatch kisses from breathless and ticketless teens trying to sneak onto trains. chaste kisses, that is: there's no lechery here.hana's long-suffering wife is obsessed with saving enough money to insure that the couple, individually and jointly, have a grand funeral, an event the life-loving frantisek is in no hurry to experience.disagreements about money and frantisek's promiscuous disposition of marital funds lead to a crisis whose resolution rings both real and endearing. michalek fishes for the viewer's emotions but he does it openly, honestly and effectively."autumn spring," subtitled of course, is a product of an increasingly vibrant czech cinema. it wasn't shown widely in the u.s. but its availability on dvd will, hopefully, bring this affecting flick to a wide audience. sadly, brodsky recently succumbed to cancer so this movie is a valedictory to a fine actor who imbued his character with a passion for life's pleasures that must have reflected the actor's own values.9/10.

i found this film to be one of those great heart-warming gems. the story line is tightly woven and the character development throughout fantastic! i am a big fan of non-us films anyway and this is right up there with: "happenstance," "the closet" even "king of hearts." vlastimil brodsky as fanda, is fantastic. it is a love story in the true sense of loving life and the twists and turns it takes to get the viewer to understand/enjoy fanda's view of life (which nearly costs himmore than he is prepared to give) are wonderful. his co-star stelle zazvorkova is unforgettable as his fed-up wife. i highly recommend this movie for the whole family--my children loved it.

"autumn spring" tells of the misadventures of a dapper, walrus faced, 78 (approx) year old czech man who haplessly befuddles and bemuses all who know him with his mischievous ways while his wife meticulously plans her funeral. centerpiece hana (brodsk√Ω) shows us how to get babes to kiss you when your 78 and how to cop a feel in an elevator and get thanked for it as he pranks his way from day to day in this warm and glowing look at old age and one man's creative, amusing, but socially unacceptable ways of enjoying life while refusing to be relegated to the old folk's home. "autumn spring" is a plodding, subtle comedy with messages for all ages which will have the greatest appeal with more mature foreign film buffs. (b+)

this film just won the best film award at the cleveland international film festival. it's american title apparently is autumn spring. the acting is superb. the story takes you into the life of an elderly man who takes what life deals him and spikes it up a little bit. abetted by his best friend (and partner in not-so-serious crime) he puts people on at every opportunity but still often reveals his heart of gold. his longsuffering wife has come to her wits end and makes a life-changing decision which is heartbreaking to watch. the resolution of the story is beautiful.

not much to say other than it is simply a masterpiece. this film contains a myriad of messages that all should take to heart. especially- women do not squelch your man's dreams -honor them -that's why you loved him in the first place! those who plan for death will live in the grave. those who carpe diem will awaken those who live in fear. even our lord spoke of this when he chastised the the one who buried his talent in fear that he might make a mistake and displease the master. take a risk, get out of the boat and you will walk on water. life is a journey that does not end in the grave but in our minds and souls.

this is a fantastic film. h√°na is a very old guy with a very young heart. he knows how to live his live fully everyday by teaming up with his friend making pranks on just about everything, even his own death. while his wife can't deal with his "irresponsible" behavior, she also knows that it's exactly why she loves her husband for almost half century. i would love to hang out with this old guy because he knows how to enjoy live and never fear of death. he is joyful, witty, mischievous, and never boring. vlastimil brodsk√Ω brilliantly played h√°na at the age of 79. every look from his eyes and every move from his aging muscles deliver so much about the character to the audience. this is a film that leaves a big smile on my face afterwards, and it makes me look at my own live a little closer. tomorrow i am gonna go and buy myself a mansion and have some fun. if h√°na can, so can i. but i think i will skip the smoking part.

to qualify my use of "realistic" in the summary, not many old folks i know go around pretending to be famous maestros, blind people, etc. -- nor have i ever been elderly. those minor issues out of the way, the relationships between the characters in this film and the emotions expressed therein were completely realistic and genuine. in fact, though we're not yet 30, i could see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife in the interactions between the main character and his wife. for those that don't die young (there's a great line in the movie about this, when the two best friends are talking about dying young, and one of them says--and i'm paraphrasing, we missed our chance--we'll just have to stick it out), we'll all be where these characters are some day. i know many movie-goers would prefer to be swept *away* from reality as opposed to being *faced* with it, but even they might enjoy the sweet reminder of our mortality--and the importance of living life to the fullest--that this film is.

most of this political thriller presented as a mostly run of the mill movie with a somewhat better development of many of the major characters, that was much appreciated, until the big twist and powerful climax that recalled twists experienced in "silence of the lambs," or "the sixth sense." reese witherspoon as the distraught wife of the missing egyptian husband and yigal naor as the strong-armed interrogator offer strong performances. jake gyllenhaal unfortunately is handed a more two-dimensional character and has to struggled with a stereotypical presentation of the emotionally torn cia analyst that has been presented many times before in other movies. early on there is the nice scene with an explosion that resembles a scene at the end of "saving private ryan," the silent scene that was used so effectively in reflecting one consequence of violence. the script also provides a little more glimpse into the mind-set of the "enemy" but still doesn't allow the audience really much understanding, again permitting the audience to wallow in stereotypical characterization. the cinematography and photography also is somewhat of a letdown because unlike "jarhead," or "blackhawk down," the crisp, raw visceral presentation is missing not allowing the audience to really be there in the movie, there is some distance that keeps the audience from realizing the intensity of the emotions occurring on the screen. however, overall, the movie redeems itself by the end, offering the audience a measured look into the complexity of the united states' use of rendition and the possible complications and consequences that may occur through its use. eight out of ten stars.

the film tackles the here and now horror of "rendition" with a multi-cast trans-global account of all involved. no-one gets off lightly because we see the blindness of the players as they carve out their own slice of the worldwide game piling hatred and misery on their "enemies" and themselves in equal measure.the interplay between the sympathetic senator's aide (played in scintillating style by peter sarsgaard) and the real washington power-mongers is electrifying. meanwhile out in the field, new cia man (jake gyllenhaal) goes through a sea change in his attitude to the usa's new found cosiness with torture. sudden though his rejection of what he initially tacitly condoned is, one has to ask why on earth would anyone who calls him or herself civilized stand and watch anyone be humiliated and abused in this way? the film has few heroes - perhaps gyllenhaal's flawed and vacillating cia man is the exception and a necessary indulgence to make the film offer a sliver of hope.the sad fact of course is that this film isn't fiction at all, but a wake up call to those with a shred of decency left in them. the awful truth is that we in the uk and usa have lost the moral plot and this film shows how low we are prepared to go. all this in the name of freedom! there's a wonderful line in the script that says that torture is a sure way to swell the numbers of our enemies. this is already happening in real life and we should listen to the message that this film delivers and start using our might and money much more intelligently!! the message seems to be that any of us who claim that rendition, torture and the abuse of basic human rights are necessary to protect our way of life are as wrong-headed and stultifyingly stupid as the jihadists and suicide bombers.all praise to the sensibilities of a talented south african director with a eye on the gross unfairness of how power is exercised, and a cast of principled mainstream actors from the us and beyond. oh, and by the way, the film has a sting in its tail with the ending a clever and thought provoking surprise (which i won't give away).i saw the film in an early london preview so it has not yet been widely written up but i'm glad to say that the tide of less than glowing reviews seems to be turning. the bbc review has been very strongly in support and they (and i) suspect that much of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple specs of hollywood - where the good guys and the bad guys are cardboard cut-outs. hence the reason that many of the truly great films of the year are increasingly indie and/or non-us pix.

"i fear you speak upon the rack, where men enforced do speak anything." this shakespearean line from the merchant of venice is echoed again in the new film rendition which introduces the viewer to the "enhanced methods of interrogation", renditions, which began in the clinton administration and have become more commonplace since the terror attacks of september 11, 2001.the film features an all-star cast, with oscar winners meryl streep, alan arkin, and reese witherspoon, as well as peter sarsgaard, jake gyllenhaal, and omar metwally. supporting roles filled by unfamiliar actors deliver as well, sucking the audience into the plot, and showing how many people can be affected by overseas terror attacks, and our means of investigating them.rendition follows an egyptian born terrorism suspect (metwally) who is taken by u.s. officials following his flight from south africa to washington dc to an undisclosed prison overseas. his pregnant wife (witherspoon) ventures to washington dc to find out about his disappearance through a family friend and senator's employee (sarsgaard). gyllenhaal plays a young cia analyst at the overseas detention facility who monitors the violent interrogation.this film follows the emotional plights of the torture victim (metwally), and those involved in obtaining the supposed information from him. some, like the cia analyst (gyllenhaal), are visibly shaken and horrified by the methods exercised, while others, the stern senator (streep) and foreign interrogator (yigal naor), see it as necessary and effective.the film may be described by some as a political piece, but is ultimately an emotional one. metwally's performance as the tortured prisoner is oscar-worthy. the film does not intend to preach, but rather to question and inform the audience on a topic that does not often have a human face put on it. renditions have been known to work, but have also been known to produce false information from innocent prisoners. the film simply depicts the emotional struggles of those involved in such grave business, and does so in a way that will affect every viewer differently. the film will keep your interest, and have you engaged in each of the character's plights.

in this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussions of waterboarding, images of abu ghraib, or tales of forced detentions at guantanamo bay, gavin hood's "rendition" is about as up-to-the-minute and timely a movie as is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mills of mainstream hollywood. it's not, by any stretch of the imagination, a perfect film, but neither does it merit the caterwauling opprobrium it has received at the hands of critics from all across the ideological and political spectrum.the term "rendition" refers to the ability of the cia to arrest any individuals it suspects of terrorist dealings, then to whisk them away in secret to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time, all without due process of law. anwar el-ibrahimi is an egyptian man who has been living for twenty years in the united states. he has an american wife, a young son and a new baby on the way. he seems a very unlikely candidate for a terrorist, yet one day, without warning or explanation, anwar is seized and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that anwar claims to know nothing about.on the negative side, "rendition" falters occasionally in its storytelling abilities, often biting off a little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character. the ostensible focal point is douglas freeman, a rookie cia agent who is brought in to observe anwar's "interrogation" at the hands of egyptian officials. the problem is that, as conceived by writer kelley sane and enacted by jake gyllenhaal, freeman seems too much of a na√Øve "boy scout" to make for a very plausible agent, and he isn't given the screen time he needs to develop fully as a character. we know little about him at the beginning and even less, it seems, at the end. he "goes through the motions," but we learn precious little about the man within. thus, without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together, the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the seams, with story elements flying off in all directions. a similar problem occurs with anwar's distraught wife, played by reese witherspoon, a woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface. gyllenhaal and witherspoon have both proved themselves to be fine actors under other circumstances, but here they are hemmed in by a restrictive screenplay that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances.what makes "rendition" an ultimately powerful film, however, is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two concurrently running plot lines elegantly dovetail into one another in the movie's closing stretches. it may make for a slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject, but, hey, this is hollywood after all, and the film has to pay some deference to mass audience expectations if it is to get itself green lighted, let alone see the light of day as a completed project.two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film: omar metwally who makes palpable the terror of a man caught in a real life kafkaesque nightmare from which he cannot awaken, and yigal naor who makes a surprisingly complex character out of the chief interrogator/torturer. meryl streep, alan arkin and peter sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles. special mention should also be made of the warm and richly hued cinematography of dion beebe.does the movie oversimplify the issues? probably. does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government forces? most definitely. (one wonders how the movie would have played if anwar really were a terrorist). yet, the movie has the guts to tread on controversial ground. it isn't afraid to raise dicey questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political stances it takes. it openly ponders the issue of just how does a nation hold fast to its hard-won principle of "civil liberties for all" in the face of terrorism and fear. and just how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say "enough is enough," even at the risk of being branded terrorist-appeasing and unpatriotic by those in power? (the movie also does not, in any way, deny the reality of extreme islamic terrorism).thus, to reject "rendition" out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. "rendition" may not be perfect, but it is good, and it has something of importance to say about the world in which we now live. and that alone makes it very much worth seeing.

i liked this movie. i saw it to a packed house at the toronto international film festival the day after the gala opener which must have gone over well. the director, gavin hood was supposed to be present for today's screening, but alas his twins were born just hours before, so he had to jet on a flight back. '2 birthings in 24 hours' was how he joked about it.rendition refers to 'extraordinary rendition' -- a term whereby suspected terrorists in the us can be sent, without the legal consent of their parents nations, to prisons abroad to be questioned and detained.it's fairly predictable -- innocent egyptian-american man wrongly accused of being a terrorist 'goes missing' while en route from south africa to washingon dc. he is sent abroad, while wife at home (reese witherspoon) fights to find him and free him. but what makes this movie special are some nice choices in story-telling: 1) a human-touch story of what is going on in the locale where a suicide bomb-detonated; 2) the humanity of a cia agent trying to understand and be honest with what is really going on; and 3) the chronology of story-telling which makes it a tight, taut tale that moves and jerks at the right moments. ah -- relief! and a mix of emotions that swirl around as the story fights for an ending.all-around strong acting with meryl streep as a standout vixen.

imagine you have just been on a plane for 18 hours. you have been on a business trip to south africa. you are a high-paid professional. you've lived in the us for 20 years. you are in your thirties, you have a wife a little boy and another baby on the way. one thing, even though you have a green card, you are still egyptian. on transit you are asked to come with 2 security guards, next thing you know you are overpowered, hooded and chained and after a brief ( but still reasonably civil) interrogation you are to be rendered! this is what happens to anwar el ibrahimi at the beginning of the movie. his is a story of pain and ( literally )torture. it's one of several story lines. one follows his wife's attempts to get more information. one follows the (cold) bureaucrats behind the rendition. another story deals with the family of the man who leads the interrogation of anwar el ibrahimi. there are some other stories too and by the end they all neatly come together. though the more famous actors like reese witherspoon ( as the distraught pregnant wife ) jake gyllenhaal ( as the cia rookie forced to watch the interrogation in northern africa) and meryl streep ( as cia hotshot corine whitman) it is really the more unknown actors that carry the story and give it it's heart. for me the actor playing the unfortunate mr el ibrahimi ( omar metwally ) was the heart and soul of this movie. his portrayal of a man in distress was shockingly well done. it's almost as if he was being tortured for real! also israeli actor yigal naor was very impressive as the part worried family-man and part extremely cruel chief of torture. hard to watch and not exactly fun, but still very worthwhile.

i think this was the most outstanding edge-of-your-seat thriller that i have seen in a long time. the research for the film was thorough, the writer kelly sane has left no loose ends. the cast was seasoned (fantastic performances all round). omar metwally was outstanding.the cinematography is poetic, music enchanting and the overall effect highly satisfying.rendition goes into territory that even the media fears to tread. it is really a wakeup call for those involved with espionage and the legal web that is the "war on terror". a woman walked out of the theater and asked me "does this really happen"? that in itself speaks of gavin hood's masterful achievement.

rendition presents a very topical matter in the form of a very tense thriller. it's a gripping, and not a preaching, movie. seeing it in an arab country with a mixture of arabian and european audience gave it an extra level of atmosphere. the audience was totally gripped by the film and gave it a loud applause afterwards. the story of an egyptian, married to an american, picked up on the suspicion of links to terrorist organizations and shipped to a friendly (with us) arab country for "enhanced interrogation (as meryl streep's character states in the film: "we have no torture in the us") seems to be from the front page of todays news. there is a very neat link between the various characters which appear in the movie and the pace of the film never drops. the movies'message seems to be (as stated by jake gyllenhal's character in the film) that by abducting and torturing suspects you create many more terrorists. the acting is uniformly excellent with streep and reese witherspoon the stand outs. not to be missed.

i saw the movie yesterday and was shocked by it, but even more shocked by some of the comments i have read here. one person wrote that it was ambiguous if the victim of the torture was guilty or not--therefore... one person wrote that since he wasn't an american citizen, therefore... some people comment that the people in the middle east hate us and want us dead, therefore... so are we saying then that it is right to torture someone who is guilty of a crime? are we saying it is right to torture someone who is not an american citizen? are we saying that it is right to torture someone who may hate us and want us dead? are we saying that, as is written in the geneva convention, the declaration of human rights and the constitution of the united states that "torture is wrong, but some torture is less wrong than others?" when does it become "right" to torture? that is why this movie is powerful-- it is ambiguous, but not about torture. torture is always wrong, and if we are willing to do it, even in the name of justice and "national security" or "freedom and democracy" then we are wrong and we are evil; we are doing exactly what we are accusing our enemies of doing (and we are calling them "wrong" in the same breath.) my favorite line in the film was "if you don't want to compromise join amnesty international." right on.

just reading why this show got canceled makes me rather steamed. this was a favorite of mine as a kid and i always watched it when it came on no matter how many times i saw the episode. sure the effects were not great, but they were also not horrible either. they did a fairly good job with the costume and it had the nice 70's vibe to it that is always enjoyable to see and hear as the music was also very 70's. it did not really have any villains from the comics, but then most comic book live show adaptations had none to very few actual super villains from the comics. spidey's powers were a bit different here too, he had his spidey sense and he could climb walls, but he was not nearly as strong as the spider-man of the comics. he was super strong though as i do remember an episode where he broke into a room by breaking the door knob off, he just was not the car hurler that the one from the comic book can be. the show was set in los angelos so there were not as man buildings to swing from, but they did okay with the web. it is nice that this show actually has the web shooters and not organic shooters of the movie. i love the movies, but part of me wishes they would start over and do the more smarty pants spidey that has the mechanical web shooters. this show had a good star as peter parker and he was okay as spider-man, it is nice to see a spidey who does not basically live in the slums like he does in the movies. neither this show nor the movie though has a spider-man that is quick with the insult like the one in the comic. still, this show was fun without being as corny as the batman show.

this was absolutely one of the best movies i've seen. excellent performances from a marvelous a-list cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back.i couldn't help but care about the characters. ms. merkerson will blow you away, as will the young man playing the young lead.i also thought that the set design was top-rate. the viewer is really placed inside each era as it's presented. the music is a blast, too. nice selections to represent mood, time and place. the blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs. this is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings. take the time to watch it!

this is a must-see movie. you will laugh, you will cry, and when it's over you'll wish there were more. well-written and compelling, this movie draws you in and holds on tight. the casting was perfect, the characters purposeful, and the performances outstanding. "nanny" is the standard to which all women should hold themselves: strong, forgiving, protective, and never judgmental. "nanny", to me, is the epitome of what a christian mother and woman should be: a true pillar of the community. if i were half the woman "nanny" is, i might consider myself to be doing okay. i would have been devastated if "nanny" had died at some point in the movie, but since she didn't i will definitely buy this when it comes out on dvd. i can only hope that the story continues and that ruben goes back to lackawanna to try to rebuild the town, piece by piece and person by person.

this film is one of the historically most accurate war films ever made in that it displays the reality of soldiers in a battle situation as well as the particular circumstances of the battle of stalingrad, obvious when one compares this film to works such as anthony beevor's book "stalingrad".unlike the better known "enemy at the gates" where the plot diverts into a sniper/hunting story, this film shows what war can do to individuals. although filmed by germans, "stalingrad" is anything but a nationalistic apologetic film. it shows that war films can be something beyond flag-waving, jingoistic distortions of the grim truth of war, like so many hollywood "war" products seem to be.the scripting, acting, direction and other film techniques in "stlingrad" are of the highest caliber.it's a must-see film for anyone contemplating to join an army and to obey orders from any type of "fuehrer".

the people of my generation and those who are older know about the ww ii (or as it is called in russia ‚Äì the great patriotic war) not only from the school textbooks, but from the witnesses and participants of the event. my granddad was a soldier at stalingrad and when i was a small girl i used to listen to his stories of how he defeated the germans. he also told me some anecdotes, not all he told me was gloomy. but it was long ago, and no when i have a conscious interest for what happened there in the battle of stalingrad, i have to turn to books and movies for information. somehow most films i saw were made in the soviet union, only a few in present day russia. and ‚Äústalingrad‚Äù is an exception. in the movie the war is described from the opposite side, and the fact in itself is interesting. all that is shown in the film is quite different from what i‚Äôm used to.the film reminds me a great deal of remarque‚Äôs ‚Äúzeit zu leben und zeit zu sterben‚Äù, because the war is shown through an ordinary german soldier perception. and this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed by repeating he is by no means a fascist. the movie heroes right from neat and enthusiastic europe, from the italian coast arrive in the snow-covered hungry soviet union. they are doomed to die; it is clear from the very beginning.after the elite detachment had taken part in their first fight at stalingrad, one of the soldiers said the phrase which reflected the whole idea for me; he said ‚Äúif you start thinking, you will go mad‚Äù. and to my mind it is true for spectators as well. from the one hand, one may think, ok, i‚Äôll just watch this movie and it won‚Äôt dissipate me, i needn‚Äôt feel sorry for the people on the screen as it were they who attacked my country and not vice versa. however sooner or later but inevitably one starts sympathizing with the characters. probably when the lieutenant chokes back his tears at seeing kolya‚Äôs execution.‚Äústalingrad‚Äù is hard to watch, all these frostbitten legs, dirt, executions, snow, famine, destroyed illusions.as far as i know, lt. hans von witzland is one of the few films where thomas kretschmann played his star roles. i watched quite many hollywood movies where he was given unimportant parts of small fries, such as ‚Äúnext‚Äù or ‚Äútranssiberian‚Äù (why did he do it?!). and after i had watched ‚Äústalingrad‚Äù, i cannot make out the european actors desire to appear in american movies, even second-rated at any cost. the fact puzzles me deeply. i believe thomas kretschmann deserves better parts and much better screenplays than those he is given in hollywood. and out of what i saw with him, ‚Äústalingrad‚Äù is the best, beyond the doubt.in my opinion the worst ‚Äústalingrad‚Äù drawback is the way they speak russian in the movie. i mean of course those who are supposed to be russian. say, the boy who spent some time with the germans or the girl with whom they planned to escape. was it really so difficult to find actors able to pronounce a couple of phrases without that horrible accent? initially i set down to watch ‚Äústalingrad‚Äù just to listen to native german-speakers because i‚Äôm studying the language. i did not expect anything extraordinary of the film. but it impressed me, made me cry when i wasn‚Äôt going to at all. i know i‚Äôm 15 years late to watch it, but ‚Äústalingrad‚Äù is not a run-of-the-mill movie, and after 15 years it is still watchable and shocking.

for the main criticisms of the movie... the love story: that wasn't a love story. those were two people distraught coming together trying to find humanity in anyone. the same thing happened with soldiers and the russian boy. it added a feminine touch, but come on look at american movies...no where close to love story. there was no storyline: does war have a storyline? i think that is a silly criticism. the storyline is this. they start with 400 men and the movie narrowed down to show the lives of about 10 men and how each did their part and died. death is the ultimate end to any story. just because there was no happy ending doesn't mean it has no storyline. there was a horrid truth in this movie. i wouldn't necessarily call it "anti-war". it had a political statement of course, but the movie wasn't all about the politics. in fact, except for a few occurrences when the captain? showed up, there was never a stifling air of nazi germany. they were far enough out of the reach of the main nazi party. the fat cats weren't gonna go into russia!maybe not completely accurate and not a hollywood hit, but it exhibits a fine knowledge of the common soldier (i'd say exactly of almost any nationality and war)and what they must go through. it was a losing battle, of course the movie is going to be depressing. and to the person who said that it was gutsy (and silly) to even portray germans as victims: there are victims on all sides in every war (any real soldier will tell you that).this movie is a fine balance between movie and documentary. a few problems with it when arguing for just one, but it instills the best of both worlds. watch it as such. beware however because it is a hard movie to watch if not graphically, emotionally.i'm waiting til they make a movie about iraq. it will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial, i want to see who has the guts to do it first. (jarhead doesn't count)

this is a film that i keep coming back to, for a variety of reasons. as a testament to the suffering of the ordinary soldier on the eastern front in the second world war, it is a powerful one. there are a number of very powerful scenes in the film which help to capture the horror of war, such as the tank battle for instance. furthermore, from what i can see the experiences documented in the film are by and large 'true' - if you read a. beevor's book 'stalingrad' you will know what i mean. the film is also successful in the sense that it doesn't allow character or plot to dominate it - it is simply a tale of survival, that attempts to depict the battle mainly from the ordinary (german) soldier's point of view. i've read somewhere that the original screenplay had to be toned down, which doesn't surprise me at all - if they tried to really show what the battle was like, it would have been almost impossible to make i'm sure. even so, there are still some moments that are difficult to watch - this was made before private ryan but is possibly even harder-hitting in places. just one word of caution - don't buy the dubbed 'english' version, it's pretty awful and spoils the film - try to get a copy in the original (german) version with english subtitles, it's far more powerful. you may need to buy a region 1 dvd of the film in this case, as i did.

the only reason i decided to view this film is because of the great acting talents of karen sillas,(alyson haywood),"bad money",'99, who is deeply involved with gary cole,(dave),"cry wolf",'05, who is a great war hero and has all kinds of ways to make money and never seems to stop telling lies. alyson and dave are trying to rebuild an old home and restore it to comfortable living conditions. the relationship gets troublesome and alyson decides to find out what is going on and the plot gets very mysterious. if you are a big fan of karen sillas, this is the film for you. i only wish karen would appear in more films, i miss her great talents.

this is one of the best tv movies i have ever seen! the title makes it so obvious and predictable but come on, all tv movies are like that!the story is fantastic. it may seem ridiculous but it is based on an incredibly true story. gary cole plays a military man named dave who feels trapped in his marriage. he abandons his wife and kids and then fakes his death! all so he could be with alyson (karen sillas). how far will dave go to keep his secret? the acting is top notch for tv movies. gary cole especially keeps the movie together as a charming, smooth-talking sociopath who has an answer to everything when his wife gets suspicious. karen sillas does the best she can as a wife who discovers that her husband is a liar and doesn't know what to do about it. teddi siddall, who i believe is gary cole's wife in real life, plays her part well especially when she cries about the "death" of her husband. wendy makkena adds a nice touch as alyson's sister. linda goranson is great in her small role as dave's mother.predictable but the acting and the story take this movie up several notches.

this mostly routine fact-based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole. this is the story of a highly trained military man, unhappy with his wife and children, fakes his demise and runs off with the other woman. to support her in the manner in which she is accustomed he robs banks. predictable, but not a bad watch.

i thought it was an excellent movie. gary cole played the role of a military man who feels trapped and unhappy with his wife who fakes his death fabulously! over all, i thought the movie was great, definitely not a boring plot line! it's sad to say, but i think lots of men might feel this way. i think he should have just gotten a divorce and asked to be transferred instead of the extreme he went to, but he felt there was no other way out so he faked his death. i thought it was neat that cole's real-life wife played the wife he was unhappy with in the movie. i think what the guy did was alittle extreme, but the movie was great nonetheless! definitely recommend it!

he is very good in this role as a disaffected and bored husband, a decorated air force officer, who becomes bored with his predictable suburban life and decides to make a radical change.one evening he meets karen sillas, an attractive woman younger than his current wife. a relationship develops, and cole decides to take it to the next level.not only does he have an affair, he fakes his death to escape his family obligations. lies become increasingly more of a pattern as he begins to rob banks to keep his new wife (sillas) happy, and to project the image that he is a success. a fictional delusion, apparently.this was also based on a true story which makes it all the more intriguing. cole is believable and excellent in these roles. recommended. 8/10.

(some spoilers) facing a mid-life crisis and fed up with his marriage to cindy ,teddi siddall, who seemed to have more say in what he did and where he stayed then the air force,usaf elite red beret sgt. major davis bay, gary cole,decided one morning to just walk away from in all and start a new life as a civilian. david first got this idea when he met at a halloween party sweet and adoring alyson, karen sillas. keeping his background secret from her by telling alyson that he's in a top secret military outfit was the perfect cover for him. back at jackson afb outside of austin tex. david starts to review his life's options with cindy and the usaf and decides to change his identity by running away from it. david then calls alyson, who only met him once, and makes a date with her. before you know it david, now using the name haywood,is engaged to be married to her.faking his death in a bicycle accident dave purposely leave his wife and kids out in the cold and deserts his military obligation to his country.it didn't take long for dave to find out that civilian life just doesn't appeal to him. it's now too late for dave to go back to his first wife cindy and his two boys with him facing the brig and a military court-martial if he comes back to the usaf. dave takes up the only job that he could do to support him and alyson and their infant son chris: using his skills he learned in the red berets to rob banks.based on a true story "lies he told" has dave bay/haywood living three, not two, different lives. one of a hard working family man one as a ruthless bank robber and yet another one as a dead and highly decorated, by the president of the us and prime misnister of gb, all-american hero. gary cole is very effective as both master sgt. david bay&husband david haywood. davids actions are, even though unforgivable, understandable in the case of his depression over his marriage to cindy. the pressure of her nagging him got to the point where he just wanted to get lost and away from her and the kids. but he should have sought professional counseling from the us air force, which he would have been gladly provided with, instead of choosing the easy way out. which in the end lead him straight into levenworth ferderal prison. it may have been that the overly macho dave thought it would have been a bad mark on his career, as well as his ego, to get help for his problems.karen sillas as alyson is the glue that keeps the film together with her at first going along with her new husbands explanation of his frequent disappearances, some for as much as two weeks, as him doing covert action in keeping the country safe from domestic and foreign terrorists. the real reasons for his long absences were the result of him casing out planing and robbing banks. which was the only way he knew how to earn a living given from what he learned, in subversive actions, all those years in the elite red berets.alyson tracking down dave's mom carolyn bay(linda goranson), who he told her was dead since he was a small boy, in portland she finds out the truth about the double, or triple, life that he's been leading since he married her. this lead to alyson finding out about his marriage to linda and the two sons that he had with her as well as his faked death, and now awol, from the usaf. being that it's a true story the ending was anything that you would have guessed it to be in a standard hollywood, or made for tv, movie. that's what makes the film "lies he told, a lot better then what you would have expected it to be.

i don't like boxing, don't understand the attraction. i did like this movie. positive portrayals of latinos, with no drugs, sex or street violence. the plot actually showed stable, loving families. the fight sequences are violent, as is boxing, but not as over the top as rocky films. nothing wrong with attempting familiar themes with a different angle and ethnicity. it's a good rent.

father hoodi can understand why a lot of people hate this tale of a father kidnapping his two children and carrying them across america, but i've seen much worse, and--when i saw this years ago--i didn't think it was particularly awful. patrick swayze is the worried father who takes his kids on the run with him for personal reasons, and halle berry is the cop chasing them down.overall a decent way to spend a couple hours of your life. you could certainly do worse--ever hear of the film "pod people"?** 1/2 out of *****rated pg-13 for some traumatic scenes, adult content matter, violence and language.

father hood is an entertaining tale of an unwilling father who is definitely a hood! patrick swayze plays jack charles who is a hood always on the look-out for the one big "score" that is going to put him on easy street. his wife died while he was is prison and his two kids were put in foster care. when he "got out" he thought they were probably better off in foster care ¬ñ besides he still had to score his fortune. his daughter kathleen charles (played wonderfully by sabrina lloyd) breaks out of a foster care institution that is abusing the kids and misappropriating money that is suppose to be being spent on the kids. she hunts down her father; tells him about how bad the place was and that her brother, eddie charles (played by brian bonsall) , "just a little 7-year-old kid" was being moved to the institution that she had just broken out of and convinces her father to kidnap him. the three start off on an adventure across country, all the while jack keeps telling himself that he has to get rid of the kids! patrick swayze is really good in this comedy, playing a "hood" (probably a little understatement for this criminal character) who is similar to his johnny castle character of dirty dancing except jack is appropriately funnier in this comedy and more optimistic than johnny castle. swayze is funny and rally does comedy pretty well! halle berry plays kathleen mercer who is a reporter trying to get at the truth of the foster care system who becomes sawyer's ally. diane ladd plays rita the con-artist mother of jack charles.

"father hood" is an overlooked little gem of a "road movie". fine performances by halle berry, sabina lloyd and brian bonsall, two really fun "over-the-top" ones by diane ladd and michael ironside,and a downright outstanding one from patrick swayze. the movie is helped by an unconventional storyline, but badly undercut by it's flashback framing which results in a formulamatic, abrupt ending. "father hood" would have worked much better without these "bookends". nevertheless, the movie brings up important issues of "family responsibilities" and the consequences of state intervention. as long as the foster system rewards state institutions for not placing children, such abuses will exist.pick this one up. it's worth the "ride."

044: the big trail (1930) - released 10/24/1930; viewed 4/5/06.births: richard harris, harold pinter, robert atkins.doug: in hollywood, raoul walsh unveiled his latest film, the big trail, a western about the trek west across the frontier, starring up-and-coming 23-year-old actor john wayne. in 1930, we are seeing many "firsts" but few "bests." besides the first john wayne film, we have here the first widescreen film (although we only watched the full-frame version). interestingly, the decision to film in widescreen was essentially the same reason that widescreen became popular later: to compete with television, which hadn't yet appeared commercially but was still an emerging curiosity. all the same, this film was extremely good, giving us a harrowing look at the trek to oklahoma. the opening title cards let us know that this is a western of the most traditional kind, about america, about the land, who should live on it, etc., and is an excellent demonstration of that. walsh gives us some astonishing visuals of the wagon company out in the wilderness (when they reach a cliff, they must rope each wagon down one by one), and we also get a revenge subplot involving wayne pursuing the man who killed one of his friends (i seem to recall something similar in stagecoach). wayne's tough cowboy routine is at least partly there, and would surely evolve further in subsequent films. since this film is representing all of wayne's early 30's work for the odyssey, we will not see his face again until stagecoach, but once we do, we will keep seeing him to the end of the odyssey and beyond.kevin: ah, our first sound western, and john wayne's first starring role. it's raoul walsh's the big trail. this review will be short, since it's been weeks since i watched it. i enjoyed this movie, but it was far from a masterpiece. the mostly predictable adventure had a few surprises, like when the brains of the bad guys, red flack (tyrone power sr. in his last role) is killed half way through; i thought he would be the boss at the end, but that ended up being bill thorpe (ian keith). i remember that i didn't like the way breck (wayne) kills thorpe and exacts revenge at the end. i understood that that's what he was meant to do in the story, but i really didn't like his reasoning when he tells ruth why he has to do it. i think he had a far greater responsibility to the hundreds of settlers he was leading through the harsh west.last film viewed: animal crackers (1930). last film chronologically: soup to nuts (1930). next film: l'age d'or (1930).

this movie was very good, not great but very good. it is based on a one man play by ruben santiago hudson..yes he played most of the parts. on paper it looks like stunt casting. yes let's round up all the black folks in hollywood and put them in one movie. halle berry even produced it. the only name i didn't see was oprah's ,thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a hallmark movie. instead this movie was not some sentimental mess. it was moving but not phony, the characters came and went with the exception of her husband, pauline and the writer in question. the movie revolved around the universe of nanny, mrs bill crosby and how she raised the writer and took in people. now being a jaded new yorker when he said she took in sick people and old and then we see them going to a mental institution to pick up a man, i'm thinking looks like sister has a medicare scam going. getting folks jobs and taking the medicare/caid checks but no she explains to lou gosset she just wants 25 bucks a week and did not want the money ahead of time. i think that part was put in the movie just for us jaded new yorkers so we know she is not scamming the poor folks.(g) it was written by a new yorker so he knows the deal(g).. she almost seems angelic and looking through a little boys eyes i can see why. she is married to a ne'er do well who is 17 years younger and fools around on her. terrence howard was born to play these type of parts. he was good but i would like to see him play something different. markerson who plays nanny is also very good. but for some reason the person who stood out to me was a small role played by jeffery wright. where is this mans oscar? he already won a emmy and a tony. he was in shaft and he stole the movie. i did not even know who he was in this movie. he is a chameleon never the same. i never seen him play a bad part yet. this was a 5 minute role and he managed to make me both laugh and cry. i re-winded the scene few times ..one time because i didn't know who he was. his wife carman ejogo was excellent. i have seen her in roles before mostly mousy stuff. but she is so good here. i actually know people who act just like her. so it was very real to me macy grey who had one of the bigger parts was also very good. i was very happy that they did not kill nanny off. i thought she was a goner in the beginning of the movie. but she was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people. there are women like that in most of our lives. people we might know or even lived with. thank god for them, i do not know how they do it all of the time. i have a friend who lost 2 children and been through a lot of stuff but whenever i am feeling selfishly sorry for myself i call her and she always puts me in a good mood. this movie is a tribute to all of those people. i only wish they they told us what happened to some of the characters like the the one armed man, paulines boyfriend who is played by one of my favorite actors on hbo's the wire, omar, rosie perez's character and richard the lesbian and delroy lindo's one arm man, he was mesmerizing in another small role.

my god, ryan gosling has made a lot of deep characters in his career, this is one of his wonderful acting jobs. for me this is a very deep movie, needs a lot of concentration, not because is difficult to watch, just because you understand it if you put your shoes in this kid, even though has everything and has famous father that is a writer, has a deeper mind, you don't understand why he kills this poor kid, until you really heard what he has to say and you start to think, at least to me, that a lot of things that he says is true. simple kid, sweet, very gentle, in a way normal like any teenage, but inside of him suffer because he start to look at the world in a different way, then you understand why he did what he did. i recommend this movie for those who likes deep drama.

this movie was a masterpiece of human emotions and experience. i think that a lot of people get caught up in leland's apparent mental illness as the storyline, but i was drawn into the relationships of many of the characters and what they reveal about the force of human emotions. much of the message of the movie is that we never know the good without the bad, which is a little clich√©, but what makes this movie so good and so original is that it very eloquently portrays the crushing and devastating force that the bad can have, whether you see the bad everywhere like leland, or are experiencing the utter helplessness of unrequited love or a relationship that just isn't going to work no matter how bad you want it to. this movie captures how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie i've seen, and it is as depressing a movie as it is good.

this has to be one of the most powerful message-sending movies i saw lately, it was absolutely flawless all the way, amazingly original and thought provoking. story is unusual and original, and the characters make this story very very powerful. it's about a guy who kills his ex-girlfriend's retarded kid brother, and as he is sent to juvenile prison, through many memory flashbacks you get a grip on a story and you don't let it go until the very end. murder he commits changes the course of life for every member of his family and the family of deceased, and as you watch and realize that everyone has its own story and its own dark side you just appreciate this movie even more, it's a total tour de force, cause those actions cannot be described by simple words. his motive of committing murder is left incompletely explained, and it makes viewers think. acting was pretty much flawless, and the cast was very good, it contains many familiar faces. if you like the movies that are thought provoking and that just make u think during them(e.g. 'donnie darko', 'mulholland dr.') then 'the united states of leland' is an excellent movie choice for you, otherwise you should pass this movie and watch it when you're in the mood for serious thought provoking movie.10/10

i remember seeing the trailer for this film and i absolutely knew i had to see this movie. it looked like something that would be right up my alley."the united states of leland" is a terrific movie. it is not one that will leave you with a nice, pleasant ending, but with a sad, empty feeling instead. and when i say it will leave you with an "empty" feeling, i do not mean that as a bad thing. i believe that you are meant to fill that empty feeling with your own thoughts about the characters and human's general motives and how they act as parts of society.ryan gosling is perfectly cast as leland. he is intelligent, yet stoic. i like the way that he narrates the film with his journal. the supporting cast is terrific as well. kevin spacey is very good, as always, and don cheadle is amazing as leland's teacher and mentor. this was a great story and is very smart and thought provoking. i highly recommend it.

this totally odd-ball feature is a typical and prime example of satanically shocking 70's horror. the events are thoroughly confusing and it takes up quite a while before you figure out what the hell is going on, but the brooding atmosphere sucks you in immediately. right from the indescribably bizarre intro, showing a couple of eerie children turning toys into real-life war machinery, you just know this become an uncompromising and gritty shocker. "brotherhood of satan" soon appears to be another installment in the alleged & unofficial "creepy little town hiding a dark secret" sub genre. a young widower, traveling with his new yummy girlfriend and 8-year-old daughter, stops in a remote little town to report a car accident they witnessed on a nearby highway. the villagers behave very hostile and insist the visitors on leaving right away. the town clearly bathes in an ambiance of fear and panic, as local children vanish inexplicably vanished and unnatural forces maintain everyone within the boundaries of town. hillsboro is in the grip of a satanic cult, apparently ruled by the elderly members of the community. i really liked "brotherhood of satan" a lot. the story reminded me of a novel written by john saul, but i can't remember the title. it also dealt with a cult of elderly people abusing youthful villagers for their own greedy merits. the film mainly relies on creepy scenery (like dolls and witchcraft relics) but a slightly more involving and coherent screenplay would have been nice. the subject matter often raises a lot of issues and questions, and director bernard mceveety can't always provide us with answers. the climax is terrific, very seventies (meaning shocking) and unforgettable. beautifully shot film, too.

i had been interested in this film for a long time, especially after reading a couple of online reviews of the dvd edition; however, i kept postponing its purchase because of the excessive price-tag and utter lack of relevant supplements. when it went out-of-print earlier this year, i finally gave in - but the entire order (which included a number of other highly-desirable titles) got lost in transit!; luckily, the dvd has been re-issued at bargain-price - and i'm sure glad i picked it up! anyway, this is one strange film, and a genuine sleeper: initially confusing but striking occult tale which manages to hit bullseye with respect to both its forbidding small-town atmosphere and the inherent eeriness of the sinister goings-on. a small cast responds perfectly to a terse, absorbing and intelligent script: lead strother martin, in particular, makes the dialogue sound better than it actually is with his nuanced performance as the town doctor/head of the witch's coven; l.q. jones and alvy moore (both of whom also produced the film!) offer solid support as the no-nonsense sheriff and his comic-strip aficionado assistant.the plot merges elements of various earlier films dealing with witchcraft and the supernatural, and not only the obvious titles: the fact that the town is held under a spell which can't at first be identified, for instance, brings instantly to mind the similar affliction of one specific bourgeois household in luis bunuel's sublimely surreal the exterminating angel (1962)!; the 'possessed children' angle was borrowed, perhaps, from village of the damned (1960); there have been many films - especially of a recent vintage - where the satanic rites of a witches' coven are shown: from the city of the dead (1960) to the devil rides out (1968) but, since the proceedings take place in modern-day america (albeit in remote surroundings) and revolve around elderly witches (seeking a 'renaissance'), the film they recall most of all is rosemary's baby (1968).the occult scenes (accentuated as much by foggy exteriors as by the shadowy lighting of the garishly-decorated house where the diabolical events take place) are presented in a completely matter-of-fact way as to make them unsettling and extremely effective - particularly the opening sequence involving an army tank crushing a car(!), the rampage of a devil-doll (a concept which has been done to death over the years but, here, it raises an undeniable frisson), a surreal dream sequence (set inside the ice chamber where all the victims are kept, since they can't be buried!), a sequence where the witches attack a doubting member of the coven, a beheading committed by a horse-riding medieval knight(!) and the lengthy 'black mass' finale (with the witches, accompanied by the respective child they will be 'taking over', all dressed in red - except for a black-clad martin presiding over the ceremony) which culminates in ritual mass suicide! the film also has the guts to deliver a downbeat 'curtain'; it's so refreshing to come across a title (albeit a low-budget production) from a major hollywood studio, columbia, that contrives to go so completely against the grain (like, i said, the film is quite weird - extending also to the editing and the score)! it's odd, too, that such a classy - and cinematic - horror offering {sic} should come from a tv director most often associated with westerns and other family fare! by the way, the same theme was dealt with almost contemporaneously in the nth christopher lee/peter cushing collaboration nothing but the night (1972; which lee produced himself!) - a film i foolishly missed out on some 20 years back when it was shown on local tv, and which has been m.i.a. ever since!! p.s. this review of the brotherhood of satan will certainly contain spoilers but, then, the synopsis and artwork featured on the dvd cover manage to give everything away anyway!

i would probably say this was on a par with films like "devil's rain" and that sort of film, although this is probably a bit better made. i love 70's horror and this has most of the elements that make up other movies i like so it was pretty easy to enjoy. a family on their vacation stumble across a small town where the people seem to be gripped by some sort of hysteria. seems like the children have been disappearing. after an initial attempt to flee this place, the family is somehow stopped on the edge of town and find their way back, but not without first finding a house where the kids are gone and mommy and daddy are dead. seems like we have a different kind of twist on a senior citizen community center in this town, they're all satan worshipers and they need the kids to renew their lives so they can continue on in their service, i guess. not that anyone seems too keen on giving up their kids for this enterprise. this is fairly classy considering that it's scary and creepy without buckets of gore or the loud startling events that try to make people jump in films today, which seem to have replaced actual scares. we have hank kimball (alvy moore) from "green acres" as tobey, a sheriff's deputy that reads ufo magazines, and lq jones as the sheriff, and a very familiar character actor as the dad of the stranded family. and strother martin plays the doctor who seems to be doing double duty unbeknown to his fellow townsfolk. this is pretty good stuff but a tad on the confusing side sometimes, but overall works pretty well & is recommended for fans of 70's horror. 8 out of 10.

i had no idea what i was going to see when i decided to view this film and to my surprise its just an extremely well made horror film that is easily one of the best of the 1970's. film is of course low budget and this is an excellent example of how the story and style of a film creates chills, not special effects! strother martin is one of the great character actors of all time and he has a rare starring role here and the film also stars martins good friend l.q. jones and "green acres" alvy moore. jones and moore helped produce this film as well. tv veteran charles bateman is the star and "enter the dragon" beauty ahna capri is his girlfriend. capri is in a bikini at the beginning of the film and she's just gorgeous to look at! film does a terrific job of staying with the story and not adding a phony feel good ending and i really liked the way the film ends. great atmosphere, interesting story and well directed by bernard mceveety. martins performance is top notch also as he doesn't hold back at all and really throws himself into the role of doc. good and underrated film!

this is one creepy underrated gem with chilling performances and a fantastic finale!. all the characters are great, and the story was awesome, plus i thought the ending was really cool!. the plot was great, and it never bored me, plus while the child actors were bad, they gave me the creeps!. this happened to be on the space channel a while ago, so i decided to check it out and tape it, i read some good reviews from fellow horror fans, i must say i agree with them, it's very creepy, and suspenseful, plus strother martin, was fantastic in his role, as the satan worshiper. it has tons of creepy atmosphere, and it keeps you guessing throughout, plus all the characters were very likable, and you really start to root for ben and his family!. it has plenty of disturbing moments, and the film really shocked me at times, plus, it's extremely well made on a low budget!. this is one creepy underrated gem, with chilling performances and a fantastic finale!, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. bernard mceveety does a very good job here, with great camera work, creating a lot of creepy atmosphere, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. ther is a little bit of blood and gore. we get a severed leg,lots of bloody corpses,bloody slit throat, slicing and dicing,decapitation, and an impaling. the acting is excellent!. strother martin is fantastic here! as the satan worshiper, he is extremely creepy, very convincing, was quite chilling, was extremely intense, seemed to be enjoying himself, and just did a fantastic job overall!. charles bateman is great as the dad, he was very caring, very likable, and gave a good show!, i liked him lots. l.q. jones is awesome as the sheriff, he was funny, on top of things, looked very young, had a cool character, and just did an awesome job overall!. ahna capri is good as the girlfriend and did what she had to do pretty well. charles robinson overacted to the extreme as the priest and didn't convince me one bit!, and that laugh of his was especially bad. geri reischl is actually decent as the daughter, she was somewhat likable, and only got on my nerves a couple times, i rather liked her. alvy moore was goofy, but very likable in his role as tobey i dug him!. rest of the cast do good. overall i highly recommend it!. ***1/2 out of 5

every great once in a while, you stumble upon a movie that exceeds even your wildest expectations. given the imdb rating of 4.0, i wasn't really expecting much with the brotherhood of satan. i hoped that at a minimum it might be cheesy fun like the devil's rain or any of the other early 70s similarly themed satanic horror films. i couldn't' have been more wrong. what i got instead was an ambitious and intelligent film with a cast i really enjoyed. speaking in broad terms to avoid giving anything away, the film's style and structure are much more experimental than the straightforward storytelling so prominent in the early 70s. the brotherhood of satan doesn't beat you over the head with plot points and explanations. a lot is left to the viewer to fill in the blanks. as a viewer, you know something is amiss, but for the longest period you're just not sure what it is. the unknown helps make for a far creepier atmosphere than most similar films. the ending is effective with its surreal imagery. i sat in amazement as the final credits began to roll. those wanting a big slam-bang finale will be disappointed with the ending's simplicity. a lesser film would have tried to pull out all the stops and would, most likely, have failed miserably.there are moments in the film where it's easy to forget the director, bernard mceveety, had primarily worked in television before the brotherhood of satan. there are a few scenes that are so well set-up, lit, and shot that even the most accomplished of directors could learn a thing or two. for example, i've seen enough films over the years to realize that directors can sometimes seem to have trouble shooting widescreen shots indoors. not here. the scene where the men are discussing their plan of action in the sheriff's office is amazing. we see all five men at once ¬ñ each doing their own thing as in real life. in a lesser film, we might see all the men at once, but each would be motionless, quietly waiting their turn to deliver their dialogue. it's a small scene, but it looks so natural and is so beautifully shot that it's one of my favorite moments of the brotherhood of satan.finally, i mentioned the acting in my opening, so without going into a long-winded speech, i'll just say that the brotherhood of satan features strother martin and l.q. jones. any film with these two guys is almost an automatic winner with me.

this was a great movie. something not only for black history month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child. the performances by s eptath was outstanding. mos def and his singing was off the hook. had to do a double take when i saw that was rosie perez there. but the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching. all the different stories they had was amazing. and how nanny protected jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence. i can truly understand her being the matriarch of that time period and even more so how tired she was in helping everyone. cant wait for it to come out on dvd. it would be a welcome addition to any movie library.

no blood, no sex (though it oozes passion), no special effects, but just one of those pearls that comes across your movie screen when you're not really looking and grabs your attention. great acting, great sets, great music, beautiful storyline. if only there were a lot more movies made like this one!the sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there.the acting appears like real life, and elevates us to the level of awareness of "nanny", to whom no-one is a lost cause, least of all the inhabitants of her own "halfway" house. best of all it's a true story of misfits learning to "fit in". i was somewhat jealous of the good times that everyone appeared to be having in the movie! could we all spend some time in nanny's house?

growing up in the late 60s and 70s i could not help but become a fan of science fiction. with america's space program in top gear, sci-fi books, movies, tv shows, and comic books fueled my imagination and opened my mind to the possibilities that exist in the universe. farscape is so unlike any other sci-fi show yet it has all the ingredients that made shows like star trek, battlestar gallatica, x-files, and deep space nine personal favorites. one of the criticisms of farscape is that the casual viewer can't just jump in and watch one episode and understand what is going on. there have been other very successful shows that used multiple episode story arcs and complicated characters. this for me is one of the charms of the show. i don't need or want to have the story all tied up neatly at the end of every episode like the various incarnations of star trek have done. all in all, farscape has wonderful and funny characters and a running storyline that says that although humans may be the least evolved or advanced intelligent species in the universe, they still have unique qualities and abilities.unfortunately, the shortsighted people at the sci-fi channel have canceled farscape's 5th season. they have stated that the cancellation was based on sagging ratings. yet just a few years ago it was their top rated original series and a critical favorite. it's a shame that all of the artists who help create this show will be unable to continue their labor of love because of the fiscal problems of the very channel/company that made it all possible in the first place.hey, don't take my word for it, watch the show, watch the re-runs and make up your own mind. help save farscape!

farscape is the best sci-fi show period, for one main reason, everything the show attempts, it does very well. from a technical aspect, the music is original and perfectly fitted to the show. the special effects are abundance and higher quality then almost any thing else that you will see on your tv. the acting is also great, too many shows nowadays use only the american market of actors for their shows. remember the first time you saw the matrix and you said, wow where did that agent smith come from? its the same feeling that you get watching claudia black, anthony simcoe, lani tupu, virginia hey, and especially wayne pygram. these aussies are great and it comes through in this great show.the plot is second to none. the next closest thing i can think of is babylon 5 during the shadow wars episodes, but this tops even that. its a real treat getting to watch all the episodes sequential again, the intricacies of the interpersonal relationships of the characters are well scripted and performed. the overall plot is both original and thoroughly entertaining. i am always itching for the next show.the comedic episodes are funny, the drama episodes are touching, and the action sequences are tense. the beginning of the second season had some great comedic episodes which had me laughing aloud, something that rarely happens while watching television that is not south park, sealab 2021, or seinfeld. the drama is even harder, whether crichton is meeting his mother or the characters face thier mortality, all is done with heart and intensity. lastly it goes without saying that the action is tops. this is sci-fi.if you are a fan of science fiction in the slightest, if you enjoy good television at all, if you like good serialized plot, you owe it to yourself to watch farscape.oh, and ben browder owns.

an astronaut gets lost in deep space and finds himself traveling through unknown territory on board of a living spaceship accompanied by a group of alien-outlaws. this incredible plotted and enjoyable tv-installment comes along as a positive birth-fantasy. the individual characters, in conflict at the beginning of the series, have to learn to get along with each other and evolve into a powerful group at last. most of the action takes place inside the womb of moia, the living space-ship (who even gets pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). while science-fiction-stories are usually interested in negative birth-fantasies (watch the 'alien'-movies for example, especially the fourth part 'resurrection') this comes as a surprise. also enjoyable is the absence of military hierarchy on board of the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human (and alien) body. one of the female characters who is actually a plant experiences 'photogasms' while being exposed to sunlight. the crew even has to go to the toilet. wouldn't that be impossible in 'star trek'?

having just borrowing the series one dvd collection from my somewhat obsessive brother, i was expecting to get through the first couple of episodes and handing it back. i have just found myself yelling at the screen for ending the first season on a cliff-hanger - a mere week later and i've watched the entire season. where i found the time for this i have no idea.this show is great. it doesn't take itself too seriously, it has likeable characters who are well acted, and the special effects (ignoring the odd tacky puppet here and there) are "special" enough to give it that polished feel. at first, i didn't realise it was filmed mostly here, and it seemed odd to hear so many aussie accents on a sci-fi show - it was most amusing for the main character (john) to land back in sydney midway through the first season.i believe this show's biggest strength is the vision that the creators of the show obviously had. they have gradually introduced new aspects of the characters that have explain previous actions, and the continue to smatter john's conversations with slang in an amusing and unforced way. on top of that, having watched the entire voyager and next gen series, i see little plot rip-off - so it has managed to maintain a sense of originality throughout the entire first season. i hope the rest of it is as good.farscape is not like any other sci-fi that i've enjoyed in the past. i heard that the fourth season wasn't as good as the first three, and i am now quite annoyed that they cancelled it before the 5th. i hope that they revive this show - with the same actors in either a movie or another series. it would be a shame to leave so many plot lines unfinished as i imagine that with a show that's had so much thought put into it, to have it axed without adequate warning will leave me feeling robbed.gotta go now... heading back to my brother's place to snaffle the 2nd season.v.

one of the greatest crimes made against sci-fi television was the cancellation of farscape. one of the most well-written, well-acted and over-all best shows ever to grace the airwaves, it set new standards for sci-fi television. once the flagship, highest rated, critically acclaied show of the sci-fi channel, it defies explaination as to why shows like buffy, tremors: the series, and even stargate: sg-1 have lasted as long as they have. yes, even buffy. but i'll save my buffy bashing for another time. farscape was poorly treated by the sci-fi channel, continually tossed around in scheduling, reruns rarely shown and never really advertised. but while the show has been cancelled, all those involved in the production of the show want to bring the show back (even henson company ceo brian henson). there is also an extensive fan-based movement to bring the show back . overall things are looking far from dark, and hopefully, fans will get their season 5.

the other reviewers are way waaaay off as to why the farscape show has been (temporarily) put to rest. it has nothing to do with the quality of the shows 'slacking'. in fact, the exact opposite is true. they kept getting better and better! :) i have seen every episode and when you simply watch them in order you really become in awe how much cooler it gets as they move on and on, and the wormhole & aeryn subplots are really very interesting and gave it more vibe, not less. before it was sort of chaotic, slow, and rather aimless. they spent like the first two seasons running from this foe type, but in the second two they were actually trying to do something :) also i have never seen such a great fun blend of sexy gals and attitudes in sci-fi. the blue girl - zahn - was cool, but not 'sexy'. they literally got to the point where the gals were running around in leather corsets and high heels blasting aliens - now tell me, what could be cooler than that??? :))the real reason farscape went off for a bit is because it was costing too much - and that is a good thing for the fans, because the show, watched end to end, is really like a 60 hour long epic movie, with all the cinematics of the blockbuster stuff (ok ok they do use similar sets a lot, but the cg is great and the gals are sexxxy).blah blah - the real reason is because tv shows are about profit. it is a business, and the sci fi channel or whoever was not getting as big a return on this expensive farscape show as they could with junk shows like 'stargate'. lexx was actually cool until they got rid of the hot german girl and replaced her with this bizarre fat-lipped oddity.anyway yes, remember this: farscape kept getting better and better, until it was really like a little real movie each week. then the networks decided 'hey people will watch any old piece of drek we shove on the air as long as it is the only sci fi thing on at that hour, so why are we spending all this money on farscape, let's shove cheesy low-budget 'stargate' down people's throats and call it a 'hit series' because it's like all we play every darn night lol :))that's the way it goes. also i gotta tell ya that claudia black is a really cool actress. after she got her facelift (got the baggy eyes tightened) she was looking really cool - one of those dynamic types like judy davis, and sometimes hot looking, sometimes ugly - like a roller coaster ride. i'd par claudia black with lucy lawless in style and substance - both very fun to watch - not just chrichton :) and yeah you may say the pregnancy thing was cheesy, but how many sci fi shows have a believable and deep romantic subplot that actually goes somewhere and progresses?? it was legitimately cool as a romance story - the actors on the show are great. it really is a shame the show is in limbo for now, but i hope it comes back in more episodes soon and movies as well, because i will deffinately buy them! :-d

i have to tell you i've been a fan of star trek tng since i was a kid.well, sometime ago i gave a friend of mine some ds9 episodes and i asked him"hey man, what are you watching lately because i'm done watching all tng episodes" he said. "well, i got these episodes of farscape". i said: "ok, let me try it" i was pretty sure at that time that i wont like it because i was just finised watching tng and found it great."i had 3 episodes, viewed those but the show didn't impressed me very much, i found it childish initially and i thought its just another tv show, nice adventures but regular. music was a little bit different, neat special effects though and i had the vague impression that the actors didn't fully get into the characters skin.i watched another 3 episodes thinking that 3 eps were not enough to decide i like or not since. then the show started to get me, i got a good grasp of the action and wanted to see what happened next to the poor crichton....the rest is history. i think i mostly like the freedom of the characters in the context of the action unlike star trek where everybody slept when they were supposed to do and way too much high tech bullshit. the show got better with each episode, very interesting story line.....what can i say, this movie its like poetry. i highly recommend it!!!

this series is vastly underrated. like many others, i came upon farscape after the series had been cancelled. bought season 1 and was surprised to find a smartly written drama infused with a balanced mix of suspense, romance, wit and, of course, sci-fi. right off the bat it got a 10 for being the first series or movie to satisfy us how our hero - and every alien with whom he comes in contact - speaks english! okay, a few others have skirted the issue, but farscape did it the best. the point is, the writers pay close attention to detail to make the show as believable as possible.with so much bad programming out there, it's a shame that balanced, entertaining series such as farscape don't get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production. while we enjoy the four seasons and, thankfully, the four-hour miniseries, maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show.

farscape - is the one sci-fi show which restarted the interest in science fiction in me.but farscape is so much more then plain and simple sci-fi. comedy, drama and much more :) the acting is very good. luckily farscape survived also it's cancellation and showed with peacekeeper wars that it is not dead yet :) i hope there is a future for farscape :) in my opinion it is also not problematic that some of the characters in the show are muppets. you have to look behind that and you will see what a beauty farscape is.farscape set a new standard in television and i think it will be truly hard for new shows to prove that they can be equal or better than farscape. i love this show :)saphirjd

when i first saw the premiere episode of farscape, i had no idea what to expect. i was immensely impressed and satisfied with "premiere". subsequent re-watches, however, have made numerous flaws apparent to me that i missed initially. "premiere" is not a great farscape episode, but it deserves credit for successfully and efficiently setting up the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the regular characters.the episode begins with john crichton (ben browder), an astronaut and scientist, preparing to launch into space in the farscape module, a small space ship perfected by crichton and his friend dk. crichton has a revealing conversation with his father, jack crichton, and then begins his test flight in space. of course, everything goes wrong and crichton is "shot through a wormhole" and winds up in "a distant part of the galaxy".after exiting the wormhole, crichton's module is pulled on board a living space ship. from here, the characters and story line for the farscape series are introduced in an entertaining albeit rushed manner.the regular characters are properly introduced during the first half of the episode. of course, there is crichton, played well by ben browder. he offers a the audience a sympathetic character to identify with. he's lost and has no idea how to do much of anything. in "premiere", crichton has to choose between joining the prisoners or the peacekeepers. he knows nothing at all about either side, but in helping aeryn (a captured peacekeeper pilot) it becomes clear that he intends to help the peacekeepers. he probably would not have ended up siding with the prisoners if it hadn't been for crais, a peacekeeper captain, declaring crichton to be the murderer of his brother. this puts crichton in an interesting situation: he's stuck with bizarre, violent escaped prisoners in a far-off galaxy about which he knows nothing at all. crichton's total lack of knowledge of the farsape world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during farscape's first season.the supporting cast is just as compelling. there's zhaan, a blue delvian and former prisoner. she's peaceful and reasonable, as opposed to fellow prisoner ka d'argo, a powerful and hard-headed warrior. virginia hey is totally covered in blue makeup, allowing her character of zhaan to appear cool and convincing. d'argo's mega-makeup, in contrast, is below-par. he looks kind of silly with his giant tentacles and strange nose, and there is something peculiar about his eyes. they look as if they have had some sort of allergic reaction to his makeup. farscape would give some improvements to his makeup in season 1, but the overall costume would, for me at least, remain as a problem until season 2.the puppet/digital characters of rygel and pilot are, to put it simply, excellent. rygel is a tiny hynerian dominar who floats around on some sort of hovercraft. in "premiere" he is given some good dialogue but not much else. pilot nearly steals the show as the liaison between the living ship, moya, and moya's passengers. even in the first episode, pilot gives off the appearance of being a real, living alien; he never once in the show seems to be a giant, expensive machine.the peacekeeper characters introduced are quite interesting as well. the peacekeepers are made up of a race called sebaceans, who look just like humans. the chief antagonist is introduced in "premiere" as captian crais, who believes that crichton killed his brother. in reality, crais's brother's death was merely an accident resulting from an accidental collision with crichton's ship. aeryn sun, a pilot who crichton helps escape, tries to explain that the death was an accident, but crais just claims that she is "irreversiby contaminated" and refused to change his mind. crais obsession for revenge, warranted or not (it should be clear to crais that crichton isn't responsible), is mysterious in "premiere", but would be explained later in the season. aeryn herself provides an extremely interesting character. by being forced to leave the peacekeepers, she changes her whole way of life, and is in that regard in a similar (though less severe) situation as crichton.the actual episode, as mentioned earlier, feels somewhat rushed and clunky. so much happens that not enough time is spent on anything. also, d'argo (for now) looks kind of silly running around in his mediocre costume trying to appear menacing. still, "premiere" is solid entertainment. the special effects (such as in the starburst sequences) are impressive. most of the costumes and the sets on board moya are original. despite its flaws, "premiere" is a must-see for farscape fans. 3/4

watching this series will probably make you feel like how our parents felt when watching star trek for the first time.this series has it all. the kind of stories that makes you forget how to blink, the kind of characters that makes you want to jump into the tv to join the action, and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair curdle in awe and endless admiration.in short, we start out with john chrichton, an astronaut, who gets shot into a wormhole and ends up with a gang of prisoners on the run from the badguys in black, ironically known as peacekeepers.other colorful characters consists of d'argo, big dude with a short temper and a sword/laser-rifle. aerun sun, former peacekeeper and a ph.d in buttkicking. zotoh zhan, who's a plant. no really, she is. she's also a priest, but with a mean streak. there's also dominar rygel xvi, an fat lazy bastard who farts helium and generally does more harm than good.later in the series we meet the most sexy alien that has ever been on television, namely chiana. a young and seemingly chronically horny nebari. she is played by gigi edgley, which is a name you should remember.one of the many things i love about these series is that since john chrichton ended up in this part of the galaxy by mistake, he keeps giving references to "real life". namely, when john is having a bit of difficulty accepting the fact that he will be frozen as a statue for 80 years, one of his many complaint is that when he returns, buffy the vampire slayer will be dead.so frell all the other series, get your dren together and spend an ahn on one of these episodes. i can assure you, sci/fi as you know it, will change forever.this series has it all. it's sexy. it's actionpacked. it's hillarious. it's farscape

"lackawanna blues'is so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban blacks during the 50s and early 60s. a culture of joy and sadness specific to working class blacks that existed outside the mainstream culture. the characters of santiago-hudson's play depicted black individuals who lived imperfect lives but maintained strong positive values of love,loyalty and honor. although the characters moved away from those values at times, they did not deny the importance of the values. instead they recognized and accepted their own imperfection and those of the other characters, without judgment, that passed through the life of "nanny". the central characters were strong and believable, the settings were realistic and brought back personal memories of a by-gone era. pre-integration urban life was a time of sensory intoxication, sight, sound,and smell, that could almost be experienced by watching the drama "lackawanna blues" unfold. i will watch it again and again.

i loved this film. a must see for any rod steiger fan. producer suzanne delaurentiis and director stewart raffill have brought us a true family film that touches the soul. an incredibly well put together movie with a beautiful soundtrack.

this film is a sleeper because rod steiger's is the only big name in the credits. yet, all of the supporting actors fit well with his character. it was fitting that in his last film, rod steiger reminded us once more of his inventive power as an actor. he portrayed a grandfather's impulsiveness, stubbornness, and acceptance of the end of life in a characteristically individual and convincing performance. because his character was close to death, the story brings us closer to the most precious things granted to us: the privilege of life, relationships with family members, and the empathy of those who care for us. his search together with his grand daughter for one of his sons provided enough suspense to keep me waiting, expecting a highly-charged climax such as the meeting of two long-separated elderly lovers who were also on the cusp of death in "forever young." i wondered how the meeting would be staged and how tightly my emotions would be wound by the time he and his granddaughter reached the end of his quest. i was delighted to find that the story brought more than i expected. the delightfully satisfying climax brought for me a greater appreciation of the value of the precious gifts of life, love, and family that are enjoyed today by me and by all of us.

i put this movie on not expecting much, other than a b movie gore fest. thankfully i was presented with a very well made film, that built up the suspense and managed to maintain it throughout its run time. this was an impressive achievement. the acting was solid, creating characters that you cared about and related to; and although some may find the film slow, it did force you to think about what you would have done in the same situation. added to this there was some fine camera work and the directors pulled it all together admirably. an excellent effort then, that is well worth your time if you prefer development and suspense over gore.

i've read many unflattering comments regarding this film, and the only things i have seen that they all have in common are: "boring" and "unrealistic".first of all, they used real frickin' crocs! how much more realistic can you get? no cgi, no animatronics, no miniatures. just a croc and a piece of meat. have fun, fellas!there is no question that this film gets off to a slow start. character development, what little they had, anyway, does take a bit of time, and i think this is primarily where this film lacks.however, when the film gets going, i found the action picked up dramatically. i don't mean to say that there is a lot of action. if anything, there are more moments where the croc can't be seen at all, and the people are just waiting. however, we know that there isn't going to be any relief, and that the croc is just biding its time. this had a similar eerie feel to other films that achieve their horror through non-action, such as open water (another film that has been criticized by some viewers as being "boring"). personally, i think that viewers who find themselves incapable of feeling the suspense have had their attention spans surgically removed at birth, but that's just me.finally, the characters feel real, and the situation is such that it really could happen to anyone in the right circumstances. furthermore, the deaths are completely real, and at times, it's a little tough to watch.all in all, this one's a winner.

one of the best horror/suspense movies i have seen in a long time. wow, it was a big surprise and stunning at how good this movie was, sometimes a gem like this will surface but is rare. i expected a popcorn monster flick and a mildly diverting way to spend a late night but instead a very well made and directed movie with great acting and made with passion and heart. this is a movie that makes you feel for the characters and what happens to them, and it is filmed like you are there and it is really happening. i know some people in other reviews compare it to "open water", but i disagree because i thought open water was quite boring and mediocre, while this movie was the opposite, although superficially they are filmed in the same "realistic" style.the actors are unknowns, at least to me, but they all are very effective and convey the dire situation with frightening intensity and realism. the story is well done and flows smoothly, the plot is logical and appears to be something that could happen, all the actions and thoughts of the characters are quite what a person would do and think about. very believable and this makes the movie more real because of it.i had tears in my eyes at the end. i must say a movie seldom has this effect on me, this is how powerful and emotional this movie was done and i am suitably impressed by the director and actors of this great movie.

so well made, no cgi crap. has anyone else been on the "jumping crocs" tour of darwin's adelaide river before? black water was way realistic; rogue was a bit cringeworthy.thought the blonde chick was excellent in it - haven't really seen her before. and the other chick is a babe, she is always excellent. v. suspenseful - i would compare it to jaws over any other man eating animal flick. got the hole aussie thing down pat without going ott with struths and crikeys, as well. loved it!

i live up here in croc territory and remember well the true events that inspired this movie. our guts fall out each time we hear of a croc attack. black water is, quite simply, the best croc movie i have ever seen. while i loved rogue last year for all its effects and splashy scenes, it was the local scenes that captured our audience. we laughed in rogue more than anything. black water, however, really resonated with the eeriness and fear that you can experience when you are alone in the mangroves (you guys call them swamps or bayous - but they're mangroves). every tourist should see this film before heading to the northern territory. the ending was a bit of a letdown after the rest of the film, but i'll be adding this one to my dvd collection when it becomes available.

black water, co-directed and written by david nerlich and andrew traucki, is very simple in its execution yet effective. the film is a low-budget australian movie that will unfortunately not get the recognition it deserves because as far as creature features go, this is one of the best out there. the setup is rather basic; grace, her husband adam and her younger sister lee are touring some mangroves in the northern territory when a saltwater crocodile flips their boat and leaves them stranded in the trees. the whole movie is about their survival while the crocodile is lurking below waiting to strike.unlike greg mclean's rogue (another killer croc movie released earlier in 2007), black water is not about the audience having fun guessing who's gonna be eaten next, it is about hoping and praying that the three people will get out safely. the three unknown actors do a great job with pretty demanding roles, considering it was filmed on location with a real crocodile instead of cgi. the characters act realistically in the situation and the dialogue seems natural and not forced. suspense is built up throughout the entire film, we do not see a lot of the creature but just knowing it is near is terrifying enough. this is edge-of-your seat stuff and highly recommended if you enjoy original and (most importantly) scary horror films.4/5

this movie sets out to do something very particular, it also sets out not to do certain things. in short it has a definite premeditated trajectory - to deal with the idea of facing death (with very few choices and all of them bad) as grave and real rather than something casual or amusing. in search of that realism it has eschewed certain conventions such as obvious character arcs and hooks. it not about the characters so much as about the human condition. never mind what the actors would do... what would you do in their situation? open water may have been a starting notion for this movie but it goes a lot further. unlike that film it doesn't cheat the audience in the end when you find out there aren't really any sharks to speak of at all. this has a real monster, not just the idea of a monster and not just an animated stand in. it also has fine production values given what these very resourceful filmmakers had to work with. and again in contrast to that other film it has some exhilarating and brilliantly rendered action at it's climax. and let's not forget the, shall we say 'dazzling', screen presence of its youngest star. she may prove to be quite a discovery.

i'd never heard of this aussie horror prior to michael elliott's enthusiastic review; in fact, after having read it, i decided to check if the dvd was available at my local rental outlet and it was (albeit a german edition i.e. sans the r1 extras), so i opted to check the film out immediately.while i wouldn't go so far as to give it full marks ¬ñ only a select few titles get them from me, let alone an obscure modern flick ¬ñ i have to say that i was quite impressed with black water. rather than looking back to previous crocodile movies, such as alligator (1980) and lake placid (1999), it evokes the memory of two which saw a small group of people who go on a trip, get lost and find themselves at the mercy of the elements and the creatures inhabiting the place ¬ñ namely long weekend (1978), itself a little-seen but impressive australian production, and open water (2005).the compact, simply-plotted film involves a couple and the woman's younger sister who decide to go fishing in a remote and forbidding part of the australian wilderness, known as crocodile territory; very soon (in fact, before even 15 minutes have elapsed!), their boat is capsized and the guide killed by an alligator ¬ñ so our luckless adventurers take refuge up a tree. the dvd talk reviewer believes the film suffers from spending too much time in this one location ¬ñ with the three arguing about what they should do, attempts to retrieve the boat, seeking a way out of the jungle through the trees (only to be met with nothing but water) and the occasional attack by the monster. however, i think the makers take the situation as far as it will go without slipping into tedium: this is due to the palpable suspense and, as michael said, the believability of the characters (particularly the two women)¬Öbut also the fact that the crocodile here makes for one of the scariest and most memorable in recent memory (i wonder how they got it to 'perform')! i also agree with mike that the film contains some really effective shock moments ¬ñ the alligator leaping out of the water to take a bite at the petrified heroes; its head suddenly emerging in front of the women as they're making for the boat; even though one of them does reach the vehicle, the monster manages to lift its massive weight and get in the boat with her!; towards the end, as the same girl manages to find a gun (on the mangled body of their guide), loads it and lies in wait for the alligator to appear, the latter sneaks up from behind her (incidentally, the creature is bestowed with the craftiness of the shark in jaws [1975]). with this in mind, the finale is just as crowd-pleasing (though on an obviously smaller scale) as that of the classic spielberg blockbuster ¬ñ even if it has a downbeat follow-up. another definite asset is the film's sparse score ¬ñ which is generally rather lovely, but becoming unnerving at just the right moments.at the end of the day, black water emerges as a breath of fresh air in the face of the demoralizing slump into which horror cinema has fallen of late; for this reason alone, it deserves greater exposure so as to remind us that there's hope yet for our beloved genre (without the real necessity of resorting to the gimmickry of a cloverfield [2008] to command attention)¬Ö

gore hounds beware...this is not your movie. this little nail bitter has very little blood and guts. its basically a version of open water that is effective and worthwhile. but what sets it apart is that we actually like the three leads (unlike open water) who find themselves up a tree when a crocodile flips their fishing boat and munches up their guide. we don't want any harm to come to any of them. so when they start getting into dangerous situations...we actually care. now i like killer animal flicks but i haven't been too impressed with lake placid up to primeval (although i'm still waiting to see rogue and hoping it is somewhere as good as this one!) but this little bugger did the job and did the job well. it's scares are creative and it only lapses into the run of the mill frantic crying sobbing and arguing for brief stints of realism so i never got annoyed. i remember reading the true story that inspired this where three guys went fishing and two ended up in a tree while their buddy was killed by the crocodile . but the thing that always impacted me that gets left out from the film was that the crocodile didn't eat up the buddy. no. for hours and hours he swam around the tree and shook the dead body still in his mouth at the friends in the tree. seeming to stay, if you come down here this is what will happen to you.

as a kid i loved the song "never smile at a crocodile", and if i found myself in this state of affairs, which is actually inspired by true events. smiling would be the last thing on my mind. from the opening set-up, i've never been so entrenched, caught up and finally exhausted like i was when watching this limited budget independent australian horror film, about three people in northern territory trapped in a mangrove swamp with a very conniving crocodile waiting in the water below them. what really brought the film alive, was how realistic it managed to be in transporting the fear and uncertainty of the characters' situation to the audience. semi-documentary camera-work with a disquietingly eerie backdrop and authentic performances effectively take you out of your comfort zone. what we get is a patient survival tale than just a bloody, all-out creature feature onslaught. think of "open water (2003)", where its budget and time restraint made sure it would stay low-key, but this minimal barrier enhanced the experience.the slow-grinding story might be black and white, but it never seemed to become disposable, or succumb to formulaic patterns. well not largely, and the connection between the characters were emotionally engaging even with a bare, straight-forward script. although you can say "less is more", with the actions and expressions illuminating the lingering thoughts plaguing their minds. the ordeal is utterly terrifying, because the threat is very alive and never seems to loosen up. this is what drives the film's chaotic adrenaline, and in which it lasts (even when its kept buried) through to the very end. writers / directors andrew traucki and david nerlich's economical guidance alienates and smartly strings along the viewer with its taut pacing and harrowing psychological traits. in certain patches the notch goes up, with pressure induced suspense and startling images. the way the night sequence is executed is immensely chilling and pulsating. the menacing crocodile manipulative toys with its fresh-meat in a distressingly suspenseful approach. sure some moments felt unlikely, but never does it get in the way or distract. sound fx is the key, and at times the lack of any just eats away at you. rafeal may's musical score is unassuming and doesn't really enter the mixture much, but when it does it builds an organic sounding quality. the cinematography of john biggins is beautifully devised, and rapidly aggressive when the mood changes. it was always on the move and claustrophobic, but none of this jerky movements. the editing was sharply handled, and the effects were professionally catered by superbly combing live crocodile footage. something like this production would also have to rely on its cast to sell to the story in a believable manner and they do it. diana glenn, andy rodoreda and especially maeve dermody are persuasively good. a lot of the responsibility falls on dermody, and she strongly delivers with an inspired turn. now this item might cop some comparisons with another killer crocodile film "rogue (2007)", but the two couldn't be any different in what they want to be and how they end up. if i had to pick though, i'm leaning more towards this outing for its sheer involvement to snap at you.a remarkable effort on all fronts, with everyone involved showing potential to really look out for.

this low budget crocodile movie really delivers the goods. the fact that it was inspired by true events would mean little if you wound up with a fake looking crocodile, bad c.g.i., or an obvious studio setting. fortunately none of the above are involved with this terrific, very realistic film. the crocodile is real, there is no c.g.i., and the on location filming takes place in an actual australian swamp. the actors were obviously inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performances, and they succeed. you can place yourself in their predicament, which is testament to how realistically "black water" translates as entertainment. highly recommended. - merk

"black water" is one of the most tense films i have viewed in a long time. the story moves fast as it follows three tourists (all great actors) into a swamp on a tour with a butch tour guide on a small boat. soon after dropping anchor in a remote area of the swamp, they are flipped over by something huge in the water.hastily, the three manage to make it into a tall tree nearby as they realize that a crocodile has attacked them. throughout the next two days, they have to desperately try to escape from the crocodile's evil watchful eye, and he doesn't seem to want to go away. the movie drags just a tad bit, but what can you expect from the setting and the limited budget? it's so much better than "primeval" and other recent crocodile/ underwater predator thrillers. the tension is heavy, and all three leads give terrific performances. truly chilling, this movie struck a deep chord of claustrophobic fear in me. apparently based on true events.

while on vacation on northern australia, gracie (diana glenn), her husband adam (andy rodoreda) and her younger sister lee (maeve dermody) decide to take the blackwater barry tour in the swamp for fishing. their guide jim (ben oxenbould) uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote spot. when they stop, they are attacked by a huge crocodile that capsizes their boat and immediately kills jim. the three survivors climb a tree and when they realize that help would never come to rescue them, they decide to try to find a way out of their sheltered location. however, in the muddy water, their boat is flipped and the crocodile stalks the trio under the water."black water" is a tense, realistic and dramatic low-budget movie and in accordance with the warning in the beginning, based on a true event. the acting of the unknown diana glenn, maeve dermody and andy rodoreda is top-notch, giving credibility to this simple but scary story. there are many similarities between this movie and "prey", but in different environments. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "medo profundo" ("deep fear")

warning: i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.this movie was on the shelf at a movie store and since i had seen a handful of very corny horror flicks there i had really low expectations for this one. well, i put it in, and almost immediately i was sucked right in. while watching, i got deeper and deeper into the story and pretty soon i was staring in complete interest. this movie is surprisingly spectacular and i loved every second. the story is about a boat ride down a river in australia. it seems safe enough until their boat is ambushed by a croc who's ready for some food. when i looked at the back of the case i thought that this movie was going to have crappy visual effects like in lake placid 2 and a lot of others, but when i first saw the crocodile it looked amazingly real! don't laugh when i say this, for i am being serious, but this is one of the most creepiest films i've ever seen. it really knew how to build up nail-biting tension and suspense with it's intense situation, i mean, think about it; your stuck, in a tree, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide with a hungry predator in the depths of the water below. you can not tell me that doesn't freak you out just a little. it even managed to give me a few chills down my arms, like when adam was taken by the croc and grace and lee are left baffled. this is a very appealing movie. there were maybe 1 or 2 parts where i found myself slightly uninterested but other than that, i would say this is my favorite animal attack film that i have seen.

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.in the tradition of all good animal centered thrillers ie jaws, the edge, the original cat people, the directors know that restraint and what isn't shown are the best ways to pack a punch. the performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.if you are after a b-grade gore fest croc romp forget black water but if you want a clever, suspenseful ride that will have you fearing the water and wondering what the hell would i do if i was up that tree then it's a must see.

while many people found this film simply too slow and simplistic i really connected with it. there is no plot as such, rather the film takes the form of a human survival story about three people trapped up a tree with a man eating crocodile lurking somewhere in the water beneath them.personally, i thought the acting was mostly very good, despite the roles being quite demanding at times, and i felt a sense of warmth for the characters. the situation they were in was quite terrifying and i really felt nervous for them. i found the whole film quite nerve wracking because of the sheer helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival.the crocodile effects were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget film, and believe me, i have seen my fair share of dodgy croc movies. the creature moved well and had real menace and, although the audience i was with didn't seem too keen on the film as a whole, they still jumped and gasped whenever the crocodile appeared.script-wise, i would have made a few changes, particularly towards the end, but this was not a major problem. for fans of slow-burning survival horror set within the realms of reality this will be an engaging film but unfortunately i think for many audiences seeking a thrill ride and higher production values from their cinema experience the point will simply be missed.

as i am a teenager, i have about one hundred years of movies to catch up on. i try to see a mixture of classics, mainstream, art-house, and other movies. the 70's is one of the most important decades for films: it's when the average, common, classical films changed into full of messages and anti-social behavior. it became like nothing anyone had ever seen before. what a decade under the influence basically shows is how important all of the movies from around the graduate to about star wars.richard lagravenese and the late ted demme are the primary interviewers in this documentary, which interviews such people as dennis hopper, francis ford coppola, martin scorsese, robert altman, and jon voight, among others about how those few years changed cinema forever. it's a very professional, polished documentary, and it's even financed by ifc films. however, as this is a very professional one, i would think that they would at least edit out the noise of someone behind the camera laughing. to me, that took out a lot of how neat and clean the whole thing was.on the other hand, it's a very interesting documentary, about film by the people who make it. of course, they aren't bashing their own films or anything of the like, but they're portraying honesty on what they thought of the films and what they meant. i don't know much about film (but i want to be involved around it when i become an adult), so i feel like to someone like me this movie is a huge asset. i have seen a good number of movies that they mentioned, like chinatown and one flew over the cuckoo's nest, but a little more insight into those movies were very informative.the main reason, however, i didn't love influence is, as slickly as it was edited, it seemed to take its time in the beginning and be quite relaxed, therefore not having enough time to get to everything that they wanted to show. they crammed in star wars and jaws in the last few minutes, when they were two of the most important. it seemed like they tried too hard to show lots of clips, and that's fine, but some of them were unimportant, such as an extended one from network.overall, though, influence is a very enthralling, informative documentary that helped me, at least, learn more about a second `golden age' in american cinema.my rating: 7/10rated r for language, and images of sexuality, violence and drug use.

i swore i would never allow myself to devolve into to the bogus authority figures of the sixties who told me things were better in the "good old days" ¬ñ the current australian prime minister is a sordid example of just such a mind set.but i switched over to "a decade under the influence" because i found watching the much-heralded "sneakers" documentary on the other channel such a dispiriting experience. i found the values expressed by the "sneakers" interviewees too ugly to accept as reasonable. so materialistic! so devoid of any sense of outrage at a society that can countenance killing someone to steal his very ugly shoes! so lacking in any worthwhile purpose that they can report without distaste the exploitation an audience by haranguing them to hold those shoes above their heads to lock in a sponsorship deal for themselves with a company of cobblers was just too much to continue watching."a decade under the influence" depicted a completely different response to the fruit of stupidity, corruption and concupiscence in high (and low) places.i have noted the change in film-making that accompanied the exposure of america's disastrous foreign policy debacles in vietnam and so many less reported places in my www.peterhenderson.com.au website. "a decade under the influence" documents the precise moment at which that change took place.before the seventies, the armed forces were depicted in american films as an invincible fighting force comprised of decent human beings who transmogrified into conquering heroes on the battlefield. after the seventies they are generally portrayed as a dispirited rabble misled by a bunch of bureaucrat clowns in the pentagon before the seventies, the fbi agent and the honest cop tended to be depicted as your friend and protector. after the seventies, the fbi agents were all incompetent and the best a cop could aspire to was to ignore their foolishness and his superior's corruption and uphold justice in his own idiosyncratic manner.before the seventies, the archetypical american "little guy", the "average joe", the jimmy stewart type would face down the problems encountered and thereby gain some insight into underlying wisdom of his elected leaders and justice of the "american way". after the seventies, kevin costner usurps that role, but now he is the voice of one crying out in the wilderness for evil to be exposed, or accepting his lot and making out the best he can.and now those "old time religion" mindsets have been stripped of any honesty and righteousness and portrayed (with a certain amount of justification) as sanctimonious bigotry and self-serving hypocrisy."a decade under the influence" tells it like it was. "a decade under the influence" tells it like it is now. it depicts the redemption of the american film industry from the hands of the artistically, morally and intellectually bankrupt studio moguls. it shows the storming of the hollywood bastille by the independent film makers who promised to get a disillusioned and tired audience back into the cinemas. the fact that their failures were numerous, and at times disastrous, merely underlines the greatness of their achievement. an achievement reflected in the adventurous and questioning attitudes of the big box office stars such as clooney, daman, affleck etc and the directors and producers who provide the vehicles for their talent.

this exploration of a unique decade in us cinema begins with the fall of one ailing, out-of-touch empire and culminates with the unstoppable rise of another, equally associated with escapism and box office receipts. meet the new boss, same as the old boss. or, as peter fonda observed in easy rider, "we blew it." in between, from bonnie and clyde to star wars, the young turks (some under the guerrilla tutelage of roger corman) were creeping under the wires to produce some of the greatest artworks of the 20th century. while the story is already familiar from peter biskind's easy riders, raging bulls directors demme and lagravenese are less concerned with muckraking than in providing a platform for the filmmakers and stars themselves.everyone from martin scorsese to francis ford coppola and julie christie is interviewed and a roster of well edited clips places the decade in a socio-cultural and economic context. if their responses are self-congratulatory (to say the least), they're also highly quotable, funny and revealing, making this something of a cinephile's wet dream. director william friedkin reveals how the original the exorcist poster was to feature a little girl's hand holding a bloodied crucifix and the legend 'for god's sake, help her", before he complained. former warner bros.' head john calley recalls that when he first saw robert de niro in mean streets he assumed scorsese had secured a psychopath's day release for the shoot.happily, a certain amount of hard perspective has crept into the mix, as might be hoped from a politically motivated, consciousness-expanded generation; hopper stresses "there's a lot of real crap in there too". julie christie observes that 1970s us cinema was "not a good time for women". but if demme responds with a spoonful of sops to women's movies - brief clips of alice doesn't live here anymore, they shoot horses, don't they and klute - we're soon dragged back to the usual male wall-pissing contests.the shift from tough, socially-conscious film-making to no-risk crowd-pleasers like jaws for 'nam-weary, fantasy-craving audiences is also documented, though a little rushed. but kudos too, for the inclusion of lesser-sung, but equally relevant films like panic in needle park and joe. "we weren't handsome," muses bruce dern on his contemporaries. "but we were f****** interesting."

i gave this film my rare 10 stars.when i first began watching it and realized it would not be a film with a strong plot line i almost turned it off. i am very glad i didn't.this is a character driven film, a true story, which revolves mainly around the life of rachel "nanny" crosby, a strong, beautiful (inside and out)black woman and how she touched the lives of so many in the community of lackawanna.highly interesting not only its strong characterizations of nanny and the people who lived at her boardinghouse, but also it gives us a look at what life and community were like for african americans in the 1950's, prior to integration, and the good and bad sides of segregation and how it ultimately affected and changed the black community.in addition to excellent performances by all members of the cast, there is some fine singing and dancing from that era.

what a wonderful documentary - i sat down thinking this would be a rehash of the bitchy stories told in easy riders, raging bulls, but it is, in fact, a clear-eyed, glorious celebration of a strange and twisted era that spawned some truly great movies. what struck me was the lack of bitterness apparent in the director interviews, given that now the movie business sucks in a large fashion - instead, folk like friedkin and coppola's eyes seem to positively glitter recalling their glory days. the footage of an audience coming out of a daytime screening of the exorcist was priceless. 'it was - traumatic,' one guy says. a great epitaph for the late ted demme, a thrilling film, i just wish it was longer - i could have sat through a three hour cut of this.

a surprisingly good documentary. my surprise was mainly due to the fact that i was confused by the title. i assumed this was about the influence of the drug culture on film making but no it is a much more far reaching and intelligent film than could have been expected. demme has done a great job in encapsulating the period from the late 60s to the late 70s. from, 'easy rider' and the collapse of studio influence, through all those introspective 'real life' movies, where brilliant young directors tried to express themselves politically, sexually and artistically, through to the beginnings of the blockbuster and the return of the reigns to the money men and their studios. as someone who saw the 'real life' movies of britain and the rest of europe through the sixties and then the revolutionary us films of the 70s and is sad that the sequel to the sequel is so much the order of the day, this was a most fascinating film. the interview clips are measured (thanks to dvd the full interviews are available as extras!) and the film clips well considered. also, as someone who has only just caught up with, 'joe', i am impressed that this important little film gets its well deserved entry here.

...and my reasons for which are simple- there are so many great films presented and discussed here (most of them by their own directors and stars), so many clips of infamous moments in 70's movie history, and in fact a number of films i have yet to see, that it wouldn't be fair to grade this work. by this logic i shouldn't have given grades to other movie documentaries like martin scorsese's personal journey through american movies and my voyage to italy. but while those films were on the basis of one man's view of cinema, narrating through most of the way, richard lagravanese and (the late) ted demmes' a decade under the influence lets the films and the creators speak entirely for themselves. what makes 'decade' worth at least one watch for film buffs, or just anyone who likes the films of the late 60's-70's in america, are the levels that it goes to, that in the uncut version (three hours, not the theatrical version, which i have no comment on) plenty of ground is covered. interviews include the likes of scorsese, robert altman, sidney lumet, julie christie, jon voight, francis ford coppola, paul schrader, pam grier, bruce dern, peter bogdanovich, roger corman, dennis hopper, robert towne, etc, and there's a constant flow of insight from start to finish. the way the clips and directors/actors pop up, edited together in a flashy and quick style, is also fascinating. the one down comment i have on the documentary is that most of the information presented has been reported on in various books, like easy riders, raging bulls, and though i haven't seen the movie version of that book yet i'm sure it would have covered many of the films and directors and incidents as here (in fact, the book of that is one of the best i've ever read. however, this documentary serves as something special for film buffs and occasional movie goers of the future- they can look at this and learn not only about such well known pictures as easy rider, the last picture show, annie hall, coming home, and lessor knowns like scarecrow, panic in needle park, the landlord, joe, they shoot horses don't they. they can also learn about who influenced them (new waves of europe and asia), who they served as influences for, and how the subject matter that created controversy after controversy still serves as intriguing and chancy material for the contemporary crowd. seek this out!

this is a gem of a film, slapstick violence a-plenty, simon pegg and green spew.a suspicious looking power plant and an incontrollable motorbike add to this stonker. if you haven't seen this i can highly recommend it, maybe not quite as good as bottom but not far short.if you have never seen a man impaled by the nose on two hooks then what are you waiting for buy this film.i didn't even see the twist at the end coming when it turns out that ritchie and eddie are both ghosts.feeb - 1 boiled egg.

okay, this may not be the most sophisticated movie you'll ever see. actually, there isn't a bit of "sophisticatedlyness"* in it. it's puerile, adolescent, inoffensive, idiotic..and utterly hilarious. basically, richie and eddie run the worst hotel in britain. cue some ridiculous antics with the guests while they beat each other up, try to get the rent money out of the only resident who is daft enough to stay, have an all night drinking binge with the boys from the power plant next door...and fall in lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press. give it a try if you're a fan of rik and ade and their work. if you're not...don't get the movie. simple as that.*i'm not being thick, this is a word from another one of rik's fab jaunts into the movie world ^_^

bottom has been my favourite sitcom ever since i saw it on t.v and the movie is even better if your a bottom fan i say this is a must buy!!! the plot is that eddie and ritchie run a hotel named guest house paradise but not all goes right for them as customers leave until a famous actress come to stay they try there best to impress her but not all well go right this is a upbringing to british cinema so buy this and you will wet yourself with laughter. also starring simon peggi (shaun of the dead) and also bill neigh (love actually) it might of not done good in the box office or by the looks of it on this website but don't listen to them buy this and i swear you will love it

i had been looking for this film for so long before i found it, i had seen it when i was younger and loved it, after my second viewing i still loved it and i still do.this is a love/hate film, if you like bottom, young ones, the comic strip, then you will find this funny. if you don't like that kind of humour then don't bother. i love this film and have grown up with these comedy programmes, for me this film is simply placing their comic genius on the big screen.. it is not an award winner by any means but if you just want good wholesome slapstick then this is it!the film lacks the quality of the tv series and this is usually the case with films but it still has enough material to keep you laughing even if a lot of the jokes are pretty similar to their previous work.yes, the humour is a little childish and not to everyone's taste but sometimes you just need that in a film.

if folks were really this stupid i could be the srw - supreme ruler of the world. in this one knotts plays a dimwitted bean counter for some little jerk water town run by a group of crooked simpletons only slightly brighter than he is. when things appear a bit shaky for the crooks they go for a frame-up of the patsy figg. plenty of laughs as knotts does his usual bumbling, stumbling act. i especially appreciated the extension cord scene; asininity at it's highest level.

this outing of knotts includes one of his best sidekicks ever, frank welker. welker makes the film. knotts and welker compete for the laughs and both receive plenty. knotts works for a small "no where" town where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials. when things go wrong the city fathers, allow knotts to take the fall. frank welker's character befriends knotts and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and knott's good name. this film shows the usual knott's scared to death character that made him famous for years on television and film. this may have been knotts' last good outing. when you have an extra 90 minutes, get a good old fashioned laugh a great icon, don knotts.

this movie was groundbreaking in the former soviet union because it was the first movie released there that contained a real sex scene. however, the movie can be considered great for many reasons, not the least of which is its true, gritty portrayal of disillusionment and pain in the family of a working class soviet family. i would definitely recommend it.

there was a lot about little vera that was strange to me. all in all i did enjoy this movie, but a lot of the way the characters behaved was not what i was used to. for example the environment that vera's family lived in was very tense. almost every time the family was together they were either drinking, fighting or yelling and frequently it was a combination of the three. after i had viewed the film i felt tense because of all the confrontation that took place during it. i was however very interested in watching the story if this middle class russian family. throughout the entire film we are reminded of the industrialized state of russia because of the repeated shots of a train passing by the screen. it gave the viewer a sense of a mechanically lived life. the characters seemed to be focused on living their lives through work and drinking after work. there was not a feeling of happiness throughout the film. the only time a character was not yelling was when vera first fell in love with her fianc√© sergei. this was very short lived because the viewer later discovers (after sergei locks vera's father in a bathroom and vera lets him out after which the father proceeds to stab sergei) that he is abusive. another time vera is told that the only reason she was born was so the family could get a larger apartment. it is very interesting watching how both vera and the family were able to cope with each other's behavior. the film was definitely worth watching because of its depiction of how life could be in areas of russia.

little vera is the story of a russian teenager, her family, and her attempts to find meaning and value in a life sliding increasingly into decay. in her search for meaning, she falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious sergei, whose hatred for her deeply flawed parents quickly spirals out of control.little vera is shocking and disturbing in nearly every way. the drinking of the father, the enabling and lack of understanding of the mother, the casual lies and misdirection of the brother, and vera herself forgiving them all their flaws are all shocking and slightly disturbing to watch. however, the raw honesty of the film somehow manages to become even more shocking than the plot or characters. set in cramped spaces and vast urban decay, little vera presented a vastly different view of soviet life than had ever been seen before. in fact, little vera is a portrait of the collapse of soviet society painted in shades of pain, desperation, and rust. it is the implosion of a family set against the implosion of an entire social order.although painful and desperately unsatisfying, the film itself is definitely worth seeing, if only to understand the feelings and cultures still reshaping russia today.

a gritty presentation of the decay of family values and human dignity in the wake of soviet communism, vasili pichul's 1988 film little vera is a landmark film of modern russian cinema. pichul's brutal drama marks a strong departure from the images of sanitized idealism promoted in soviet times (as in aleksandrov's circus), brashly moving the social chaos of his time into the public spotlight. a contemporary ukrainian setting further intensifies the effect, first by the immediacy of the film to its time period, second by its utilization of a locale not only struggling for identity in lieu of a soviet system, but also as a nation distinct from the russian idiom that had dominated the u.s.s.r.vera, the film's title character and protagonist, is a rebellious adolescent girl with a "dysfunctional" family including a hard-drinking father and a mother care-worn. rejecting her would-be beau andrei, vera begins a destructive (and primarily sexual) relationship with a college student named sergei. despite her parents' dislike for the lazy sergei, and despite sergei's rude contempt for her parents, he moves into their cramped apartment. tensions escalate until vera's father drunkenly stabs sergei. vera must decide if she will stay loyal to her intolerable family by testifying her father acted in self-defense, or continue to support and defend the ever-detached sergei. unbearable in almost every imaginable way, little vera masterfully captures and communicates the inescapable void left in social life after the collapse of communism. the sexual aggressiveness of the film (it was the first film to show explicit sex) combined with the unrelenting presentation of social reality (a marked distinction from the socialist realism demanded by stalin) effectively confronted the conditions of former-soviet life. most interesting, however, was public reception. while many wrote hate mail to the director and star, the film was wildly popular. here the double-edged nature of "film as social criticism" emerges: if done correctly, the film will make the audience uncomfortable. because no easy solution presents itself, some viewers will hate the film and filmmakers for "bringing up" the issue. many films come to mind as somewhat comparable in this regard: larry clark's kids, harmony korine's gummo, even popular movie's such as john hughes' breakfast club. i recommend this film to those viewers for whom the prospect of nearly two hours excruciating domestic conflict and social miasma is not overly daunting. the film is absolutely beautiful, and incredibly challenging. despite the difficulties of watching the film, some moments within it are profoundly beautiful. of course, the socio-historic and cultural significance of the film cannot be overlooked, and in fact operate as an even more assertive reason for watching this film.

forget every spy movie you've ever seen - this is what life was like in the ussr, and still is in many places in russia and the ex-soviet countries. vera dreams of life of leisure, as she imagines the west to be; her reality is very different, with a bitter mother, a violent father, and the ever-present alcohol. and her prospects for the future are not much better. she finds a man and they try to patch up a life together, but he is afflicted by the same environment, both socially and physically - the scenery in this movie is brilliant, sitting comfortably in the company of post-apocalyptic movies but obviously done with no special effects; they have just walked in and shot whatever happened to be in front of the camera.forget your stereotyped, cold russians of spy movies. this is the real deal: people are passionate, vibrant, and present in a way you'll never see in a drama from the west.

in russia, the ordinary teenager vera (natalya negoda) lives a leisured life with her drunkard father and her simpleton mother, without working and waiting for the calling for a technical course of telephone operator. her brother victor (aleksandr negreba) lives in moscow with the family of his own and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and vera, being always motive for arguing. when vera meets the student of university sergei (andrei sokolov), they fall in love for each other and decide to get married. sergei moves to vera's house, but lives in conflict with her father. this relationship leads the family to a tragedy.i have just seen "malenkaya vera", and i liked a lot this deep family drama. i am not familiarized with the life style in the former urss, but there are some unusual behaviors that i found very interesting. the first one, when victor tells vera that she was conceived not because her parents wanted to have her, but because they wanted to move to a larger apartment. another one, when the family goes to the beach in a truck. many difficulties of vera's family and their friends, the repression in the park and other situations pictured in the movie are common in third world countries. this low budget movie is very well-directed, and the story is very profound and real. the cast has great performances and the actress natalya negoda is very beautiful. in the cover of the brazilian vhs, released by sagres distributor, there is information that natalya negoda was the centerfold of playboy magazine. i am not sure how precise are the subtitles in portuguese, since many long sentences spoken in russian are limited to short translation in few words. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "a pequena vera" ("the little vera")

one of the major aspects of "malenkaya vera" (called "little vera" in english) is that it was the first movie from the soviet union that featured a sex scene, albeit a short one. the title is important: vera is the russian word for "faith", identifying that punk vera (natalya negoda) has little faith in the soviet system. and as the movie shows, there's not much faith to be had in it. the opening scene shows the bleak industrial town of zhdanov, nearly a hell on earth. when vera's lover sergei (andrey sokolov) moves in with her family, it leads to some unexpected events.like in many russian movies, people's names describe their characters. for example, there's viktor (remember that "victor" means winner). all in all, this is a good look at the soviet union while it was collapsing - and we can see why it was collapsing. really good.

it is difficult, today and in the us, to understand this movie. we have nothing, really, to compare it with. here is an attempt at comparison: it is as if during the last years of saddam's rule, a filmmaker in iraq were somehow able to make a film, which, for the first time ever, showed life as it really was lived in that country. the life of ordinary young girl, with all the terror and the repression full blown. then the film was exhibited freely in iraq. if you could imagine that unlikely event, then you might have an idea of what went on with this film in the last few years of the soviet union. prior to this film, soviet cinema was highly censored. soviet movies would only show an ideal life in the worker's paradise. then suddenly this. the alcoholism, the random sex, the ugly wasteland that was the soviet city, the choking pollution, the proletariat victimizing each other and themselves, the utter hopelessness - it is all there. people were stunned. soviet women would often weep during the showings. many would say that this is the story of their lives. it was a cultural earthquake the like of which filmmakers only dream of accomplishing. it undoubtedly hastened the breakup of the soviet union. reading the reviews here, i can see that few understand this film. one says it was groundbreaking because it contained real sex. to the soviet viewers at the time, the sex was a minor event compared to fact that it portrayed reality for the first time in soviet cinema. others compare it to current films such as "as good as it gets" might as well compare homer's illiad to the latest john grissam novel. they simply do not compare. this is not just a film, this is was a social document, and a transforming social force. it needs to be viewed that way or you will not understand the film. other reviewers see it as a film about a dysfunctional russian family. one even says that it is difficult to feel sorry for vera because she keeps coming back to her family. the point is that vera and her family are symbols for all of soviet life. there was nowhere else to go, because the family down the block and in the next town were the same. this was life in the soviet union for most people. this is a film that can be viewed on many levels: as a drama it traces the landscape of despair, as a social document it shows the living conditions of the time, as a political document it shows the attitude of the people and many of the reasons for the break-up of the soviet union, and as a moral document it shows the evils of a dictatorship that is out of control, and the cruelties that victims will practice on each other. little vera clearly shows the human toll that socialism eventually takes on its victims, despite any good intentions that system may have. in doing so it helped end the soviet regime thus contributing to one of the major changes in modern history. this film achieves what only a few films have ever accomplished. it is not only an stunning representation of history but it also become a force in that shaped history.

superb editing, outstanding acting, especially by epatha merkerson, and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack. this film reaches back to the 40's to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady.the actor portraying the young terrence howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate new york town. the audience laughed, cried, and erupted in applause for the film and its director. soon to be shown on hbo (feb 7, i believe) - fire up the tivo and enjoy a great story!

the captain and tennille have released a very good 3 dvd package with minimal editing. unlike most variety show releases these shows have not been hacked to bits. the musical and dance numbers are included with the skits just as they were when first broadcast. i suspect that some musical numbers on the dvd may have been edited into shows in which they did not originally appear but have been unable to verify that suspicion. i've noticed a few inconsistencies between what is on the dvd and program information i've found on the net. i've been unable to verify whether the net information is inaccurate or if the musical performances have been edited into the shows on the dvd. whatever the truth may be, i'm very appreciative of the efforts made by the production company. i wish every variety show released would show the same respect for the format. i would guess about half the shows broadcast are included. i believe they ran into rights problems on the shows which weren't included. hopefully those issues can be resolved and a volume 2 can be released sometime in the future. there are some individual music videos along with a dance rehearsal among the extras. i recommend this dvd to any c&t fan.

this was alright. it was one of those we gotcha but we don't have enough evidence yet storylines. in the couple handfulls of movies i've seen her in, i've never really though much of stephanie zimbalist. a professional tv actress she is but nothing really outstanding. here in this she was definitely above average as the former fed (or was it fed on loan?) profiler. her character got along well with the motley bunch of special investigation unit cops she was assigned with. there wasn't really a goofy character you'd roll your eyes at and just despise which was good. also good is it takes awhile to know who the murderer is... but when i found out i wasn't that surprised. oh well. one more thing that was good was the los angeles locations. quite possibly if this was made today they'd use toronto or vancouver but here they really shot in downtown l.a. like that a lot (even though i semi-despise l.a.) liked the movie, too. i don't know if i'd ever watch it again but it wasn't too bad. my grade: b-

i have to admit that when first saw madonna performing holiday on top of the pops many years ago i said to my wife "another american one hit wonder getting the whole thing wrong!!" well she was wearing a fright wig and was appallingly dressed. i have never grown to love her the way my daughter does but i have to eat my words. i do like some of her stuff and sometimes enjoy her filmed concerts. this confessions tour film is great,even if the music is not(and its not). i was impressed by the staging and concepts. madonna's own performance was enhanced by the incredible dancers she chose to support her. my daughter was at the london gigs and was crazy about it. the lady (madge) has proved my initial assessment of her so very wrong!!

this show was so exhausting to watch and there's only two numbers drowned world (substitute for love) and paradise (not for me) were you can sit down and just contemplate it all. the opening of this show will go down in history as the most visually thrilling, as madonna enters the stage via a gigantic swarovski crystal ball that comes down from the ceiling and the huge screens from behind it show images of horses galloping. horses play a role in this show due to madonna falling off one. the infamous scene of madonna on the crucifix is in this show as a huge screen counts to 12 million, the number of how many african children are orphaned due to aids. at the end a website address comes up for anyone interested in donating. we then go into the theme of the environment and again images of politics and religion are shown. there's an interlude and then the show starts again to the music of i love new york and ray of light this part of the show is one of my favorites with the dancers doing there funny hand movements. towards the end there's the music number with the song disco inferno mixed in with the song and the dancers make more of there presence known. the ending again is full of energy as the show wraps up to the tunes of lucky star and hung up and hundreds of golden balloons fall from the ceiling at the end the message "have you confessed?" comes up. the dvd is worth buying and when it came out the soundtrack for the show was added as a bonus. jonas akerlund did a great job with the footage for this show keeping it consistent with the style of the tour.

madonna has been rocking the boat for over 20 years, and with that comes a lot of experience -obviously- and a lot of knowledge. she was never the one to think about yesterday, au contraire, she seemed to know what is going to be popular tomorrow. she bravely takes all the new trends, technologies, and incorporates them into her own acts. her world tours have never been 'average'. when madonna performs, she gives 120% - everything is bigger, better, theatrical and meaningful. she takes inspirations from east, west, and makes then unique. everything is given a deeper meaning, and the confessions tour is not different. from the very beginning, you find yourself sitting on the edge of the chair. she starts with bang, then she does brave circus poses on a horse high up in the sky, she does everything she can to entertain you. she remakes her own songs, giving them a modern feel. she sings on a disco cross, she almost comes in the middle of the stage, and with her amazing dance crew that know no dimensions of fear, the show is absolutely more than you bargained for. it's a spectacle, an audio-visual orgasm that cannot be put in words. lucky are the ones who actually experienced seeing madonna on stage. pushing fifty, she is still in an incredible form. recent sticky and sweet tour is even more ground-breaking, which proves nothing else, that madonna was, is, and ever be the one and the only queen of pop.

the show was amazing and very professional. madonna is a non-stop, dancing and singing for 2 hours. the opening was pretty good when she came out of the disco ball and also jump was a really good performance. the entire show was full of energy so it's kind of hard to say which were the highlights because every song had something special and unique. i saw live couple of her previous tours (drowned world and reinvention tour)they were good but you can't compare with this one. the dancers were fantastic, the lights and the whole show were just perfect. madonna still looks very good. if you haven't seen it yet, i highly recommend you to see it. you'll enjoy the show from the beginning to the end. madonna is still the dancing queen.

this concert is the type of concert that only comes around every twenty years or so, madonna's confessions on a dance floor era will certainly be remembered as one of the high points of her career. she's 48 and she looks simply divine, she keeps up with the dancers that are almost twenty years her junior. i am also very glad to report that all the songs were sung live, which is good because she actually sounds better live. each song was so unique, the visuals where stunning. the performance of 'live to tell' was fantastic and had me awestruck, 'isaac' was exotic and gorgeous and was rich with political symbolism, the arabic horn, the american eagle set free. i particularly liked the rockin performance of 'i love new york', i almost stood up in my lounge room and cheered when she told her critics to suck george bushes ****. and then again i was impressed by the 70's inspired music (inferno remix). this spectacular decedent concert made a fan out of me.verdict: highly recommended with a capital h.

well i have to say i had the chance to see this show here in philadelphia,pa sometime in june of 06.and i really loved it.my all time favorite madonna look was the 1990 blond ambition tour era.this to me is "madonna".now that she is a mother of 3 she has to change some things to suit motherhood.and i totally agree.this is a classic madonna concert.i wish "live to tell" wasn't edited.we saw body's falling from buildings on 911,we can see a woman on a cross...any way i'm looking forward to the release of this tour on dvd and hope it is the entire show unedited and with a bunch of bonus footage.she is a artist of all time.the best out there...and still at the top and going strong.long live madonna !

this is a spectacular production! i have seen the show live twice in chicago and my only problem with the production was the fact that i was able to perceive only fragments of what was going on. the stage consisted of three giant catwalks and the platform and as the action moves from one part of the stage to the next sometime you loose track of what is going on no matter where you are located. as always, this is a thought-provoking sensory overload, skillfully captured in high definition with 15 cameras! the footage was masterfully edited, one of the best concert dvds of all times in my opinion! i only hope and wish that they will release this on blu-ray of hd-dvd so that we can re-live this extravaganza over and over again.

years ago, with "ray of light," madonna broke through to a truly amazing level of musical artistry, and since then she's occasionally transcended even her own standards. this concert production, with its hypnotic editing, amazing dancing, hallucinatory lighting effects, and trance-inducing arrangements, blows away all previous efforts. madonna's apparent ambition -- to single-handedly bring about world peace through music and dance -- may seem hubristic or absurd to some. but hell, somebody's got to do it! thanks to her assemblage of the remarkable talent of everyone involved in this production, "confessions tour live from london" places her once again among the top ten artists working anywhere in the world in any medium.

hammer house of horror: witching time is set in rural england on woodstock farm where stressed musician david winter (jon finch) lives with his actress wife mary (prunella gee) & is currently composing the music for a horror film. one night while looking for his dog billy david finds a mysterious woman in his barn, calling herself lucinda jessop (patricia quinn) she claims to be a witch who has transported herself from 300 years in the past to now. obviously rather sceptical david has a hard time believing her so he locks her in a room in his farmhouse & calls his doctor charles (ian mcculloch) to come examine her, however once he arrives & they enter the room lucinda has disappeared. charles puts it down to david drinking too much but over the next few day strange & disturbing things begin to happen to david & mary...witching time was episode 1 from the short lived british anthology horror series produced by hammer studios for tv & originally aired here in the uk during september 1980, the first of two hammer house of horror episodes to be directed by don leaver (episode 13 the mark of satan being the other) i actually rather liked this. as a series hammer house of horror dealt with various different themes & were all unconnected to each other except in name & unsurprisingly watching time is a sinister & effective little tale about a witch, the script by anthony read benefits from it's slight 50 odd minute duration & moves along at a nice pace. the character's are pretty good as is the dialogue, there are some nice scenes here & i liked the way it never quite reveals whether david & mary are going crazy or not. i think it's a well structured, entertaining & reasonably creepy horror themed tv show that i enjoyed more than i thought i would.being made for british tv meant the boys at hammer had a lower budget than usual, if that was even possible, & as such there is no gorgeous period settings here as in their most well know frankenstein & dracula films although the contemporary english setting does give it a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a bit more. another tv based restriction is that the exploitation levels are lower than you might hope for, there's some nudity & gore but not much although i didn't mind too much as the story here is pretty good. it's well made for what it is & hammer's experience on their feature films probably helped make these look pretty good, the acting is good as well with genre favourite ian mcculloch making a bit-part appearance.witching time is a good start to the hammer house of horror series, as a 50 minute piece of british tv it's pretty damned good, now why don't they make show's like this over here anymore?

as a great fan of the hammer studios and enthusiastic watcher of their gothic horror films, i wonder what took me so long to start watching their tv-series "hammer house of horror", which only ran for one season in 1980. now that i've seen the first four episodes of the show, i can say that it easily satisfies my expectations so far. while this first episode "witching time" is maybe not the most imaginative horror story ever told, and doesn't quite deliver the marvelous gothic atmosphere that i love hammer's films from the 50s to the 70s for, it doubtlessly does accomplish to tell a surprisingly spooky tale and create some genuine creepiness within fifty minutes. film score composer david winter (jon finch) is tormented by the 17th century witch lucinda (patricia quinn)... while he story may be simple, but for a running time of less than an hour, it is effective and delivers many creepy moments. northern irish actress patricia quinn, who is probably best known for her role in "the rocky horror picture show" (1975) as well as the fantastic monty python comedy "monty python's meaning of life" (1983), is wonderfully malicious in her role which fits her like a glove. jon finch is also quite good as david, and while prunella gee, who plays his adulterous actress wife, may not be the best actress ever, she is definitely nice to look at. the episode is accompanied by a nice score which plays along well with the atmosphere. overall, "witching time" is a very entertaining episode with several truly creepy moments, and decent opener to the series.

this was my first look at this short-lived british tv horror series, but i had seen a couple of hammer horror films (horror of dracula, captain kronos: vampire hunter) and thought highly-enough of them to give this a look.this first episode was a shocker - not for the horror but for all the nudity. was this "regular" tv in england in 1980? if so, it showed a lot more skin than what we see in north america. there were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, one scene where a guy put his hand on one, and another scene with man a top of a woman faking intercourse. hey, i'm not complaining. the story is a simple one: a witch who had disappeared in the 17th century comes back to her old house and makes life tough for the married man. the latter, jon finch as "david winter," wasn't much of an actor, but his wife wasn't bad and was a really beauty. she was be prunella gee as "mary." the husband suspected her, rightly so, of having an affair and that plays a part in this story.patricia quinn was entertaining as the laughing witch "lucinda jessup," who comes back with a mean streak in her and has a good time tormenting the couple until things go wrong at the end. as a man, i'd say it was particular fun to see the two women going at it! this starts off slowly but once "lucinda" starts stirring up things, it gets very entertaining.

possibly john cassavetes best film to date, and definitely his funniest. seymour cassel plays the young moskowitz smitten with real-life wife of cassavetes, gena rowlands, excellent as usual. a must see gem of a film, if you can locate it.

i would recommend this for anyone who is an admirer of the late john cassavetes. and for those who have never known of cassavetes. it is an excellent film. i really don't have the time to go into the details of why this is my opinion, but if you're looking for something gutsy, with lots of scenes to mull over, then this one is for you. the cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film, as well as the story itself. this "review" does not do the film justice. it is an experience one must view for themselves. lots of character. very genuine.

although it may not be cassavetes' best work, minnie and moskowitz is almost perfect in all its endeavours. the plot is whimsical and charming, and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive range of emotion -- much more drama than comedy, contrary to imdb's profile. yes, the story is whimsical, but not arbitrary; it succeeds as believable, albeit a tad forced -- which i will come back to. all of the artistic aspects are of true cassavetes form: the cinematography and camera-work are delights, and the soundtrack -- albeit barely there -- is complimentary. plus i believe i noticed some nods to godard and such in the editing -- as i have in a few of cassavetes' other films -- (namely the abrupt cutting of a song in one scene), which are interesting.i feel the plot is built up nicely, with the first half being particularly enjoyable. seymour's conversation with morgan morgan (timothy carey) in the diner, for example, is wonderfully funny and fascinating, and sets the tone for the philosophical commentary made throughout the film. this philosophising -- a tradition in cassavetes' films -- is what made the film for me. seymour's amusing and profound monologues instantly eliminate the first impressions one may have of him as a hippie simp -- though his character is curiously similar to that of his in faces (1968). this tipped me, however, (on second viewing) into the opinion that it stands up against cassavetes' best work. i gained an affection for this film that i lacked on first viewing.there are, sadly, several aspects that make this film imperfect. i find the plot to be unbalanced. as i said before, it builds up nicely, but it wanes a bit here and there, particularly towards the end. because of the spontaneous style in which cassavetes worked, and particularly the freedom with which he allowed his actors to improvise, the quality of his product can easily go either way. in this case it's inconsistent. i assess that most of this film was improvised, and most of it beautifully. but one or two scenes, unfortunately, just don't work. in particular, the scene after seymour fights with minnie's work associate outside her house. during what is intended to be the most intense scene of the film, cassavetes allowed his actors to run free with the dialogue -- presuming some was planned beforehand. this, i believe, was a mistake. one gets the impression cassel doesn't quite know what to do, as he repeatedly fumbles in his speech, often not making sense, and overacts; all of this damaging the scene and the character development. i understand seymour is intended to be a bit of a brash fool, but cassel's attempts here are misapplied. why does he cut his moustache off? these flaws are resulting from: a lack of direction on cassavetes part; a lack of understanding and forethought on cassel's part; a lack of rehearsal and preparation; etc. evidently, cassavetes didn't learn from his mistakes, as he allowed this same thing to happen in his next film, a woman under the influence (1974) -- the committing scene, and ending.the flaws i mention are not minor, but they do not ruin the film. they simply make some scenes cringe-worthy and unrealistic, spoiling the flow of the film and compromising its potential. however, i am very, very fond of cassavetes and all of his actors, particularly cassel, in spite of the faults i mentioned. this is a very enjoyable film, although it proves the precariousness of cassavetes' style.

real love. true love. mad love. beautiful love. ugly love. dirty love. sad love. happy love. silly love. smart love. gorgeous love. dumb love. love love love. minnie moore understands that what she really needs is a man who trust her, trust her and love her madly. of course when this man comes along... she tries to run away but seymour, wonderful seymour, he trusts her, he believes in her so he is going to fight for her against her. i want to be like seymour moskowitz. i want to be that kind of man. a man willing to love without been afraid to fail but willing to fail. that's a kind of hero. that's my kind of hero... and minnie moore is my kind of woman. long live cassavetes and all his lovely bunch!

minnie and moskowitz is the most pathetic and ungraceful love story i've ever seen. between minnie, a disillusioned museum curator whose abusive married boyfriend dumps her and leaves her even more uptight and confused than she already was, and seymour moskowitz, a parking attendant so desperate for attention that he spends his nights going to bars and restaurants aggravating people, there is a chaotic and disenchanted match from the start. just like so many pairings that we see every day.in nearly every love story, there is a man and a woman, the man being confident, funny, either classically hot or attractive in his own way, whose shortcomings are charming, and the woman a wounded soul who could have any man she wants who chooses this guy because there's just something about him. these movies make everyone feel so good because the characters embody what every man and woman wants to be, not what they are. minnie and moskowitz, instead of indulging in any hint of fantasy in the realm of romance, depicts people who may just be more common than the attractive, confident people with so much experience playing the field. what's the story behind the love affairs of the ugly, alarmingly awkward man with no life and no job that we all run into, or the woman so crippled by insecurity that it's difficult to talk to her?this film is not as fascinating as cassavetes's faces or opening night, but it has that riveting quality that cassavetes always fought so hard to render, which is an unbridled depiction of people underneath the ego that hides behind itself in nearly all other films. gena rowlands and seymour cassel, delivering startlingly pitiable people, are hardly likable. moskowitz nearly drives us mad, let alone minnie. he imposes himself so forcefully in her life, the dates are an explosion of the inner voices of ours that respond to the screamingly inept uneasiness on dates we've all been on, rejections we've all swallowed, and arguments we've all had that we know were our own faults. i admire a film like minnie and moskowitz because, as the trademark is with the films cassavetes helmed himself, it identifies with us in 100% honesty. our egos play no part in company with his characters, thus a tremendous achievement per performance by actor.

life is crazy. you're crazy, i'm crazy, we're all crazy. we're all a little bit minnie, and a little bit moskowitz. sometimes it does seem best to be sensible...but then what might you be missing out on?you gotta be you. you don't have to park cars and semi-randomly yell at people, but you can't hide yourself behind a veil (or dark sunglasses) and pretend and act like everything is okay. and sometimes, you really do have to throw caution to the wind, because why else are you alive?i'm not going to 'rate' this love compared to cassavetes' other movies, because they are all absolutely 100% unique works and each their own individual act of expression and exploration of our lives. in that sense they are all great, and comparisons are odious. for sure, this movie has that one crazy, sometimes maddening, but ultimately wonderful and freeing quality that all his movies have- you never know what's going to happen next, and you never know what the characters are going to think, do, or feel next. neither do the characters themselves- and do we really want to live our lives any other way? unlike moskowitz, you can have a great job and judiciously sock away money into your ira, but still live the life of an adventurer inside- in your feelings, your spirit, and your very experience of life. yeah, we can have it both ways, that's what cassavetes shows us. thank god somebody did.

i feel as though i know these people and have known people similar to them. these days, though, people are discouraged from showing such passion about anything especially love and loneliness. it has a slow beginning, but then look out! if you love romantic comedies, but would like to see one that had some basis in reality for a change {or at least did have back in the 70's}, then you should see this movie!

this light-heated (for cassavetes)love story is pleasantly conveyed by two wonderful performances by gena rowlands and seymour cassell. rowlands was never more beautiful as a repressed, damaged mid-30's woman who meets her match in seymour. cassell is a powderkeg of energy and romantic notions (on his terms). there is a great supporting performance by val avery as zelmo swift and an unusual (as always) timothy carey that's worth the price of admission. made between husbands and a woman under the influence this is cass' most accessible film that should touch the heart of anyone (especially the cassavetes haters) who claim his films are too long and ponderously heavy at times. made my top ten that year and not seen by enough people. an 8 out of 10.

oz is by far the best show ever to grace television. better than the sopranos, yes, er, yes, csi, absolutely. uncompromising, daring, and utterly disturbing yet profoundly moving. oz took us past any image of prison that anyone had ever conjured up on television. tom fontana truly did a brilliant job with the writing. no topic is taboo. rape, drugs, murder. oz is evidence of just how good tv can be. it follows characters of all different backgrounds and all different races, but always comes back to your everyman tobias beecher, in jail for vehicular manslaughter. we see what we don't want to see, pain, death, mayhem. oz will disturb you, make you cringe, make you look away, but most of all it will make you think. to see oz is to see a truly magnificent television production

although the wonderful soda counter in the local drugstore nolonger exists, and the clothes are definitely l946 immediatepost-war vintage, and good and evil are easy to understand, andthose old planes are really dated, this movie will never be dated. the human adjustments and problems post-war, the beautifullove stories, the wonderful acting (especially harold russell anddana andrews) are as moving today in 2002 as they were in l946. i was one of the young women who welcomed our marvelousveterans home from world war ii. like so many, my memories ofthe war years and the homecomings are as fresh today as if theytook place yesterday - this movie is very relevant for our times.

this film tells the stories of several couples coping with post-wwii life. through many moving accounts the audience learns how the war has changed people, while their human spirit went on to triumph.my favorite scene is where a young service man, who returned home as a double amputee (after losing both arms up to the elbow) is sure that he would be no good to his sweetheart, who still wants to marry him. his girl simply said that she would help him with the things he wouldn't be able to do, but that they would be fine together. moved by this true demonstration of love, the man embraces his fianc√©e in tears.the scene where a service man asked for a bank loan is also a highlight. when he is initially refused as a "high risk", a higher ranking bank official takes over saying "you fought for our country and kept us safe--that's good enough for me. your loan is approved!" "the best years of our lives" won 6 oscars, including a special statuette for the disabled actor who showed us all that life goes on and will continue to be worth living, even with a severe handicap. this film is a joy to watch over and over again. a true classic! highly recommended!

i always felt that ms. merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills. familiar to millions as the lt. on law and order, she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases, always in a supporting role. hbo's lackawanna blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as nanny, successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration. but the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in lackawanna, new york, a suburb of buffalo.the story could be set in any major african-american community of the 50's and 60's from atlanta's sweet auburn to new york's harlem. but the segregation-integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at nanny's boarding house. the story revolves around nanny's relationships with all kinds of people, played by some of the best actors in the business (i purposely did not say black actors--this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black, except for jimmy smits, of course) i recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day.

billy wilder continues his strong run of films during the 1950s with a biopic of charles lindbergh, the young american pilot who became the first man to fly solo across the atlantic in 1927. jimmy stewart plays lindbergh, and while he might be a bit too old for the part, he still brings the sincere warmth and confidence needed as well as his trademark down-to-earth goodness that makes him an iconic film star. wilder directs solidly, balancing the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what lindbergh was up against when he decided to take this challenge. it certainly isn't his nor stewart's best work, but it is a gem of a movie. it lifts your spirits with the plane and makes you proud to be an american. overall, it is just plain good.

the main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of s. ephata merkerson. ms. merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as nanny, the woman who believes in doing good, no matter to whom, with no strings attached. this actress clearly shows a range that is amazing.thanks to director george wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best black americans actors together. this ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place.of course, none of this would have been possible if ruben santiago hudson hadn't written his wonderful play. working with mr. wolf, perhaps the best theater director of this generation, they have opened the play in a way that it evokes that not too distant past where a child lives under the influence of ms. crosby, when his own parents are not around to take care of him. ms. crosby becomes the adoring mother of little ruben; in a way, he represents her reward for having lost her own daughter.unfortunately, there is no time to develop some of the characters, as the action solely concentrates in enhancing the relationship between nanny and the young ruben, played with such charm by the young marcus carl franklin, who is a natural. the only thing that could have been done differently was the voice over narration that is at times intrusive, as it doesn't clarify, or justify what one is seeing. frankly, just by watching the interaction of the players, is self explanatory.in the background there is always music. no matter what hard times these people are going through, but nanny's house is full of laughter and that glorious music that takes us back to that era.aside from ms. merkerson, other notable performances are given by terrence dashon howard, one of the rising stars of the moment. mos def, jeffrey wright, marcy gray, louis gossett jr.,delroy lindo, rosie perez, carmen ejogo, jimmy smits and the rest.ms. s. ephata merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience. in "lackawanna blues", she clearly demonstrates she can do anything she wants because of her enormous talent and charisma.

lemuel gulliver (ted danson) is a doctor who goes missing at sea, leaving pregnant wife mary (mary steenburgen) behind. eight years later, he turns up, disheveled and seemingly mad - babbling about his adventures in the lands of the tiny lilliputians, the giant brobdingnags, the floating island of the intellectual laputa, and the houyhnhnms, a race of intelligent, talking horses who have to deal with the yahoos - a race of bestial humans - among many other adventures. the not-so-good dr. bates (james fox), who has designs on lemuel's wife, has gulliver incarcerated in a mental institution, and lemuel, mary, and son thomas (tom sturridge) must find a way to prove his sanity.a splendid adaptation of jonathan swift's satirical novel, this film is a magnificent adaptation on so many levels: the story, the satire, the characters, the visuals, the brilliant cast. it's simply a treat to watch, and it's almost amazing considering that it was a made-for-tv film.the film does a brilliant job of capturing swift's vicious satire, which cuts like a hatchet through british society of the time, but still resonates today. the wise brobdingnags and the houyhnhnms are almost perfect individuals who find it virtually impossible to understand why gulliver speaks with such pride of the vices and corruptions of his society. the scenes where gulliver struggles to prove himself different from the yahoos are perhaps the best, with biting satire in describing how they pick their leaders ("they seem to pick the worst among them. . . who rules until they find someone even worse"), go to war ("we only go to war for a very good reason - such as they are weaker than us, or we want all of their land"), etc. the scenes involving laputa are also effectively done - the intellectuals are so wrapped up in their specialized fields that they have no time for anything else, and really possess little common sense. and the addition of the asylum plot line enhances the story greatly - dr. bates is truly nasty character, and when he gives a speech to the inquiry on gulliver's alleged vices, it's quite clear that he's describing his own faults.the film makes use of beautiful, and fairly convincing cgi effects depicting the very diverse settings of the novel with great effect. the contrast of sizes is done in a very skillful way, and all of the worlds depicted in the story are convincing in their own way. the cinematography (particularly that concerning the asylum) and the costumes are brilliantly done. the editing of the present with lemuel's memories is a device which could be awkward, but works very well.the cast is truly wonderful; a veritable who's-who of british and american talent. ted danson gives an excellent, multi-layered performance as gulliver, showing effectively his transformation from a person bewildered by his strange surroundings, to the lunatic state he was in when he reappears, to his rational, intellectual personality at the end. most well-known for his work on sit-com, danson shows that he's more than just sam malone with this wonderful serio-comic performance. mary steenburgen is effective as his wife, and james fox is absolutely repulsive as bates. the rest of the cast is made up mostly of cameos, with peter o'toole, omar sharif, warwick davis, kristin scott thomas, geraldine chaplin, alfre woodward, edward fox, and sir john gielgud being the most memorable - but even the smallest parts are very well-played.while not 100% faithful to the book, "gulliver's travels" is a triumph of story and images. it's not to be missed.9/10

i watched this movie when it was released and being really young and not too much into cinema it was one of the most fascinating cinematic experiences i ever had and it really left a mark inside me.at first i didn't quite understand the story and probably failed to make the necessary correlations between past and present as the movie presents them to the viewer.years after i first watched i managed to watch it again and this was the time that i fell in love with 'the english patient', it touched me so deeply and for me it became the best film ever made.anthony minghella made an absolutely stunning film, all the locations are amazing and through his camera he manages to create unbelievable emotions inside you.of course, the music of the film is such a big part of the whole emotional journey of the characters and the film would not be the same without it.but personally the best thing was the fragile performance that ralph fiennes gave in this masterpiece. he plays so well the man that falls in love slowly but so deeply with katherine clifton,opens up his heart and dives into this prohibited affair.the most heart-breaking scene for me will always be the one where hurt katherine is carried by almasy towards the cave of swimmers and she wears the thimble that he bought her.she says 'i always wore it.i always loved you' and at that moment he starts crying with such pain flowing from inside him.juliette binoche is also amazing in her performance and really deserved the oscar she won.overall, this is a film that anybody who proclaims himself a cinema lover should watch in their lives.

i won't go to a generalization, and say it's the best love story of all time, as some have said. that's fine, people feel very deeply about this film, you either love it i believe...or you simply hate it. i don't want to say, the best of all,because that is simply too 'broad' for me to make a statement like that. however, i feel very passionately about the english patient, as well as millions of other people do. the awards say it all. i don't agree with critics, on many levels, however, the ones that picked this one, i couldn't agree more.9-oscars. 41-wins.37-other nominations, makes this love story,on the top of the bunch. from the director, anthony minghella, the story that bursts onto the screen and as mr. peterman (from t.v.s seinfeld) said, "elaine, i simply can't take my eyes off of it!" in this instance, i don't agree with elaine's response. but the story builds and takes the right time, needed to make it's case beautifully. the cinematography,(john seale) won multiple awards as well, as it ought too. i have not really paid much attention to juliette binoche, until now. well, not entirely true i loved her performance in "sabrina" lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship, next to harrison ford. but this was simply an incredibly differing character for her, and as deeply talented as she is, she simply shined in her own subtle and graceful way, she was just what this film was looking for, i'm truly glad that it was her performance and not another actress. ralph fiennes, was also spectacular in portraying count laszlo de almasy. i had a new respect for his ability, after seeing this one! what can you say except, see this picture again. (*****)

the centerpiece of lackawanna blues is the character rachel "nanny" crosby, who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy, ruben, the narrator of the film. based upon the experiences of writer-actor ruben santiago-hudson, the film lovingly recreates the upstate new york boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s. the first half of the film is virtually non-stop music. the second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse. nanny's ability "to take fragments and make them whole" affects everyone within her sphere. an especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband, telling him firmly, "if you ever touch that child again, we're going to dance!" as delivered by actress s. epatha merkerson, that line is so steely and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hair-trigger temper is frozen in his tracks. from start to finish, merkerson delivers a commanding presence her character binds together the disparate lives of the borders in her home. this was a touching, heartfelt film with a wonderful cast. as played by merkerson, the character of nanny simply radiates love. this is a film experience that i will remember for a long time to come.

compared to battle of britain, this is a real film, with real characters and a real plot. battle of britain is basically a documentary with the occasional lawrence olivier and michael caine, but the real protagonists are the spits, the hurricanes, etc. here, on the other hand, you have two well-wrought characters (actually three) and a real plot. i strongly recommend it to anybody, even to those who are not particularly fond of war movies. it's well filmed, and i wonder what the director might do if he had the big capitals behind him. and i do not think that it's over-sentimental. it's only that in the fighters you have real people, with real feelings and a real life--as real as any fictional life in any great film.

it seems that no matter how many films are made on the subject, there is no shortage of stories that emerge from the second world war. it stands to reason that a conflict on such a scale as global warfare would capture the imagination of filmmakers everywhere and provide them with ample material on which to base a story. heading in a different direction than most mainstream movies about the war is dark blue world, a film that does not deal with the traditional major battles of the war, does not tell the story of many of its major figures, and does not even focus on soldiers of any of the major allied or axis powers. dark blue world instead ventures into the world of refugee soldiers fighting in exile for their occupied nations.the film does a marvelous job of portraying the challenges faced by czech pilots flying under the british royal air force, expressing the frustration that they felt both at the language barrier between them and the other fliers, but also at being restrained from achieving vengeance against the germans until being re-trained.dark blue world also works quite well outside the arena of the war film as being a story about human relationships. a love triangle develops between the two main characters and an english woman that complicates the teacher-mentor relationship of the two exiled soldiers. this relationship is extremely well acted throughout, developing into almost a father and son relationship at many points.the aerial combat in the film is among some of the best and is also very interesting in exploring the cultural challenges mentioned above as the men struggle to fly their machines, fight the enemy, and relay commands and replies in an unfamiliar language. the tension and struggle of these scenes continues the tension between the men on the ground, just as the tension on the ground continues that felt in the air.this may not be a film for everyone. the hardcore war film buff may find its exploration of relationships a bit off-putting, but it is on the whole an excellent film regardless of the bellicose element or not.

fun, entertaining movie about wwii german spy (julie andrews!) falling in love with american pilot (rock hudson), while trying to get secrets from him. for some reason this was attacked by critics and shunned by the public in 1970--i can't see why. it's beautifully shot, has wonderful costumes and interiors, and exciting aerial dogfights. also it has andrews doing a strip-tease (strictly pg material) and singing a beautiful song--"whistling in the dark". the movie does have problems. andrews and hudson did not get along during the shooting of this--and it shows. their love scenes lack spark and they have zero sexual chemistry. still, they turn in ok performances. the film is a little long (even in the 105 min director's cut i saw) and gets way too dark and serious at the end. still, worth catching. try seeing the directors cut...the other one runs half an hour longer!

blademaster is definitely a memorable entry in the swords and sorcery category of movies. i found blademaster along with quest for the mighty sword at a thrift shop attended by mentally handicapped people and was very happy to pay 2.00 each for them. believable sets and costumes, good sword fighting and a beautiful female warrior, mila make this an enjoyable watch. a few problems though, there were a lot of details in the plot that didn't quite fit, like the cave men for one. i didn't understand their purpose. also, this movie could have really benefited from some more monsters. the snake was cool, but i guess it does borrow a little from conan. however, any primitive sort of movie where someone winds up with a hanglider is ok by me (see yor and battle for endor). i think ator is cool! oh, and was anyone else reminded of gallager by the villain or is it just me? i give blademaster a 7/10

the ator series is a shining example of what b-movies should be. they fail in every aspect, but in such a hilarious way that they are funny rather than sad. "ator l'invincibile 2" aka "the blade master" aka "cave dwellers" shows us europe's favorite conan clone, ator where we left him in the first movie- after showing us a lengthy recap of all the events of the first film. this time the world must be saved from "the nucleus", a kind of bomb, represented on screen as a bright light (i guess they couldn't afford a prop). this one features invisible attackers and samurai. as with the first film, lots of stock footage is used (including one rather obvious bit from "star wars"). thoroughly laughable and unforgettably bad- this is an exception b-movie.

this film, blade master, may be cheap, clumsy in appearance and it is sometimes, but it shares thoughts on problems that are way beyond the era this film is set in. ator is the chosen one that has to protect the earth against a terrible weapon, that is compared in an unforgettable and unpredictable way to the atomic weapon. he goes through obstacles as a witful character who is just more than muscle power, although he has quite is lot. i would say this aspect of the movie makes it surpass a film like conan the barbarian, which is the least i can say, quite brainless. it doesn't diminish in any ways the great adventure movie that is conan, but it gives ator his wholesomeness that he shares not with the barbarian. for a lower budget movie, this film does good in terms of setting and the fights are most of the time believable. zor, the villain, has with is prisoner throughout the film one of the most interesting psychological confrontation that gives tension to the movie, even if ator seems way too fit for the task to loose. what gives this movie that little extra are those scenes that may look quirky, but worth of mention. the fight with the serpent god, even though he is a gigantic puppet, is well handled as the snake, with good lightnings, remains a silhouette and the fight is quite convincing. the movie climaxes in a most unusual way, quite anachronic, but breathtaking : the deltaplane sequence. the scene itself is not introduced properly, read not at all, where did ator get that machine, it's pretty unconvincing, but it leads to a really poetic and beautiful midair sequence, that standalone, is the culminating point in the movie, elevating ator in a place where few human fantasy heroes have been. if blade master is not among the great fantastic movies of all time is no surprise due to its lacks, it's a bigger surprise, considering the philosophical way it chooses on the confrontation between good and evil, the truth it speaks and the heart it shows, that this movie is so unwlecomed. i suggest it for every fan of the genre and try take it seriously as an intelligent movie that's to be taken more seriously than it seems.

this film must have been quietly released on some other side of the world, perhaps even in english. hopefully nobody understood a word, not there's anything to understand in this movie anyways! haahaa! call me a nut, but i think this is one of the best movies ever. why would i come to that conclusion?? because it's my national pasttime to sabotage horrible films and this one begs for it every other minute! once i became a fan of myster science theater 3000, i had no doubt in my mind they'd find it somewhere and use it. sure enough! the version they acquired was entitled "cave dwellers" using some strange intro footage not even from the film itself (apparently, they were ashamed to use footage from their own film!). i can't say i recommend buying this film. rather, i highly recommend getting the mst3k version. sure to find it most anywhere mst3k dvd's are sold, don't miss out!

expectacular the ator's second part!! directed rapidly by joe d'amato, specialist in all kinds of subkinds(subgenres) of exploitation, and interpreted again by miles o'keeffe. the budget of the movie debio to be derisory or minimal. in spite of not being a better movie of his antecesora not mas entertained, ator 2 either, it has something, something that makes it enterteining. his introduction you prop it explains ator's origin to us with images of the first part. the script is incredible, is like any comic-book of the brilliant roy thomas. has so fantastic elements inside dle world of the sword and such fantasy as invisible men, black gentlemen, cannibals - monkeys ... the role of the villain this one interpreted brilliant. the final this struggle very well. lacking mas violence and blood, but this one well. never it becomes boring. it has everything what there was lacking ator 1. be charmed with to my me!! 4/5

when the italians and miles o'keeffe work together nothing can go wrong! as ever, miles is great as the almost as great ator; the most lovable barbarian of all times. totally lives up to the first movie.

miles o'keeffe once again assumes the role of the mighty ator in this the first sequel to the original film.what can i say? - this pretty much represents b-movie nirvana! the plot is ludicrous, the script is terrible, the acting is hammy throughout, the special effects....well let's not even go there! - all in all this movie is a veritable delight! highlights of the film include ator and thong (his mute companion, not his undergarments) being attacked by invisible assailants in a cave (certainly saved on the fx budget there!), ator battling what has to be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid, and of course, the infamous hangliding scene! there's one question i have though......at the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when ator supposedly destroys the geometric nucleus (as the narrator tells us)......how in the hell did ator destroy it and manage get out alive?! did he fashion some form of primitive timer/detonator or something? oh well, such an illogical ending really only adds to the movies overall charm - they just don't make them like this anymore!

the jazz singer is one of a number of films made in the late 1940's and 1950 about the jewish experience in the united states. other than crossfire(1947) and gentleman's agreement(1947) which dealt with anti-semitism they usually had a musical-theatre background. these films included the jolson story(1946), jolson sings again(1949), the eddy duchin story(1951), the eddie cantor story(1953),the benny goodman story(1956) and margorie morningstar(1958). the leading actors in these "jewish" films were always played by non-jews. for example larry parks a non-jew played al jolson and gene kelly played noel airman in marjorie morningstar. this casting was probably done to make the jewish theme palpable to a mainly non-jewish audience. the jazz singer(1952) is no different. danny thomas was a devout catholic and peggy lee was certainly not jewish although she plays a non-practicing jewess in the film. the clue to her background is when she attends the golding's family meal before entering she says "i haven't been to a sader (passover service) since i left home".the film is about a cantor's son who has just left the service after seeing action in korea. his dilemma is whether to become a cantor, a family tradition or to be a singer in musical theatre. his choice of theatre leads to an inevitable conflict with his father.however, there is much more to this film than this. this film was made after the rosenberg trial during the mccarthy whitchhunts and the hollywood blacklist. therefore in this film the jews are shown as good loyal citizens andare quintessentialy american. the synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice. the cantors friends also talk about baseball in fact one of them is a major league umpire. the synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and george washington is said to have visited. therefore jews are presented as part and parcel of american society. nobody in this film has a eastern european accent. peggy lee appeared in very few feature films. in this film you get to see her sing "lover" and "just one of those things" wonderful. danny thomas is quite credible and he acts and sings the part very well. the comedic routines could have been left out. yes, the film is schmaltzy and sentimental but it is well worth seeing. i enjoyed it very much.

to be frank, this is probably the best version in my book as a sound movie version of the jazz singer. the 1927 version is really a silent movie despite its build-up as the first talkie.danny thomas is a great comedian, and he sings very well. he does the jewish stuff with feeling. peggy lee is great and any film that has her is always entertaining. allan joslyn is not too entertaining and we could have done without him. one question: since when do cantors live in such luxurious houses???

by 1952 hollywood decided to remake the al jolson first-talking classic.this time the cantor's son was played by danny thomas. coming home from the army, it is expected that he follow in the footsteps of his father and other male relatives by becoming a cantor. however, young mr. golding has quite a zest for show business.at this time, he meets peggy lee, an aspiring singer. she acts very well and her rendition of her favorite song, lover, is remarkable. the film writers were smart not to plug the obvious jewish guy and non-jewish girlfriend relationship. if anything, this is glossed over. in his anger, for betraying his pledge to become a cantor, his father makes the traditional jewish sign indicative of a loss in the family. this would not be done under circumstances of breaking a pledge, it would be done if among the orthodox, an inter-faith marriage would take place.thomas does a really good job of playing the cantor's son. his singing is up to par as the film ends on a positive note.am surprised that technical advisers did not realize that women do not carry pocketbooks into synagogue on the sabbath or at all during that period.

this is like something i have never seen before. it had me cracking up the whole time i don't think there was one scene that i didn't laugh through. it is about a girl from the country in south who goes off to a big town for college. at the school she befriends the ra across the hall. when she realizes that he has no family to go to for thanksgiving she invites him to come home with her. rabecca and her family and her serious boyfriend all go out to dinner one night and becca realizes what her boyfriend is about to do...propose. she urges cral to do something so he stands up and shouts something like... sorry mate but you are too late i already asked becca to marry me a couple of weeks ago back at the school and she said yes. that all turns into chaos. please watch this classic it is totally worth it... i swear.

the cast was well picked. pauly shore is hilarious and does a good job of bringing the plot of the movie together. however, tiffani amber thiessan is who really makes this movie special. her talented acting combined with her great looks makes this movie a definite see.

this movie is extremely funny and it also contains the best looking girl, this young man has ever seen. tiffani-amber thiessan is a great actress and she has the looks that stop traffic. tiffani completes this movie, which contains funny scenes put on by shore.

this movie was great and funny. pauly is funny. the best looking girl is all the way tiffani, she is totally hot in this film and she proves she can act with this film. this movie is a must see comedy.... and its not all about tiffani, its a great movie in general but tiffani adds the zest to this film, cause she does her scenes very well and she is all the way sexy........

i was cast as the surfer dude in the beach scenes. almost got cast as the muscle guy, since the real muscle guy was really really late that day. pauly had my brother and i (the skateboarder in front of the tattoo place) do some vj stuff in between takes live from venice since he was still doing his mtv thing. this movie is really good as well. would it have made my top 100 if i wasn't in it........?

i think this is pauly shore's best stuff, he played the part perfect. i really enjoyed this movie, patrick renna is really funny as zack the annoying little brother. son in law is a good comedy worth your time, but the only thing i wish tiffany thiessen was the farm chick instead of the one they had.

when i first saw that this movie was going to be playing on tv, i only new of pauly shore as this joke of a comedian who wore really weird outfits back in the day. i still decided to watch it and i was impressed. shore brings a fresh breath of air to the screen. in this movie, he plays crawl a college adviser that probably needs his own adviser as well. carla gugino, in an underrated role, plays becca, a midwestern "farm girl" with a simple family and a movie-clich√© boyfriend travis. when she heads off to ucla, she meets crawl and he quickly turns her into a bubbly, blonde californian girl. she decides to bring crawl home for the thanksgiving break. when travis decides to propose, becca needs a distraction. crawl then decides to make everyone believe that him and becca are engaged already. this leads to crawl spicing up the romance between becca's parents, befriending her brother, and even getting the dancers at the local bar to get a little loose. i'm not going to reveal the end, but i liked it. anyway, don't rent it if you want a poignant performance; rent it if you want to laugh your butt of and enjoy an often-missed part of 90's humor.

this was such a funny movie, which was soon forgotten about, probably because there are so many teen and young adult comedies, such as this. the movie is not quit as predictable as one would think. crawl is an unattractive, but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend. still, an unlikely match for rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend back home. when he helps feel more at ease at school, by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more, they become buddies, but it is completely platonic. when she realizes her boyfriend might propose, she does not feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to be enjoying her free laid back party life at college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility. you kind of learn what a good friend crawl is when he tells her he will help get her out of getting married. when her boyfriend proposes to her, in front of the whole family, she kicks crawl and puts him on the spot. he tells the whole family that he proposes to her, and gives her his diamond ring, which it tunrs out was his the whole time (he must have come from money or something. well they never really show a close up of the ring). the message of the movie seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and not to judge people before you get to know him. rebecca's boyfriend, who her parents love, turned mean when we find out he druged his new girlfriend after rebecca,(amber thesan) and crawl, so that rebecca would have broken up with crawl, thinking they were a couple. although they were not, rebecca was mad at him, which when you think about it, was kind of unfair, since they were not a couple, but i think they were starting to like one another. and i think she thought there was more. the movie never showed them actually become a couple, they left it open for the viewers to decide. they never even actually kissed at any point, although there was one part where they almost did. that was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand. many people saw it and said, that he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock, but they were just friends the whole time, even towards the end. and she did not introduce him as her boyfriend; still they never told her parents they were not engaged. rebecca almost did. even if he would never become her boyfriend, they could have still been friends. in the 90s for some reason femanin men were in, and there was this big stereo type that woman liked femanin men (not that there is anything wrong with that), think it came from the fact that women like the kind sensitive type, which crawl proved to be, through his friendship with rebecca. but when i saw the movie, i must admit, if i went for looks, i thought i would have gone for the first boyfriend. still it was a creative movie, that tried to teach a lesson on friendship and judging others.

i've sat through several pauly shore movies, but this is the only one that i've liked. of course, it helps that he is far less irritating than usual, perhaps even a little likeable. the rest of the cast does a fine job, especially underrated carla gugino. the film itself is basically a harmless and silly comedy, and although few of the jokes are especially funny, the film is quite entertaining overall.

if you like pauly shore, you'll love son in law. if you hate pauly shore, then, well...i liked it!

this is the only pauly shore movie you should ever see. o.k., it's the only one i've ever seen, and i think i've made good choices. i normally find shore's shtick kind of tired, but he is very funny in this movie. actually, the script is pretty funny, and shore doesn't overwhelm the other actors with his ... what do you call it? tomfoolery? anyway, this is a funny, if ultimately forgettable film. --frink-3

i've read that paolo sorrintino's inspiration for the consequences of love came from simply observing a businessman alone in a brazilian hotel, and speculating what he might be doing there. the film unfolds to us in a similar way. we view the existence of titta who has lived alone in a hotel in switzerland for 8 years. he is secretive and avoids friendship. his life is dominated by order and regularly. gradually, the truth of his existence is revealed to us until, finally, his world begins to fall apart.the mystery of titta is central to the consequences of love and it works thanks in large part to the superb performance by toni servillo. his character becomes all the more intriguing to us as little details are revealed - that he injects heroin once a week, that he has no imagination. although some here criticise the dialogue for not being naturalistic, that doesn't matter in my view - this is not that sort of film, and i think the script is great. the camera work is also excellent.if you have to criticise, the film does lose its way a in the later scenes as the mystery of titta's existence is revealed to us, and as his world begins to fall apart. however, the tragic final scenes are every bit as good as the earlier build-up.

someone on these boards has predicated that the whole thing is being dreamed by the best friend of the protagonist, albeit a friend he hasn't seen for some 20 years. i'm reluctant to dismiss this out of hand but it does raise some viable questions. why would a telephone engineer - or a shoe salesman or butcher for that matter - want to create a mythical world and weave it around a friend populating it in the process with a set of equally mythical supporting characters. with an imagination that good the friend should be writing not dreaming. dream or not someone, and the obvious candidate is director paolo sorrentino, has created a very watchable world in which tony servillo makes stillness a fine art. we are asked to believe that forty-something titta la girolomo (servillo) 'upset' the mafia some years prior to our meeting him and as penance he is a virtual prisoner in a small swiss hotel from which each week he drives to a local bank with a suitcase containing nine mill large in used notes. other than this weekly trip he is free to do as he likes and what he likes to do is smoke, play cards with a man who cheats and a wife who reminds the husband how far they have fallen socially, and ignore the friendly overtures of olivia magnani, who has spent two years trying to get a smile and/or a 'good evening' out of him. for reasons best known to himself and which are inconsistent with a man who has no interest in anything or anyone, servillo spends a certain amount of time every day applying a stethoscope to the wall of his bedroom and listening to the private conversations of his card-playing partners. eventually he does respond to magnani - he has to do so or they would be no film. this is plot 6f: the one about destry, who never wears a gun, or sean (duke wayne), the 'quiet man' who refuses to rise to provocation and fight until the obligatory scene where the gun is strapped on and the fists cocked - but instead of contenting himself with a polite come stai oggi he removes 100,000 from the suitcase and buys her a car. the final inconsistency occurs when magnani tells him she will pick him up the following day at 4 pm in her car and they will drive into the mountains to celebrate his birthday. we've established that she lives locally so why she is then seen driving from somewhere miles away, ignoring a police roadblock to drive off the road and overturn the car is anyone's guess. this inconsistencies apart this remains a fine piece of film-making with an excellent lead performance and a very good supporting one.

it really is a great film (after being able to ignore blake edwards pink panther references which he appears to be obsessed with and are hugely unfunny). julie is, as usual, wonderful - singing and acting brilliantly. i remember seeing it at the odeon cinema in the haymarket, london on its release. however julie's non-appearance at the uk premiere of star! was most unfortunate and (apparently!) due to filming the aerial shots for darling lili over ireland. a reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots but she did not. two box office flops in a row ruined her film career for quite a few years. but darling lili,just like star!, deserves much more public appreciation.

the movie is a really well made one, which is great and looking and passionately directed. you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection. for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into it.it's hard to place this movie under one label. it's not really a drama, it's not really a thriller and it's not really a comedy. instead its more a movie with its own style, that does things its own way. it doesn't necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combined.but just like the movie its main character, the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts. the artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite simple one and it's more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie. it doesn't make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute must-see. in parts the movie also feels as if it's trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself. it just feels a bit overdone in parts, though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifully.it features some great camera-work and some unique storytelling, which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch.7/10

i saw this interesting film back to back with the chinese/french film "2046" at the recent dubai film festival. both were intelligent works made the same year (2004/2005). both had the main characters living in a "hotel". in both films, the hotel is more a metaphor of exile than a location. both dealt with love between a man and a woman. both had wonderful music and riveting performances. what a coincidence and yet how the two films differ in treatment of the subject! somewhere at the beginning of the film, a man walking on a pavement turns to look at a woman and in doing so hits a lamp post. the audience erupts into a volcano of laughter innocently. but isn't that brief shot the synopsis of the film, that entertains you for 2 hours? while the film is a wonderful blend of black comedy (e.g., using a stethoscope to listen to neighbor's conversation), the film builds on what buster keaton and jacques tati had introduced to cinema earlier--stoic faces that leads to comedy quite in contrast to the equally intelligent world of robin williams or the heartwarming danny kaye. a sudden frenzy of activity transforms an otherwise stoic character while moving money from the hotel to the bank is reminiscent of tati's works.but the film is not mere comedy. the anti-automation statement (cash counting and the reaction of the bank staff to the statements relating to it, the dummy that acts as an ineffectual warning to the speeding lady, the reference to "moulimix" as the fictitious "company" he works for, etc.) are several cues that the director is offering a loaded comedy to the viewer. laugh, yes, but reflect on it and enjoy further..the movie's strength lies in is brief, staccato script (by director paul sorrentino) that offers comedy that is mixed with philosophy ("truth is boring," "dad is dead, but nobody told him," "bad luck does not exist--it is the invention of the losers and the poor". then the director goes on to provide you with a fascinating lecture from the main character on insomniacs. you will not sleep through this lecture.sorrentino provides entertainment pegged to the subject the italians know best--the mafia. it is an existential mafia film.since "truth is boring", the director provides a dessert as part of the fine meal of superb acting (toni servillo), good music, clever camera-work (luca bigazzi), a beautiful, enigmatic actress (magnani, grand-daughter of the great anna) and powerful script. the dessert is for the viewer to figure out whether what preceded in the film was the truth. it would have been boring, if it was, wouldn't it?

the opening shot of the consequences of love perfectly sets up this intriguing and absorbing film. a travellator slowly carries a solitary out of focus figure towards the camera, trailing a huge suitcase behind him. like the central character in the film, we know nothing of him and our initial interpretation of him, his profession, the contents of the suitcase could be way off the mark.consequences of love is that kind of film. from the title you might expect a bergmanesq dissection of a relationship. what we have instead is a lead character, titta, living life in emotional exile, seemingly choosing to cut himself off from those around him. if the film can be classified in any way, i would call it a mystery, as we are engaged in working out who titta is and what he is about. what we know from the start is he is 50'ish, cool, composed and expensively attired. he has lived for the last eight years in a plush looking swiss hotel, always paying his room fee on time but seldom showing any interest in the staff or other guests.his only real companions are a couple who he plays occasional card games with. the couple, it transpires, used to own the hotel but have now gambled everything away and have only the room they live in left. their love of money, antiques and each other was their undoing and titta seems to identify with their plight. he once had it all, but now is now living as a virtual prisoner in the hotel. his brother, a long haired surf instructor, drops in to see him occasionally, but he sees his visits as more of an intrusion than a pleasure. they talk about the person titta considers to be his best friend, even though he hasn't seen him for 25 years. this long lost friend is now a telephone engineer, repairing the communication network that brings so many together. meanwhile tittas phone calls to his wife and children end quickly when they refuse to speak to him.midway through the film titta makes an uncharacteristic move and begins to open up to a young barmaid from the hotel. with his judgement clouded by emotion he sets himself on a course of actions that will ultimately seal his fate for good.the slow unfolding of tittas fall from grace is and beautifully scripted, shot and scored. the thumping techno soundtrack does much to build up the tension as more and more secrets are revealed, the final half hour turning into a taught thriller as titta lets his mask slip and must once again face the consequences of his actions. the ending, with a visual nod to felini, is dramatic yet ambiguous and leaves the audience to once more question his motives.patrick bliss, 01/06/06

le conseguenze dell'amore (2004)is a beautifully made film that takes small carefully positioned steps towards its ending that need to be savoured in order to be enjoyed. from the contrasting landscapes, to the tightly enclosed world that the hero inhabits, we are taken by the director and controlled from the very moment we enter the hotel. we, like the hero, will never escape from the suffocating intensity and paradoxical monotony of his criminally driven, mafia world. that the film resists mafia stereotypes whilst revelling in them makes it all the more successful. the concrete grave, the inevitable brutal executions and overwhelming maleness are laid bare and exposed for what they are. just brutality and business, and no more. life is about being part of the corporate machine that is organised crime and not about love or living for self, family or others. our hero is indeed a hero in that he gives up his life for the sake of the touch of the beautiful barmaid, the resolution of the misery suffered by his only neighbours in the hotel and in order to escape his decorative prison. the consequences of love are indeed beautiful and brutal at the same time. see it!!

a true masterpiece by sorrentino and tony servillo demonstrates his exceptional acting ability as the cool, enigmatic titta.yet another example of a must see movie that the everyday person will not receive access, as the high street cinema chains are full of hollywood funded nonsense. fortunately i reside in the metropolis and amongst the privileged few who enjoy the choice the art-house cinema provides. i champion the day when cinema investment will be channelled into bespoke film screenings allowing choice for the masses and away from assembling penny sweet counters! film of the year for me so far and yes i've seen a few....

maybe my rating should have been a 9, but the film absolutely stunned me when viewing it first time and my latest viewing confirmed my initial belief. stylish yes, every scene has crafted scoped views, terrific angles with a perfect sound side accompanying them.put on top great acting from especially toni servillo, garner it with one of the most beautiful and charming women in olivia magnani, and a fine plot and you will end up seeing this small masterpiece over and over.paulo sorrentinos next movie "l'amico de famiglia", which is in competition in this years cannes festival, will be eagerly awaited.

i've seen this film so many times, it's that good. maybe because i can relate to tittas way of life is the reason why. not everyone would find it to their taste. also, my italien is improving after each viewing. am i a sad case? thankyou mr sorrentino. i look forward to your next film. although i did not see the film at a cinema, i have the dvd and would encourage anyone to buy it. the special feature extras alone is worth the price. the amount of time a director spends on the making of a film is very seldom appreciated, the extras on the dvd gives an excellent insight to the making of a film. as for the story of the film, i'm bias.i happen to rave about it to all my friends, but as i said before, i relate very much to the main character who is a loner in a situation not of his own choosing. the mafia in sicily use titta to launder their money in a swiss bank. he owes them for costing them millions of dollars years ago in stock market deal that went wrong.love kills.

stylish, thought provoking, cool and gripping ¬ñ just four aspects of a film that will long remain in the thoughts of this viewer.slow-paced it may be at the beginning but the director beguiles with beautiful camera work, sophisticated compositions and elegant editing. the unfolding of the story, not so much the narrative line but the revelation of the characters' inner selves, is masterful.olivia magnani, who plays sophia, the hotel receptionist, who finally breaks down the icy reserve of former consiglierie titta di girolami (tony servillo) is coolly beautiful and reveals hidden depths and personal honesty in her brief but profound relationship with girolami.the disgraced mafia middle-man, forced to live out an empty life, tormented by insomnia, in a swiss hotel, becomes caught up in the similarly empty lives of the refined older couple who formerly owned the hotel but are now forced to live there as residents after the husband gambled away their resources years earlier. the husband is constantly dreaming about recovering his lost wealth and making a grand statement to the world. his wife realises this is but a pipe dream. this nicely counterpoints the resignation of girolami who sees no way out and does not seek one.the fleeting love affair between girolami and sophia has consequences that no one could have foreseen. it enables him to escape his prison without bars but to pay a huge price that he willingly accepts and in doing so provides redemption for the older couple.

i saw this the week it opened four years ago and i really did not know what to expect being unfamiliar with sorrentino's work at the time. he has created a very intriguing and ultimately moving account of an odd character, one for whom the phrase 'life is for living' no longer applies. it outwitted me at every turn and i was constantly surprised by the story. i enjoyed the pacing very much and the way i was gradually given the pieces to work out what was happening. tony servillo is superb, as is magnani. it opens with a brilliantly stylish wide shot and concludes with a very moving image that takes the movie into sublime territory. i thought long afterwards about the main character and the position he was in and his final fate and i didn't shake it for weeks. i recently bought the film and that final scene where he thinks about his friend gets me every time. i still have yet to talk to anyone who has seen this. it's a shame that it did not reach a wider audience as if this is the direction of italian cinema it can only be a good thing.

i was a little worried about actors and acting in italy then "le conseguenze dell'amore" and toni servillo came. it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen. paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years. the movie is not completely perfect but 'titta di girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie. toni please keep on acting in movies, you're for sure the coolest actor around today (and not just in italy, his performance deserves international acclamation). i rate this movie 9/10.

well, where do i start...as one of the other reviewers said, you know you're in for a real treat when you see the opening shot - minutes and minutes of film time spent on a guy standing on a travelator.i won't repeat rubin's excellent summary of the story. what i would like to say, though, is that this film gripped me more than any film i can remember. i sat open-mouthed, and on the edge of my seat all the way through. the camera work, sound track and *fantastic* performances (particularly that of tony servillo) draw you to the screen and won't let you look away.it's italian, so of course everyone looks fantastic, but it is by no means merely an exercise in cool style. this is a film with lots to say about luck, loss and love.go and see it.

ok, i'm italian but there aren't so many italian film like this. i think that the plot is very good for 3/4 of the film but the final is too simple, too predictable. but it's the only little mistake. the consequences of love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack. i'd like very much the lighting work on it. the best thing on it is a great, great actor. you know, if your name were al pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance. but it's only a great theater italian actor called toni servillo. yes, someone tell me this film and this kind of performance it's too slow, it's so boring, so many silences, but i think that this components its fantastic, its the right way for describing the love story between a very talented young girl, the grand-daughter of the italian actress anna magnani, olivia and the old mysterious man toni. one of my favorite italian films.

this is a very visual film. by that i mean that the dialog is sparse, almost to the point of being a silent movie for some very long takes, beginning with the opening shot.the silences, however, are broken by a stunning sound track that ranges from discordant, staccato beats to a haunting mix of violins, and interspersed with vocals that sound like dreams. it's a feast for the ears as much as for the eyes, one of the early visuals being a man walking along a street, so preoccupied with his interest in a shapely woman, that he walks into a lamppost: one of the consequences of love and a metaphor for what lies in store...a long time ago, another movie ¬ñ love story (1970) -- said that love is never having to say you're sorry. this narrative turns that idea on its head in a number of ways, beginning with the main character, titta (toni sevillo), a seemingly innocuous long-term resident in a plush hotel somewhere in switzerland. everyday, week in, week out, he sits at the same coffee table, enjoying the passing world, his cigarettes, his coffee, his solitude ¬ñ and he's been doing it for ten years. he sits, he observes, and once a week he engages in three very surprising activities that you'll find out about when you see this little masterpiece...love is explored in another way, in a direct counterpoint to titta's solitude and reserved nature: two older residents of the hotel are still much in love, but the man wants to die in a spectacular manner when his time comes, while his long suffering wife berates him for cheating at cards with the other guests, one of whom is titta. now, titta knows about their squabbles, their love, the man's cheating, his apologies to his wife, and his whining. how? in a surprising and black-comedic manner...one of those surprise activities i mentioned.but, this is no comedy, in reality, although it does touch upon the idea of the human comedy in a balzacian sense: the irony of life and what to do with it. that decision had been made for titta ten years earlier when he left his wife and began to live in the hotel. he keeps in touch occasionally, and it is clear that he still loves his children (now grown up) and the sorrow in his voice speaks volumes. but, there's something more than just sorrow...such a life as titta's would obviously seem to be utterly boring, and it actually is from many perspectives. it is only when we learn what lies beneath his almost death-like countenance, however, that the horror of his situation hits the viewer between the eyes. but not before we know that the female bartender, sofia (olivia magnani), is very interested in titta and goes out of her way to pique titta's interest in her.and that's when things start to unravel for titta: he eventually succumbs to her femininity and in doing so discovers, once again, the consequences of love. ironically, in doing so, he finally realizes what he must finally do with his life, and in a most spectacular fashion.i know that all of the above is somewhat cryptic; but, to say more would spoil the film and story for you. if you like italian cinema ¬ñ i love it! ¬ñ i urge you to see this one. the acting is superb; the sound track chills the spine; the camera work is truly innovative; the direction shows the maturity of a true artist.i know i'll see this movie again, and again...

although i totally agree with the previous comment regarding the marvellous acting of toni servillo as titta di girolamo, i would also like to add the beautiful filming and montage which turns this movie virtually into a painting. the young director paolo sorrentino had the courage to experiment with different types of camera techniques which reminded me of darren aronofsky' requiem for a dream. they both used the same mtv-style filming combined with modern (alternative/techno) music, making the film ¬ñ le consequenze dell'amore - stand apart from the other crime/mafia movies in its genre. even though the movie may start of very slow-paced almost "sec" compared to the faster hollywood productions it should be enjoyed cause of its serenity, marvellous character portray and splendid ending. definitely a must see for people who enjoy the european/italian cinema. ps toni keep on acting like this we need an encore.

i saw this movie in the rotterdam film festival and i was pleasantly surprised. the photography is just so stylish and beautiful, and the story it's just not your average mafia movie, actually that storyline is pretty much in the background. it's more the personal journey of a middle age man that is trapped in an existence he was forced to live. the actor, toni servillo, is superb, he excels this "quiet man". the girl, olivia magnani, is the grand-daughter of italian actress anna magnani and lives up to the family surname.if you're expecting your typical italian movie where everybody is screaming to each other in big families, this is not your movie. there are not you're average clich√©s and it's definitively worth seeing this one.

the consequences of love: there is really something special about this film but it's very hard to put your finger on. it is a love story of sorts but not really one i've seen before. it has several love themes running throughout the film. one mans love for a younger woman, a younger mans love for his older brother, the mafias love of money at all costs these are just some that intertwine in a story that has you guessing or rather not knowing where and how it will end. the cast are all superb from sophia the teasing barmaid to the straight faced-ness of titta the films central character. with simple yet affective camera work bounced off an ever-changing soundtrack that mixes low-fi trip hop with lush orchestral pieces. the style of the film changes beautifully using several styles without ever getting cluttered. love has never looked so diverse and powerful as the tales we are told rumble towards various conclusions. the director has married old and new into a rich italian classic.

there are movies that are just a different version of another one, not remakes, but just similar to others, it is not. although it talks about mafia it is watched in another way and often it seems just a secondary theme. i went to watch that movie for case (because the otherone's theatre was full) and i was satisfied at the end. it surprised me, because of its black irony or cynicism and there are more and more interesting items to analyze. it doesn't follow the classical ways of movies, it is just different and i think not to be the only one to like that. i am very happy also because it is italian, and i was afraid that italian directors and producers were not enough brave to change themes. in this movie you can watch new italian style as well, but is not blocked into clich√©s. i hope to be understandable enough, i know it is difficult, i hope also that this movie can be exported out of our frontiers, it is a good product to export. i want to point out also the music, very good soundtrack, the movie needs it because of its long silent pause and they are covered perfectly by that music. many compliments to the director, and thank you, cinema needs these movies.

i saw le conseguenze dell'amore on the 2005 rotterdam filmfestival, it was the first of ten films i saw there.le conseguenze has left the most powerful impression of the ten films. from the first shot, you know the movie is going to be something special. the beautiful cinematography left me in awe of what can be done with a camera. the music is also on par with the visuals, complementing the colorful and stylish architecture-like images.toni servillo plays the main character in the film, titta. he's a tax expert gone wrong who lives in a hotel. every week, he brings a suitcase with money to a bank and the story plays around this.he is always very controlled and shows almost no emotion to anyone; looks calculated and well-dressed. he has a habit of ignoring people who are of no significance to him. for example sofia (played very nicely by olivia magnani), who works as a barmaid in the hotel where he lives. although she's been working in the hotel for two years, he never greets her, even if she does greet him. on one day she confronts him with this and the next day he sits at the bar, instead of his usual spot at a window. from here the story really begins, and will unfold in a strong tale of love, sacrifice and the mafia.i won't spoil the rest of the film. see this film if you love stylish movies like ones from david lynch, the godfather, etc. don't see this if you're an action-buff.

one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man titta di girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from salerno in southern italy. when we're introduced to him at the start of the film, he's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian-speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo's cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. at the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. he says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamo's troubles. this initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. at one point in his non-life, titta decides to feel concern about appearing "ridiculous". the first half of the film may be described as "slow" by some. it does indeed reveal di girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. however, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. the existence of titta di girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out). never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dell'amore or l'imbalsamatore. another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. not unlike the machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the al pacino film insomnia), le conseguenze dell'amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it's almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia (played by olivia magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary anna) and the memory of titta's best friend, a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. though it's never explicitly spelt out, the spectator knows that to a man like titta, accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences. a film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations, le conseguenze dell'amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecitt√† during the second half of the 70s. the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postino-like fare, more la vita √® bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dell'amore, l'imbalsamatore and others. your loss, world.

while this film might not be the next evil dead ( hell who knows maybe it will, it has only been out for a year) it is worth a look. don't expect a $10 million film. cuz you'll be disappointed. do expect to be entertain, to laugh, and to enjoy the experience.all in all this film is much better than many if not all of the low budget horror films out there. i have seen films that spent more than 10 or 20 times what this film cost to make and turned out 10000000000 times worse. the effort that was put into this film far out weighs the set backs it faces by having a limited budget. movies are meant to entertain, and this movie sure does that. in fact this film might even open up new doors for you in movie watching. it's available on netflix if not your local video rental store. so watch it, then decide.

i own this movie. i am actually from the same town as the brother directors. but that doesn't make the film any better. but, if one night you wanna watch something not serious, and don't have and high expectations, i strongly recommend demon summer. yes, the lines are cheesy and the plot is corny. but it contains key elements of a horror/comedy. i just wanna see some small-town kids make a movie full of effects. and i say "bravo" to the campell brothers. they are now making more movies and continuing a long dream. demon summer was one of the movies that are gonna help them start a great career with a great future. speed freak productions and compound pictures described in one word: potential

the mystery and its solution was a great noir conceit. i do have some questions though, maybe i wasn't paying enough attention.who killed the neighbor and why? who killed the replacement girl and why?and some minor quibbles, they should have shown the stopoff at the hotel for the switch. not that they should have shown the switch, but they should have shown jim and the girl going in the hotel, jim going to the bathroom, coming out and being told by the bartender that his girlfriend went to the car without him.then, jim getting back in the car and seeing the sleeping woman, and little girl in his back seat.this would have given the viewer a sporting chance at figuring out the solution.i wish i taped it though, i'd like to see it again.

a variation of the same plot line was used in a simon & simon episode (thin air) that originally aired in dec 1982.the gender of the victim was changed, the surviving spouse is one of rick's "old flames". it's also interesting to note that gerald mcraney had a role in this rockford file episode. both episodes were based on a story by howard browne - as noted in the list of 'writing credits'. anthony james plays one of his classic tv bad guy roles.the continuation of the concept between the rockford files to magnum pi to simon & simon quite interesting.

'sleight of hand' is my favorite rockford files episode of the entire series. this episode shows a side of jim rockford that is usually ignored. to wit, jim is genuinely in love with a beautiful woman and is shown as a father figure to her young daughter. the woman is recently divorced and she and jim have recently returned from a weekend getaway along with the youngster. through a strange turn of events, the woman is discovered missing after they return to her home.rockford's recounting to his father, rocky, of the events leading up to the woman's disappearance is reminiscent of mickey spillane's mike hammer series from an earlier era. after much brooding and reflection and with rocky's encouragement, jim stumbles upon the clue that sends him off investigating the disappearance with his usual steadfastness.unfortunately, jim's girlfriend, karen, unwittingly witnessed some mafia activity while they stayed at the buena vista inn. the crime bosses responded by killing karen and substituting another woman into jim's car. the imposter, ostensibly asleep in the back seat, made her exit immediately upon arrival at the home. a couple of cover up murders ensue and jim proceeds to their solution while under suspicion of the l.a. police department even as warrants are issued for his arrest.this episode evokes more emotional reaction than all other rockford files episodes combined. james garner as jim rockford is seen at his most vulnerable moment and yet he retains the presence of mind to pursue the case. this is personal for jim rockford. in this case, he is not hired to do a job but he is trying to recover his lost love to save her life. unfortunately, this is not possible but jim tries hard to sort out his feelings but it is apparent that he will not soon get over his hurt.despite the appeal of the main story line, many key questions are raised but never answered in this episode. (1) what becomes of the young daughter of jim's girlfriend? (2) what did karen actually see at the hotel that made the mafia kill her? (3) how could jim drive for hours with an imposter in his back seat without noticing this? (4) the daughter stated that "mommy didn't come back with us". so why didn't the girl scream or cry when she noticed that her mother was absent for the hours long car ride? regardless of these ambiguities, 'sleight of hand" is the rockford files episode which comes closest to being a tear jerker. the suspense is compelling and the story is told in a sensitive and vulnerable style which makes us feel rockford's pain.

i just recently discovered this fantastic series and i just can't seem to get enough of garner's laid back pi. the shows continually display excellent level of writing and suspenseful episodes.this episode, sleight of hand, is a little different. forsaking humor in favor of a more serious turn for rockford as he searches for his missing girlfriend.the mystery is great and it's unraveling is convincing enough. it's based on a book (can't remember the name) and it could easily have been stretched to a feature length episode. garner excels here as rockford gets tough and really means business. this has a "noir" feel to it all the way, the dark lighting and overall mood echo the great dark thrillers of the 40's and 50's.really good episode in a class a series. easily deserves a 10.

darling lili is a mixture of perfection and magic! the stars; julie andrews & rock hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried. it's full of all the magic that a young lady wishes for and it makes it seem as if it can all really happen to you. the brilliance of the director; blake edwards is shown to be at his best. he was truly capturing the woman he loved on screen!the blend of each song, went perfectly with the moment in the film. the film opened with julie andrews singing whistling away in the dark and closed with the same song by andrews.for a film of this excellence to have been such a failure when it was released, is a total shock...as it is: "inspirational...purely....inspirational!" ~one of andrews most memorable lines in this film!

i recently had the pleasure of meeting mr. hauer at the 2005 sarasota film festival for the u.s. premier of this film. not only was he gracious enough to autograph my copy of blade runner, he took the time to answer some questions about the film before screening the room for a packed theatre. i was so impressed by the film that i used it as the yardstick by which to compare all other films i had seen at the festival. it was powerful and moving, yet subtle and brief. the film tells the story of how a young man, (older version played by rutger) one day finds himself entranced by a seemingly ordinary room in an unremarkable building near the street. walking by, he notices a single window, always open, from which a haunting melody can be heard. each day, he passes by the room, sometimes standing for hours outside, watching it through the silken drapes that flutter in the light breeze, hoping to get a glimpse of its occupants. towards the end of the film, we find out how significant this room really is and what has drawn our protagonist to it. the film was cut beautifully. not a second of screen time was wasted on an uninteresting shot. any single frame from the film could stand alone in an art gallery. rutger is amazing. he is mysterious, yet approachable. his dialogue encompasses a series of reflections on a life that has run it's course, for better or worse. his words conjure familiar feelings and thoughts from the audience. i was particularly moved by a scene in which he is looking at some old photos, remembering his favourite dog, his favourite horse and his first love. you get the feeling that you are in his presence, as he allows you into his world to glimpse precious memories of a life that is nearing its end.i loved this film and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something fresh, intelligent and moving. should be required viewing for all film majors.

knute rockne led an extraordinary life and his story is told rather well in knute rockne all american. we follow rockne's incredible journey from young norwegian boy to iconic american football legend. produced in 1940 the film may at times seem a touch dated and at times downright hokey. and the filmmakers do lay it on a bit thick at times as rockne is glowingly and lovingly portrayed. you may come away thinking rockne should have been nominated for sainthood when in fact he was, after all, just a football coach. but it is undeniable that he had a great impact on the game of football as well as having a tremendous impact on the lives of so many of the young men he coached. this film shows the great impact he had and gives you an insight into why he is so revered to this day.playing rockne, pat o'brien gives an impressive performance. it's unquestionably o'brien's movie to carry and he makes the film and the character his own. the real-life rockne was renowned as a great inspirational figure and o'brien's performance will make you understand why. the only quibble comes early in the film when o'brien, in his early forties, is playing the college student rockne in his early twenties. all the makeup in the world wasn't going to make that believable and the effect is rather jarring. but as the rockne character ages and begins his legendary coaching career o'brien fits the part perfectly.as for the rest of the cast one name jumps out and that is of course ronald reagan playing the young, charismatic, but ultimately doomed football star george gipp. in the grand scheme of the film it's not really a large part, with reagan appearing for no more than 10-15 minutes. but the performance has become legendary thanks to reagan's famous "win one for the gipper" deathbed speech. it's a brilliantly-played scene, chock-full of emotion. reagan may not have been on the screen for very long in this film but he certainly made a tremendously positive impact in a winning performance.the rest of the film strikes a balance between football and life in general with rockne having great lessons for his young men in both areas. for football fans (and history buffs) there is a rare treat as actual archival footage from notre dame games of the rockne era is interspersed throughout the film. it's a rare opportunity to see just how much the game has evolved in the last six-plus decades and an opportunity to see rockne's legendary strategic innovations put into practice. if you're a notre dame fan you'll probably enjoy the fact that the notre dame victory march provides a seemingly constant soundtrack for the film. if you're a notre dame hater...well, then you're probably not watching this movie anyway. knute rockne all american is an inspiring, uplifting, emotional film. perhaps a tad overly sentimental but that's not such a bad thing. it's a very enjoyable film, one well worth taking the time to see.

some time ago, we read of the results of a poll taken by some newspaper sports writers. the questions posed were only two, and were brief and right to the point.the question number 1 asked respondent to tell who was his most beloved college football team. question number 2 asked the fan to name his most hated college football team. the answer to both questions was simply, notre dame! nd is tops on both lists! yeah, love 'em or hate 'em, but you sure don't ignore ,em.the roots of this unique position of this indepent* college football powerhouse are found in the life and career of one, grown-up, little immigrant norweigen boy from chicago named knute rockne.as a biopic, the production of knute rockne, all-american(1940), came out relatively close to the death of coach rockne in a 1930 plane crash. it was about 10 years after that the film was released. that would mean that preliminary work on the project started about 8 years after our nation's great loss of mr. rockne.his likeness and voice were well known from newspapers, radio and motion picture news reels. both knute's widow,bonnie skiles rockne, and the university of notre dame had approval rights in choosing the actor to play the lead and okaying the script. we think that they could not have done the job any better. pat o'brien truly looks the part and was himself a footballer in college. ronald reagan is cast in the pivotal role of george gipp**, a free spirited student going to notre dame on a baseball scholarship! he was a "walk-on" football player.the cast runs full of talented players. we have griffith veteran,donald crisp as fr. callaghan, c.s.c., notre dame president. albert basserman is fr. newland, the chemistry prof and rockne mentor. gail page appears as the mrs., bonnie skiles rockne. owen davis,jr. is rockne cohort, gus dorais(the passer in that historic nd vs. army game at west point.)the cast is rounded out by kane richmond, nick lukats, william marshall and william byrne as the four horsemen. real life big time college coaches howard jones, 'pop' warner, bill spaulding and amos alonzo stagg appear as themselves in scenes of congressional probe into college sports and add an authentic touch. as for biopic,knute rockne all-american!,all one can only say that it hits the ground running, and did not slow down from beginning to end. there is no wasted time either. all the screen time is used to move the story along. use of notre dame choir, the campus itself and all that brass band rah-rah march music all ad to the feeling of really being there.**** to this day,even though their basketball team and other sports teams compete in the big east conference, notre dame remains an independent in ncaa football. what this means, that in effect, the fighting irish play a national schedule.** there was no such agreement with the family of george gipp. there was a lawsuit some years ago over the scene portraying young mr. gipp giving the famous "win onr for the gipper speech". television prints of this knute rockne all-ameican were minus the speech in the death bed scene.*** other notre dame themed films were made over the years. the spirit of notre dame (universal 1931)featured j. farrell mcdonald as a rockne look-alike coach. it also featured lew ayers, andy devine nat pendleton, as well as the members of the real notre dame championship teams featuring the real four horsemen. then of course, we have rudy (tri-star 1993)with sean astin, jon favreau, ned beatty and charles dutton, among others, in a fine cast. there was also talk of an unauthorized film, critical of notre dame called golden glory, but nothing has materialized, has it?(let me know, dear reader, thanx!!)**** warner brothers always had great music in their, both in opening themes and in incidental music. in this rockne movie, they have incorporated the notre dame fight song in the score. along with it were step notre dame and the notre dame alma mater, which had its premiere at the rockne funeral in 1930 at the notre dame basilica.

recently was traveling in norway from bergen, norway and stopped in the small town of voss, norway and there was a monument in honor of knute rockne who was born in voss years ago. the people all know about knute to this day and tour guides are proud to stop at his monument. this film is a great history of this great man and his great love for notre dame never realized that knute has such great talents in chemistry and laboratory science and also taught chemistry for years and at the same time coached the football team. ronald reagan played the role of george gipp, (the gipper) who was an outstanding football player; reagan had a short role, but gave a great supporting role in this film. donald crisp, (father john callahan) was outstanding as a priest who always had great faith in knute during his entire life at notre dame. this is a great classic film and will be viewed by many generations to come. enjoy.

the true life story of perhaps the greatest football coach the game has ever known. knute rockne led the game of football out of the "stone age" with innovations such as the forward pass and offensive formation shifts. but he is probably best known for his motivational locker room speeches. along the way, he brought fame and glory to a tiny, little, unknown catholic school in indiana. pat o'brien is incomparable in his role as rockne. terrific cast that includes ronald reagan who gives a great performance as notre dame's first, true superstar, george gipp.for football aficionados, this is the greatest football movie ever made. do yourself a favor and rent the black and white version. (some versions have deleted scenes for some reason) if you got the good version, look for a brief cameo by the immortal jim thorpe as he sticks his head in the locker room telling rockne and the team they only have a few minutes left before the 2nd half begins.

"knute rockne all american", the biopic about the famous notre dame beloved coach knute rockne, is an excellent sports film to watch. not ever having seen it, we were surprised by the technique used in the movie by director lloyd bacon, who shows he was ahead of his times in photographing football games. the result is a vibrant picture about the man responsible for the legacy of the collegian sport, knute rockne.the film presents rockne from his humble origins in chicago to his studies in famed notre dame university in south bend, indiana. he was an ambitious man who had a vision about how the game should be played. luckily, he went to give his beloved notre dame the glory he was after.pat o'brien looks a bit older when he starts as a freshman. in fact, he doesn't change much throughout the film, but he is fine as mr. rockne. pat o'brien shows he could inspire the players under him by just being a father figure. gale page plays bonnie rockne, the wise woman who understood her husband's call in life. ronald reagan plays george "the gipper" gipp, who was a legend that died much too young, but who left a legacy behind. donald crisp makes a good contribution as father john callahan who was rockne's mentor at the university.this film will delight not only sports because of lloyd bacon's direction and the fast pace he gives to the movie.

it's hard to imagine in this day and age how popular and how much of an impact a norwegian immigrant and would be chemist had on the american public and how much of a national tragedy his sudden death in 1931 was viewed. but knute rockne was an extraordinary individual who both revolutionized and popularized college football and put a small obscure catholic college on the map.i've heard clips of rockne's famous pep talks and it is uncanny how pat o'brien got the voice and the inflection perfectly. in what turned out to be his career role, pat o'brien captures the integrity and fighting spirit that was rockne. rockne is assisted by well by gale page as bonnie stiles rockne who complained about her home being a training camp for notre dame, but never threw anyone out of her house.rockne's first impact on football was as a player with notre dame not a coach. one fine day in the second half of a losing football game against heavily favored army, rockne and team mate gus dorais played by owen davis used the forward pass as an offensive weapon. before that football was simply a game where you just got bigger guys for your side and ran through the defense. rockne didn't invent the forward pass, but he popularized and football became a game of strategy as well as brawn after that. rockne knew how to work the media also. those well publicized pep talks of his were not just to inspire his players. they were well publicized and it was in a lot due to him that college football became a major sport in that golden age of sports in the roaring twenties. playing a small, but key role is ronald reagan. as george gipp, the first player rockne coached to achieve greatness, reagan not only got a good performance, but forever after a name that was handy in his subsequent political career. that deathbed scene which rockne swore was accurate became a republican battle cry as many a gop underdog went out to win one for the gipper.i still remember a widely distributed photograph in 1981 that was one of the first of recovering president ronald reagan at notre dame's graduation with his old friend pat o'brien. reagan always credited o'brien and dick powell of all the warner brothers stars of the period as the ones who were the kindest and most encouraging to a young player on the lot trying to make good.notre dame itself owes its prestige to rockne. it's quite possible that notre dame would be an obscure small catholic college without the reputation that football brought to it.though george gipp and the later famous backfield of the four horsemen certainly had their place in the sun it was rockne who had the reputation. it's no accident that warner brothers was able to get amos alonzo stagg, glenn 'pop' warner, howard jones, and william spaulding, rockne's contemporaries and coaches with great reputations in their own right to appear in knute rockne, all american. it was there way of honoring the guy who was number one in their profession.i think more than football fans will enjoy knute rockne, all american. though you might become one after seeing the film.

i am an avid julie andrews fan and i just watched this for the first time on dvd -- the director's cut version. i was very surprised that it was rated g. how did they get bedroom scenes, a seduction story line, two strip tease acts, and war/shooting/blood into a g rating? weird. i would rate it pg-13.other than that i thoroughly enjoyed the movie. it was a beautiful showcase of andrew's voice and talent. the acting was great. the storyline was a little weak, leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue. there were too many "no talking, just walking" scenes for me... i would have liked to see the the relationship between julie and rock blossom, so that the intense love would be more believable.

i just got it and it is a great movie!! i loved it! although jane brightons voice n the beginning is so annoying because of her braces she don't open her freaking mouth...but ya have to watch it cause its a great movie!! the things he says in here are so funny and extremely cute!! and i'm sure aaron would probably say some of the things in real life cause i don't know, it just seems that way!! ha ha there is a part in tha movie that is really funny...its wen jane's little sister meets him...but i cant tell ya what happens cause ill just have to let u see for your self!! i went to go see aaron n concert and it was so much fun!! n he smelled so good ha ha...i still cant believe i got to meet him!!! i have pictures if anyone wants to see them!! steph

this is a really cute movie. i had a massive sleepover (girls 10-11) and they absolutely loved this movie. they watched it twice! don't let the rating fool you. you have to be 13 or older to rate a movie on imdb, that eliminates the movie's target audience. if you have a girl (or boy) between 7 and 13, i guarantee they'll enjoy this movie. sort of a gender reversed "notting hill" set in high school. aaron carter plays a famous pop star who is failing his privately tutored classes. his mom sends him to a "regular" high school with the ultimatum, "pass high school or no summer tour." taking the advice of his manager (former pop star david cassidy) he befriends the smartest girl in school (alana austin) with plans to cheats off her. look for the humorous and insightful janitor (another former pop star lief garrett).

i am probably a little too old for this movie, 16, and being a guy, the story is a little too girlie, but i really thought it was a cool movie overall. all the girls in this movie are so hot and really great actresses, from alana, to adrianne, to deena, to kimberly, all the way down to the cute girl that plays alana's little sister, rachel. i am not a huge pop-star fan with the lovesick songs, but i thought that aaron carter did a really great job in this, and seems like he was really into this movie, and made it seem real. my mom liked all the older farts that she grew up with, so that's cool too. i kept thinking that i liked a lot of the people, and wonder if i will see them again? a sequel would be cool. i rented this, but i might buy it too, since i have a ton of dvd's, and like to go back to see something that i missed. i couldn't buy it at blockbuster though, so i don't know where i could buy it right now, but i'll look into that. anyway, i am a 16 year old guy, i already said that, i know, but i would totally take a date to see this. it's really good for all ages, really. i think even my little half sister who is 6 could see this. that's what is so cool about it, that it is something that all ages can see. i'm sure that was done on purpose, but it really works. girls can dream about being with aaron carter, and guys like me can dream about all the hot chicks in this movie. there is something for everyone.

i know what most of people will think about this movie without even seen it... 'the typical movie from a famous singer... it will be a pink movie,a teenage film,it will be stupid...' and stuff like that... and yes, it is...i mean, it's a pink movie... but, you know what?...i loved it. seriously...it's a very romantic film... i think that every girl in this world has dreamed with something like the plot of 'popstar'... met his favorite singer, know him as a person...and even have a romance with him...right? ^^ i really enjoyed watching that... in addition, it's really funny... i think the actors did a great job... there's a lot of loving characters...and, aaron carter (jd) is not the exception... to be honest, in the first five minutes of see him act, i thought 'this will be awful'...but then , he surprised me really pleasingly...also, i gotta say that the music performances on the film are great! i specially loved the part when jd ( aaron) sings without music , (only with a guitar) a very beautiful song...this guy is really talented... time will tell...my advice to you?...watch it! don't make a prejudice ;-)

well, i have to say, this movie was probably the funniest movie i have seen all year. and i don't exactly mean that in a good way. this is probably the most pathetic movie i have seen in a while, and yet that's what makes it so hilarious. you can tell these people are really trying to act, unfortunately for them they aren't doing such a good job, making it so even lines delivered in what is supposed to be a serious tone come out sounding really funny. aaron carter is essentially playing a character quite similar to himself in real life, and still he manages to make the character seem corny and not at all realistic. this movie is one of those movies where everything that is supposed to sound serious comes out really funny and all the things that are supposed to be funny are just so stupid and corny that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying. this movie is so bad, it's actually good. i would definitely recommend it if your in the mood for a good laugh.

even though i am slightly older than the recommended age group, i really enjoyed this movie. it's a little break from reality and it must be every little girls dream to become friends with a pop star. i know it was mine, to be sure! the first 10 minutes were really cheesy and the mean girls said a few things that were also slightly cheesy. once you get over that, you can really start to enjoy it. i loved the relationship between jd and jane - it was really sweet and you could see how much they began to like each other. the soundtrack is perfect and it fits into the film really well. i also liked the family set up for jane, her sisters seemed lovely. very well made film.

aaron carter plays the pop star(j.d. mcqueen) in this movie (surprise surprise). this is a typical movie where the leading lady (jane) has a huge crush on j.d. mcqueen the pop star (as well as many other girls) but she's the lucky one that gets to spend the days with j.d. and forms a relationship with him that is more like a fantasy. j.d. has to go to a public school to keep his math grade up in order to do his summer tour. problem is j.d. isn't good at math. he finds the smartest person in school (jane) to tutor him. jane tutors and falls in love with j.d. j.d. in return falls in love with as well but j.d. screws up and has to fix everything in order to win the girl and make the summer tour. the movie is definitely worth watching. aaron will be a great actor!!!

wow is all i could say i really loved the movie and one thing i could say to aaron carter is that i really think that you should be in a lot more movies cause you rock.i love aaron carter so much hes hot and so i say thank you a lot for making this movie great.i really do so wish he would be able to make a lot more movies because he his a great dancer, actor, and singer. i so wish i could sing as good as he could. and i've been a fan of his for like ever and i will never ever stop loving him. i rented the movie and i've had it for two days and iv'e literally watched it over like 10 times. laugh out loud you could call me crazy but that just proves that i liked it a lot. if u wanna talk you can hit me up at dvlbab300@aol.com so e-mail me if you wanna. i love you aaron carter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this film brought me to tears. i have to say, that if i did not have a beautiful husband at home, i would ask this beautiful piece of art to marry me. aaron carter gives a masterful performance as a confused young pop star, while timothy barton writes quick and witty dialogue that only furthers the genius of carter's performance. kyle is pretty gay, but his performance was nothing less than spectacular. he is also very handsome and cute. i'm thinking about asking him out on a date and giving him a very sweet goodnight gift.;)if you would like to discuss this film in the future, please contact me.nick burrell vassar class of 2012 malibu, california malibu west 310 924 0126

i don't understand why everyone hates this movie, aside from the fact that they're just jealous their music careers never took off like mega popstar aaron carter. like it or not aaron has seen more success in his young life than most people could ever dream of having, so it only seemed natural for him to do a movie. lou pearlman and company have been known for over-exploiting their pop prot√©g√©es, you remember justin timberlake's foray into tv movie model behavior? granted this movie isn't big scale and impressive, but it's not supposed to be. it's not trying to impress people or be an emmy award winner, it was released straight to dvd. it's just a cute little movie about an awkward teen who gets her dream of being with her favorite popstar; i know a lot of you out there have had that dream at some point or another about you favorite singer, don't deny it. it's sweet and gentle and i applaud it for not stepping into the realm of sex, violence, and vulgar language that seem to be creeping into more and more of our movies today. where's the decency? where's the line? teen dramas come in dozens these days because teens are a big market for companies, at least this one is more tolerable to me than bratz (aka slutz) with all the fake little girls running around going "oh mah gawd!" in tank tops and mini skirts and is fathoms better than those gore fest movies like saw. i feel for the main character girl because i was nerdy outcast girl in high school who loved aaron carter and nsync and the backstreet boys and other pop music and still do; and like aaron's character would get crushing "testophobia", especially in math. if you judge this movie solely based on the fact that you don't like or are jealous of aaron carter and his fame, then of course you're going to hate it and trash talk it in reviews. the only reason britney spears' dribble crossroads got a higher score is because she has boobs. accept this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be. i think this happy formulaic teen movie ends on a high note and makes you want to sing.

if monte hellman's legendary early 70's road movie masterpiece "two-lane blacktop" had been done more like a stark, stripped-down, fiercely taut and straightforward brooding mood piece embellished upon by that distinctly mean'n'lean, rough'n'tough, very raw and ragged macho australian mentality and topped off with a generous sprinkling of dour, despairing, no-hope-whatsoever end-of-the-road punk nihilism, it would undoubtedly be much similar to this jarringly bleak and atmospheric knockout.nice guy factory worker mike (an appealingly scruffy terry serio) runs afoul of sneering, shades-wearing fascist car race champ fox (a perfectly hateful richard moir) when he steals fox's fetching model girlfriend julie (the lovely deborah conway) away from him. mike and fox begin competing in increasingly lethal races in which the stakes become higher and higher with each successive bout, finally culminating in an especially pulse-pounding all-or-nothing race with only one true winner allowed. mike, assisted by his worried, but loyal italian mechanic pal tony (a splendidly smooth turn by vangelis mourikis) and tutored by blind, supremely hip 50's-style greaser rebel (marvelously essayed with maximum coolness by max cullen), willingly puts his life on the line for the sake of his reputation, the affection of his old lady, the money, and, most importantly, for the chance to topple the haughty fox from his gloating, glowering thrown. directed with utmost gravity and intensity by john clark, written to laconically right-on perfection by barry tomblim, with a shivery, flesh-crawling synthesizer score by peter crosbie and spare, unadorned cinematography by david gribble, this authentically gnarly early 80's item presents the concept of racing cars as not only a funky alternate lifestyle, but also an all-consuming obsession and reason for living (it's the sole thing most of the film's characters are really passionate about) with a remarkably astute and unblinking eye. complete with a harrowing downbeat ending and unsparingly grim central message about the bitter price one pays for being top dog, this riveting depiction of a dead-end existence rates as an extraordinary cinematic achievement.

whenever this film gets a mention, usually the discussion begins and ends with the wonderful collection of cars and drag scenes, often overlooked are the at times eclectic characters that populate the film around the three central charactersone character that stands out is rebel played by the great veteran australian actor max cullen. rebel is a blind drag racer, who nearly runs down the hero and his group in the middle of the night because he is not using any headlights.in the back story we discover that rebel master builder of street racing cars, and he and his wife seem locked in a time warp of the 1950's. rebel goes on to play a small but pivotal role in teaching mike, played by terry serio, the almost spiritual truth about street drag racing. it is not speed, reaction times that make a great racer. it is the one who feels the car best who will become the greatestthis is best exemplified as rebel explains to mike after a test drive "you got all the agony, just missing the style"graham bond, is another well credited actor lending his talents as a crooked police officer looking to get in on some of the financial action being generated by the street racing. the confrontation between bond and fox played by richard moir adds tension to the story. bond not only expects results but also fox to drum up racing businessfor most of the movie fox displays a real manipulative and evil side, yet in the climax he presents a sense of honor that turns the final few minutes into an extremely tense and memorable ending. it is almost as if the film is refocusing on its true intention, to show us the culture of street racing rather than the day to day activities of peopleone of the major complaints about the film is the script. although it is nothing exciting, i believe the complete lack of any chemistry between mikes girlfriend played by deborah conway and his mechanic played by vangelis mourikis has more to do with the problem. any scene in which these two interact simply should have been cutlastly in terms of the actors, one truly standout performance is delivered by kristoffer greaves, who plays a deaf and crippled member of fox's inner circle. his back story is never explored, was he injured in a race, born that way, what is it that fox sees value in to keep him around the reality of the film is simple, it is about street racing, and the culture behind it. when the cars are flying and action sequences are in motion it is the only time director john clark and his writer barry tomblin seem really comfortable with what they are doing.so if you are looking for an in depth exploration of human relationships, moments of life defining drama, then this film is not for you. if your pulse races at the thought of a blown 57 chev or the iconic gto phase 3 blazing away on the streets of sydney, then you wont find much better than this film

i'm guessing that we all, no matter if we are fans of cars, luv the sound of a dodge challenger as it growls along the road, the noise a 57 chevy make as it screams with ecstasy when it tears round a corner and, most of all, the blast of sound as a classic vehicle bursts into flames as it explodes. i'm not the biggest car enthusiast by any stretch of the imagination, but any of the above really does rev my engine! there's no denying the importance of transport on cinema. it has even been said that the invention of the train was one of the biggest influences on early cinema (looking out a window almost like a moving picture and the idea of being transported to a different time/space). but the car remains the most popular and most luved, it's even got its own genre: the carsploitation genre. a genre that focuses purely on the beauty of cars. in effect, it's just porn! car porn! and i'm not talking about that rather nasty documentary on channel 4 in which men actually had sexual intercourse with cars. whatever floats your...car, i guess. moving on... whilst running on empty isn't quite as pornographic as vanishing point (richard c. sarafian, 1971) for instance, with its close ups of the car in motion, all it's bumps and curves (!), this doesn't mean that the car isn't the main focus of this film. in fact, the cars themselves become characters (more on that later). they're objectified and fetishised as much as the women, in fact, maybe even more. and holy holy, are these cars something! every car in this film (besides the ones in the background) are simply beautiful ¬ñ works of art, there's no question about it.as i was saying, these incredible cars are, in a way, given characters themselves. you actually start sympathising with the car! spoiler ¬ñ most notably during the scene in which the car is being wrecked and burnt spoiler over. this has become almost a convention of the carsploitation genre; the evil 1978 plymouth fury from christine (john carpenter, 1983), satan's custom lincoln mark iii in the car (elliot silverstein, 1977), the nifty little mini coopers from the italian job (peter collinson, 1969) to the friendly volkswagen beetle in the love bug (robert stevenson, 1968) and of course each car from death race 2000 (paul bartel, 1975) and even wacky races (1968-1970) all of which had their own character. ironically however, this emphasis on the car often over takes (!) the human characters! and this is certainly the case with running on empty, in which only one human character (the blind character who drives his car with his hearing rather than sight) has any sort of dimension, the rest are very much stock characters. these are all your stereotypical australian 1980s teenagers; big hair, annoying accents and none of whom would look out of place in neighbours, especially the kylie minouge look-a-like. but who gives a damn? it's all about the cars racing and crashing! that's it! if you don't like that you really are watching the wrong genre.the car scenes are certainly the selling point of this film, and the best thing it's got going for it. they are fast; very fast! and we're not talking about the rather annoying technique some films seem to use where they record the car 'speeding' at around 40mph, and then speed it up. oooh no! not with this film you don't. these cars are zooming along at top speeds in real time ¬ñ no fancy editing tricks here. so, we've got speed. check. what about crashes? check, check, check! whilst there isn't cars crashing everywhere a la the incredibly blues brothers (john landis, 1980) , when cars do crash in this film, they certainly crash! it would seem that they use gunpowder or something similar to build the cars as one little hit and kaboom they're up in flames. it kind of reminded me of thriller: a cruel picture (bo arne vibenius, 1974) in that sense.between these simply awesome scenes (especially the very start and the very end) there are quite a few scenes which slow everything done and, in my opinion, fail to add very much to the film. note: more exploding cars needed! however there are a couple of exceptions here which are great scenes ¬ñ spoiler especially the attempted rape scene.so, all in all, this is a man's film! a boy's film! full of cars vroom vroom vrooming around the outback and a couple of tits thrown in for good measure too. i'd recommend this little film to anyone even if they are keen cyclists (!) ¬ñ it's a great film which you can just switch your brain off, sit back in your leather chair and put on full volume! i'll give it 3.5 luvs out of 5 luvs ¬ñ bruuuuum! p.s ¬ñ amazon are selling this for just over ¬£2 ¬ñ it's a real bargain although the dvd lacks any special features whatsoever.

this is a top car flick (its a work of art/ yer a work of art!) all classic cars no plastic fantastic, i have watched it over & over again i have worn out two video tapes, and will wear out lots more. lots more car lovers young or old will love this film & watch it more than 1 time! so hire it or buy it (just see it) i wish they would make more (car) movies like this v8 power not gassed up little whipper snippers!!!!(shes a 351 right?)(motor magic) (the heap the chariot)(you've got to learn to feel the power)

the movie has started, the wheels spin, your car has entered a race against the fox.... you're behind you can't get in front, you figure, "if i go out, i'm taking you with me..." you smash into the cars parked on the side of the road, you turn to hit fox but your aim is bad.... bang, you've gone up the back of a vw, and smash you've landed in a reservoir. your car lights on fire. you could get out if you wanted, but the shame of losing has taken you... bang! your car blows up, everyone looks on in despair, some crying... the sound of a siren tells you the cops are coming. everyone gets in their cars and bolts, leaving you to burn. the charred remains of the cars frame sits there, haunting the on lookers... you're dead.this is one of the scenes; actually its the first scene in the movie. there are many more like it. as you enter the cockpit of the fox in his pimped out v8 ford, terry serio in his crazy gtho, and many others in this blast from the past.... john clarks masterpiece, "running on empty" "-he'll win at any cost-"

for those of you out there who have seen this pic on vhs, i would recommend the dvd. in fact the vhs is utter rubbish. the main reason is that the film was shot widescreen (2.55:1) and the producers ran out of money making the vhs version and released it as 4:3. the result is that several actors are not on screen at all, and in many drag races, less than half the cars are showing since one is on each side of the screen. the dvd is actually a reasonable version of the film.a lot of the best scenes in the film were cut before the final release. they were viewed as being too offensive to minority groups. in fact the prospect of a us release caused even more cuts in the film. for example, the americans reputedly did not understand words such as petrol & strides. mike's dad and mum were meant to be hippies. the dad survives in the film as a wasted dope smoking guitarist. but the following scene with the mum was cut. the scene took place in the roof space of the house which was lined with aluminium foil, fluoro lights and filled with plants... you get the picture. the producers had rounded up a lot of real plants for the foreground and when they saw the result on the big sheet, they freaked and the scene was cut. cowards!yes, the film is noted as an australian cult classic. voted #2 in street machines best 100 films of all time, narrowly missing out to mad max ll. the latter had over 10 times the budget of roe. in fact the budget on roe was so small that the director could not afford to wreck any of the cars... even though there would have been a public outcry if anyone had wrecked a real ho. (compare that with smoky and the bandit or blues bros where dozens of cars were wrecked.) so there's one real gtho and two fakes. one of the fakes was bought from the local indigenous community in cobar after the standby gtho crashed into the back of the country boy's truck. (that was unscripted! the car was meant to burst out from the side of the truck.) because the budget was so tight, the car was made up with ordinary brown masking tape instead of the painted on gold trim of the real thing.the 55 chev is absolutely real. the car began as a very plain 4 door and was brilliantly and quickly converted to the blown '55 in the film. the motor was a marinised 545 which made around 1000 bhp. this was reduced to around 600 for the filming. the car was able to easily to 170 mph as show in several scenes in the film. just for the record, anyone with $12,000 could have picked up all the cars after the film. the ho, the dodge, the '53 ute, rammer's 53 chev... the lot. wonder where they are now?sw

i remember watching this movie many years ago on vhs at a friends place. at first i thought it would be a boring car movie. but much to my surprise it ended up being one of the best movies i can remember watching for its time.it has a good story line and best of all it has some awesome aussie cars and street racing. i really loved fox's car the most which was a worked dodge charger. the paint work which was done on this car was truly outstanding in my opinion :)!there's also a black two door blown 57 chev which comes into the movie later on. i actually managed to get a copy of this movie on vhs last year at k-mart over here in australia. i did have plans of converting this movie to dvd myself as i believe it is a movie worth the conversion. but much to my surprise this weekend while i was browsing the dvd movie bin i came across it on dvd. so of course i grabbed it while i could as it was the only copy there.anyway if you really want to see some classic street racing with real muscle cars, including a great story line without a rice burner in sight. then this movie is for you!!!!here is some additional info taken from the back of the dvd.he'll win at any cost fox is a young man that lives in the fast lane. he believes he is the fastest man on the road - but street racing is illegal. if he doesn't accept his latest challenge he could loose his girl... if he does accept, he could lose his life. living dangerously, living fast and winning at any cost is their obsession. they don't turn back, the don't give in.. and the don't ask for help.

this is one of my all time favourite movies, if ur not into cars then forget it!! this movie features 1 of aussies greatest muscle cars, the xygtho. yeah so the acting not the greatest - it was never made to win an oscar. the car action will keep you comin back for more and more. there is a cool collection of muscle cars from the 70's and an awesome '57 chev - with a real cool cat drivin it! also there is a really cool song sung by terry serio the main actor. the acting is pretty funny when taken lightly, but the tyre smokin and drag racing is the main focus in this movie. big fast cars with pleantly of steel(no plastic cars), and some cool street dragging. i recommend it only to people that are into cars and not someone looking for great acting.

i saw uzumaki about a year ago and was mesmerized. the only japanese horror film i had seen before this one was kwaidan (which i proudly own on dvd, by the way), superb! the idea of a town being absorbed by spirals sounds exactly like something out of lovecraft. certainly it reminds one of shadow over innsmouth, of the inhabitants slowly turning into monstrosities (in this case giant snails). and who can forget the washing machine sequence? i hope we will soon see this one available on region 1 dvd (i see that sundance has recently screened it on us tv, hopefully they'll do it again very soon) so that we can all see it. highly recommended!!!!!

having discovered the ring trilogy, i have been greedily gobbling up all those other japanese and korean films that are either on or following the bandwagon.i don't have an easy definition of horror, but this film certainly pushed some of my buttons, even though i can't claim that the film makes a lot of sense. i'm squeamish so there were several points in the film when i just didn't want to watch what was happening on screen. the film unnerved me so i became apprehensive of seeing things that i thought i was going to see.it's an imaginative film offering a great deal visually. it also provides food for thought. and plenty of material to argue about when the film is over.the characters are well-defined to say the least. could they make films like this in the west?so it doesn't make sense in the end, but when one has an appetite for the occult, the supernatural, the bizarre, the otherworldly, then no film is going to deliver a final all-explaining pay-off.

watched uzumaki last night and right away was reminded of two early peter weir films from australia, the last wave and picnic at hanging rock. they were films loaded with atmosphere but short on actual horror. uzumaki, to me, seems clearly influenced by these films. it has a number of fairly mundane scenes that become more portentous the deeper you are sucked in by the film. it also has more scenes of outright horror and although i don't think the film actually measures up to those two films it is well worth the time of most thoughtful fans of the unusual (not necessarily horror). 7 out of 10 seems fair but i must say that years after seeing the last wave the film still stays with me, and it is precisely picnic at hanging rock's unresolved ending that makes it so haunting. p.s. all the people criticizing the acting... pullleasse...in this genre?

uzumaki succeeds as at plunging you into a bizarre surreality where uzumaki shapes haunt and curse a town. it fails at being a competent horror movie. while the film is sure to draw attention mainly to it's bizarre plot line and a few interesting visual treats, it's going to come off better as a dark comedy than a horror film. it's definitely a film you should see if your into the kind of stuff- but if your looking for a scare or even a small chill, you'll want to look elsewhere. uzumaki doesn't really have much else up it's sleeve but a great chain of odd events.a

to be honest, i thought this movie would be a japanese drama. i was dead wrong. this movie is based of the popular japanese anime novel of the same name. it tells the story of a town that is cursed by the uzumaki or the spiral in english. little by little the towns residents start to slowly become dangerously and violently obsessed with anything to do with spirals and some of the residents start to actually turn into living things the actually have some sort of spiral within them such as a snail.the movie was one giant, random, acid trip twisted with romance and drama. sort of like a¬Ötwisted¬Ödrama. what makes this movie disturbing is the ways that some of the people are obsessed with the spiral. for example: one of the dads has a garage full of house hold objects with spirals incorporated into them, one girl took her extremely long hair and teased to an insanely huge spiral-like style, one kid slowly transformed into a human snail, one man could twist his body into a spiral shape, one woman attempted to cut her ear open to obtain the cochlea inside and one teen ran over himself so that he could be twisted around a car tire and one kid stuffed himself into a washer so he could become a spiral.another very disturbing aspect of this very well syndicated is the atmospheric tone and the style in which this movie was shot. the camera angles add to the psychotic and twisted story, in other words, a very good cinematography. the overall coloring of this picture makes for a somewhat demented story. the coloring is a blend of lime green, yellow and a little orange and the special effects with some of the spirals are outstanding.however, like many japanese films, this one has an undertone of forbidden love and romance between a girl and a boy. however, with all the spirals and strange happening going on in the town it is hard to keep up with the relationship of the two teens. but, in some way it is very irrelevant, more like a second hand story that has nothing to do with the actual story of the spiral obsessed town.overall, i would recommend this film to anybody who likes vastly different and bizarre foreign films. it has just enough wackiness and insanity, it touched me.

uzumaki has a formidable reputation within lovecraftian circles and now i know why.uzumaki is based on a manga title (which, unbelievably, is allegedly better than the film) and follows the bizarre events preceeding a typhoon in an isolated japanese town. i'm not about to tell you anything that happens in this film because it is an absolute must-see movie. i watched it for the first time last night and i was blown away. it shot into the my top movies of all time and leap-frogged pans labyrinth as the best fantastic movie (literally and photographically) that has been released in the last decade.this movie is very lovecraftian in nature without formally having any direct connection to the cthulhu mythos. it has been made in the same way that lovecraft composed his stories; it exudes power as an aura of 'something's not quite right here' intensifies through a brooding phase to dread and, ultimately, horror through subtle progressive changes in the soundtrack and the cinematography. this is, indeed, a "weird tale" par excellence.simply stunning.

uzumaki has a very unique story and i will never look at spirals the same way again. not really spine tingling horror, this film has a dark morose, acid trip feel to it. during certain parts, was it just me or did you see vortex visuals? the camera shots are interesting and the movie lets your imagination run wild. the bizarre supernatural feel of this film draws you in just as the title suggests. acting is done well and the town setting itself seems wrong with to begin with.this may take a few viewings for it to sink in. a great trippy film.

uzumaki (that's japanese for "spiral" or "vortex") is one of the most absurd films i've ever watched. a town becomes obsessed and then all-consumed by the vortex pattern in some very grotesque ways. fingertips are cut off, people commit suicide in washing machines... just wild and crazy japanese horror. possibly as psychologically damaging as "the ring". generally not as scary as "the eye", but the imagery in this is more sickening than most of the things in "the eye". and not as gory as "the untold story"... but that isn't to say there isn't a fair amount of blood and dismemberment. seriously, if you enjoy horror films and especially asian horror - you must add this film to your list. a few parts are a little odd with the sound effects (the story is adapted from a manga comic and it shows), but it really fits. unlike some films that try too hard to capture the original source ("house of the dead") this one does it perfectly. the most original film you will see... not just this year, but probably ever. recommended!

a girl begins to notice that people in her small town are becoming fascinated by anything that is shaped like a spiral. soon, the fascination turns to obsession and things get deadly. while i won't say that "uzumaki" was an excellent film, i will say that it was unlike anything i've seen before. throughout my viewing, i felt like i was watching a cartoon. there are funny segues between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes. later, i found out the film is an adaptation of a manga comic, so this makes sense. however, just when you think you are watching something that could be a kid's movie, you are bombarded with nasty and gory visuals! the story often lags and the ending is somewhat abrupt and seemed anti-climactic at the time, but in retrospect i appreciate it more for its originality. my rating: 7/10.

uzumaki is a visually astounding film however i felt as if some of the story line may have been sacrificed. there is hardly any character development which left me feeling personally detached from the film, which is ironic because all puns aside, this film really does draw you in with its many slight spiral effects and stunning scene transitions. at first the overall cinematography threw me off but as you get used to the overall appearance you start to see the beauty in this twisted film. this is a great movie if you are looking for a looker with out too much substance or deeper meaning.it is a great horror film that is not actually scary or suspenseful but somehow...eerie.

a couple of weeks after i saw this movie it began to remind me of john carpenter's in the mouth of madness (not for the story!) for the atmosphere, the fast elements of surprise and the dreamlike sequences. on the other hand, this movie mixes very well the image and the music (note the 4th chapter in the movie)

anyone who enjoys the lynchian weirdness of twin peaks, or any fan of hp lovecraft who knows that the most frightening things are the familiar things, will really enjoy this film. don't watch it as a horror film in the "traditional" western sense, but more like a grimm's fairy tale. it is gory and definitely for 16+, but once you start watching it, you too will find yourself drawn into the vortex. definitely one of those movies that hangs with you for a few days after watching (i'll never look at my snails the same way again!)

this was a movie of which i kept on reading the reviews again and again; and despite it being played at film museum and not at pathe theatres ¬ñ i decided to give this movie a try. the reasons were many ¬ñ in the reviews it was compared with pulp fiction, it had several parallel stories running in the movie and lastly it had already won 17 awards internationally in various categories. i was eager to see this movie and due to my off day at greenpeace i decided to make myself happy by going and seeing this movie.it is a story based in finland. i think it reflected the current life of people in general ¬ñ drugs, crime, sex, anger, anguish, fear and guilt. every emotion was captured brilliantly in the movie. there are several characters and stories interwoven but a few characters come back in the latter half ¬ñ making a link with the beginning sequences and that takes the story forward.the story is about two friends ¬ñ one of whom is computer geek and the other is a drug addict ¬ñ son of an abusive father. the drug addict boy trades a euro 500 note ¬ñ printed by his friend ¬ñ to buy back his music system, and in returns gets huge change of cash back to buy more drugs. the trading of euro 500 note continues to bizarre events ¬ñ from the shop trader to an auto mechanic cum robber ¬ñ to a car dealer ¬ñ to a vacuum cleaner salesman ¬ñ to a prostitute ¬ñ to a police officer ¬ñ then to her family and children. how the beginning of a small thing ¬ñ creates a chain reaction that lead even after 5 years of that first incident to a depressing last note ¬ñ which i won't reveal here.the direction is excellent. the character development in the movie is first rate. the character that sticks on your mind even after you come out of the movie is of the vacuum cleaner sales person. all the departments of the movie are handled nicely. here i would like to make a couple of critical comments. first, during the sequence of one event leading to another i felt that the coincidences were too rapid and forced. but this screenplay writing error is pardon when one sees the whole canvas. second, the trail of one character leading to another somehow leads back to the first two characters and that again i found to be a forced decision by the screen play writer. there was no need to have the same characters showing up again when there are different causes leading to different effects in such a big city.but after saying that ¬ñ it is an excellent movie! it is a dark movie with quite a few sex scenes. the characters are having the black, white and gray shades and emotions that change from facing different situation which is brilliantly captured by the director.a top rate movie! it has all the ingredients of becoming a cult movie. i hope that only such movies should not become and achieve the status of cult movies and win lots of awards, because without crime, sex, violence, drugs etc. too one can make fantastic movies ¬ñ bicycle thieves and pather panchali are its prime examples ¬ñ only thing is that they were a long time back and times are changing and i think movies are reflecting the current times.

i saw this film at the 2006 palm springs international film festival and director aku louhimies introduced his film and was on hand for q&a after. for some reason this movie is titled frozen land in english so i don't know how the distributors got frozen out of paha. this is a very good film. it doesn't for me have enough that i would knock it up a notch to the excellent category but i did talk to some viewers who felt that it was an excellent film. louhimies said that back in finland people either loved this movie or hated it and said a lot of people in theaters walked out on it. i'm sure some objected to some of the violence, swearing, drug and alcohol abuse and sexual explicate scenes. it's a very clever story of how these different lives are woven together because of a trickle down effect. this film has very interesting and strong characters. i would rate it a 7.0 out of a possible 10 and would see it again and recommend it with caution.

this is another of those rare movies one feels grateful to be introduced to instead of the usual hollywood tripe. it really is a roller coaster ride, as we follow the effects of a a forged 500 euro note on a multitude of people. one asks 'what if' all the time but it certainly is a butterfly effect captured on film. it'll have you laughing, crying and biting your lip. i loved every minute of it! and thank you sbs australia for showing films that are truly entertaining, even worth the effort to read the subtitles. the only downside to my mind is that i wont be booking a holiday to the frozen land - they all seem to be far too depressed - must be all that cold weather. either way, watch it - it's worth every second.

for estoninans finland sometimes seems like a land of dreams. a land where many of us want to go and work there or start a business. find love, start a new life etc. but... aku louhimies has made this brilliant piece which shows that everything is not so good in finland as well. that finland can be just as paha maa (the bad land) than any other country. it shows that people there can be just as miserable in their lives than we in everywhere else. that sometimes there's nothing good. this movie nicely shows why finland is one of the top suicidal countries. it's not easy to live in north. cold climate changes us. i've become more and more attracted to finnish movies and this one is very good. the acting is great as well. jasper p√§√§kk√∂nnen has become one of the top finnish stars. beware of the sex scene (if you have little children) and a little depression that might come afterwards the movie! 8/10

before i'd seen this movie i've heard a lot of praise about it and quite many exclamations about how "horrific" it was. not to take any credit away from this movie, i think it wasn't all that horrible or even shocking. it's just a movie about people living in the darker side of the town. and a good one at portraying the point.there's some great acting here and a well-thought of manuscript. paavo westerberg is a renowned writer in the finnish movie scene and he's the best in what comes to describing the contemporary finnish culture (albeit he's not the only one writer for this movie, but i dare say he's the main-writer anyway. correct me if i'm wrong).the casting is excellent, except for jasper p√§√§kk√∂nen (the pseudo-main character, who in my opinion should have stayed in the soap opera scene), and the sets, the cuts and sounds are very well done as well and give great atmosphere to this movie.this movie is a story about loosely interconnected sad destinies that according to a famous finnish band's very well known song (eppu normaali's "tuhansien murheellisten laulujen maa", which very roughly translated to "paha maa") throughout the whole finnish society lead to a sad, dark end accompanied with booze, lonesomeness and the bad choices. and it's the side of everyday finnish life about 80% of the population have no awareness of, unless movies like this are made.

when the bicentennial hit, i was in hershey, pa and part of the middletown skate team. we didn't do anything except skate around trying to learn what we were reading in the pages of skateboarder magazine. a couple of local hills provided all the speed-wobbles you could handle. at the time mike weed was the hot stuff, along with russ whats-his-name, with the z-boys hot on their tail. i had a gt (grentech) plastic board with power paw urethane wheels (loose bearings).my parents told me we were moving to california later that year and that they were taking a trip to go house-hunting. i was an extremely good son that summer and asked if i might not be rewarded with a real skateboard from california. they delivered. it was a fiberglass deck with the surfer magazine logo screened on it. wide trucks and big red wheels (precision bearings, don't ya know). they got it at oak street, a surf shop in laguna beach.when i got to california (all of 13), anaheim had the concrete wave and carlsbad had a great park as well. soon came skateboard odyssey in mission viejo. an indoor park with every scenario imaginable. all the while i was reading about stacy, shogu, tony and jay. this flick was right on the money and a wonderful experience to watch.

this movie was awesome. it's a documentary about how surfing influenced skateboarding in the early days. it has interviews with skaters such as tony hawk(my idol)=), and stacy peralta to name a couple. dogtown is a so called "ghetto" part of california, where there used to be an amusement park that was torn down. people started riding alongside the dangerous ruins of the park. soon, the zepher surf team was formed. that led to skateboardings first real start in dogtown. the z boys were a team of ragtag teenagers who loved skateboarding and started the phenomenon known as vert skating. they started it by skating in drained swimming pools. that's just a bit of the story behind it. it even contains rare footage from charlie's angels of stacy peralta making a cameo. i think you should buy this movie if you are a skater. it'll teach you that skateboarding wasn't always popular. even if you are not, buy!

i must say that this has to be the best documentary i have ever seen in my life. i first say the movie at my friends house, and didn't get a chance to finish watching it. from that point on, i spent my free time trying to find the movie. i never found it, but on my birthday, my friend who knew i had the hardest time finding the movie,got it for me as present. sean penn does a great job of narrating the documentary. i loved how it told the story of each of the z-boys and the history of dogtown. i have been to venice and the surrounding area many times, and had never known what had taken place, until i saw the documentary. i didn't get a chance to see the actual movie, and i heard it was nowhere near what the documentary was. i don't know if i actually want to see the movie, but who knows.

this is a pretty good documentary. i'm not a skateboarder, i don't particularly like skateboarding or skateboard culture. but somehow for about 2 hours this movie made me interested in the subject.i wouldn't call it the most intriguing film of all time, but for some reason when those guys were talking about how they started their skateboard clubs and were skating in those empty southern california pools, i was interested.i should also add that the music in this film was pretty good too. i don't sit around yearning to hear more 70s rock bands, but it seemed appropriate for what they were talking about.

i first viewed this movie when it first came out and also bought an lp recording of the soundtrack. i liked it so well, i went back to see it several times..cannot understand why it was considered a flop. julie andrews was lovely in this film, her voice was in top form and the costuming was beautiful!the film contains a little bit of everything and even though some of the scenes were a bit heavy-handed, they were still fun. i recently found i could get a copy in dvd form and ordered it......i was disappointed that a couple of songs and sequences in the movie were not included in the version of the dvd i ordered.

just saw baby blue marine again after 30 years. i still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever. the innocence and purity of a time now long gone, is truthfully captured in this small film. the acting is above average and richard gere's brief appearance as a shell-shocked raider marine war hero, holds a keen interest for any film buff or gere fan. jan-micheal vincent is in his prime and looks and acts like the "all-american" boy. the late bruno kirby (who was billed as b.kirby, jr.) has a meaty role as "pop", a peace-loving, marine corp reject, dreaming of getting back home to his wife. if you're looking for sex, drugs, or rock and roll, this movie is not for you. if you're looking for action and adventure, the same applies. however, if you want to recapture a time in america of innocence, honor, romance, and love, then baby blue marine is a movie for you.

cheezy? yep. poorly filmed? you betcha. zero budget? they proudly claim it on their posters. brilliant anyway (or because of it)? for sure.this movie celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre: characters with absolutely no depth, fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment; teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent; completely gratuitous nudity; impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims; slow moving zombies; great one-liners... and our hero even wears a michael jackson jacket! this is not an all-out spoof like scary movie, but more a tribute film to the lost innocence of the 80s horror movies... when being scared and grossed out could also be a fun, silly, sexy, and goofy good time!

ok, so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers, but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being blacklisted, right? right! consider yourselves officially warned, and read on...in this parody/tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history - the 1980's - a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a seance in the house of the notorious murder mcgee, who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard. as i'm sure you can guess, things go from bad to worse faster than you can say "where's the beef??" and in typical 80's horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody, the dialogue is cheesy, and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get. good times...no clique or 80's horror movie clich√©d characterizations are left unrepresented here. in fact, no stone was left unturned at all ¬ñ we have the cool hero, his innocent girlfriend, the goth chick, the tough thug (think john bender), the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt, the shy dork in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt, a couple of gorgeous half-naked lesbians, and two big geeks.as you can plainly see, the cast is pretty big. usually, larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly, with one or two sour apples buggering up the whole barrel. not in this case though. not a single cast member left me disappointed. the acting was very well done. everyone from the cool hero in his thriller jacket played by jovan meredith to the grooovy goth chick played by renee dorian to geeks one & two played by cory assink & jonathan brett ¬ñ they all played it straight, brought their a-game, and knocked it out of the park. if you're a fan of gary & wyatt in weird science, you'll immediately fall in love with the geeks.director/co-writer jeff c. smith is a guy to watch for in the future, trust me on this. if this is what he can do with a low budget, there are nothing but good things ahead for him when he gets more money for future projects. the characters were dead on; the atmosphere was perfect; the laughs were huge; the blood flowed, and squirted, and sprayed beautifully ¬ñ it was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980's. call this one "the breakfast club meets night of the demons"!!! the tag line says it all, and says it honestly - "excessive violence; gratuitous nudity; zero budget" - no false advertising here, folks! as fans of this genre, we have to look to the indies and support these hard-working folks who are busting their humps out there bringing us original tales, lest we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered-down pg-13 'horror' or pointless remakes like the hitcher. no, thank you - no more of that for me.in closing, i honestly have to say that stupid teenagers must die! is by far one of the best indie flicks i've gotten the pleasure of watching this year. it's a bloody good time, and holds up on repeat viewings. from the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobe...even the closing love theme over the end credits (which if that doesn't bring back fits of laughter recalling mid-80's power ballads by reo speedwagon - over-pronounced r's on every word starting with the letter 'r' - then i'll eat my dvd right now)...bottom line is, if you're a fan of 80's horror or horror in general, no more hesitation - this flick deserves to be in your collection!!

loved this movie! kicking it old school! love the idea. love the script. love the characters. i really really really loved the geeks! i was excited to see the silly slapstick horror flicks still being honored. this was right up with my favs such as saturday the 14th and pandemonium. if you are a big fan of scary and silly then this is your movie! only taken off one star because i would love to have had better sound. not bad sound but would have liked to have more. great blood splatters. great murder weapons. great costumes! i really love the nod to the great 80's teenager stereotype ala breakfast club. and i can appreciate the non-cgi suspense. really good camera action and light suspense instead of cutting to cgi. i would rather have good fake that really fake fake.kisses to the cast and makers! oh, loved the "making-of" too!

stmd! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films i've seen in quite some time. director jeff smith (who also served as co-writer, cinematographer and editor) definitely shows his love of under-appreciated 80's horror films with this movie! anyone who loves the cheesiness, preposterous situations, wacky and stereotypical characters of 80's horror movies will definitely love this very tongue-in-cheek homage to the past.stmd! definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some. it has all the "excessive violence" and "gratuitous nudity" that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80's horror movies we all love. i had a blast watching stmd! from the 80's outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone i just couldn't get enough!

it's the 1980's and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of murder mcgee. after mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an ouija board, the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one. sound familiar? it's supposed to. it's clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80's slashers with the tagline: "excessive violence. gratuitous nudity. zero budget." can't get enough; it's pure entertainment! i enjoyed the humor and the way it poked fun at all the horror clich√©'s, but at the same time embraced what was fun about movies from this time. there is something you get with this movie you never got with the old 80's slasher films though: good acting. the entire cast was very talented and you don't see that very much in any low budget flicks, recent or otherwise. there was a lot of chemistry between the characters. i was very entertained throughout the entire film, and i am fully convinced the writer/director and cast will go a long way in their separate careers. the script was very well written, and the dialogue flowed naturally.the effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not lit well, but the fact that this movie admits on its cover there was practically no budget, i already know this going in. this film makes it simple to politely ignore its faults and just sit back and enjoy. although this is not an oscar award winning opus, it never claims to be, and props to that. it's a lot of fun. if you like slashers, you'll really appreciate this film. if you like blood and boobies, you'll appreciate it also.

this brass eye special paedo-geddon was swamped by complaints ( more on that later ) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible " sarah`s law " following the abduction and murder of school girl sarah payne . in fact it`s scheduling was delayed while phil collins took legal advice after he found out he`d been fooled by the show`s maker chris morris into a starting a campaign entitled nonce-senseif truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but i do confess that i laughed out loud . the edition centres around paedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims . chris morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous paedophile has been launched into space then confesses that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the paedophile . cue the child`s frightened screams . like i said very poor taste other highlights of the show include dr fox giving a scientific lecture that paedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs ( " no one knows this but it`s a scientific fact " ) labour mp barbara follet giving a public warning about equipment paedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net and kate thornton warning viewers that paedophiles can send gas through the internet which makes young children suseptable to sexual predators including one victim " who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old colonel " . morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if they`re classed as obscene . the photos included barbie surrounded by a marital aids and a composite photo featuring a young boys head , a dog`s body and an erect penis that could only have belonged to john holmes . hey i never said this show was tasteful did i ? it`s impossible to mention paedo-geddon without the hypocritical fall out that surrounded it where politicians , childrens organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject . the show was poor taste despite me laughing all the way through it but it`s a biting satire . perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted paedophile slime to walk around the streets of britain before they criticise a mere tv show for exacerbating tensions .

this blake edwards film isn't too sure whether it wants to be a comedy, a drama or a musical. no matter, the sheer presence of julie andrews, is reason enough to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy spoof. julie is beautiful and uses her many talents, throughout the film. rock hudson looks tired, but he's is more than fine, as julie's romantic interest. authentic world war i cars and planes, add to the appeal. overall, the film is very entertaining. the dvd release is an edited (by blake edwards) version of the original release. supposedly, this is the only version that edwards would allow; but, turner classic movies has shown the complete (theatrical release) version, recently. recommended.

i love this movie. the cast were all terrific in the portrayal of their various characters. judith ivey did so well portraying a weak, fearful, dependent, who was passive aggressive in her complaining and self-involved character, that it was a relief to see the character's metamorphosis. blythe danner was equally appealing in her role as a somewhat judgmental jewish mother, devoted wife, and loving sister. jonathon silmerman, bob dishy, stacey glick, and lisa walz performed their roles equally well.if you enjoy movies that relate to going through challenging times without loosing your sense of humor and hope, you will love this movie.

one of my favorite movies. great cast, lead by jonathan silverman and blythe danner. serious drama situations with brilliant comedic punches. an exact mixture of character and story. real people with real problems, and everyone has a different relationship with each family member. sensitively moves from slightly-sad to hilariously-funny. read the quotes. this is the best adaptation of a neil simon play.if you wanna see more of eugene check biloxi blues (starring matthew broderick who played in both stage versions) is ok, a bit on a darker side. get away from the made-for-tv broadway bound.

this is a gently amusing coming-of-age comedy that comes from the later, more mature period of neil simon's writing. although there are plenty of wisecracks to go around, this is not one of those neil simon pieces where every character spouts out one-liner jokes for 2 hours like they're guest stars on a bob hope special. there are also dramatic elements (some work, some are overkill) that lend some weight to the story.the performances are good across the board, especially blythe danner as the mother (although she and judith ivey were oddly wasp-ish choices to play jewish women). i've never been a fan of jonathan silverman, but i will say that he hits the right notes as the obnoxious, gawky, and totally horned-up teen-age narrator/protagonist of the story.the movie is very similar in tone to woody allen's "radio days," but the latter is far more imaginative and funny than this one.

how many of us have read a book or seen a play, and then when the movie version came out we were terribly disappointed? well, maybe this would be one of those movies for those who saw the play too, but as someone who never had the opportunity to see it on stage, i was extremely entertained by this movie. the characters were funny, the music was great, and the story was interesting and made you feel genuine empathy for the characters, flaws and all. jonathan silverman has such good comedic timing, and his lines especially are hilarious. i'm not going to give any spoilers, it's just a nicely done, funny movie showing the inner workings of a middle class family during wwii. so if you never saw the play, and if you have enjoyed other neil simon movies, don't be held back by the couple of negative reviews seen here. on its own, brighton beach memoirs is a great movie. i guarantee it (no money back, though).

the viewer who said he was disappointed seems to be wildly missing the point here. this is a superb movie, excellent and realistic portrayals of a middle class jewish family in brighton beach, brooklyn, of long ago. the nuances are perfect and i felt the casting of everyone was superior. i especially found the acting done by judith ivey just perfection---especially the speech she has with her daughter when the daughter comes home late one night. that scene was oscar worthy. but, really, all the acting was fine. i recommend this movie. it is a fun, family film and delightful to see how a lovely middle class family lived in brooklyn so long ago. see it and you will be glad you did. has some very funny lines and the eugene character is a real comedian--very funny.

this is without a doubt one of neil simon's best plays turned movies. it's full of great characters, and memorable dialog. johnathan silverman makes a great screen version of young eugene(he was played by matthew broderick on stage).this is the first of simon's autobiographical trilogy, its followed by the wonderful "biloxi blues", and closes with the tv movie "broadway bound". if i had to say the movie has any flaws it would maybe be that characters sometimes usually speak in obvious dialog, but that's alright because it's great dialog. rent this little gem, you won't be sorry!

in april 1947, new york city faced an epidemic crisis. eugene labar, a rug importer arriving from mexico, had arrived in the city, bringing with him the deadly smallpox virus. he stumbled off a bus, complaining of fever and a headache, and soon died in a midtown hospital, but not before he had infected a dozen passers-by. the damage was already done; for the first time in decades, smallpox stalked the streets of new york. the city's health authorities acted quickly to isolate sufferers and contain the virus, enacting a free vaccination campaign that saw over six million new yorkers immunised against smallpox. thanks to their swift response, the virus was contained with minimal casualties. the outbreak, nevertheless, must have left an indelible mark, for several years later it was followed by two similarly-themed film noir thrillers in which doctors must track down a single contagious carrier in a city of millions: elia kazan's 'panic in the streets (1950)' and earl mcevoy's lower-budget 'the killer that stalked new york (1950).'mcevoy's film unfolds in an unglamorous docu-drama style. reed hadley's narration sounds as though it was plucked straight from a newsreel, reciting facts as if reading off the official police transcript. this technique does feel a little cheap at times, but fortunately the narration is largely restricted to the film's bookends, as well as providing some explanatory filler during breaks in the plot. the "killer" stalking new york, in this story, is not a rug importer from mexico, but beautiful diamond smuggler sheila bennet (evelyn keyes), who has just arrived from cuba. within days, sheila has two parties independently pursuing her: a treasury agent (barry kelley) looking to arrest her for smuggling crimes, and a team of doctors (led by william bishop) who have identified her as the source of the smallpox outbreak. as in 'panic in the streets,' an otherwise routine manhunt is given a heightened sense of urgency, particularly when those in pursuit initially have no idea as to the identity or appearance of their suspect.'the killer that stalked new york,' for the most part, manages to sidestep its low production budget. aside from a select few lines of dialogue ("we have to stop it!" exclaims dr. wood at one point, as though coming to a difficult decision), the filmmakers and cast members allow the story to unfold in a realistic, engrossing fashion. indeed, in this regard, the low budget quite possibly aids the film's intentions, necessitating a documentary style that adds to the immediacy of the outbreak scenario. evelyn keyes is excellent in the leading role, showing obstinate resilience in the face of unimaginable torment; by the film's end, she appears so brutally incapacitated by her illness that it's almost painful to look at her face. aside from the virus, charles korvin is the main villain of the piece, as sheila's greedy and adulterous husband who, rest assured, gets everything that's coming to him. and if all nurses looked like dorothy malone, perhaps catching smallpox wouldn't seem like such a bad break, after all.

in this crackerjack noir thriller from columbia which is a combination of panic in the streets and the naked city, evelyn keyes is unknowingly the killer that stalked new york. evelyn who smuggled some stolen jewels into the country from cuba also smuggled in smallpox. it gets misdiagnosed by doctor william bishop and when they do find out what it is the hunt is on for her.for most of the film the treasury department is also hunting keyes, but for the smuggled jewels. it's not until nearly the end of the film that the health department and law enforcement realize they're looking for the same woman.evelyn's on a mission also. her husband charles korvin has left her flat, the unkindest cut of all being that he was fooling around with her sister while she was in cuba collecting the gems and contracting smallpox. when lola albright as her sister commits suicide over the whole affair, evelyn's on a mission, get korvin or die trying. and that's not an idle threat given the situation.the film was mostly shot in new york like the naked city and its cast is sprinkled liberally with a lot of familiar names and faces. keep an eye out for good performances by connie gilchrist as evelyn's unsympathetic landlady, jim backus as a shifty club owner, and art smith as korvin's fence.a real sleeper in the noir category, don't miss it if broadcast.

(some spoilers) sweeping into new york city on a first-class railroad car a killer who doesn't kill with a gun or knife or club but just with his,or it's, touch and breath. a killer that's as old, or even older, then man himself. that killer has a name it's know the world over as smallpox.arriving in new york one cold november afternoon the killer hidden inside of sheila bennet, evelyn keyes, and like a trojen horse it waits until the opportunity presents itself. then like a ticking time bomb with it's fuse set off explodes throughout the length and breath of the city.sheila knows that she's being followed by a u.s customs officer who's been on her tail since she came back to the us from the island nation of cuba. having smuggled $50,000.00 of illegal uncut diamonds she had to be careful in getting them to her husband matt, charles korvin, to be cut and sold to unsuspecting jewelers in the city. mailing the diamonds ahead of time sheila knows that if caught the diamonds won't be found on her. what she doesn't know is that matt is two timing her by having an affair with her kid sister francie, lola albrght. even worse he plans to check out of town with the diamonds leaving her as well as francie holding the bag.even though we know right from the start of sheila's deathly condition it doesn't really come to the surface until much later in the movie.the first half of "the killer that stalked new york" is a crime suspense/drama with the u.s customs officials and nyc police looking for the stolen diamonds. as sheila starts to get sick and begins to infect everyone whom she comes in contact with the film reaches the point of a mass panic in the streets type horror movie. both the police and custom officials together with members of the city's health depertment race against the clock to find sheila before she infects the entire city of new york with the deadly smallpox infection that she's carrying. sheila finding out from matt's boss willie dennis,jim backus,that he quit his job as a nightclub piano player and that he was having an affair with francie shocks her into the realization to what a heel he is.confronting francie at her apartment it turns out that matt not only stiffed shelia but her sister as well. which later leads the guilt-ridden francie to take her own life. on the run and not knowing that she's infected with smallpox sheila goes to her brother sid (with bissell),who manages a flop-house on the bowery, to find a place to stay. only too late does sheila, and sid, find out the the stolen diamonds is the last of her problems. knowing that she's dying sheila goes to the office of jeweler arnold moss, art smith, knowing that sleaze-ball of a husband matt, who ended up beating old man moss into a bloody pulp, is going to be there to exact vengeance on him.doucmentry-type drama, based on a true story, with striking black and white on-location photography makes this movie about the horrors of unseen and deadly smallpox unleashed on a unsuspecting public well worth watching.

this is a really dark movie. noir indeed. the title character is smallpox, brought into new york city unknowingly by evelyn keyes.she is on one mission when she arrives and on a rougher one after she's spoken to her no longer innocent sister. but she herself is not intentionally a killer. this doesn't mean she doesn't kill. it doesn't mean her presence somewhere among eight million other people doesn't throw the city into turmoil.keyes is excellent. the supporting cast is very good too. there are several little-known people involved in this -- the director included. don't be put off. it is a movie to be reckoned with! (and how nice to see a columbia picture. columbia and republic turned out wonderful comedies and noirs; yet we hardly ever see them anymore.)

from 1950 comes a neat thriller about a couple smuggling diamonds from abroad and also the contagious disease smallpox. evelyn keyes pulls out all stops as the essential victim of this film-noir. once back in the united states she is not aware that she could be spreading the disease on everyone and everything she comes in contact with. eventually she is pursued and must be stopped before an epidemic occurs. other than keyes striking performance there is good support from villainous charles korvin, william bishop, dorothy malone, lola albright and whit bissell. the finale is a humdinger with miss keyes on the ledge of a building with spotlights and hundreds of spectators below. a good b flick!

there must have been a sale on this storyline back in the 40's. an epidemic threatens new york (it's always new york) and nobody takes it seriously. some might say that richard widmark and jack palance did it better in panic in the streets, but i disagree.there is always something about these poverty row productions that really touch a nerve. the production values are never that polished and the acting is a little rough around the edges, but that is the very reason i think this movie and those like it are effective. rough, grainy, edgy. and the cast. all 2nd stringers or a list actors past their prime. no egos here. these folks were happy to get the work. whit bissell, carl benton reid, jim backus, arthur space, charles korvin, and the melodious voice of reed hadley flowing in the background like crude oil. by the way, i've been in the hospital a couple of times; how come my nurses never looked like dorothy malone? in these kind of movies they don't bother much with make-up and hair, but they really managed to turn evelyn keyes into a hag. or maybe they just skipped the make-up and hair altogether. anyway, it was pretty effective. she plays a lovesick jewel smuggler who picks up a case of small pox in cuba while smuggling jewels back for ultra-villain charles korvin (who is boffing her sister in the meantime). you got the customs agents looking for her because of the jewels, and the health department looking for her because she's about to de-populate new york. no 4th amendment rights here. everybody gets hassled.you gotta have the right attitude to enjoy a movie like this. i have a brother who scrutinizes movies to death. if they don't hold up to his orson wellian standards, he bombs them unmercifully. they must have the directorial excellence of a david lean movie, the score of wolfgang von korngold, the sound and art of douglas shearer and cedric gibbons respectively. this ain't it.but i have the right attitude, and if you do as well, you'll love this movie.

this is an excellent b-film horror movie that borders between horror and comedy. it is about a genetically mutilated scorpion in outer space. can it get more unreal? it is a hybrid between "alien" and "chain saw massacre." the movie was shot in stockholm with a mixed cast of americans and swedes that interact beautifully. director martin munthe does a great job finding the comical highlights in this script and gets a few good laughs out of the audience. the movie was shot with little or no money and it is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources. stinger has all qualities of a b-film horror movie. it is comical and scary at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause. it is great to see that movies like this can still be made! i would recommend seeing it if you like this type of films.

i think this movie was made as good as it could have been. with only 4 months and a 52000$ budget - i'm surprised this wasn't worse. if you are not to care about the cg or special effects, this movie is great.okay, the movie is not that well made (i'm sure it could have been but, you try to do better in only 4 months) but the story is good and the movie is rather exciting.don't trust me when i say that this movie is good, cause i also find the 1933 king kong to be good.i must confess that i didn't watch the complete movie either... i might have fast forwarded some minutes here and there...

i found this little gem as an extra feature on my dvd of vampyr-der traum des allen grey, and didn't expect all that much from it. it looked like it might be an interesting little short though, so i turned it on.i am so glad that i did. it was really incredible! despite having been made more than 70 years ago, the animation was, in my view, better than some of that done today with all the computer effects and experience available now.the story is quite simple-a newly put together toy dog hears its owner's laments about not being able to afford an orange and goes on a quest to find her one. in the process, it runs into a toy's underworld with all sort of nefarious creatures and toys overseen by none other than the devil himself, who all want the dog's orange for themselves as well.this film precedes, but reminds me a lot of mad monster party? (1969, jules bass)-a movie which i have always really enjoyed-and to a lesser extent, some of tim burton's animated works-the nightmare before christmas (1993, henry selick) and corpse bride (2005, tim burton). fans of any of these movies will, i am sure, also love the mascot.overall, an incredible piece of short animation which is well worth watching.

the mascot is ladislaw starewicz's masterpiece. it tells the tale of a stuffed toy dog who searches for an orange after he overhears the mother tell her daughter she hasn't any money. the dog gets picked with other toys to be sold off. in the truck, after the others jump off while the vehicle runs, the dog stays and waits to be picked up from store before setting off on his own. he manages to get orange after biting woman's leg as she was holding and selling the fruit. as he runs, he encounters the devil and accepts his offer to stop at nightclub. there, he meets the other toys who jumped off truck. the cat who was next to him in vehicle is especially determined to get dog's orange. i'll just stop here to mention that other wonderfully bizarre things happen in nightclub that you'll have to see for yourself. suffice it to say, if you love starewicz and is interested in all animation from the past, i most definitely recommend you seek this one out!

i agree with most of mr. rivera's comments, and i just want to ad a couple of caveats. this film, "the mascot" is criminally neglected in its current form. for that matter, so is "vampyr". "the mascot" isn't a "bonus feature"-- it's tacked on as a chapter in "vampyr". even though it's made very clear that this is a separate movie, it should have been treated as such by the manufacturers. and while i"m at it, "vampyr" needs some of that same respect and cleaning up as well. i got the feeling the decision to put the mascot on there went something like this.dude a: "we just transferred vampyr to dvd, but it comes up about 20 minutes short. we need to put something on there that won't cost much money. can you believe film critics want to be paid to talk about films!" dude b: "not to worry. i have this little animation thingy that's been sitting in my drawer. just go ahead and throw it on as an additional chapter." dude a: "you're awesome, dude b." the animation's of the mascot is great, and there's no need for me to repeat what mr. rivera's done so well. however, this thing needs some major cleaning and restoring, especially the audio. the plot comes through in the dialogue. and in my copy there were so many hisses, pops and places where the sound just dropped right off (i would have had no idea what the dog was going after without having read the box). no amount of volume was going to make the words more understandable, it just brought up the tinniness and made the hisses and pops louder.bottom line is: starewicz's films need to be put into a respectful collection, cleaned up, spiffed up, liner notes and the whole nine yards. in other words, they need to be "criterionized" 9 out of 10 for the movie, not the product which would get only a 5.

i still can't belive that starevich made this film back in 1934. animation is simply perfect, and what is amazing about it, with all the advanced technology we have nowadays there are few animation studios that are capable of producing a little gem like this one. it has everything: a great story, beautiful chracters (although this is a morbid kind of beauty in some cases), special effects... well, it is definitely not a kid's movie,but it's a must-see for anyone seriously interested in animation.

one of starewicz's longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange. the dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold, but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters. with the help of a stuffed cat, the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death. the mascot features new techniques i have not yet seen in starewicz's films. the addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop-motion animation makes for a new twist on starewicz's old style of puppetry. live scenes of moving cars and people's feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh. the honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and starewicz's utilization of the new technology seems like old hat. new puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil's club scene. twigss and newspaper shreds come to life. skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks. characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses. a new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene. overall, starewicz is able to update his style of film-making to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work.

words alone cannot describe the sheer beauty and power of this film.think "toy story". now, think "toy story", circa 1934. now, imagine the animation looks as lifelike, as fluid. think of the movie not as something adults and children can enjoy, but imagine it as a filme-noire.imagine trying to do something like that back in 1934. somehow, "the mascot" delivers. in a story where toys come to life, and one of them is trying to deliver an orange to his sick owner, starewicz delivers a level of animation completely unexpected. it's so fluid, you will wonder for a long time whether what you see is really stop-motion animation. comparing "toy story" and "the mascot" is an excercise in futility, plot-wise: while "toy story" is a children's story adults can enjoy, "the mascot" is a dark, chilling story aimed at adults. meaning, no, your kids won't like it. one bit.still, get it if you can. you might be able to find it along "vampyr" in dvd and laserdisc. and prepare to be stunned at what starewicz was able to do back in 1934 with a couple of puppets.

a brilliant animated piece that was far ahead of its time, and certainly far ahead of anything that was being released in mass production at the same point in history. the influence of this work upon tim burton's "nightmare before christmas" is readily apparent. one can only imagine how starewicz slaved over every beautifully detailed frame of this masterpiece.there have been very few animated films of this caliber. it's a shame that more people haven't seen this gem.apparently, imdb now requires comments to be at least ten lines long, so this is the tenth line. this must be something new - but i really don't have anything else to say!

straight from the brilliant mind of animation pioneer wladyslaw starewicz, "f√©tiche", or "the mascot" as it is known nowadays, stands as a masterpiece of stop-motion animation that sadly, has been almost forgotten by now. nevertheless, the work of this man deserves to be seen, and in fact, must be seen to be believed because the outstanding way the animation flows is simply unbelievable.decades before "toy story", starewicz conceived the idea of moving toys, in "f√©tiche", he tells the story of a small stuffed dog that gets makes friends with the sick daughter of his maker. one day, his maker takes him away to sell him, and the adventure begins as he tries to find his way back home. in his odyssey, he'll travel from paris to hell, and will find the other toys that were supposed to be sold with him.it is a surreal experience to watch this movie, as starewicz makes every imaginable creature come alive with grace and beauty. the other toys include a beautiful ballerina, who loves a thief, but she also is secretly loved by a clown, forming a love triangle; an old woman, a stuffed cat and a stuffed ape complete the group. every toy is so detailed and very expressive that without words one can understand their motives.truly, the surreal atmosphere the whole animation has it is remarkable. it is hard to believe that a work of this magnitude was done in 1934 since it looks even better than most of the current day animation. the influence it has in modern day animator such as tim burton and henry selick is very significant.this short is a masterpiece of animation and the outstanding work of one genius who done everything by himself and that has influenced animators for decades. starewicz's work is an immortal piece of art that should be seen by everyone. this work is not only for kids, adults as well will enjoy it and probably catch most of the subtext hidden in the movie.it is possible to find it in the "vampyr" dvd as a bonus feature. anyone with the slightest interest in animation should give it a look.

there is a complete copy now available at the internet archive - watch it or download it today!http://www.archive.org/details/the_mascot_completeone of the greatest animated shorts ever made. starewicz is endlessly inventive and his techniques still astound animation fans 70 years later. we may have computer-generated techniques now, but all he had in 1934 was an imagination that wouldn't take "no" for an answer. whatever he wanted to see on the screen, he created. and he wanted to see some truly bizarre stuff - every imaginable piece of scrap is called up for service: old shoes, chicken bones, utensils, broken glasses, dolls, monkeys, rats....seems like there was nothing that was off limits.a truly eerie, even unsettling film that should be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in animation. this film must be seen to be believed!

cannibalism, a pair of cinematic references to delicatessen, not only in plot, but in style. cannibalism, a pair of references to the historic case of the uruguayan rugby players that survived in the andes by eating the dead members of their flight to chile. cannibalism, only an excuse the movie uses to delve into the extremes men are willing to go to defeat isolation and obtain social acceptance.the script is extremely creative, and hopefully is going to leave the viewer laughing and wondering...

this movie is the funniest danish movie i've ever seen!the plot is funny, surprising and exceptionel. danish humor is unlike any other, and it gets you every time. the entire audience laughed 90 % of the time....it was incredible. the characters are so well played, and the two actors, mads mikkelsen and nikolaj lie kaas play their best ever!i would highly recomend seing this movie, you won't regret it, believe me :-)

this is a novelty in danish film. the mood is not unlike that of blinkende lygter, also by anders thomas jensen, but with a novel touch. one difference is fewer characters, leaving much more room for them to be dwelled into. and what characters?! the two butchers are perfect. mads mikkelsen is a dominating, deranged parody and nikolaj lie kaas an indifferent looser with a twin brother more or less an unholy pairing of the two.

it is a wonderful film about people. strange people. the characters in the movie all have a very tragic past, so they all have their problems. their problems evolve in a way that makes the plot of the movie very absurd; but that does not make the movie worse, only better, for it is shot in a kind of fantasy-like way, so nothing is real. this review might sound a little weird, but then again, the movie is not quite normal... it is also a hilarious movie at many times. if you have not seen it, see it. enjoy!

this without doubt one of the funniest and most entertaining movies i have ever seen. i really enjoyed the characters in the movie. they are all wonderful bizarre in them selves. it's quite something i have never seen before in any movie.the story is almost non-stop from beginning to the end. there are no boring moments. i was totally captured by the movie. and i thought the acting was great.so if you want to see a fun movie. you should look for the green butchers. a great movie.i give it 10/10

this is actually a brilliant movie. the story is grotesque, but the actors are brilliant. especially the performance of mads mikkelsen as svend, is magnificent. it's a simple story about two guys with an urge to make it on their own, but it unfolds to a strange and absurd story, with a lot of people accidentally getting killed and served up as chicken steaks. if only more people understood danish... this could be a great candidate for an english version. it is also worth mentioning ole thestrup, who always delivers that extra twist to the plot, with his slightly mad character holger. i can only recommend this movie to the danish audience. also take a look at adams √¶bler (2005), a movie by anders thomas jensen, also with mads mikkelsen accompanied by a well playing ulrich thomsen.

this movie is a mix of a dark comedy and a drama, about two guys who worked in a butcher's shop and wanted to build up their own. when they finally fulfilled that dream, they faced a new problem: there were no clients! one day, by accident, one guy dies in the refrigerator room, and a new kind of butcher's business begins¬Ö they start selling human flesh, saying to the clients it's just chicken¬Ö and their business starts to improve: human flesh sells good! oh! i forgot to say something¬Ö these guys aren't normal! there's really something missing in their brains! the movie has some nice dark humour scenes, but it is, in my opinion, mostly a drama. one that shows us what is inside the head of a psychopath, what are his motivations to what he does. i must confess i was a bit surprised with the ending of the movie, because i never expected they could make it without been discovered, but that's probably because i see too many hollywood movies¬Ö what i mean by this is that in hollywood's cinema we always expect the punishment of the guys which do the "bad things". there's always a morality protecting the "good values", in spite of we all know that in "real life" it doesn't happen this way too many times¬Ö and i liked this movie mostly because of that, because it fits in a kind of cinema which is true, frontal, without fake moralities, and which "see" what is on the other side, behind the "conventional morality"¬Ö it just happens in independent cinema (especially in the european)! besides, there're excellent performances by nikolaj lie kass and mads mikkelsen (especially the first one) in the roles of the "disturbed guys"¬Ö very nice danish film!

this is, by far, the best movie i've seen in a long while. it is a wholly original and beautiful plot. it is not boring, nor is it too dramatic. the characters are tangible and realistic, but it does not take away from the story line. the fact that is not in english is most likely the final touch. the end leaves you fulfilled in a way i've never experienced in a movie before. i wish i had found this movie earlier.more lines.more lines.more lines a lot more lines c'mon, i'm done

many americans are lazy, and this has manifested itself even in our dvd-watching. many of us don't like to take the time to read an hour-and-a-half (or more) of subtitles, so we choose not to see many foreign films. one film that is totally worth your time, no matter how mundane a task you might think the subtitle-reading is, however, is "the green butchers." it's by far the best foreign film i've ever seen, and tops many american films i've seen lately as well. it's a complex situation told in a remarkably simple and funny dialogue. the character depth derived in this film is amazing. the way svend and eigel (sorry if those are spelled wrong) feed off each other's contrasting personas is downright spectacular! the actors were well-cast, and i'm very much hoping that a sequel is in consideration...it needs very little of bjorne and what's-her-face...just give me svend and eigel on some sort of journey with supporting characters and more amazing dialogue! to the author of this fine screenplay, i say: write more! the story itself is rather twisted, but you'll find yourself rooting for the bad guy anyhow...with no remorse. please check this movie out!

de gr√∏nne slagtere or the green butchers as it is called in english is a very dark comedy about two losers who work for a popular butcher. they are fed up with their bosses criticism and decide to start a business on their own. their shop is expensive and it doesn't even have electricity all over the place. and to make things worse, they haven't got any customers (as their former boss predicted). when the man pays them a visit in their shop, he challenges them to provide the meat for a dinner party he organizes.than a tragic accident happens. one of the butchers locks the electrician into the freezing chamber when he closes the shop. the man dies and the neurotic one of the two butchers decides to cut fillets out of the electrician's thigh and serves it to the dinner party instead of calling the police. it's an incredible success. all at once every person in the village wants to taste that incredible "chicken". overwhelmed by his sudden success the butcher sees no other option but to kill more people, who he can sell as chicken.i guess that the subject cannibalism may not be enjoyed by everyone, especially not because it is shown with a lot of humor. personally i liked it a lot. it shows perfectly how far some people would go for some social acceptance and to get out of their isolation. it may sound a bit far-fetched, but i'm sure you would be surprised to see how people in real life sometimes act.next to the original subject, i was also pleased by the actors' performances and the humor. there is no overacting, as you might expect in this kind of movies, it's all very sober and realistic (i guess that's typical for the scandinavians and scandinavian movies). the same for the humor. i'm sure i wouldn't have liked it as much as i did now if the humor had been over the top, or with a lot of farting, vomiting,... like you see so often in american movies. i loved this movie and i give it an 8/10.

the game was made in 1996, but it is still good today. the graphics is not that hot and the actors are not oscar-worthy but the plot is twisted, diabolic and highly enjoyable. the dark story is compelling from the first film and is continuing throughout all the play. we played several people together for several reasons: 1) to use all our minds together. 2) not to be so afraid.play this game and you won't regret this, just don't try to find a quake engine in there.

i play this game exactly after i watch the trailer in old magazine advertise cd...the is very interesting and dark atmospheric (missing in nowadays games/movies). the game is set somewhere in the middle of the '90 in the spooky mysterious mansion. you play as adam randell and your quest is to free the soul of your death trapped father.the look of the game is doom-like, but very different type of game. a lot of a action, various puzzles, quests, mazes and many more interesting locations and characters are presented in this old classic game.the game will run only on windows 98 and there is no patch for windows xp.

found a copy in a bargain bin sale of this old time classic. i played it with dosbox on a vista machine without any issues. it's graphically dated heavily, but what do you expect for a 12 year old game! the game is a fps/adventure game hybrid. it's what i call pseudo 3d, you can't look up or down, just spin in 360 (think wolf3d). game play can get tricky with a very limited supply of health pots, and a somewhat average interface (tip: press i), but on the whole it's passable.one main strength of the game is the mood. there game heavily uses full motion video, and whilst the acting is b-grade and the plot is very choppy, the game as a whole feels genuinely creepy. it also does a good job of making you question the 'good guys'. are they really helping, or are they just waiting to stab you in the back? the other major selling point is the games length. there are from memory 18 chapters, which range in game play time from 10minutes to, potentially, hours. my first play through took me a week with some serious devotion of time.dated, yes, but if you missed this years ago and can find it for $5, give it a look. cheaper than a movie, and more entertaining than most movies.

this game is an action/adventure with combat. there are quite long periods with no combat but other times, you have to get rid of various kinds of monsters. the monsters are not like anything you would see in real life, and they have to be gotten rid off in order to continue with your quest. the whole game is a quest. you play adam randall whose father contacts him from the beyond and asks him to come and save him. the game is from the mid 1990's and has to be played in dos. i used dosbox and was able to play the game quite well. the graphics are not as good as some games even of the time, mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes look quite blocky, but others look batter, but don't let that put you off the game. the game is very imaginative, its long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters appear out of nowhere. not for young kids who likely wouldn't be interested anyway, but over 13 or 14 might like this game. its a horror\mystery\action\adventure\combat combination.i thought it was a great game. its had to find now. maybe ebay. but remember its a dos game and you would not be able to play it on todays faster computers. would be hard to play on fast computers unless you use dosbox. oh, and the acting is very good too.

this game is one of the best horror/shooter games i've ever played. the plot is a little choppy, but the game never fails to send you plenty of chills and excitement. many people shelved the game when they found that there are no cheat codes for it and very little health potions and ammo to be found. but actually, after you've gone through the game once, you are more familiar with the monsters and different rooms, so you can easily get by the second time around. the puzzles are great, not too hard, not too easy. there are tons of different monsters so you never get bored. and there are plenty of gaming areas. you really feel like you're in a good stephen king novel as you play. it's nice and creepy. pick this game up cheap and have some fun.

never mind if 'national velvet (1944)' is a bit hackneyed and occasionally unconvincing, clarence brown's equestrian fable is an endearing and very likable story with a good moral. after achieving modest success through her appearance in 'lassie come home (1943),' young elizabeth taylor, age 12, landed her first leading role as velvet brown, a passionate schoolgirl with an obsession for horses. though filmed in california, the story - adapted from a novel by enid bagnold - is set in a small township on the english countryside, and full advantage is taken of the technicolor photography to present the vibrant and handsome landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs. mickey rooney takes top billing as mi taylor, a misguided ex-jockey with devious intentions, whose relationship with young velvet reawakens his sense of dignity and opens a new, optimistic chapter in his life. though he noticeably struggles in one sequence, when he must confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses, rooney is enjoyable as the surly but passionate young man who must prove his worth.it is perhaps a good thing that elizabeth taylor had those entrancing violet eyes, because her acting abilities, at this young age, were rather limited. her more emotional sequences, in which she displays courage and integrity in the face of adversity, strike one as being rather hollow, and the touchingly-naive notion that simply "believing" will accomplish everything is one that has since been repeated ad nauseam by practically every unmemorable inspirational sporting film ever made. nevertheless, taylor is bright-eyed and enthusiastic, and she works well with mickey rooney, who was no stranger to being a child-star. anne revere plays a very important role as velvet's mother, once a famous athlete, who not only swam the english channel but was lovingly-trained by none other than mi taylor's own father. i liked that mi was not told about this until the film's final seconds, with mrs. brown correctly deciding that the young man would first need to develop his own sense of decency, rather than exploiting the memory of his late father for financial gain, as he would undoubtedly have done at the film's beginning.the film reaches its climax at the grand national sweepstakes, where velvet has, at the last moment, decided to ride her own horse, the pi, in the world-famous competition. under the guise of a latvian male, she goes on, as expected, to win the race, but is later disqualified - either because she's a girl, or because she tumbled from the horse before she was allowed to dismount (what a stupid rule!). this extended race sequence is exceedingly well-done, effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerve-racking pre-race seconds, and the confusion of the event that places us in the same position as rooney's character, stranded behind tall spectators and waiting anxiously for somebody to provide an accurate update. it doesn't really matter that we know it's a stunt double doing most of the difficult riding - in several scenes, we can clearly see a creepy-looking man in a wig - but the positive message remains the same. i'll wager that 'national velvet' has nurtured the imaginations of millions of young girls over the last sixty years, and it's power to inspire has decreased little with time.

a teen-aged girl gets the horse of her dreams and is trained by an ex-jockey to participate in london's grand national steeplechase. a fine adaptation of the classic children's book, with an excellent, start-making performance by taylor as the energetic but polite youngster. rooney is ok as her trainer, although he has some overly melodramatic moments. crisp and revere are quite good as taylor's loving parents. filmed in technicolor, it looks beautiful. the problems are that there are corny elements, nothing very interesting happens, and it drags on a bit too long. the race is exciting but could have been much more so.

i just wanted to say that i am watching national velvet on tv, it is now feb 2006 and i was checking on dates details, etc. surprising to see it was made in 1944 and rooney was 24 years old whilst liz taylor only 12, what an accomplished english actress she is.to put some americans contributors right: there are no irish villages in england. ireland is a completely different country and has nothing whatsoever to do with the english countryside. the scenes shown are supposedly taken on the south coast of england between brighton and arundel (county of sussex). no such scene exists now unfortunately. like many other places roads and buildings have been built on the hills and beaches.so please, all you lovely americans, do not confuse ireland with england, ever! we take great exception to it. like confusing texas with coney island.

wow! what a lovely, warm, rural film! the story focuses upon mi taylor (mickey rooney), a young male wanderer, whose journey takes him to a quiet, rural coastal town. there he stays with the brown family. velvet (liz taylor) their youngest daughter, who mi subtly befriends, has a passion for horses and wins one at an auction. this horse is a beautiful, maroon stallion; referred by its previous owner as a 'murderous pirate', but velvet re-names him pie. not long later, velvet suggests to enter him in the grand national race, mi and her family are against the idea, but soon agree and velvet and mi began to train him for britain's most famous horse race ¬Ö this film is a beautiful example of what british films are like. i remember i first saw this when i was eight and on my summer holidays. my parents taped it off the tv and i warmed to it instantly ¬ñ watching it most days instead of the large collection of disney films that i owned.i believe it was one of liz taylor's first movies and a good one! her character is na√Øve but sweet ¬ñ her acting is extremely convincing, especially when she portrays her love for horses. it's also a good chance to see angela lansbury in one of her early roles; who co-stars as velvet's older sister, who spends most of her time in the film being smitten with a boy in the town! i must say she was a gorgeous lady when she was younger. beautiful blonde hair and a rosy cheeked face. although she doesn't have a major part in the movie, she dose have a number of scenes - so not to disappoint her fans! parents reading this, i must emphasis ¬ñ if you can get hold of a copy of this please do! if you're children love animals ¬ñ i strongly suggest you show it to them! they may find a few scenes boring but you see velvet riding the horse on many occasions throughout the film and would most defiantly entertain children! a lovely and nostalgic film. i might just go away now and put it on!

after my 6 year old daughter began taking riding lessons i started looking for horse movies for her. i had always heard of national velvet but had never seen it. boy am i glad i bought it! it's become a favorite of mine, my 6 year old and my 2 year old. it's a shame movies like this aren't made anymore.

ccmovieman-1 must be, as the reviewer in the new york times who preferred the janis joplin big brother and the holding company album to the just released beatles'"white" album was called, either evil or insane. national velvet is a great film. elizabeth taylor's performance is fantastic, and i fail to discern even a trace of accent, much less too much of one. her performance is very natural, authentic and unbelievably charming. the rest of the cast is superb, especially rooney and revere. as far as the dialog being hokey or sentimental, i suggest cc has dined too long on a diet of irony and has lost the ability to discern genuine straight-forward emotion and human interaction. there was a time when people actually did think and talk in such a manner. not that this film doesn't have a slight hint of the magical permeating through it. that is the reason to tell the story. one might as well criticize the wizard of oz, king kong, the maltese falcon, casablanca, the black stallion ( the other great horse film ) or a thousand other films for having action and dialog that seem richer than real life. no my friend, national velvet endures because of its belief firmly in itself, with tongue firmly not in cheek. something today's jaded filmmakers find nearly impossible to recreate.

two of hollywood's great child stars (elizabeth taylor and mickey rooney) are perfectly teamed to deliver one of the all-time family classics. the story of a determined 12 year old girl, whose adoration for horses won't allow her to turn away from her goal to win the british nationals. mickey rooney is the newly orphaned drifter, looking to tie himself over until he can follow his own dreams.a beautiful side plot reveals that the girl's mother had ambitions of her own as a young girl. repeatedly overruling the father's decisions in favor of their spirited daughter, it is mother who seems to know best. the scene where the exhausted taylor rushes to go to school is priceless: father protests "why did you let her go to school, she'll drop from exhaustion before noon!" - not to worry, she'd be back within a half hour; it was saturday! the brilliant technicolor, the sumptuous music score, and those beautiful faces, all telling a bittersweet story. here's a good reason for the old saying: they don't make'm like that anymore!

julie andrews and rock hudson were great in this movie / musical. the opening song by ms. andrews, "whistling away the dark," will always be in the back roads of my mind. the plot line during world war i, is great and suspenseful one. if you are a romantic, you will love this movie. this is a movie that i always enjoy to see again and again.

i am 13 years old and i am writing this review in my mom's sign in. she will write her own review later. this is my all time favorite movie.it was filmed in england in 1944. i watched it so many times when i was little that i wore out the video tape. i love this movie and it changed my life! the beautiful landscapes. the mighty pie-bold thoroughbred horse. the plain little irish village with the young girl who wanted to do what no other girl had ever done, compete in the grand national steeplechase in london with her most beloved horse, the pirate. it all made me want to ride horses (which i have done now for 7 years)and learn everything i could about their breeds so i could also draw and paint them. it's a ground breaking movie about winning against all odds, overcoming your fears, believing in yourself, and reaching difficult goals by working very hard. also, the horse race scene was one of the best ever made and i have seen many movies with horse races. i never get tired of watching this movie. everything about it is perfect. especially if you are a young girl and passionate about horses!

a sentimental, heart-tugging family film set in england of the 1920s. a young elizabeth taylor wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter him in the grand national; fortunately, ex-jockey mickey rooney is around to give liz some help. director clarence brown displays some remarkable control with material that could've been excessively maudlin in someone else's hands. he and screenwriters helen deutsch and theodore reeves take great care in establishing genuine characterizations and developing the story naturally. true, there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced, but overall it's quite affecting, and gorgeously filmed in technicolor. the race itself is quite thrilling, and like so many great classics, there's a marvelous, three-hankie fade-out at the end. liz proves that she was a real trooper right from the start, and rooney--who i usually find rather annoying--is surprisingly subdued and really very good. donald crisp is terrif as liz's gruff father and angela lansbury is a delight as her older, boy-crazy sister. most of the acting kudos, however, belong to anne revere, who won a richly deserved supporting actress oscar playing liz's wise and caring mother.

in "lassie come home," "national velvet," and "the courage of lassie," elizabeth taylor was eleven years old ¬Ö nevertheless, her charm and beauty were extraordinary, and what she lacked in talent and experience was well hidden in a fine production that was nominated for five academy awards¬Ö as horse-trainer or dog-owner, as spurned wife or mistress, liz is a female who is absorbed in the giving and receiving of love: devotion to the object of passion is the center of her life¬Ö little liz lavishes love on horses and dogs with remarkable intensity¬Ö ecstatic; a dreamer with a turbulent emotional life, persistent, the young liz dedicates herself to the prize-winning horse the way she later devotes herself to men¬Öanticipating her later images of young sex goddess, liz as velvet is both saintly and mature¬Ö howard barnes, in the new york herald tribune, called her a child who 'lights up with the integrity of a great passion.' directed by clarence brown with loving attention to detail, the movie that made her a star is a big bestseller from another era set in sussex, england, where velvet brown, a butcher's daughter, teams with a vagabond teenager named mi taylo (mickey rooney) to train for competition a horse she's won in a raffle¬Ö from the coastal plains with its beaches, to the rolling hills, thatched cottages, and miles of country walks, "national velvet" is the product of a bygone era in movie-making¬Ö following closely the structure of the popular enid bagnold novel, the movie is part horse story, part family portrait: scenes of training and riding are balanced by cozy family scenes, vignettes about young love and sermons from mom on the virtues of courage and endurance¬Öthe browns are a noble version of hollywood rustic¬Ö dedicated to a sober work ethic, they live quiet, exemplary lives¬Ö mrs. brown (anne revere) is the very spirit of plain-folk wisdom; the spokeswoman for common sense and fair play, she knows well enough not to silence the semi-hysterical energy of her horse-crazy daughter, and she lets the girl have her dream¬Öanne revere won an oscar as velvet's mother, as did editor robert j. kern¬Ö

i saw this 1997 movie because i am a fan of lorenzo lamas (and of his father, the late fernando lamas). in my opinion, lorenzo looked his best in this film, mostly due to his hairstyle and the preppy wardrobe that were flattering to him.as the plot progressed, i realized the movie was more than just entertainment or a reason to see a favorite actor. the story was about a ring of serial killers and the attempts of law enforcement to investigate the ring and bring the members to justice. there was adequate suspense, and i believe the violence was necessary to relate the story to the viewer.at the end of the film i was shocked to learn the film is the true account of horrendous murders that occurred in utah. furthermore, lorenzo and his leading lady were portraying actual fbi agents who solved the disappearances of many young women and contributed to the apprehension of the ring. i believe the film is worthwhile as it informs the public about the dangers and capabilities of the criminal element.

the first in a new style of films for lamas- no tattoo's, motorcycles or karate. i, for one, miss them. but this is a serious movie. he plays a fbi profiler who has lived so long with the bad guys in his head that he no longer trusts anyone, including himself. gary busey is either a great actor or somebody i wouldn't want to meet in broad daylight on a crowded street. kristen cloke pursues lamas as doggedly as she pursues the serial killer. there is one surprise after another as the story unfolds not the least of which is the ending. it seems to never come - there is always one more layer to the story. cloke and lamas start out as the good guys, turn into the bad guys and somehow end up the heroes. but it's definitely worth the rental price. for maximum enjoyment throw in a candy bar,a bag of popcorn and a soft drink. you're going to the movies!

this was so much better than i expected, the film oozed proffesionalism compared to other b-moive of this sort of budget. the script was good if a little formulaic but the acting was surprisingly good from all including lorenzo and you always expect good standards from scheider and busey. aswell as the good plot and acting the action is good especially the car chases and the crashes are a-class. all in all this is a rise above other b-movie thrillers and doesn't have to rely on constant nudity or a flow of cheesy puns to make up for budget and script defficiencies, its certainly worth a rent.

what a show! lorenzo lamas once again proves his talent as a cop who committed the worst crime a good cop can commit, by being a good cop. then, again, he shows how sensitive a cop can be, displaying a range of emotions like no other actor can except, maybe, himself in terminal justice.huge enjoyment!

i stumbled across this film while channel surfing, and was blown away. it was being broadcast on a lesser known short films program here in australia.it has been a long time since i have been so impressed by a film, especially one so short. the power of the story, the quality of the acting and the stunning cinematography... wow. if it were available, it would make a very worthy addition to my dvd collection.i am undoubtedly impressed, and i will look forward to joshua leonards' next film.an exceptional experience 10/10

i found the story to be just enough of a thriller that the wonderful henry mancici music didn't lull me. julie andrews was excellant and i sure don't understand why this movie had problems at the box office when it came out because it just makes me happy at the end to have everybody singing. and i do like happy ever after endings which i think you can say this movie has along with some traditional blake edwards humor...

even a decade after "frontline" aired on the abc, near as i can tell, "current affairs" programmes are still using the same tricks over and over. time after time, "today tonight" and "a current affair" are seen to be hiding behind the facade of journalistic professionalism, and yet they feed us nothing but tired stories about weight-loss and dodgy tradesmen, shameless network promotions and pointless celebrity puff-pieces. having often been subjected to that entertainment-less void between 'the simpsons' at 6:00 pm and 'sale of the century' (or 'temptation') at 7:00 pm, i was all too aware of the little tricks that these shows would use to attract ratings.fortunately, four rising comedians ¬ñ rob sitch, jane kennedy, santo cilauro and tom gleisner ¬ñ were also all too aware of all this, and they crafted their frustrations into one of the most wickedly-hilarious media satires you'll ever see on television. the four entertainers had already met with comedic success, their previous most memorable television stint being on 'the late show,' the brilliant saturday night variety show which ran for two seasons from 1992-1993, and also featured fellow comedians mick molloy, tony martin, jason stephens and judith lucy."frontline" boasts an ensemble of colourful characters, each with their own distinct and quirky personality. the current-affairs show is headed by nicely-groomed mike moore (rob sitch), an ambitious, pretentious, dim-witted narcissist. mike works under the delusion that the show is serving a vital role for society ¬ñ he is always adamant that they "maintain their journalistic integrity" ¬ñ and his executive producers have excelled into getting him to believe just that. mike is basically a puppet to bring the news to the people; occasionally he gets the inkling that he is being led along by the nose, but usually this thought is stamped out via appeals to his vanity or promises of a promotion.brooke vandenberg (jane kennedy) is the senior female reporter on the show. she is constantly concerned about her looks and public profile, and, if the rumours are to be believed, she has had a romantic liaison with just about every male celebrity in existence. another equally amoral reporter, marty di stasio, is portrayed by tiriel mora, who memorably played inept solicitor dennis denuto in the australian comedy classic, 'the castle.' emma ward (alison whyte) is the line producer on the show, and the single shining beacon of morality on the "frontline" set. then there's the highly-amusing weatherman, geoffrey salter (santo cilauro), mike's best friend and confidant. geoff makes a living out of always agreeing with mike's opinion, and of laughing uproariously at his jokes before admitting that he doesn't get them.for each of the shows three seasons, we are treated to a different ep, executive producer. brian thompson (bruno lawrence), who unfortunately passed away in 1995, runs the programme during season 1. he has a decent set of morals, and is always civil to his employees, and yet is more-than-willing to cast these aside in favour of high ratings. sam murphy (kevin j. wilson) arrives on set in season 2, a hard-nosed, smooth-talking producer who knows exactly how to string mike along; the last episode of the second season, when mike finally gets the better of him, is a classic moment. graeme "prowsey" prowse (steve bisley), ep for the third season, is crude, unpleasant and unashamedly sexist. it's, therefore, remarkable that you eventually come to like him.with its cast of distinctive, exaggerated characters, "frontline" has a lot of fun satirising current-affairs programmes and their dubious methods for winning ratings. many of the episodes were shot quickly and cheaply, often implementing many plot ideas from recent real-life situations, but this never really detracts from the show's topicality ten years on. celebrity cameos come in abundance, with some of the most memorable appearances including pauline hanson, don burke and jon english. watch out for harry shearer's hilarious appearance in the season 2 episode "changing the face of current affairs," playing larry hadges, an american hired by the network to reform the show.particularly in the third season, i noticed that "frontline" boasted an extremely gritty form of black humour, uncharacteristic for such a light-hearted comedy show. genuinely funny moments are born from brooke being surreptitiously bribed into having an abortion, murder by a crazed gunman and mike treacherously betraying his best friend's hopes and dreams, only to be told that he is a good friend. the series' final minute ¬ñ minus an added-scene during the credits, which was probably added just in case a fourth season was to be produced ¬ñ was probably the greatest, blackest ending to a comedy series that i've yet seen.below is listed a very tentative list of my top five favourite "frontline" episodes, but, make no mistake, every single half-hour is absolutely hilarious and hard-hitting satire.1) "the siege" (season 1)2) "give 'em enough rope" (season 2)3) "addicted to fame" (season 3)4) "basic instincts" (season 2)5) "add sex and stir" (season 1)

the sad thing about frontline is that once you watch three or four episodes of it you really begin to understand that it is not far away from what happens in real life. what is really sad is that it also makes extremely funny.the frontline team in series one consists of brian thompson ( bruno lawrence )- a man who truly lives and dies merely by the ratings his show gets. occasionally his stunts to achieve these ratings see him run in with his line producer emma thompson ( alison whyte ); a woman who hasn't lost all her journalistic integrity and is prepared to defend moral scruples on occasions. the same cannot be said of reporter brooke vandenberg ( jane kennedy )- a reporter who has had all the substance sucked out of her- so much so that when interviewing ben elton she needs to be instructed to laugh. her reports usually consist of interviewing celebrities ( with whom she has or hasn't 'crossed paths' with before ) or scandalous unethical reports that usually backfire. martin de stasio ( tiriel mora ) is the reporter with whom the team relies on for gravitas and dignity, as he has the smarts of 21 years of journalism behind him. his doesn't have principles so much as a nous of what makes a good journalistic story, though he does draw the occasional line. parading over this chaos ( in name ) is mike moore ( rob sitch ) an egotistical, naive reporter who can't see that he's only a pretty face for the grubby journalism. he often finds his morals being compromised simply because brian appeals to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do the rest.frontline is the sort of show that there needs to be more of, because it shows that while in modern times happiness, safety and deep political insight are interesting things; it's much easier to rate with scandal, fear and tabloid celebrities.

this show came to canada via pbs in the mid 90s and i really, really loved it then. even 10 yrs later watching the various news networks, i cant help but think of the cynical manipulation that goes on in the name of ratings and the various "show ponies" we all see on tv as depicted in various frontline episodes. the scripts are tightly written and the actors all have impeccable comic timing and none of it is encumbered by an idiotic laugh track. there is a lot of funny material here really well executed and we don't need to be told when to laugh and what to laugh at. i don't understand why this show never took off in north america as its truly a gem! i was really excited to see the dvds available, even though they are pal format. i figured i would rip them to my computer and then watch the converted files. i took a chance and ordered it from abc¬Ö 6 to 8 weeks later, i had all 3 seasons. even better it worked on my ntsc dvd player. i suspect any player bought in the past 2 yrs that does xvid/divx will play them. great stuff! 10 yrs later the episodes all hold up really well! you don't need to know anything about australian politics to get the humor as it will all be familiar to western audiences. my wife and i had a 10 day frontline fest and are still chuckling weeks later after watching all 39 episodes

this is one of my favorite movies. the performances of rip torn and tantoo cardinal are excellent and their performances combined with the music, scenery and reality of the movie are quite compelling. a look at a true, tell it like it is, logging, mountain man who refuses to give up his way of life in the name of progress and development. the music of the horseflies is very unique and adds an eerie quality to some of the scenes. after seeing this movie for the first time, i had to go out and purchase the video and the soundtrack. overall, a quiet type of movie with bursts of panic. both torn and cardinal are very believable in their roles. i put this movie in the same category as winter people with kurt russell and kelly mcgillis, another favorite.

this is an incredibly compelling story, told with great simplicity and grace. the story itself is the object of the film, although the scenery is beautiful. the acting is understated, even superbly so, for the characters themselves come through in all of their eccentric simplicity.this piece of art will likely not be appreciated by those who view movies "casually", without due attention. it takes work to be brought into the story, but once you become involved the captivation is complete!

i was really surprised when i came across this movie on cable tv a couple of years ago. the story is a wonderful example of how our land keeps changing and the fight to hang on to it and use it according to need. conflicting desires of "the people" and the government. the actors were fantastic in their portrayals and i absolutely fell in love with tantoo cardinal-she is so believable and was such a character in this movie, as was rip torn. the story was also a love story about the land, the past, and between the 2 main characters. i have tried to buy this film and have been unable to locate it-but i would sure would love to own it.

this movie is certainly well-constructed, beginning and ending in the dark, with focus on lili smith /schmidt, julie andrews,initially the singing 'angel' later the notorious spy.it's beautiful! i saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently. while it was dismissed by critics in the 70's as overblown, 'cinema vulgaris', and lacking in structure (among others) time has proven them wrong. blake edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality.the film soars and swirls (aerial photography; julie andrews in motion) and captivates. one must just buy into the premise that julie andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong. overlooking the tepid chemistry between julie andrews and rock hudson, one must believe that these are lovers - who in all innocence fall for each other. and in the end, love is far more important than winning wars. and so is maintaining innocence.there is a lot of understated acting, and the film certainly reaches emotional depths often not seen in comedies.there are wonderful comedic elements (foreshadowing the french goons in victor/victoria), interesting diplomatic asides (reminding me of the tamarind seed, seen about 18 years ago) and a general sense of good-will.suspend all disbelief and this movie will carry you away. julie andrews' belting out of war songs and the haunting 'whistling away the dark' are reason enough to turn the tv on, just for the soundtrack. and the striptease number, like the 'jenny' number in star! works. this film has, like a good champagne, aged well. paramount should bring it to dvd as soon as possible. the same applies to transferring the laser disk of star! to dvd. these are both interesting pieces of julie andrews' meticulous and then underrated works.

i always loved this film. the music,story and the action. i especially love the opening and closing of the film. the music stayed with me throughout the years. the wwi plane battles were great and the comedy is typical blake edwards. slaptick is his forte' after all. julie's singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen. the sets and the scenes are wonderful. the characters are appealing. i loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and julie's singing to them. i wish she sang to me in vietnam. i also enjoyed the old cars from the period and the wwi music.i was glad when the dvd arrived. now i can whistle in the dark watching it again and again.

i liked house of dracula much more than house of frankenstein. carradine is much more passable & his acting isn't as ridiculous & overboard as in hof. the actors deliver solid enough performances. the subplots (eg the monster, the village mobsters, the village idiot, the hunchback nurse etc ) are mixed in well, so that none becomes an odd splinter as in hof. better run than the stitched-together hof. the hunchback nurse is as likable as the hunchback in hof. the doctor is very good. as well, lon chaney adds a classy touch with his wolfman. worth watching twice. a classic universal horror with that typical 1940's, long lost flair. especially good is the doctor's performance before/after his blood had been contaminated with dracula's.

house of dracula was made towards the end of universal's horror cycle of the 1940's and i've seen this a couple of times.a mad doctor, edelman is breeding plants for a serum that cures people. count dracula arrives for a cure for his vampirism and lawrence talbot then comes to see if he can cure him from turning into a werewolf at full moon. frankenstein's monster is then discovered and edelman brings him back to life just as the villagers descend on the castle and set it on fire. talbot, now cured and one of edelman's female assistants are safe though.like a lot of movies of its kind, we have a hunchback assistant and thunderstorm to keep it moving.the cast includes universal horror regulars lon chaney jr (the wolf man), john carradine (house of frankenstein) and glenn strange as frankenstein's monster. also starring onslow stevens (them!), lionel atwill (the vampire bat) and martha o'driscoll .house of dracula is a must see for all old horror fans out there. great fun.rating: 3 stars out of 5.

the "house of dracula" really has nothing new to offer in the way of chills or thrills or new twists on an already tired storyline. this film was made as a hasty sequel to the fairly better made "house of frankenstein" from a year earlier. in "house of dracula" you can see the factory like production values of 1945 taking their toll on an otherwise potentially scary movie. stock footage from previous films in the series and then the ending from "ghost of frankenstein" used as the ending here just makes for an "el cheepo" flick. therein lies the shame of the studio and the producer considering that they had top notch talent and merely wasted everybody's time and effort on a quick money return scheme. but that seems to have been the trend all throughout hollywood at the end of wwii. this is what brought on some of those mindless scifi pics of the 1950's with all their closeups of harmless lizards in order to make them appear as dinosaurs. the days of james whale and val lewton, to mention two, were over as far as creating real mood and atmosphere in this genre. keep in mind also that the makeup genius, jack pierce, who actually did medical research in order to create all of our favorites, was summarily fired right after this particular film was released. a lesser capable makeup man by the name of bud westmore was then hired as the head of this department at universal, soon to be universal-international. not to denigrate mr. westmore's ability but horror films were just not his forte. ok, to watch or not to watch. watch this film but only as part of the chronological order of the frankenstein series and you'll see how this all ended up as comic fodder for abbott & costello.

the last of the sequels,not counting abbott and costello meet frankenstein which was more or less a spoof.this time count dracula (john carridine)takes center stage seeking a cure for his vampirism from a kindly doc(onslow stevens).well good ole larry talbot(lon chaney jr)shows up also seeking a cure.the good doc succeeds in curing larry's werewolfism,but dracula tricks the doc and ends up contaminating his blood and makes the good doc a crazed lunatic.oh and all this time big franky(glenn strange)lies on a table awaiting his electricity fix so he can wreak some havoc.this was kind of a short movie,around 70 minutes and some change,but the action is there,and the great actors are there as well.lionel atwill turns up as a police inspector,heres some trivia,lionel atwill appeared in son of frankenstein,ghost of frankenstein,frankenstein meets the wolf-man,and house of frankenstein. and then this one.if there was another in the series they may have added the creature from the black lagoon to the line up,i'm giving house of dracula 8 out of 10.

dracula (john carradine) visits dr. edelman (onslow stevens) who believes everything can be cured by science. he wants edelamn to cure his vampirism--edelman agrees. then lawrence talbot (lon chaney jr.) pops up looking for a cure for his turning into a werewolf. thr frankenstein monster is discovered too but doesn't really do anything.very ambitious plot for a universal horror film from the 1940s. trying to cure the monsters by science is actually an interesting idea. also this movie has beautiful sets (love the castle to doctor lives in), tons of atmosphere, is very well-directed (great use of shadows) and has pretty good special effects.the acting is all good except for carradine--he tries but i could never accept him as dracula. also lionel atwill pops in playing (as always) the chief of police. this is pretty much forgotten and derided as a stupid film but i think it's very good. it's also to last time the universal monsters were done seriously--the next film was in 1948 in "abbott & costello meet frankenstein". it's a great film but the accent is more on comedy.the only real flaw here is there's a lot of plot for 67 minutes and some gaps in logic: why does dracula try to bite lovely miliza (martha o'driscoll) when he's being cured? and why (and how) does the doctor get frankenstin into his castle? still these are small complaints. recommended.

i would say to the foreign people who have seen this movie and who did not understand it that it is normal because it was based on massive plays on words. a person not knowing about the french cultural funny references in this film could not follow all the subtleties. the movie has been a huge success in france and all the actors are well renowned here.

this film is the smartest comedy i have ever seen, a lot of jokes are either a parody of another film, (from star wars to dragon ball to power rangers to kung fu etc..) or somehow related to history of whatever, (otis creates the elevator), a lot of jokes are also related to the modern world and made fun of because it was b.c. (like the wheels of the horse wagon spinning) other jokes are just plain total non-sense but also hilarious (like the famous scene, with the dog running after the roman guy with the little music) in fact in this movies they mix pretty much every kind of humor. i watched this film 6 times already and every single time i watch it i find other subtle jokes. (like the scene where waldo is part of the egyptian crowd). it is the funniest movie i have every seem, finally a laugh-out-loud comedy, that doesn't include toilet or sex humor. numerobis is also what makes the movie, everything that comes out of that guys mouth is hilarious. this movie is nearly perfect except a few clich√©d thing, like the fact that asterix gets his power back because he is kissed, that is plain stupid. but overall an excellent movie!! 9.5 out 10

after i read that ''at the time of its release in 2002, its budget of $47 million, or 327,000,000 frf, was said to make it the costliest french film ever. however, ast√©rix et ob√©lix contre c√©sar (1999) had a budget of $48 million, or 274,620,000 frf, which supposedly made it the most expensive french film ever'' i discovered the reason why i found this movie to be one of the most beautiful and colorful of all i have ever seen. i loved the scenarios,the clothes(specially the ones from cleopatra) and the atmosphere of the movie! it's so happy and cheerful! i found the jokes smart and hilarious and i have to consider this movie to be in my favorite comedies of all times!the cast is also excellent, with monica bellucci(who is very beautiful as cleopatra)g√©rard depardieu,(great obelix!!christian clavier, jamel debbouze(that i saw for the first time in ''am√©lie poulain'') among others!:)i recommend this movie even for people who doesn't know asterix and obelix comics. you are going to have a great amount of fun!:)aka "asterix e obelix: miss√£o cle√≥patra" - brazil

wow! the french are really getting the hang of it. if we look at their first asterix movie we see a good story with nice actors (especially thanks to gerard depardeu)but very lame special effect. in a fantasy story like asterix special effects are really important. well.. they did it right this time! it looks terrific. i personaly think mission cleopatra is the best asterix story ever written. in the movie there's not one moment you're bored. go and watch this! one thing! they didnt go exactly by the script which i think is a little bit pittyful. for example, in the comic obelix breaks the nose of the sphinx, immediatly all the little storekeepers start breaking of the nose of their miniature sphinx. (really funny to see)..well they didnt put it in the movie, instead they burried the nose under the sphinx. asterix: "they will never look for it here" (guess again). was funny but not as good as the original. another thing i disliked about the movie was their choice for music. it maked the film to childies. but never the less... it's a must c!grz da jean holland

i have to confess that i slept in the cinema while watching the first asterix movie... but this one is simply fantastic! it is really funny and it leaves the first one miles away. it has enumerous gags and funny situations that made me laugh since the first minutes of the movie and i only stopped laughing when i reached the car to return home. i repeat: this movie is spectacular... obelix is really funny and cleopatra is a real babe!!

i loved this film, the audience i was part of loved this film, and the little 7 year old girl who was with me loved this film. we all laughed at the puns, the visual humour, and the good feeling you left the cinema with when it ended. i could easily see why it was such a huge box-office success in france. i am planning on buying the dvd, so i can see it again and laugh at all the bits i missed as i was laughing so hard the first time.

i was lucky to see this sequel before the original because i'm not sure i would have gone out of my way to see it if the contrary had been true. i found "mission cl√©op√¢tre" better than it's predecessor for different reasons, but the major one is this : it was almost word for word an adaptation of one book not an amalgam like the first movie. the physical resemblance of some characters to their animated self were very funny especially the bad guy (who's name is escaping me, but he's the other architect). i don't know how this movie played in english; my first language is french so i didn't have that problem... i imagine some of the jokes weren't that easy to translate. i've learned something with years it's better to watch a movie with the subtitles than with the dubbing maybe you wont understand what is said, but you wont lose the rhythm and i think that's important too. i would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves "ast√©rix et ob√©lix".

making a movie about a comic is hard to do. making a good movie about a comic is extremely hard to do. making a good movie about asterix & obelix has been done.this movie shows that the french do know how to make an : a) funny , b) hilarious , c) beautiful , d) superb movie. the acting is no less than superb , the sunny feel to the whole movie is perfect .. a must see ! this just has to be the funniest thing to come out since we started the new millenium.. 10/10

this is definitely a "must see" film. the excellent director alain chabat (also acting as ceasar) has managed to capture the very essence of the "adventures of ast√©rix" (the french comic books it's based upon) and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy, which is also an homage to the world of animated films. this movie is so funny, so full of jokes (both visual and spoken) that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all, between your bursts of laughter. the only drawback is that a non-french audience (or at least a non-french speaking audience) might not get all the "private jokes". there are so many dialogues impossible to translate, so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the french way of life, that the fun might be lessened. however, it's still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture, the amazing stunts, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting. all actors are great, but the film would not be the same without jamel debouze, g√©rard darmon and edouard baer. and please don't ever compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books : "ast√©rix et ob√©lix contre c√©sar" and directed by claude zidi.

for those not in the know, the asterix books are a hugely successful series of comic books about a village of indomitable gauls who resist caesar's invasion thanks to a magic potion that renders them invulnerable supermen. there have been several animated features (only one of them, the twelve tasks of asterix really capturing the wit and spirit of the books despite being an original screen story) before a perfectly cast christian clavier and gerard depardieu took the lead roles in two live action adaptations that proved colossally successful throughout europe but made no impression whatsoever in the english-speaking world. the uncut french version is great fun, but sadly does not appear to be available in a version with english subtitles outside of the uk dvd. while there's still no sign of a us theatrical or dvd release, the miramax version of asterix et obelix: mission cleopatre is also on that dvd (and has played on uk tv), and you'll never guess what - it's been completely re-edited (at least 21 minutes gone) and dubbed into english. maybe harve mistook it for a hong kong movie - after all, he never saw a foreign film he didn't think couldn't be improved by heavy re-editing and shelving for a few years.whereas asterix et obelix contre cesar was lovingly dubbed into english from a particularly good translation script by terry jones but otherwise left unaltered, that sort of thing really isn't the miramax way. the results ain't good. the film was the best attempt to get the books mixture of slapstick, anachronisms and highbrow classical humorous asides to the screen, but a lot of the classical references are gone (such as the great raft of the medusa sight gag or the cyrano de bergerac references from depardieu), alongside anything that seems too french or might slow the picture down, with the result that the first 20 minutes are now a real slog. several punchlines to sequences are missing, depardieu's part has been trimmed (his part was already fairly small because of his serious health problems during the shoot: the us version has been partially digitally regraded to change the unhealthy pallor of his face in the original!), and as usual with dubbing, because literal translations into english don't fit properly, lines are either rushed so much they're not funny anymore or the dialogue has been changed completely (a couple of these changes are admittedly funny, like one character dreaming of a world in which he could move his lips in french and hear the words in english).not a total disaster, but very disappointing considering how good the full-length version is. it would be nice to think that miramax would do a shaolin soccer and release both versions, but since they've shelved both films for two years since paying $45m for them (another classic case of harvey's notorious chronic buyer's remorse: gee, wonder why disney were so p****d at their overspending) and still have no release plans, that may just be too much wishful thinking.it's a real pity that such an accessible and entertaining film will now only be available to non-french speakers in such a clumsily bowdlerised version. it seems the plucky gauls may have been able to defeat caesar's legions but are no match for the miramax jackboot.

not for everyone, but i really like it. nice ensemble cast, with nice contributions from better known players (like stockard channing) and strong eye candy (from sheila kelley). what really works is the bond between the three brothers! try it, you'll smile a little.

it's the story of three brothers pulling together in the midst of hardship and loss, and learning that the really important things in life are family, love, trust, and forgiveness. the entire cast manages to pull in a powerful performance despite a few lousy one-liners. a great film for fans of true to life problems befalling believable families. also worth a look for fans of dermot mulroney or sean astin. they both do an astounding job, often bringing you to tears. take my word for it and rent this today!

if you've never been "tromatized", this is the troma movie to see first. amazing acting, supercharged soundtrack, and bust-a-gut humor blend perfectly with troma's unique brand of storytelling and special effects. despite straying from a word for word retelling of romeo and juliet, the fact that it stays in iambic pentameter gives you the odd feeling that it's closer to shakespeare than that overdone music video with dicaprio and danes. i assumed i'd seen the ultimate shakespearian comedy when the cast of moonlighting overhauled the taming of the shrew, but nothing comes close to tromeo and juliet. i strongly recommend the dvd version, which contains a second audio track with director lloyd kaufman which is just as entertaining as the main track.

can this really be a troma movie? some scenes almost have an "a" movie look. the acting is generally competent (the two leads and the nurse-surrogate were especially good, and i liked some of the confrontations between the young capulets and ques); the scenes were smoothly edited; the plot is coherent. it's funny. it has a hip, original sound track.it does have the usual troma gross-outs and low humor, but i don't think shakespeare would have minded so much. in fact, i think he might have gotten a few good laughs out of this.it's a good dvd. there is an alternate sound track with a very informative commentary by the director, several deleted scenes, and the usual collection of troma self-deprecating silliness.i'm not going to tell you this was citizen kane, but it is some pretty inspired low-budget filmmaking.

these guys combine low-brow with low-budget. it's glorious.look- if you want bergman, rent "7th seal" or something. if you want to see gross-out humor and exploitation sex, this is the one.i think jane jensen as julia makes it all watchable. she can actually act (really well), she's a complete dreamboat, and she doesn't seem to feel above it all.

superb! even the author was laughing at the end. and what a "balcony" scene! this film has it all. wickedly funny and yet strangely faithful to the bard of avon. (but not for the faint of heart!) and... the best credits since monty python and the holy grail! i am "troma"tized!

i think it was fran√ßois truffaut who said that the best movies either involve the joy of making movies, or the agony of making movies. this flick is definitely of the first type. tromeo and juliet is a pleasure to watch from start to finish. the zany zeal fuelling this shakespearian shenanigan is infective. i don't think i've laughed so hard since i saw monty python and the holy grail. it's that good!

this was the best movie ever has seen on "germen's cine club" (buenos aires) this movie is a realistic critic of the society of the past and the next century. it cause a very good impression to all the partners of "germen's cine club". i recommend this movie to all the fans of troma and to all the people who like the good movies, not the commercial movies.

this movie is amazing. it is funny, sexy, violent and sick, but it all holds together for a brilliant troma rendition of romeo and juliet. if you don't mind being grossed out a bit (ok a lot, but it's funny grossed out), see this movie. it's worth it!there's not one level on which it doesn't deliver. i've seen it thrice now, and it is still amazing. i recommend it. go! get it!

i found it real shocking at first to see william shakespeare's love masterpiece reworked into a gory, violent and kinky sensual movie adaptation. but after you watched it once, it sort of grows on you when you watch it the second and third times, as you come over the shock and start appreciating the movie on its own merits - solid acting, good dialogue, nice sequencing and choreography, not-too-bad soundtrack and some of the (special) effects that go on. oh, and also the ending. what a riot!

this film is a brilliant retelling of shakespeare's classic love story, complete with "kinky sex, body piercing, and dismemberment". it does follow the same spirit as all the other troma movies [except combat shock...that sucker was depressing] but it's not only for troma fans. anybody who appreciates lowbrow visuals and a hilarious script will without a doubt fall in love with this movie.don't expect pretentious, artistic-wannabe crap like the version of r&j with claire danes and leo dicaprio; this one knows its a silly movie and draws its humor from that. the acting is also surprisingly good, and you can just feel sammy capulet's pain as he tries to put his brain back into his head.the soundtrack, which contains many original and high-energy bands like the wesley willis fiasco, supernova, and the meatmen is also four-star. this movie should be viewed by all, because it remains faithful to the original story while still being jam-packed with troma's trademark gore/sex humor.

what can i say about tromeo and juliet, other than if you like twisted troma machinations, then you must see this movie! this is my absolute favorite troma flick, and i have seen almost all of them! penis monsters, cecsarian births to live rats and popcorn, lesbianism, steamy sex scenes in plexiglass boxes, incest, nipple piercing, dismemberment, shameless troma plugs, and computer masturbation...how can one go wrong? it amazingly follows the original story very closely. you must see this movie!!!! oh, and speaking of shameless plugs...check out jane jensen's "comic book whore" cd on interscope records. it is awesome!

i don't think the world was ready for this film. i know i wasn't. i'd been expected a standard low-budget schlock exploitation potboiler. instead, i got the most intelligent reworking of shakespeare since peter greenaway's "prospero's books". this should become the definitive film version of romeo and juliet. it won't of course. but that's the world's loss.

this movie is a absolute masterpiece!, 'tromeo and juliet' has all the kinky sex, car crashes, mutations and a penis monster that shakespeare always wanted but never got! this is shakespeares classic retold, troma style! tromeo and juliet is about two rival familys named; the que's and the capulet's, non of the familys ever got along ever since cappy capulet (juliet's father) screwed monty que (tromeo's father) in the filmmaking business. two rival familys grow apart, until tromeo and juliet find true love together and when each side hear of this..blood shed is the least that happens!..yes! tromeo and juliet is the troma classic adored by fans world wide! witness harry balls (the penis monster) first feature film! and also has lemmy's first troma appearance...what are you waiting for?? now go out and rent the movie!! 10/10

one of the more interesting films i've seen. lord montague isblack, lord capulet is in charge of the porn industry that washanded down to him by montague, not to mention the dismemberment of fingers, the squishing of heads, etc. etc. another troma hit, this beats the toxic avenger. this is by far myfavorite troma flick... and there's a priest who fights like bruce lee. nothing can beatthat. -joefro

romeo and juliet had been interpreted in so many ways, but very few of the versions captured the essance of the play. the ony ones i can think of that really nail the romance's spirit were west side story and, beleive it or not, troma film's tromeo and juliet. at first glance, this is another mere splatterfest, and many would think it bastardizes the shakespearian classic. however, the film has an honest feel about it. updated to appeal to the sick-minded youth of today, of course, but not without merit. yes, the frequent dismemberments, body piercings, car crashes, lesbian sex scenes, masturbation and incest are in bad taste, but what's the harm when you have such a sweet love story as the foundation? as bad as most of the acting in this film is (i mean, it is troma, after all), the two leads have some genuine chemistry, more so than in big-budget monstrosities titanic and star wars episode two. there's a great deal of modernization, but much of the original text is in tact, especially when tromeo and juliet are together. there's a great scene where juliet utters the famous, "parting is such sweet sorrow," and tromeo quickly follows, in mid-nineties grunge fashion, "yeah, it totally sucks." i think it's truly unfortunate that this film isn't going to get the recognition or the wide release that it deserves. i hop that people who see this on the video store shelves won't be turned off by the grossmess in the movie, because they'd be missing out on quite a subversive expereience.

tromeo and juliet is perhaps the best shakespeare modernization i have ever seen, not that there's much competition, but anyway...all in all, tromeo and juliet is definitely one of troma's better movies, one of the little pearls hidden in a towering heap of dung. it's a funny, action-packed, gory take on the world's greatest love story, but still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as one can except from this kind of movie. well, except for the ending, where tromeo and juliet kill juliet's abusive father, and live happily together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their hideously mutated children.this is the movie high school literature classes should show instead of making poor students read through hundreds and hundreds of pages of shakespeare's scripts. thumbs up!

this would definitely not have been my kind of movie, but my husband saw it on tv and said it was really good. so, on his recommendation, i bought a copy, since i didn't know if it would ever be on tv again. i had never heard of anybody in it except armand assante. at first i had a hard time getting into the story, because the first part of the movie is a jumble of images-- and it doesn't make much sense. it is only later in the movie that it all comes together. the scene-cutting- if that's what it's called, is a bit jarring-- it sometimes looks as if a few frames have been cut out of each scene, and the scenes are jerky--but i guess that was done to add to the unusualness (if that's a word). the story veers here and there, and just about the time you have it all figured out, everything turns upside down and you have to readjust your thinking as to who is the bad guy and who is not. or bad woman. the acting is very good-- i kept thinking how much norman reedus looks like leo decaprio. the ending was a real twist, totally unexpected, which i liked. a good show.

we stumbled across this show one sunday morning at 6:30 a.m. while flipping through all of the cable channels and this turned out to be best show on! it is absolutely adorable. we need shows like this for children (and adults, as i'm certainly way beyond my childhood years.) as one of the other commentaries pointed out, this show benefits from the simplicity of the characters and story lines. the puppets are fantastically cute, the backgrounds are colorful and even though they are created out of cardboard, foam, paint, and pure imagination, they remind us of our own childhoods, when we could spend the day at our own grandma's house, exploring the world around us. for those who never were lucky to have a grandma as nice as nana, this show is for you, you'll make up for lost time! this show is a true inspiration and filled with cleverness and humor and just outright fun, for children and adults alike. in other words, don't overlook this show, just because you're over the age of three! spend a half hour with mona, nana, mr. wooka, and russell, they'll be friends you look forward to seeing!

my girls 4 and 6 love this show. we stumbled across it on a pbs station and they always ask when its on now. it reminds them of their grandma that takes care of them everyday in the summer. its funny too and sometimes they can't stopped talking about one scene or another. i would definitely recommend this show to all young kids. it is very clean and shows you to slow down and its not about watching tv all day long. when nana reads a story it is slow and she talks about each page with mona. it reminds me to slow down when i read the next book to my girls at bedtime and talk about the book instead of going through it quickly just to get them to sleep.

i ended up liking this movie but it was not the easiest to get through. what makes the movie great is the music and the scenery. the songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented. a great job was done to show different settings for the rom people.however, the viewer was not guided enough. a more in depth history of the rom people would have been nice. only a fraction of the of the spoken words were given english subtitles. in addition, more explanations about the settings and who was their and some of their challenges would have been appreciated too. it would have helped if there were a narrator too explain about customs, dress and music.

beautifully filmed, mind expanding exploration of gypsy culture in the context of their music. travel across a continent, experiencing the amazing musical styles of various groups of gypsy peoples. it is sort of misleading to say this movie is not narrated. it is masterfully narrated by the music itself, the soaring melodies and subtititled lyrics tell a story much better than a narrator would have. see this film.

hercules' son gets severely wounded during a lion hunt that goes awry. hercules (a solid and engaging performance by the beefy reg park) has to venture into an eerie and dangerous alternate dimension ruled by the evil and vengeful gia the earth goddess (a deliciously wicked portrayal by gia sandri) and battle various monsters in order to save his son's soul. meanwhile, gia's equally nasty son antaius (a perfectly hateful turn by giovanni cianfriglia) poses as hercules and takes over an entire city as a cruel and ruthless tyrant. director maurizo lucidi relates the engrossing story at a steady pace and maintains a serious tone throughout. this film begins a little slow, but really starts cooking once hercules enters the misty and perilous subterranean spirit world: rousing highlights include hercules grappling with a humanoid lizard beast, hercules climbing a giant gnarled tree, and hercules being attacked by a bunch of creepy rotting zombies. better still, the bizarre spirit world just reeks of spooky atmosphere (gotta love that persistent thick swirling fog!). the strenuous rough'n'tumble mano-a-mano major physical confrontation between hercules and antaius likewise totally rocks. of course, we also get a big mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption as well. allvaro mancori's crisp widescreen cinematography gives the movie an impressively expansive sense of scope. ugo filippini's robust, rousing score has a nifty majestic sweep to it. okay, so this flick is an obvious cheapo cute'n'paste job that uses copious footage from both "hercules in the haunted world" and "hercules and the captive women," but it's still an extremely lively and entertaining romp all the same.

there are several ways to misunderstand this movie and a couple of them have been shown in some of the past comments. this is a movie to be analyzed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not to be compared with the opera, the book or other carmen movies seen before. it just stands for itself and i must say that this carmen does it very well. it is a mistake to compare because that is the first step to deny movies the chance to be autonomous creative works of art. vicente aranda is a master of atmosphere and the art direction, the costumes and the photography are extremely well put together to achieve a pleasing aesthetic experience. let's take it as it is.and that brings us to the next misunderstanding. someone complains about the typical spanish clich√©s in the movie. well, historically the movie is extremely well researched and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene. it is not only an accurate portrait of the "black spain" of knife and espadrille that goya portrayed so vividly, but it's also of that part of history as seen by a foreigner fascinated with the folkloric side of that society. honestly, anyone who doesn't want to see any clich√© about spain shouldn't buy a ticket to see carmen, but in this case those clich√©s are presented before they became one and the way to see them is getting rid of our own prejudices.another important requirement to understand this movie properly is to speak the language. it is not acceptable to criticize any actor performance for not having understood his or her lines. if all the rest of the audience did, the problem most likely lies somewhere else. paz vega has an immaculate diction with her andalusian accent and all she says is understandable and credible. her argentinian partner, leonardo sbaraglia, gives also a convincing portrait of the basque officer that became a "bandolero", and her accent is very well learned.no less important is to have a minimally open approach to the material. to say that paz vega is "horrible" suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons. we already had in spain a critic in one of the most prestigious papers that used to recommend us pictures he found homosexually arousing, without mentioning it explicitly. and that was not totally fair for the rest of us, especially for the ones that hadn't detected that the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers didn't necessarily had to care for. i'm not suggesting at all that the reviewer had the same motivation, but the expectations must have been different as the ones of those among us that went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role, because that's what we got. paz vega is carmen, and an excellent one, in vicente aranda's movie.

excellent movie in many aspects. vicente aranda has succeeded in depicting the time (1830) with meticulous care. the light, the places, the feeling, are perfectly perceived from the very start of the movie. and along with it -in opposite to what happened to "mad love" (juana la loca), a rather episodic historical movie- all of this beautiful photography/ music/ clothes is wrapping a very fluid screenplay that reaches its climax in the only possible way.concerning the actors, paz vega as carmen is outstanding: liar, seductive, agressive, totally sexual, so beautiful carmen. sbaraglia is a little less convincing the audience about his instant mad love for carmen, but he succeeds in conveying the proper tragic mood to the whole movie. i recommend it to everyone: the best spanish movie of the year.

i really liked this film - not so much for the story (which was okay, but was a bit slow-moving in spots) but moreso for the incredibly beautiful scenery of greece and the greek isles! susan sarandon is utterly engaging as the carefree love interest of john cassavetes - a man "on the edge". but the scenery! oh oh oh!

an extremely gentle retelling of the shakespeare play (and much more overt about it than forbidden planet). cassavetes is always a joy to watch, and even more so with gena rowlands sharing the spotlight. his take on the prospero role is well suited for the sort of craggy all-knowing expression he brings to the story. this especially comes to the forefront in a scene when, upon spotting his estranged wife and her lover in a speedboat, he conjures up a storm (accompanied on the soundtrack by an appropriate selection from stomu yamashta's "go"). this is only one of the moments throughout the film where the line between reality and fantasy becomes nicely blurred, and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more possible than one might believe. add to this an excellent performance by raul julia, plus good work by susan sarandon, vittorio gassman and molly ringwald, and the film becomes a nice little treat to occupy the space behind your eyes.

just lovely. it is long. no climax. don't wait for anything to happen. great for a rainy day. about a man in a mid life crisis who takes his family to a secluded area of the greek isles. i saw this in my teens and still love it 20+ years later. i have been unable to find it in video stores however. molly ringwald is a cute average teenager who basically wants to go home and then kind of settles into the place. there are no phones, no tv, boredom, which when hit with quietness like that, the human condition is to be bored and then to reflect. and each character does so. susan sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually involved with john cassavetes' character, but he is unable to, well, you know. gina rowlands, is the wife that loves him but is just about to give up on their marriage. he is demanding and frustrating to everyone. there is another character in the movie, a greek who talks to molly ringwald inappropriately about sex, but things that she is curious about. but he is irritating and horny and i didn't like this character. the locale of the film is what makes this film so so good. it wouldn't work if filmed anywhere else. i recommend this film and give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.

i saw this film much like skywalker02 did, but when i could manage to see it again and with formal film training, psychology, and life has had the time to really take me by the hand and start beating me about,..i really click with the film. i remember the pay for service cable channels played this thing almost to death, much like poltergeist when it first came out, and many other popular films. i felt back then it wasn't worth the fuss and constant "airtime" (i know cable isn't really on air) given it, but i was very young and adult situation drama wouldn't have and shouldn't have worked. however, recent viewing of the film has enlightened me on the film. i think that susan surandon and molly ringwald were likely studying the script together, and i would be a bit surprised if surandon had coached ringwald during this project. ringwald's other projects, while good, do not have her exhibiting the potential depth as this role. surandon nailed hers, as raul julia did also. cassavettes and wife delivered acceptable performances, but i will admit at times first class acting turns to mediocre. a steady ebb and flow to the acting does take place during many scenes, but overall i can see why the story might call for the dynamic to become more subtle.all in all, i don't find this film to be the "take me out and drown me" kind of boredom fest as skywalker02 would have you believe. i think that perhaps with the right psychological training and a bit more hardship in one's domestic life strategically placed, coupled with some film courses perhaps this film would appear different. i would say if you are feeling a bit melancholy and yearn for a simpler life, and you have had your share of marital discord amongst dysfunctional family units, then perhaps this film might provide more insight and entertainment than you might think. i do feel it is a classic and find it much more entertaining than mainstream films that are supposed to share many of the same elements, such as terms of endearment which as far as i am concerned could be stripped of a few extraordinary performances by jack nicholson, then ceremoniously burned until nothing is left. (how could a film like that get more attention than this one. talk about boredom.)best thing, don't take my word or anyone else's, see the film and support our industry.

i just cannot believe the low scores for this movie. probable reason has to do with the low number of votes meaning few people have seen it. this is simply a fantastic movie! there are so many stories inter-wined within but it's not complicated. each character grows with the movie and we experience with them undergoing life changes. the scenery is simply amazing and the end credits are the best ever in any movie i have seen (just like a shakespeare play). yes, it's a little dated (filmed in 1982) but the issues the characters face are very current. it could have been filmed in 2002 without modifications to the story line. raul julia is amazing, best role ever in a movie - this is his signature piece. a young molly ringwald is excellent as she matures from girl to young woman. susan sarandon is perfect as a young carefree woman and john cassavetes is the force that puts this all together. do yourself a favor, find this movie, view it & enjoy it. come back to imdb and score this movie into the top 250 of all time where it really belongs.

paul mazursky's tempest - interesting,odd and strange movie about a mid-life crisis.set in nyc and a remote greek island with john cassavettes as world renowned architect who decides to drop out.he is accompanied by his daughter(molly ringwald) and a lounge singer(susan sarandon).a beautiful transfer of this 25 year old movie on the dvd- but without any extras-not even the theatrical trailer.tons of great scenery and razor-sharp dialogue make this 2 and a half hour movie an interesting trip.raul julia and gena rowlands round out a strong cast.a good drama mixed with comedy and tension and near insanity.this recent dvd release is worth renting. b+

william shakespeare probably didn't envision stephanos as a gay doctor, antonio as a faithless wife, or caliban as a goatherd with a trinitron, but the bard's had worse done to his good work over time, and might even enjoy the sumptuous pageant of life that is his "tempest" as re-configured by paul mazursky and co-writer leon capetanos.this time, prospero is philip dimitrius (john cassevetes), a manhattan-based architect tired of designing atlantic city casinos for the amiable mafioso alonso (vittorio gassman), especially after discovering alonso is carrying on an affair with philip's wife antonia (gena rowlands). along with daughter miranda (molly ringwald), philip escapes to a remote greek island with miranda and his new mistress aretha (susan sarandon), a nice catholic girl who struggles with philip's celibate lifestyle. will a sudden storm bring all right in the end?here's a thought on the career of cassevetes: how many other actors could make a film so confused into something so riveting? a darling of film critics for his earlier work, often with his real-life wife rowlands, he presents a central character who really suffers for his art here, but seems to enjoy himself and makes us enjoy him, too. it's not prospero, but something rich and strange that makes for a terrific sea change all his own."it's all here," he tells one of his faithful companions, aretha's dog nino. "beauty, magic, inspiration, and serenity." that it is. "tempest" transfers 1611 london to 1982 manhattan and finds some nice resonances in philip's displaced life. "show me the magic", he calls out to a storm-tossed city skyscape, and mazursky's version, augmented by donald mcalpine's sterling cinematography of purple seascapes and naturally sun-burnished greek landscapes, does just that.it's not a perfect movie, by any means. in fact, the big finale, which is the only part of the movie that follows shakespeare's storyline to any faithful extent, is a mess. rowland's character is hard to care much for in this film, and after meeting sarandon in all her braless glory, it's hard to understand philip's continuing concern for his wife, let alone his left-field desire to make an unhappy "sacrifice" in order to restore the natural order of things.but there's a lot to love about "tempest". in addition to cassavetes, there's ringwald's film debut as his loyal but restless daughter, here as in the play an object of desire for the primitive rustic "kalibanos" (raul julia). ringwald here is very much the same teenaged muse of privileged adolescence that would inspire john hughes, but with an emotional depth those later hughes films didn't delve into. ringwald and julia never got any oscar attention, but they both would win golden globes for their playful work here. he tries to woo her in her island isolation with his tv reruns of "gunsmoke" in greek, tempted by her 15-year-old body."i want to balonga you with my bonny johnny," kalibanos declares, getting shoved aside but winning our sympathy anyway, especially after performing "new york, new york" with a chorus of goats. (when "tempest" hit the screens, julia was the toast of broadway as the lead in "nine".)it's mazursky's show, even if it feels at times that cassavetes is running things with improvisational line readings and emotional breakdowns galore. (philip introduces himself to aretha by telling her "i'm right in the middle of a nervous breakdown".) he plays his character as an amiable obsessive, seeking to crystallize his happiness by building an theater in his otherwise uninhabited island.adding to the enjoyment is gassman's rich performance as the other man, who is as completely amiable as julia while telling a youth-obsessed philip: "boys don't have half as much fund as we have. they're nervous...and they make love in the back of an old sports car." despite being overlong and pretentious in spots, like so many art films, "tempest" is entertaining in its excesses and a trip very much like shakespeare intended, even if his dreams didn't involve smoking pot backstage at a go-gos concert.

cheers to all the wonderful fans of this film that have not only seen and appreciate it, but (based on the many literate comments) actually get it! i for one have always considered paul mazursky's "tempest" a musing on the shakespeare play of the same name, as has been noted in a few of the other reviews here. on the other hand, if you're looking for a more straightforward adaptation of the play, you should look elsewhere. as an experiment, however, it succeeds just spectacularly. charming, moving, funny, sad, dramatic ... it's all of that and much more. cast, locations, script, music are just fantastic. cassavetes and rowland were never better. susan sarandon's turn more than hinted at the great work to come from her in the future. molly ringwald makes her film debut memorable and you just have to love raul julia's performance ... he steals the show in several scenes. what's more, the always great cassavetes was confident and assured enough a performer to have let him! a study on what the thematic elements of shakespeare's classic might be life if updated into more "modern times," mazursky's "tempest" burns brilliantly!

i love this movie despite the fact it just misses being great. it's an adult entertainment, full of issues that a grown person can relate to. the acting is superb. it's fun watching john cassavetes and gena rowlands as a feuding middle-aged couple. who knows how much of it came from their own marriage? susan sarandon has never been sexier or more appealing than as her freewheeling character, aretha. raul julia is a hoot as a lusty goatherd. the scenery in greece is spectacular; the new york settings cause me to squirm due to many shots of the world trade center. fantastic score by stomu yamashta. with so many things going for it, why isn't this a great film? it's a bit rambling and overly long, unfocused, and uncomfortably imbalanced between humor and drama. still, it's engaging, entertaining, and deeply thoughtful.

what will be prospero in the twentieth century, what is his life? why a man would need to choose to live on an island with his daughter and girl friend? because it is too hard to live and love in good conditions in "civilisation". this man (john cassavetes) is a broken hearted giant, he can command the storm. he's got the power, the strengh but he is human. deep love of life is the subject of this extraordenary movie. the acting is incredible, all the genius of john cassavetes, gena rowlands, vittorio gasman and shakespeare and paul mazursky of course. don't miss it it'll be a mistake this film is one of the most beautiful i've ever seen.and i've seen a lot of movies.

i've often heard people express disappointment that mazursky's "tempest" has little to do with shakespeare's original. in my opinion, that is both true and false, but most of all, it's a bad starting point for offering critique. a work of art should never be criticised for what it isn't, but for what it is. the movie "tempest" is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play, but to my mind, it is faithful to shakespeare's work in spirit. what "tempest" is, then, is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time. no, not experimental as in hand- held camera and mumbled dialogue, but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story without undue regard for box office earnings. mazursky's tempest is epic, sad, realistic, joyous, full of life, but most of all, it is imaginative. cassavetes portrayal of philip/prospero is in itself worth a 10/10 rating, and when you add gena rowlands, susan sarandon, a wonderfully deep molly ringwald, raul julia, the dialogue, the music and the exquisitely suggestive little tableaux scattered throughout the picture... i rest my case. one of the best movies of the 80's. don't miss it.

i love this movie and all aspects of it, well directed as a comedy and as a drama. the acting is tremendous, performed by an all-star cast who play the high society new york perfectly. the scenery is incredible, totally breathtaking. i also love the story: a successful nyc architect who is going through a midlife crisis leaves his cheating wife and runs off to a greek island to hide out with his daughter who chooses to go with him.i just cannot express my love affair enough regarding this movie. "show me the magic".

i can't say what knowing the source for this movie adds, but this is one of my favorite films from paul mazursky (director and co-author). this is a retake on the shakespeare "comedy", but utterly removed from the stage. without much text, mazursky and star cassavettes make visual a mid-life crisis of passion and purpose. desperate to re-center himself, cassavettes retreats to a remote greek island--where the locals and the island itself weave a little magic. with raul julia especially, susan sarandon and molly ringwald, this is an adult fantasy that is emotionally satisfying and visually gorgeous. and funny. it wasn't a big box office hit, but whenever it does come to dvd, it will sell.

very rarely it happens that i sit down to write a comment for a movie....but this movie!!!!!!oh my holy god!!!!!!!!never ever was there a hindi movie better than this......and never ever there came a movie better than this......it's the king of all comedies.....aamir khan is arguably the best comic actor in indian film industry...though its funny to say that because he is a class act,not a comedian...but what he has done in this film is perhaps the most hilarious performance by any indian actor in an out and out comedy...salman khan has never been a good actor in my eyes....but this movie got the best out of him....he was innocently comic...if ever there was a term like it....just what the doctor ordered as far as his role in the movie was concerned...rajkumar santoshi i don't know why, never tried his hand at comedy again....he directed great ventures like the legend of bhagat singh and khakee but could not recreate the magic of andaz apna apna....i don't care why this film bombed at the box office....though i feel sad that a film like "hum aapke hain kaun" was the reason for it's failure...... as of now i hope the rumors become true.....there'll be "andaz apna apna-2" they say.......we as the audience can only say amen!!!!!

the summary is only for those who hate this movie, as finding the movie ok or average is acceptable. visiting this movie on imdb has made me nostalgic as i can't help myself going back in the year 1994. i was one of the few lucky ones who saw this movie in theaters. it instantly became one of my favourite comedies and took some years to make it my favourite. how can i say what made this movie my favourite? was it the excellent writing ( story was ok but screenplay and dialogues were fabulous) was it the superlative performances? was it the mood of the film?after thinking about it for so many years i say it has to be a mixture. it is one of those movies which didn't have any flaws not even its music.(the other movie coming up in my mind right now is sholay)ps: rajkumar santoshi please keep a balance between your drama and comedy movies. only 1 comedy is not enough. i want moreeeeeeee..........

well this is the best comedy movie i have ever seen... my both favorite actors did good job. salman khan and aamir khan rocked. hope to see andaz apna apna part 2 soon as i heard they will come back with part 2 as well. i have request to those who haven't watched it yet. please buy dvd and watch it u wont feel bored. i am watching this movie 1 times a week. all other was also good in this movie. paresh rawal, shakti and others the music is also good it have also nice songs. there are some sense which will kill u from laughing salman khan did very nice role and also aamir.so must watch movie excellent job by actors and director..

according to me, a movie can be best rated by the number of 'best scenes' there are. there are probably at least 80-90 scenes in the whole movie that is probably rated as 'best' by somebody or the other.this movie is a masterpiece. period. i know many who have called it ahead of its time, probably because it bombed at box-office. however, i think any generation can relate to this movie and have a good laugh through out.i am personally glad that mahmood is part of the movie too. his role isn't that 'meaty', however its good to see that he is a part of the cast in the funniest hindi movie ever.

along with cops, the goat is one of keaton's two funniest shorts. which makes it one of the best shorts ever made. this has an decent "plot" for a short, and it forms a perfect line on which to hang some great gags. keaton is mistaken for an escaped convict (how the mistake happens is a classic) and then must elude the authorities. best gags - the bread line and t he "elevator".

i hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem, except to say that it represents young buster keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the half-dozen best short comedies ever made. the goat is twenty minutes of smoothly paced, expertly photographed, beautifully executed gags; two reels of non-stop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending -- which wasn't always the way with buster's comedies. (see cops for one case where fatalism ultimately got the better of him, or one week for the victory of defeatism.) if i had to describe this film in one word i'd call it "effortless," but if i were permitted two i'd call it "seemingly effortless," for surely a lot of hard labor goes into the making of any comic opus that unfolds with such sublime ease. still, they didn't call him the great stone face for nothing: buster never let the public see him sweat.a sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is set "along millionaires' row," i.e. on a bread line in a grim urban setting, where buster waits patiently at the back of the line and, as a result, doesn't get fed. but it needs to be emphasized that not for one moment does he play for pathos; buster has our sympathy, but he never asks for it. before long, through a series of accidents, coincidences and absurd misunderstandings, buster is believed to be an escaped killer named dead shot dan and is being pursued by every cop for miles around, and yet while he's clearly dismayed by this turn of events there is never a hint of self-pity or even surprise; we get the sense he always knew that this is what life would have in store for him, and that he hasn't time to feel sorry for himself anyway, he has to figure out new ways to dodge those cops and escape from the latest trap.just as buster refrains from playing for sympathy he never seems to strain for laughs either, which is especially impressive because the goat must be one of the most laugh-packed short comedies in existence. this is the film that features that iconic shot of buster riding a train's cow-catcher right up to the very lens of the camera, which isn't a gag exactly but sure is laugh-provoking in its own strange way. meanwhile, there are gags involving guns, dogs, cops, an incredibly furry mustache, and a clay statue of a horse that melts under buster's weight (a surreal sight indeed), but some of the biggest boffos are saved for the finale when buster is trying to elude his primary nemesis, big joe roberts, a rotund cop who also happens to be the father of leading lady virginia fox. trapped in big joe's dining room, buster leap-frogs over him and sails through a transom, turns a phone-booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear, and eventually uses the elevator itself to rid himself of his pursuer and win the girl in time for one last fade-out gag.to say more would be a disservice to first-time viewers. i only wish i could see this film in a theater full of people who'd never seen it before, and float on the laughter. live musical accompaniment would be nice too; and incidentally the musical score supplied by kino for their home video/dvd version of the goat is first-rate, serving as icing on an already tasty cake.

ok i am a huge traci fan so her just being in the movie automatically makes it rank at the 8.5+ rating. but even besides her being in it i thought it was a good movie especially for it being an hbo movie. but i am afraid if you take traci out of the movie it would just be ok. but a person can't do that she is in it and she is a wonderful actress. she just keeps getting better and better.

if you like shoot em up westerns this is a keeper. i thought that the movie was fun to watch and to see folks that i have not seen in a while. i am no expert but i liked the acting. the town and props etc seemed to fit the period and kind of town that you would find out on the frontier. this is not an a western, not enough people and budget. the costumes and firearms were correct for the time! i expect to see the young actors in the film again in the future. rachel, chance, rebekah and kirby were great. the sass (single action shooting society)members that contributed to this effort were pretty darn good. hope to see more.

i really enjoyed watching hell to pay. i've been a fan of westerns for as long as i can remember and this one reminded me of a lot of the westerns from the 1960s (even though i was too young to have seen them in their first run). the one thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music. it was distracting at times. one thing i did notice, and i wonder how many other fans of gunsmoke noticed, was the name of buck taylor's character. it was a play on doc adams' name from gunsmoke. instead of gaylan adams, buck taylor used adam galen. i wonder if that was his choice or chris mcintyre's? anyway, i would recommend this movie to fans of westerns. don't expect anything too "deep". just plain old entertainment.

this is a cute little movie that provides pretty much what it promises - some good entertainment. after all, when a movie proclaims it features top sass shooters, you have to figure that it is not a likely candidate for the "best picture" oscar. those guys are shooters, not actors. your next clue is that the movie doesn't star nicholas cage or jennifer aniston, i.e. you shouldn't expect to see the current hottest names. it was meant to be just plain old entertainment and in that regard it is every bit as good as a lot of the old "oaters" i have seen through the years.so what do you get with "hell to pay"? you get 100 minutes of good old entertainment. you get a chance to see some stars from past years, who act pretty much like what they did in their prime but a little older. you get to see some good sass shooters in major roles and a few sass hams in the background. it was a lot of fun for me seeing people that i have shot with, visited in their homes and who are my good friends get to do something that a lot of people only ever dream about - they're in a real, live honest to gosh movie. they're doing something a lot of wannabe actors and wannabe shooters will never get the chance to do and i think that alone makes it worth the watch.admittedly, not everyone is a sass member and so i saw lots of fun and humor that others may miss, but it is still good, old-fashioned entertainment, and frankly, there are a lot of movies in the theatre right now that i wouldn't give a nickel to see, so save the money to go see "brokeback mountain" get "hell to pay" and watch some real cowboys have some fun.

for a long time, this was my favorite of the batman films. it had the best cinematography and an edgy feel to it with two wild characters - catwomen and the penguin - along with the always-interesting christopher walken. however, after the last viewing it finally slipped in my ratings and, frankly, i now prefer the last batman: batman begins, with christian bale.the good - nonetheless, this is still the most intriguing of the five latter-day batman films. the stylish cinematography in here is the best of any of the batman movies. director tim burton is known for his films which feature stunning visuals, as this is a great example. the three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. of the villains, i preferred catwomen, finding her the most fun to watch before and after she changed. violence is not overdone here as it was in several of the other batman stories but one is never bored watching this. as he did in the first film, michael keaton does a fine job playing batman/bruce wayne.the bad - for a movie based on a comic strip that mostly kids read, i still think these first two batman movies, both done by burton, were too dark and the profanity was definitely not appropriate. although, unlike the first movie, there was no usage of the lord's name in vain in here, there still was profanity and both villains made too many sexual remarks. that would have been okay if they hadn't marketed this film for kids as well as adults. danny devito's "penguin" is downright gross in spots. "grotesque" i can handle, but who wants "gross." few guys, meanwhile, complained about the beautiful michelle pfeiffer playing catwoman. generall too much darkness and some cheap shots on christian- bashing also made me re-consider my previously-high rating of this film.overall - fabulous visuals and memorable characters make this the most interesting in the batman series, but too-dark an edge, too gross and too much anti-religious bias all finally turned me off after a half-dozen looks at this film. sorry, but i prefer a kinder-gentler batman movie. after all, it's just a cartoon. most will disagree, but i was glad to see the series lighten up after this one.

i really like traci lords. she may not be the greatest actress in the world but she's rather good in this. she play the dowdy, conservative, reporter to a 't'. it's a great little thriller which keeps you guessing for a good while. jeff fahey is also good as traci's boss. i think given a decent break traci could be a top actress. she's certainly no worse than some of today's leading ladies.

with "batman returns", tim burton succumbed to an important priority in american cinema: giving a sequel to a blockbuster. three years after the most successful movie of the year, "batman" (1989), here comes the hero of gotham city again for the pleasure of many spectators. like its predecessor, "batman returns" enjoyed an enormous commercial success. tim burton made batman come back once again because it is to believe that the victory of the latter on his enemy the joker did little to improve the image of gotham city. indeed, violence and corruption still exist and here, the second word is epitomized by max shreck (christopher walken) and the penguin (danny de vito). these two crooks who are eager to take control of gotham city are going to make life difficult for batman. his task will be more difficult with the apparition of catwoman... tim burton still delivered much work on the scenery and it seems that he tried to correct the faults of the first movie. it means that the director gave way to fight sequences which are better mastered than in the first batman. but he didn't neglect the psychology of his main characters for all that. if in the movie of 1989, burton had focused on bruce wayne/batman's psychology, here, it's the penguin that obviously interested him. the director attempted to make of him, very well acted by de vito an ambiguous character. on one hand, he's full of bad intentions (previously quoted) but on the other hand, he's searching for his past and would like to be considered as a real man."batman returns" also appears as crazier than its predecessor, especially with the cast. i think of mich√®le pfeiffer who offers a daring and powerful performance as catwoman. besides, at the time when i'm writing this review, it makes me remember that a new version of catwoman is currently at the cinema. but given the bad reviews (3 out of 10 on imdb!), it is sure that her performer halle berry must pale into insignificance beside pfeiffer.ultimately, this film is one of the best sequels of 1992 and it enables to develop tim burton's peculiar style. we also still find his taste for the strange and the gothic. concerning batman's other adaptations for the screen, you can skip them. "batman forever" (1995) and "batman and robin" (1997) are no good. i heard that christopher nolan was shooting the beginning of the batman story and it was to be released next year. will it match tim burton's works?

this film is where the batman franchise ought to have stopped. though i will concede that the ideas behind "batman forever" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case.apparently warner brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second batman film from tim burton turned out. apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the sixties tv series, i fail to understand how "batman returns" can be considered at all disappointing.true, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in "batman," a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of keaton and jack nicholson as the joker in the first film. yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying.michael keaton returns as the batman and his alter ego bruce wayne, tangling with nouveau riche tycoon max schreck (christopher walken, named in honour of the 1920s german silent actor), his partner-in-crime oswald cobblepot, the penguin (danny devito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of laurence olivier's "richard iii"), and selina kyle, the catwoman (michelle pfeiffer), whom wayne romances both as himself and as the batman. the four principals turn in excellent performances, especially walken and devito, while together keaton and pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities.there are some intriguing concepts in this film. about the only weakness i can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places, which i think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. there simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on.nevertheless, this is a damn good film. i highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under burton and keaton.

any batman fan will know just how great the films are, they've been a major success. batman returns however is by far the best film in the series. a combination of excellent directing, brilliant acting and settings makes this worthy of watching on a night in.tim burton, who directed this movie, has specifically made sure that this film gives a realistic atmosphere and he's done a great job. danny devito (penguin man) is a man who has inherited penguin characteristics as a baby, and grown up to become a hideous and ugly...thing! michelle pfiffer plays the sleek and very seducing 'catwoman' after cats had given her there genes from being bitten. the result in both the character changes is excellent and both catwoman and penguin man play a very important role in this excellent film. the mysterious catwoman is great fun to watch - her classic sayings and a funny part in which skips with her whip in a jewelry shop adds such fun to the film. danny devito also does well, his ability to impersonate some strange creature was vital, and he adds a great atmosphere to the film that takes us back to the dull sewers where he lives.you can't forget batman though. micheal keaton once again pulls of a comfortable performance, and shows us a different side to batman. his affection is let loose when he confronts catwoman at the end of the film, and his meetings with her when she's a normal person, selina kyle, result in him being seduced badly in his own home. there's a clever part after this when they leave, and the film is full of great scenes. its worth noting that bruce wayne's bat mobile is not used as much as in the other batman films, as close combat and story telling scenes make up this film.the winter setting is created perfectly in gotham city with most of the scenes being set at night, and with the town being filled with snow. therefore, if you watch this film during the summer like i have, it doesn't feel the same. best watch it during the winter.overall, its an amazing movie. all the credit goes to tom burton and the cast, they've done an incredible job.

batman returns is more gothic and somber than its predecessor, and i like it a lot. also, the scenery is more darker, and the entire environment is saddening along with the soul-chilling music composed by the so-talented danny elfman.however, i didn't like the idea to make the penguin a monster, unlike to the comic books, where he's human. even if he looks like a monster, he shows well that he possesses a human dignity, and i felt very sorry for him when he saw the tombstones of his late parents. but still, he was a dangerous villain in fact, and he needed to be stopped.michael keaton made a "tour de force" with his return as the dark knight, and this time he's powerful as in the original batman. it's not difficult to understand why he's called batman in public sometimes...also, michelle pfeiffer is so sexy and well-fitted in her role, and she gave a faithfully performance as the female villain/crimefighter dressed as a cat. really, the actors did all a masterful work with batman returns, which made it a successful movie.if you liked batman, watch its awesome sequel, cause it's very worthy for all the dark knight's hard-core lovers.steve baillargeon

tim burton is in essence an expressionist film-maker, disinterested in dimensions of character and obsessed with gothic scope, opting for style over substance incessantly throughout his career. however, with his style being so poignantly endearing, i, like many moviegoers, forgive all the countless flaws that can be found in many of his movies and become engrossed in what are essentially, one hundred million dollar art films.it's almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic, emotionally involving spirit within the second installment of a mediocre franchise, especially when that franchises target audience are half-witted 15 year old boys. batman returns should have been every bit as commercial as its predecessor, ensuring box office draw and cheap (in actual fact, very expensive) thrills, being entertaining without ever truly involving its audience. had this been the result, then tim burton would have surely been required to direct a third installment. instead, burton delivers something that can only truly be defined by the phrase, 'out there'.from the melancholy opening in which a high society couple throw a prison-like bassinette containing their newly born deformed baby into a river, it is clear that batman returns, ain't no picnic at buckingham palace. cut to thirty three years later, during a political speech made by bad guy business tycoon max shreck (sinisterly portrayed by christopher walken), the red triangle circus gang attack gotham city. batman (michael keaton returning to the role) makes his first appearance sporting a new logo, eventually saving the day. shreck is soon kidnapped by the circus gang and black-mailed into endorsing the political return of the baby, now a fully grown penguin man (danny devito in hideously perfect make-up), whose motives for return are suspicious only to batman.meanwhile, shreck attempts to off his nosey and awkward assistant selina kyle (played perfectly by michelle pfeiffer who quite frankly deserved more recognition for her performance) who transforms into the deliciously sexy and psychotic catwoman, out for revenge and harbours, for some unexplained reason, a deadly vendetta against the dark knight.batman returns is bleak. the production design is breathtaking, delivering a cold haunting gotham city with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor. danny elfman's score supports the film brilliantly, ranging from invigorating to tragic. the tone and direction of the whole film itself is intensely brooding, shot like a sad nightmare, burton's direction overshadows what is in fairness a diabolical screenplay with an almost totally irrelevant plot and yet at the same time perfect for burton's visual style of film-making. and whilst burton's action sequences struggle for exhilaration, the real excitement lies in the directional choices displaying the fall of each of its main characters, the penguins demise, the catwoman's mental state and bruce wayne's lonely destiny.warner brothers hated it whilst critical and audience reaction was mixed. after all, they wanted a batman sequel, not a weird, somewhat ghastly horror movie, in which a deformed psychopathic orphan attempts to kidnap and drown a batch of babies, all-the-while vomiting what can only be described as green mucus. the production company wanted an audience friendly feature, something for the mcdonald's clan to promote their happy meals with, not a movie of dire irredeemable characters, including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from a skyscraper and revived by a gang of cats awakening her from unconsciousness by chewing on her bloodied ice cold fingers.it's easy to understand the mass disappointment that followed the release of batman returns. the film never felt like a batman blockbuster. it is questionable if burton really knew who batman actually was or even if he cared about the character as much as he cared about the film fitting in with his usual themes of beautifully haunting art direction and misinterpreted, lonely characters who rarely conform with societies standards and expectations. this is why burton failed to create a great batman film. he did however; create a nostalgic and stunning, ballsy piece of cinema that remains a personal and nostalgic favourite of mine.this may not be a great batman movie. but it is a great tim burton film.

what can i say, this film is amazing. it has its flaws like every film does for example wobbly headstones in a graveyard, a clearly visible slide board during the penguins death scene, max shreck losing his heavy coat in a split second between shots during the image consultancy scene, batman losing his black eye makeup all of a sudden between shots so he can reveal bruce wayne to catwoman, dialogue being recorded but is played back and spoken differently than when it was spoken in the first place and lastly catwoman all of a sudden knows how to use a bull whip without any training whatsoever. these flaws are minor compared to some you would see in for example batman forever where the riddler can obviously be seen waiting for his cue or val kilmer's hair changing between shots.what makes this film so deserving of an 8/10 is the great acting because the performances are absolutely amazing. michael keaton reprises his role as batman and has a lot more to do in this film. he looks more comfortable in the role the second time around and is on par with the villains performances. danny devito is the perfect penguin. i really like the conversion of the penguin into the grotesque penguin man instead of the non threatening character from the comics or tv show because now the character has more depth and has a far more interesting story that generates from the basic need of family and to feel accepted and wanted. this gives us an evil character who we feel sympathy for because he was rejected for being what he is which is not his fault. michelle pfeiffer is excellent as catwoman. she is sleet and sexy and she is also a villain we can feel sorry for because of the way she is victimised. christopher walken is a great secondary villain and is so interesting a character even though he is not even in the batman universe.the soundtrack is far better than the first and danny elfman gets more of a chance to show off his musical talents this time around. the sets are amazing. they are detailed, eye catching, sinister, gothic , unique, dark and so many other adjectives can describe how amazing they look. the costumes and make up are great and obviously a lot of work went into making them and all the work pays off because the batsuit is better, the cat suit is amazing to look at and the penguin make up and effects are so convincing.the animatronic penguins look really realistic and are played to good effect. the script is really good and the storyline in my opinion is a plausible one. overall, because of all these factors this film deserves an 8/10 and stands as my favourite of all the batman films

the best batman movie of the 90's no doubt about it. this movie takes place in a city filled with insecurity and nightmares.although the villains are somewhat cheesy, they fit perfect for the movie's tone of colorful but nightmarish cinematography. the performances are really great and the comic tone behind them really delivers expectations. don't get fooled by the cheesy outfits, this is a movie in the pure style of burton. that can't be described; burton is a sui generis director that took the batman franchise to another obscure level but not forgetting about it's comic style past. recommended for fans of action cinema and best of all, if it deals with super heroes.

first off, this film has no story. it's obvious there were a lot of rewrites during production -- sometimes characters reference a timeline that is impossible, and this is probably because the timeline of the entire story was never known to anyone on the set.that said, the film is kinda brilliant. pfeiffer is amazing -- and i mean amazing, as catwoman; she nails the character's inherent sexy darkness and good/bad tendencies. walken is walken -- but even more nasty than usual. devito is not true to the comic book when it comes to penguin, but he is good and memorable. keaton is underrated as batman. and the music and style are pure cinema thrill. true, the 3rd act doesn't work. but the final 2 scenes are knockouts, and it's clear pfeiffer and keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that got derailed by this film's kinky darkness. that's too bad, because pfieffer and keaton had classic chemistry, and had they acted in a third installment, joel you know who might not have gotten the chance to destroy batman for an entire generation of movie fans.

when i first rented batman returns, i immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional. i mean, jack nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how could there be a good movie? simple, throw in danny devito.batman returns is an arguably more dark movie than batman. there are more villains here, less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects, and more nerve-striking issues. however, the music is similar to the first if not darker. the scenery is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail right down to the time of year. this movie follows the same comic-style format we came to love in the first batman.now for the performances. michael keaton thankfully returns as batman/bruce wayne. he was great in the first movie, and just as much in this sequel. there was not enough screen time in the world for keaton as batman, need more! danny devito gave an award-winning performance as the penguin, the most grueling, disgusting, lovable, angry, evil, sad, pathetic villain ever to grace a superhero movie. you hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time. and it explains him down to the last detail too, making it all the more conflicting. michelle pfeiffer was excellent as catwoman/selina kyle. two completely different personalities in one. she actually got a good amount of back story as well. christopher walken didn't disappoint as max shreck, the greedy, judgmental, selfish ceo of the power company. michael gough also thankfully returns as the lovable alfred, and he was just as good here as well. pat hingle also returns as gordon, although i feel he was really never in the spotlight.with lots of great twists and sub-plots, batman returns is sure to please any fan of the original.9/10

batman returns it is my opinion that the first batman of the batman series was only half the movie that batman returns is. in the first batman by tim burton we had only batman and the joker both played wonderfully by michael keaton and jack nicholson.in batman returns we have what i feel is the most perfectly cast batman movie (yes even better then dark knight). keaton returns as batman and is perfect in the role never going to far over top with the character of batman, which is perfect in this film when it comes to the two villains that he's up against. first you have danny devito who is delightfully insane as the penguin. then you have michelle pfeiffer as cat-woman, who i dare to say is one of the most interesting and complex villains in the batman movies. i feel this way about pfeiffer because of the way she becomes the cat-woman she starts off as the rather pathetic mousy selena kyle and then truly dives into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman who goes from trying to be a hero to a villain and then i suppose back to a hero in the end. also in this amazing cast you have the evil businessman max schreck played by the amazing and legendary christopher walken. while in a supporting role there's something about this role that i love and maybe it's the look of schreck in the film that makes his performance all the better then it already is.story wise i have to say that batman returns has so much more going on this time around as opposed to the first batman. part of the reason i loved this story so much is the fact that burton dared to go in a much more darker and twisted direction as opposed to nicholson's over the top antics. you have the story on the penguin and how he tries to deceive the people of gotham into making him the new hero and mayor of the city. then you have cat-woman and her struggle to decide just who she really is and what she should do with her new persona. when it comes to batman i feel that in this one he's more the ring leader that holds the two stories together but of course kicking ass at the same time.cinematography was the film is dark and atmospheric just like the story that's taking place within it. gotham city never looked as good as it does on blu-ray and hd so if you have the chance to see it this way then by all means do because it truly adds to the overall experience of batman returns.so all in i truly feel that of all the batman movies batman returns believe it or not tops the dark knight for me because while i enjoyed that movie for heath ledger's amazing performance as the joker i felt that the movie was lacking something. batman returns lacks nothing, so if you want to see an amazing film with what i feel is a perfect cast then this is the batman to light the bat signal for.

a very good offering from hbo. traci lords is becoming a much-better dramatic actress with each effort. i hope to see this attractive lady in more challenging roles in the future, instead of the "flighty" roles she has been stuck with in the past.

as a kid i grew up with the chintzy 60's tv series (and no i'm not that old¬Ö pow!). however when director tim burton brought his novel vision to the silver screen, i simply took an immediate shine to it and never backed away from favoring his installments over the much hyped-latest additions ('batman begins' and 'the dark knight'), which i don't really care for. even if they're going for a much more grounded approach and wanting to explore bruce wayne/batman psyche further¬Ö but in honesty i don't think there's all that much to tap in to. i wanted crazy fun with a dark streak and in my eyes that's what burton brought across, and this is the reason why i can watch them over and over again. after wowing audiences with the 1989 'batman', thanks to the gaudily gothic art direction and jack nicholson take no-prisoners performance of the camped-up, but psychotic joker. burton would return 3 years later for the follow up and my favorite of the batman films so far; 'batman returns'. camp, but well-done. in what would fair up to being even more expansive, louder, dreary, and nihilistic and having two villainous foes for the price of one. enter the grotesque penguin (with danny devito magnificently going out on a limb) and the ravishing catwoman (a steamy michelle pfeiffer who fills out the suit nicely) coming to spoil gotham's party. again batman (an aptly brooding michael keaton is equally commendable and looks quite imposing in that bat suit¬Ö look at the eyes) plays second fiddle to the bad guys, but i always preferred this sober interpretation of batman that gave him an ominously gloomy mystique, but also a wearing psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed. and his turn of bruce wayne was well served too. burton's illustratively atmospheric direction opens with his sleek gothic style engraving an carnival comic book world filtered in with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes. the moody narrative (in what probably is a tad too long) is more so symbolic in its progression, rather show-piecing its spontaneously arresting and extravagant set-pieces and sharply etched art direction covered with shadowy tinges and grey/blue neon lighting of a wintry backdrop. the magnetically free-flowing camera-work takes flight and danny elfman's stately spacious score balances the playfulness along with gloomy touches with a very hypnotic pull. the rest of the performances might be overshadowed, but christopher walken digs in his teeth into a smarmily glassy role of a two-faced businessman max shreck. pat hingle is back, but gets very little to do as commissioner james gordon and michael gough is delightful as alfred. in solid support are michael murphy, andrew bryniarski, vincent schiavelli, doug jones and peter rubens also makes a cameo appearance.

i remember really liking batman returns when it came out in 1992, but now i think that this is the best of all the batman movies (even over christopher nolan's terrific 2005 batman begins and definitely over the seriously over-hyped overrated 2008 the dark knight!). i originally remember thinking that the 1st batman w/ jack nicholson was the best (and i still love it). but i think that this movie really hits the nail on the head. the 4 main characters (batman, penguin, catwoman, and max shreck) are all vivid and memorable. you really get to see what batman/bruce wayne is all about in keaton's terrific characterization. keaton is the best batman, not kilmer, clooney, or even the up-and-coming bale, who was exceptional in bb and could have stolen top honors from keaton had his character not been destroyed by nolan's hack film-making in tdk !. danny devito as the penguin is disturbing, scary, hilarious, and lethal. devito is great and doesn't need scenery-chewing to give great performance like nicholson's joker. the viewer can actually sympathize with this disfigured outcast and his plight to fit into normal society. i had never really been big fan of michelle pfeiffer until this film, but this is definitely my favorite performance of hers. pfeiffer's selina kyle is goofy and odd at first, then when she is transformed into catwoman, she is simultaneously sexy and scary, a total deadly sexpot! also, i feel that keaton and pfeiffer have more chemistry than keaton and basinger from batman; they form a tragic love story. and christopher walken as shreck is, well, as always, christopher walken!batman returns, more so than batman, is more confident and focused. it is assured film-making from beginning to end. the way burton introduces the penguin's heartbreaking backstory grabs you from the very beginning. the first 5 minutes are among my favorite beginnings to any film: danny elfman's music sets an ominous foreboding tone that defines the rest of the film. it is a modification from the original batman and a great one!then flash forward 33 years to the present day gotham and we are introduced to powerful businessman shreck who wants to build new power plant in gotham. during same scene we meet shreck's meek, bullied, under-confident secretary selina kyle. and not long after all this is the film's exciting opening action sequence as batman must battle the penguin's red triangle gang, a fun yet lethal group of outcasts and circus performers. penguin sets plan in motion to attack the gotham christmas celebration, kidnap shreck in the chaos, and force him to help re-introduce him to society. meanwhile, selina discovers shreck's criminal plans and so he "kills" her by shoving her out his high-rise office, then she is revived by cats. sound convoluted? yes, but burton never claimed to be posing a realistic story. he has created a world where the viewer can accept that things like this can happen, a dark, noirish world comprised of mistreated, deformed outcasts who deep down only want acceptance and to fit in. confident storytelling if you ask me!the action scenes are few and far in between, but they are all exciting, entertaining, and nail-biting. they aren't there just for show, the way some in batman are. and they all make sense. the climactic scene with penguin's "army" marching into the center of gotham with batman zoning in on penguin's hideout and sidekick butler alfred (michael gough in a welcome return from the original!) assisting batman is succinct, solid, heart-pounding fun!i also love the christmastime, wintry setting, which adds to the super-dark, cold feel of burton's batman world. i also love the way burton slowly introduces to us the batman "toys" without shoving them down our throats. each "toy" is appropriate for that moment in the film and we are compelled to accept them for their purpose. and although dark, returns is still a funny film. devito's penguin has many funny lines. so does walken's shreck. the batman-catwoman exchanges are extremely stimulating and humor-filled as well! a great ensemble! all in all, batman returns is a tightly woven tale of the dark forces at play in tim burton's fun, comic book world.

1992's "batman returns" was tim burton's second round as director and yet again he scored a hit by making this film again dark and gloomy like his 1989 one. gotham city again is a place of darkness and gloom with crime and corruption boiling out from every street corner. it was also clever to see how burton used politics as a subplot that tied in well and neat with the business corruption of businessman max shreck(christopher walken)and the plan to make the "penguin"(danny devito) mayor of gotham! anyway keaton again returns as "batman"/bruce wayne and he gives another stellar performance as a strange and torn man who just can't find love in a normal world yet he is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in selina kyle only ms. kyle has a dark secret of her own one that's very slinky and she's just a downright vamp as the sexy and mysterious yet dangerous "catwoman"(michelle pfeiffer). a plan forms between both villains to destroy gotham and most of all both want to rid themselves of the bat. really this film even though violent and somewhat gross with many penguin scenes is clearly an exciting thrill ride from start to finish as you never find a dull moment and thumbs up to tim again for his exploring of the characters as dark and conflicted it just made the film even more interesting. the performance from michelle pfeiffer was the best ever as no one could have played "the catwoman" any better and devito was perfect as the "penguin" his body frame fit the character just perfect his performance even though ghoulish was fun to watch. "batman returns" is an entertaining thrill ride that you can't take your eyes off of as a viewer you will enjoy it many times it's that thrilling and explosive.

i've enjoyed this movie ever since i was a kid and i still do. i also liked batman forever back then but the real difference is that this movie didn't date when i grew up. i did notice a few scenes in this film that didn't make any sense like: 'hhmm... the crowd is angry. hey! where did they get those tomatoes from?' then i thought: 'who cares? this movie is not 100% serious anyway!'the original tim burton batman was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and i didn't like all the actors. this movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast, a more gothic style and no involvement of prince. nowadays, many fans of the christopher nolan movies dislike burton claiming that the nolan movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics. i don't think this is entirely true: -there has never been an adaptation of the original concept of batman which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun. -batman has taken many forms over the years peeking its silliness in the 60's (and a bit with batman & robin). a director is free to choose what kind of batman he's going to portray as long if it's good.my opinion: batman doesn't necessarily have to be serious. it's about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears. burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole idea.i just recently watched the nolan movies and i love those ones as well (especially the dark knight). there's simply something about this movie that interests me more. nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so, he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of batman. that's a bit too much for me, i'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of batman. the burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere.my conclusion is that you shouldn't compare the nolan with the burton movies. they're just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like better. my respect is for both directors.

i always thought the batman returns was a great sequel to batman. the story was an interesting one and danny devito, christopher walken and micheal keaton gave great performances. plus lets face it, tim burton was a genius and did the comic book character more justice than joel screwmacher ever did.plot: oswald cobblepot also know as the penguin(played by danny devito) is abandoned by his parents as child for being deformed. he uses this as an excuse to masquerade a sinister plot to abduct the first born children of gotham with the help of his goons(red triangle gang) and a very shady tycoon max shreck(played by christopher walken). max shreck later makes penguin the mayor of gotham. selina kyle(michelle pfeiffer) is pushed out of a window by max shreck and is revived by cats. later on she develops cat-like qualities and seeks to destroy max shreck and batman. her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained.opinion: batman returns is a classic. it has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere. tim burton always had a knack for making grim backgrounds look appealing. micheal keaton is still sharp as batman. danny devito steals the show as oswald cobblepot/the penguin. when you think about it, he would have made a better violator for the movie spawn than john leguizamo. michelle pfeiffer gave catwoman more personality than halle berry ever could. max shreck is one of christopher walken's best roles. the main reason why i like batman returns is that its fun. its not only creative but its also fun. something a lot of big budget movies these days sorely lack. the batman series goes to the dogs after tim burton decided to do no more. you don't believe me, look at batman forever and batman and robin. thank god that christopher nolan breathed life back into the series with batman begins.

why is it better? because it's true to the dark vision of the comic. because the imagery is inventive and, unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos in this one. the first one had too much of jack nicholson's shtick, too much prince music, and an awkward "romance." here, instead of one villain, there are three. no robert wuhl, and the leading lady is more than just a pretty face. in fact, pfeiffer is the #1 attraction of this film. her transformation is what drives the running theme, teetering on the edge of sanity and insanity, good and evil. she becomes truly fearsome. the costumes and makeup are excellent. danny devito's penguin is inspired and anguished, not just a nut. his circus gang posse is the one element of comic relief (besides that giant duck). max shrek is the only character i'd have toned down, walken is pretty hammy as the ruthless businessman. danny elfman's score is a perfect fit as usual, and the siouxie and the banshees song ("face to face") is easily the best of any of the songs from any of the films, a perfect match of musical artist and film soundtrack. the least campy of the films, it is macabre, doesn't pander, and demands second and third viewings like an amusement park ride. bravo tim burton and cast!

forget the over-rated "batman begins, this is the ultimate batman movie that you are not gonna want to miss out on. this movie has everything, and it totally surpasses the first 1989 mega hit. it may not have done as well as the first one in at the box office, but this is certainly a much better film. the visuals are amazing, burton works his magic as he always does in his films once again. gotham city, batmans hunting ground, is an amazing sight to behold. the story itself is actually quite good and the 2 villains in this one are very interesting, much more interesting in fact then there comic book counterparts. tim burton and screenplay writer daniel walters go a step further to bring you a truly emotional connection with these characters. the penguin, played to perfection by danny devito, is a type of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge on the world that denied him. very disgusting to watch at times, but he has some of the most classic lines a villain could ever utter in a single film. the other villain is catwoman, played so absolutely brilliantly by michelle pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and gives a wow performance, and totally steals the show as far any of the past and present live action batman villain's is concerned. she also has a tragic background. her name is selina kyle, and she is a very put-upon, mousy secretary for a shrewd business man called max shreck, who later murders her by shoving her out a window. somehow, she survives and is "awakened" by cats, and decides right then and there to become the legendary catwoman, not before, of course, the amazing sequence in which she completely lets loose and wrecks her entire apartment in one of the most oscar worthy performance's of rage and anger i have ever seen in an actress.michael keaton once again dons the cape and cowl as batman and also as bruce wayne and this time hes much darker. there's not much else to say here except that keaton is simply the best actor to play batman ever. he just oozes cool, and he has a kind of clint eastwood approach to playing batman, and he is very dark. he doesn't talk a lot, and when he does, he sounds very cool and he doesn't make his voice sound all goofy and fake ie bales "batman" voice in batman begins. he struts around gotham like a man possessed by his own inner demons. he's pshycologically disturbed, and you know it. in this outing he takes on 2 of the most famous baddies to ever grace the batman comic book world.i have to say though, despite the awesomeness of the action scenes, like the scenes with the coolest batmobile ever racing down the street knocking thugs to the ground and batman gliding across gotham, its the romantic angle between pfieffer and keaton that really makes this movie classic a top choice for anyone who wants to see the real batman in action, i rate this a 10, would give it more if i could.

so what is 'batman returns', anyway?it was marketed as an action film, and many people who've seen it seem to think that they've watched an action film - but really, there isn't that much action, and tim burton barely seems interested in it.people often align it with the 'grittier' superhero comics of the late eighties, but honestly, if you've read 'the dark knight returns', that seems just a little absurd; burton's excessive imaginings have more in common with the day-glo sixties tv series (the penguin drives around in a giant plastic duck, for goodness' sake).burton's style is often described as gothic, and that's a little closer to what we see on screen; the penguin - deformed, malign, with a tangled history and a subterranean lair - is a gothic menace dressed up in more respectable dickensian clothes - udolfo masquerading as uriah heep. but what of catwoman? she may be raised from the dead, but that pvc catsuit is decidedly twentieth century, and her alter ego selina kyle's world is all boardrooms and apartments - reminiscent of a 1930s romantic comedy.and then it clicks. the smart but downtrodden secretary romanced by a lonely millionaire? the ensuing complications caused by deception and disguise? 'batman returns' is, quite clearly, a romantic comedy in the old hollywood style, filtered through burton's s&m dungeon sensibilities. it has more in common with 'the hudsucker proxy' (including expressionist sets) than it does with other superhero films. like many a romantic comedy, it centres around the make-over of the heroine; not from ugly duckling to swan, but from doormat to dominatrix. michelle pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her (often remarkable) career; she's iconically sexy as catwoman (poor halle berry never had a prayer), playful and vindictive, memorable because she knows how to act with her whole body. in retrospect, though, it's her scenes as selina that impress; almost every one of them is a little comic gem, particularly the glimpse we get of her lonely home life. it's a delicately balanced tragicomic performance, and it's in these scenes that the film really sparks to life. nothing moves me quite like selina and bruce wayne dancing under the mistletoe to siouxsie and the banshees, a gun held between them, simultaneously empowered and trapped by their alter egos, doomed to conflict. forget the easy sentimentality of 'big fish' or the gossamer emotions of 'edward scissorhands' - this is the most heartfelt scene in all of burton's films. love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, insanity, self-loathing and not a little wit, all in a few short lines and absolutely nailed by the actors - particularly pfeiffer. elsewhere, danny de vito almost matches her, finding the wounded dignity buried beneath those truly repellent long-johns. the upper-crust villain of the comics is revealed to be nothing more than a sham; burton's penguin is a feral creature subjected to his own, eliza doolittle-style make-over (almost literally an 'ugly duckling'). it's burton's most radical - and funniest - reinvention. christopher walken's max schreck completes a perfect triptych of villains, sliding between casual charm and blank-eyed psychosis with unnerving ease (and is it just me, or does his company's logo bring to mind mickey mouse? perhaps we should ask former disney animator burton).christopher nolan's 'batman begins' - a real action film - has been much praised as the first film to do justice to batman; i admire nolan's film, but it would be a pity if it were allowed to overshadow this idiosyncratic gem.

this sequel proves that tim burton was for all intents and purposes the best choice to ever direct a batman movie. the story focuses on baman taking on three enemies: the penguin (wonderfully played by danny devito) catwoman (the slinky michelle pfeiffer) and max shreck (the superb christopher walken).perhaps the best entry in the series, it has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out. the cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand-out is devito as the multi-layered penguin. here is a guy who is evil, pitiable, funny and perhaps most importantly, scary. the infamous scene with shreck's image consultants still sends shivers up my spine. in other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances.i do not hesitate to say that "batman returns" is my favorite of all the batmans released (sorry, dark knight fans). if you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action, then please check out this badly underrated film. if nothing else, it's at least the best film tim burton has ever made.

batman returns is to be considered quality when one speaks of superhero films. its predecessor, batman, in my opinion, is by far the greatest and most well thought out of the comic book genre. for one to say that batman returns was disappointing, he or she has not fully watched the movie and considered the acting of danny devito as the penguin. devito and walken offer some memorable moments. the tale of batman is suppose to be dark and tim burton has fulfilled how the comic portrays batman. batman returns provides comic relief, action, suspense and fantasy; and it should not be viewed as 'crap', although we are all entitled to our own opinions.

it's been said that batman begins in the first batman movie to "get it right" but i think that's a horrible overstatement, for i think the new batman film, although greater that batman forever and batman and robin, pales compared to tim burton's classics, with this one being the best of the five. the darkness is beautiful, as is the music and scenery, creating a gotham city cloaked in mystery, unlike batman begins, where gotham city is a normal-looking city. the villains are terrific in this movie. you literally can't take your eyes off of the penguin and cat woman. i applaud tim burton for being original with his use of the penguin as a freak, rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old batman tv show. in batman begins we have the scarecrow, whose not nearly as demanding on screen as the penguin or cat woman. the film doesn't need to focus only on batman, because we already know his story, and it is the villains who we are exploring and trying to figure out, and they are the ones who create the plot, with the penguin running for mayor and seeking revenge for his parents' desertion by killing the first born sons of gotham, a task he fails. danny devito gives the finest performance ever by a superhero villain in any film, surpassing even nicholson's joker. the closing scene where the penguins drag the dead body of the penguin into the water is touching and powerful. it's a tragedy that tim burton wasn't allowed to complete his trilogy, since warner bros., interesting in marketing appeal, wanted to "lighten" the batman movies up. and they got their wish...unfortunately. tim burton planned on directing the third film, using the riddler as the villain, with no two-face and robin to mess it up, and i'm sure michael keaton would've signed on. so this is the last great batman film. batman begins is dark, but boring, tedious, ordinary, filled with lackluster villains, and a playboy bruce wayne. a decent batman film, but the best batman film ever? never. batman returns holds that crown.

batman returns is a really dark movie, that shows the caped crusader fighting against the penguin and the sexy catwoman (i'll get to them later). michael keaton acts well as bruce wayne, showing he is a good actor. tim burton directs this picture well, and the locations of the movie are impressive. the villains: danny devito is menacing as the penguin. a cruel, yet disturbed man, that had a really hard childhood. but, michelle pfeiffer steals the picture. she is the best catwoman ever! she is threatening, and extremely sexy. there's a scene where she kisses batman the cat way that just heats the movie up. the action scenes are good too, and the ending is dramatic and tragic, probably the best ending of a batman movie. tim burton shows he can manage a batman movie really well (he already demonstrated this with the first batman) and also gives batman a darker nature. so much like him.

"the phenix city story" is a brutal, hard-hitting docudrama about what was once dubbed the "wickedest town in america." the film documents the events that led up to the murder by the phenix city crime syndicate of albert patterson, an alabama attorney who made a bid for the state attorney general's office as a way to clean up the vice and corruption plaguing his hometown. his son, john patterson, picked up his father's mantle after his death and won the post, making clean up of phenix city a primary item on his agenda.director phil karlson created a film that has the ability to shock even today. the grimness is so relentless that the film is actually difficult to watch. we see the crime syndicate beat and kill in order to get what they want -- the beatings and killings include women and children, and one scene in particular, revolving around the death of a little black girl, is especially disturbing. it's not exactly an enjoyable film, because there's very little payoff at the end to reward the viewer for sitting through the infuriating events leading up to it, but it's a well made film, full of an intense and angry energy.a 15-minute prologue includes a series of interviews with the actual inhabitants of phenix city, some of who are then portrayed by actors in the fictional portion of the film. it lends the film a quality of urgency that carries over into the narrative, so that we feel like we're watching a documentary the entire time, a feeling that's helped by karlson's choice to film on actual locations.i'm glad i saw this movie, but it's one of those films that fills you with a sense of righteous indignation and then makes you feel helpless because you can't do anything about it.grade: a

having been brought up in phenix city as a child, i recognize many of the local people in the movie, so for me, it's like a trip down memory lane to see "the phenix city story" again. as a matter of fact, my granduncle is in it in one of the very first scenes. uncle drew's the one in the hawaiian shirt who scoots his chair out to get a better look at the singer/stripper.unless you've been there, like mr. page and i both have, you couldn't possibly understand the story it tells. the reviewer from new york calls john patterson racist, most likely without ever having had an encounter with mr. patterson or his father. and what is your point in bringing up mr. patterson's employment now? it has nothing to do with the film that you're supposedly reviewing. how in the world can you sit back and judge either them or this film when you've probably gone no further yourself than the south bronx? it's been my experience that people who do that are simply attempting to feel morally superior to the folks portrayed in the movie. by most accounts of the time, both mr. pattersons were basically good and decent men. their families were respectable people, as were most of the people who lived in phenix city.by the way, why is so hard for those who live outside of the south to believe that there are good and decent people even in small towns in alabama? and why do they assume that everyone living in a small southern town is a racist? my parents lived there and yet, they didn't tolerate it in our household. others didn't tolerate it either, but the myth that everyone in the south is racist lives on through the willful ignorance of others.the movie itself is simple and direct. it isn't the whole story --- hollywood added a certain sensationalism when the film was made. parts of it were absolutely on target. other parts of it bordered on fairy tales. and if it's the source that anyone uses to decide how folks in small southern towns are, they need to get a grip and understand what most of us do --- it's only a movie.

to view the fictionalized biography "the phenix city story", i claim, is to enter fields where u.s. filmmakers have seldom ventured, director phil karlson got his directorial assignment on "the untouchables" tv mega-hit series largely on the basis of "kansas city confidential" and this film; and it has become one of the most admired and most- imitated movies ever made. the rarest feat for us filmmakers seems to be the hero-centered purposeful anti-crime film or tv series; i remind the viewer how mightily "cain's hundred"'s and "hardcastle and mccormick"'s and even "the untouchables'"' producers had to work to produce anything but episodes devoted largely to the unfictional activities of criminals rather than those of their ethical opponents. this powerful, seminal and very-gritty movie has a style all its own; and its lesson seems to be attention to detail about the opponents and victims of criminal organizations as well as their gang members. there is a twelve-minute prelude to the film, in which reporter clete roberts interviews the real participants from the alabama city's who had struggled against its corrupt vice gangs. the problem grew out of the presence of fort benning across the river, and the nearly century-long existence of vice dens in the area. the film details the return of john patterson from germany where he has been a prosecutor. his father, defeated for attorney general of alabama, refuses to join his pursuit of the 14th street vicelords despite several provocations including a beating of his son, avenged by patterson on his tormentor. there are several well-developed characters, including ellie, who works in one of the clubs and her honest boyfriend, the leader of the syndicate, the pattersons and john's wife, ed gage, the vicelords' operatives and zeke ward, an honest black man victimized for his opposition to them. the cinematography by harry neumann and the art direction by stanley fleischer are in b/w and are very much like news-film, adding to the film's realistic power. music by harry sukman contributes to the film effectively. writer daniel mainwaring and crane wilbur produced a swift-paced and straightforward story that divides into parts. part one illustrates the vicelords' empire from inside one of their clubs, showing the fate of a victim who is beaten and then picked up by police in the pay of the mob. in part two, albert patterson refuses to oppose the leader of the mob, the intelligent rhett tanner. in part three, young patterson returns and after several incidents including his having to beat up the mob's head goon to avenge his own beating decides to run his father for attorney general of the state. his wife is horrified; and the mob kills zeke ward's daughter and dumps the body at patterson's house with a warning his children will be next. a few more such incidents, including the loss of a trial in which the pattersons prove the goon killed a friend of theirs who had found the car implicated in the murder of the little girl, and watch the inquest declare the death accidental, convince patterson to run, and he wins the democratic statewide nomination despite the mob's statist tactics--and is promptly assassinated. john patterson stops a vigilante crowd from starting open warfare with the 14th street mob and uses their voices to call the capital and demand martial law for phenix city. the clubs are closed and equipment confiscated, but not before the girl inside is murdered by the mob's goon, and patterson has to be stopped by zeke ward from killing tanner instead of delivering him to the law. the drama's ending is upbeat; but the prognosis for the town is less- sanguine than painted; the mob in fact tried to come back then moved to tennessee. in this well-acted classic of anti-crime film-making, richard kiley is young but very strong as patterson, playing it without an accent. john mcintyre as his father is very good, while edward andrews as boss tanner is award caliber. others in the cast include kathryn grant as the girl inside, ellie, jean carson and kathy marlowe as the mob's women, john larch as their goon, biff mcguire as the young victim, james edwards as zeke ward, lenka peterson as john's wife, and some good character actors as townsmen and mob bosses. it is i suggest hard to say enough good things about the realism and lack of posturing in this film; it is certainly one of phil karlson's best directorial efforts. karlson also did "the scarface mob" later did "walking tall" as well. a sobering and inspiring look at the ease with which complacent citizens of a public-interest democracy can acquiesce to tyranny, and how a few honest men can teach them the need to fight for their rights.

during the clete roberts preface, i was beginning to think this was an ed wood production, however, what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff. the story of crime and corruption in a southern town is told using a cast culled from hollywood's poverty row, and this makes the movie all the more realistic. there are no punches pulled here, and at times the film is reminiscent of "the well"(1951). the black and white texture gives a newsreel-like quality. for certain, younger viewers will be reminded of "the blair witch project" but this one is based on real events!

after world war ii the ungoing crime in phenix city, alabama, encouraged by the money from an army base just across the river in georgia, got even worse. gambling, prostitution, loan sharking, and the like helped an organized crime apparatus in the city. soon it was too bad and violent to even tolerate anymore. this movie is based on the real story of that fight.by the standards of the 1950's it was shockingly explicit. although low-budget, that same small budget helped with the realism requiring location shooting. a very gritty film. richard kiley was marvelous as always, and john mcintire stolid.why this good movie isn't on video is a real puzzle!

this is a film that every child should see before they grow and get distorted often passed down ideas from generation to generation of family. i grew up in two different places although only 20 miles apart. i went to school & had friends of every color creed & religion for the first 8 years of my life. then i moved to hillbilly country (although not anymore) where it was very unusual to even have one african-american kid in your class. my graduating class in high school had 2 or 3 african-amercians (god why can't i just say black? you can call me a honky or whitey or whatever! all of this political correctness peeves me as it does most others!) anyway back to the film give this a try to see what happens when people get a distorted view or just what ignorance or a lack of understanding does to a culture or a country! this is an excellent film everyone should see especially children.

i've read "anne frank: the diary of a young girl" when i was in high school, and found myself completely engrossed in her story, and also in the broadway play of her life in the secret annexe.however, i'm a little perplexed about how people have perceived her diary and of her as a person, seeing her as a little saint or having a message of hope for the world. i don't think that was the original intention of her diary. she wrote it mainly for herself, even though she did make some rigorous rewrites before the occupants of the secret annexe were betrayed, intending it to be published someday.but i never saw her as a saint or as a messenger of hope...but as a very talented writer who could express her thoughts very well and very entertainingly in a diary. no doubt she was a very engaging writer, and she did possess an extraordinary talent with expressing herself fully with words. you really got to know her well through her diary. but the importance of her diary lies in the fact that it is a testament and an important historical document of the proof that the holocaust did happen.it also brought the tragedy of the holocaust closer to home, to lose someone that we could put a familiar face and personality to, at such a young age...literally having had her young life ripped away from her and from the other occupants who were murdered in the holocaust. it's a searing indictment of the nazis systematic murder of over 6 million jews, and that should not be forgotten.but it's sad to me that her diary is being so misconstrued as anything more than that. when i look for hope, i have the bible...the first most widely read non-fiction book in the world. god's words in the bible is eternal...but anne's diary is a diary of a young girl under extraordinary circumstances, and that is it. she is not someone to be worshiped or idolized, because she was an ordinary girl with many flaws, who possessed incredible talent as a writer, and who died at age 15 from typhus in the bergen-belsen concentration camp. she was a victim of the holocaust, and as this otherwise excellent documentary has so vividly testified, she was hitler's most famous victim.besides the anne frank's story...the stories from her family members and friends and survivors of the holocaust were engrossing, vivid and powerful. i especially enjoyed miep gies' testimony, and marvel that she is still strong and alive today. hannah goslar's testimony was also very interesting. and i also liked hearing from otto frank. but i also agree that the moving picture of the young girl with the dark hair and the familiar big eyes at the end was particularly memorable. another thing about the holocaust that i kind of disagree with the documentary...is that i don't believe it was just a matter of discrimination...but rather something deeper and more profound, and that was just an act of pure evil. pure evil. nothing else but pure evil.excellent documentary of anne frank and of the holocaust that should be watched.

as good as schindler's list was, i found this movie much more powerful as it is a documentary and based on real life. it details the story of the frank family, and anne in particular. although it is a bit slow moving at first (detailing their family life before the war); it becomes very powerful.due to some of the footage and photos of the camps, i would not recommend it for children but for adults, it illustrates the horror of the holocaust through one young girl. highly recommended.

through the years i've been very much interested in the life of this teenager who left such a profound, indelible mark on the world. my fascination has also been born of fear, as in, could this happen again.and throughout the ensuing years, yes, i fear 'it' continues to happen around us and of course 'it' was happening long before anne. the 'it' of course is can a so-called civilized society turn on its own or on an innocent country/race/continent and murder citizens in cold blood on the flimsiest of excuses? i leave that question out there.at the beginning of the documentary there is a statement about the leader adolf hitler in that the one profound fact about hitler that is never mentioned was that he was elected democratically and all of the atrocities committed were done as the result of a compliant poodle-press and fear-mongering propaganda played over and over again for a docile population.one of the atrocities was anne frank, who put a face to the death camps by the miracle of her diary's survival.kenneth brannagh does a wonderful job on the commentary and interviewing, he has that rare gift of minimizing his own persona thus allowing the subjects to speak for themselves.many new facts and people never before interviewed are brought to life in the meticulous research, which i will not go into here as they add immeasurably to the reality and gut wrenching sorrow of the film.glenn close reads selections from the diary and her voice is perfect for the part, she brings a naivet√© and freshness to the role.old childhood friends of anne's are interviewed at length and her last days before death are well recorded and witnessed along with her vibrant and mischievous personality.this is not to be missed. a wonderful and respectful film about the seldom seen anne.10 out of 10.

the diary of anne frank is the second best-selling nonfiction book in the world, and for good reason. nonetheless, sitting through this documentary about her life, which fills in some of the details where the diary left off, i thought, "just another documentary about anne frank." i found it to be competent but not extraordinary. that was my complacent attitude because i was already well aware of the story of anne frank; most of what the documentary had to tell me wasn't news to me.everything changed, though, when i got to the end of the documentary---when i saw the motion picture footage of anne frank. the emotional impact of seeing this footage, only a second or so long, made everything that came before it a thousand times more real---but not just everything that was in the documentary; everything i had previously known about anne frank suddenly became more real to me, more personal. i'd always been moved by her story, but when i saw that footage, what i felt was stronger and deeper and more profound than any other film experience of my life. (i knew beforehand that this documentary contained live footage of anne frank, and i'd even seen the footage in a movie review on television, but seeing it in the context of the documentary was a completely different experience. it's not likely that my mentioning it here will spoil it for anyone.)i realize now that many people still don't know the story of anne frank; it's discouraging at times to be witness to this kind of ignorance. i think to myself, "how could someone not know the story of anne frank?" this being the case, though, anne frank: remembered, along with reading her diary, is the best place to start. it's a story that everyone should know.

although the concept of a 32 year old woman portraying a 12 year old girl might be a stretch for today's sophisticated audiences,in the 1920's this was what the fans of mary pickford desired and expected from their favorite star. the opening scene displays annie's tomboyish character as the apparent leader of a multi-ethnic street gang in comic "battle" with a rival group. the sight of a young girl being socked in the jaw and kicked may be a bit crude, but the scene is played in such an "our gang" fashion that it would be hard to take any of this seriously. anyway, annie can dish it out as well as take it. once annie returns to her tenement home and replaces her street duds with more girlish attire, it becomes more difficult (especially in close-ups) to imagine this beautiful young woman as a street urchin. however, for those who can muster the required suspension of disbelief, the rest of the movie has it's rewards. vacillating between comedy (annie's gang puts on a show) to sentiment (annie plans a birthday surprise for her irish policeman father) to tragedy (her father is killed on his birthday), the film gives mary ample opportunity to display a range of emotions that would please her fans of any era. of course the requisite "happy ending" is eventually achieved; the evildoers are apprehended with the help of annie's friends and rivals and she is last seen in the company of her pals riding down a busy thoroughfare on a sunny day. which is a good a way as any for a mary pickford movie to end. 

mary pickford plays annie rooney--the daughter of a cop that lives in the tough part of town. she is a rough and tumble young lady of indeterminate age (somewhere between 12 and 16) who loves to scrap but down deep has a heart of gold.this is a very typical style of film for mary pickford. like so many of her films, she plays a young girl--even though she was nearly 40 when she made little annie rooney. and, like so many other stories, she was both plucky and courageous. as a result, i had a strong feeling of d√©j√† vu. now if you haven't seen her other films, this isn't an issue. however, she is essentially playing a character much like the one in sparrows or daddy long legs--though these two other films are a lot better. now this isn't to say this is a bad film--just that it's certainly not among her best work--mostly due to a rather "schmaltzy" story that is very heavy on sentiment but not especially convincing. entertaining but not essential viewing unless you are a huge fan of the silents.

annie rooney lives with her officer father and brother tim in the slums of new york, where she is constantly getting involved in many fights with the other neighborhood kids. annie secretly has a crush on joe kelly (whose little brother mickey is head of the gang that annie constantly battles), who is in a gang that is headed for trouble, says officer rooney. kelly sponsors a dance, where tony plans to shoot kelly in order to get even with him for making him look like a fool in front of his girl, but officer kelly gets fatally wounded instead. tim (part of kelly's gang) is told by tony, and friend spider, that kelly shot his father, so he goes after him in vengeance. annie learns of this and goes to stop her brother, if she is in time. very good mix of humor and heart in this film, even though the plot doesn't start until the 40 minute mark of the film. pickford is enjoyable (even though she was 33 playing a girl no more than 12-13) and really gets into her character. haines doesn't play kelly as tough as he should, but is able make the audience feel for him on an emotional level. the scenes where the officer tells annie of her father's death and the ending really put a lump in your throat. the mix of all sorts of kids throughout the film are fun to watch. rating, 8.

although it might seem a bit bizarre to see a 32-year-old woman play the part of a 12-year-old, mary pickford soon makes you forget the incongruities and simply enjoy the fun.mary is a street kid in new york city, with her own lovable gang of mischief makers, whose attentions are engaged by the older william haines (he was 25 at the time & just on the cusp of his own screen stardom.)to give away too much of the plot would not be fair. suffice it that mary is great fun to watch & amply displays why she was hollywood's first and most beloved super star. production values are very good, with lots of extras making the nyc street scenes quite believable.

la antena, an audacious film by argentine director esteban sapir, succeeds both as a reinvention of the silent movie genre and a gripping cautionary tale. the setting is a city in thrall to mindless television, its people deprived of the power of speech except for a solitary and mysterious screen presence known simply as the voice. in a bid to cement their grip on power the marvellously villainous duo of television mogul mr. tv and mad scientist dr. y set out to kidnap the voice and turn her unique talent towards their own dastardly ends. it is up to a young family and the voice's nameless, eyeless son to stop this evil scheme. the result is a roller coaster of a story that is bewildering on occasion but never less than engrossing.this is a silent movie that wears many of its influences on its sleeve; the overt references to silent movie greats such as george melies and fritz lang will be readily apparent to anyone with a passing familiarity of their work. but more subtle references and symbolism lie behind such tributes. i particularly like the fact that mr. tv and his henchman drive around in typical 1930s gangster cars, drawn from the decade when the silent movie era died away and a very different industry began to emerge.la antena mines the clich√©d plot devices and theatrical over-acting common to so many silent films, albeit in a very knowing and humorous way. it is the astonishing visual style of la antena that really sets it apart from the movies that it pays homage to. from the hypnotic tv logo to the menacing hilltop transmission station, this film abounds with dazzling visual inventiveness that is the rival of a studio ghibli animation ¬ñ and all this using real actors and handmade sets.moreover, though the style is often intentionally corny and theatrical, this is still an unsettling, provocative and emotional picture. the use of religious symbolism throughout la antena lends added resonance to the struggle between the tv empire and the waning power of words. at the same time, many of the most powerful images are original ones, including the hypnotic swirl of the television sets and the nightmarish tv food factory.i hate to end this review on a sour note, but i feel that the english-language release of la antena is let down by the subtitles. the original spanish subtitles are used to great effect, with much playing around with words on screen. however, the english-language subtitles that accompany the original dialogue are frustratingly incomplete, with omissions and mistakes at times leaving the viewer to piece things together for themselves. la antena is nevertheless a striking piece of cinema; a visually breathtaking experience that displays great energy and humour whilst narrating a powerful cautionary tale.

the summary line is some men's wet dream for the ideal woman ... ;o) seriously though, back to the movie, which has classic cinema written all over it (pun intended and quite literally shown in the picture, too as you'll see)! how could someone make a silent movie in this year and age? it's not completely silent for once (take the music for instance). with great cinematography is the answer. and it's no wonder that it did win prizes (as another user stated) in this area! but it's also sometimes it's downfall. although the pictures are great, it sometimes delves too much in them instead of moving forward (plot and time wise). if you can cope with that, than you'll enjoy it even more than me. i haven't told you anything about the story, but i'll never do that, because i don't want to spoiler anything for you ...

some would argue that argentinean director esteban sapir's la antena is an exercise in anachronistic futility; that, while the silent films to which sapir's pays homage were at the cutting edge of cinema when they were made, they are outdated today, leaving la antena a meaningless oddity.i would disagree. fervently. la antena melds the conventions of the silent film with 21st century technology, making it the ultimate exercise in post-modern film-making.the film is set in the timeless "the city without a voice", so called because the citizens have been rendered speechless by mr. tv, a dictator/media mogul with his hair painted on. the city resembles the titular one in fritz lang's seminal metropolis (1927), perhaps 100 years before that film. it is all expressionist skyscrapers, tv aerials, and animated billboards.the citizens of the city are mollified by la voz (the voice), the only person with the gift of speech. her face perpetually shrouded by a hood (kept on even when she is naked), la voz is forced to sing on mr. tv's television network. but when mr. tv concocts a plan to steal the written word as well, la voz and her eyeless son join forces with a renegade family in an attempt to return the freedom of speech to the people.la antena is nothing but pure cinema. burdening himself with the conventions of the silent film, sapir has to rely upon images to tell his story. there is sound, most notably in the almost continuous score by leo sujatovich. it evokes the best of silent movie music, as well as ingenuously working itself into the film's diegesis, such as the beeping of car horns, or the rhythmic ra-ta-tat-tat of gunfire. and, underlying the whole film is a familiar whirring, as if it were being shown on an ancient projector.there is a fair amount of dialogue as well. but instead of using intertitles, sapir has the characters' words appear in the frame. they are larger or smaller, filling the screen or hovering meekly in the air, depending on what is being said. think a more imaginative version of the subtitles in night watch (2004).thankfully, the words don't distract from the images. which is very fortunate indeed, because la antena boasts some of the most creative and original images we've seen in a long time, all captured by cristian cottet's sumptuous black-and-white photography. there are the expressionist cityscapes. the hooded singer and her eyeless son. there is the city's abandoned aerial, which looks like the decayed remains of some colossal spider. and there's the sinister dr. y, whose jabbering mouth is displayed on a television screen attached to his face.la antena has been criticised for relying too much on its imagery, while skimping on the allegorical depth. but, again, i would disagree. it is true that the sudden appearance of a mind-control machine shaped like a swastika, or the eyeless boy seemingly crucified on a star of david, feels out of place, a tad over the top in what is otherwise merely a well-crafted fairy tale.but the lack of overt symbols (the two previous examples aside) works in the film's favour. it allows us to make up our own minds: to decide whether to infer political meaning, to see la antena as an allegory for fascism, the danger of capitalist monopolies, and the power and responsibility of the media; or to just take the film at face value, as a visually stunning adventure through a world simultaneously unique and familiar.the sacrifice of explicit depth in favour of unique imagery may seem like a compromise. but, really, when a film looks as good as this, it's hard to care. there is more imagination and artistry in every frame of la antena than hollywood can shake a derivative stick at. evoking films almost 100 years old might be futile, but in doing so, sapir may be showing us what is lacking in the films of today. he may be telling us that it is time for another artistic revolution. and he may be right.

i didn't see such a movie where the creators put so much heart's blood into their work and paid attention to the finest details for a very long time.everything was well thought and perfectly put into reality. camera-work, editing and compositing worked so good together it was just amazing. the titles were so fun and so perfectly choreographed.this movie just blew me away.the "showdown" could have been cut down by 10 or 15 minutes though.it's a near to perfect homage to early silent noir films story, acting, scenery and costumes were perfectly fitting and believable to have com from the times of silent film-making.

for those who appreciate the intersection of silent cinema and social commentary, this is a unique film. part homage to german expressionism, part allegory, the film is replete with visual symbolism and an artistic style that rivals anything seen since the 1920's. moreover, the attention to period detail and the visual composition of the scenes as an instrument for advancing the story is stunning. aside from this, the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its effect on social voice, perception, and opinion. in truth, it's not so much the silence that permeates the film as it is the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and express thought that inevitably follows. in sum, this film is something not often seen and, as the producer of the film said in the q&a that followed, will leave you thinking about its meaning well into the next day.

i've seen this movie twice on transilvania international film festival(tiff), the movie is in competition and i really hope that esteban sapir will get one of the awards (at least the best image award). as a silent cinema fan i'm interested in contemporary movies that quote or recreate the language of the yester-year cinema. the previous reviewer emphasized the quotes from fritz lang and fr. w. murnau. as i see it, the movie references directly lang's metropolis, and the allegorical-parabolic character of his plots. but i didn't see murnau in it. there's a more obvious melies-homage though: the moon with a (here cigar-smoking) human face, and the paper-made, painted mountains and city-landscapes. i enjoyed the film mostly for its visuals, and in the meantime i found very interesting the story on muteness, and the creative means of communication used by the inhabitants of the voiceless city. from this perspective this movie is an unique reflexion on the muteness of the silent cinema, because in the films of the silent period one can hardly find stories with mute characters. in this case can be questioned whether the story on the stolen voices was the motivation for the silent film form, or there's an intention to play upon the muteness of the silent films. another example of this kind of reflexion i found in guy maddin's careful,where the inhabitants of a mountain-village have restrictions in using their voices. i intend to write a paper on it, if you know movies related to this topic, please let me know!!! i highly recommend esteban sapir's film to every moviegoer (one of the critics called it: the jewel of the festival).ps: winners were announced, and the film won the award for best cinematography!

la antena (esteban sapir - argentina 2005).a completely unique take on silent cinema in this fairy-tale like story by esteban sapir, beautifully shot in black-and-white and practically without dialog, "la antena" is a feast for the eye and a must for lovers of german expressionist cinema, with most of the nods to the works of fritz lang and friedrich murnau.'the city without a voice', 'la ciudad sin voz', is ruled by mr. tv. he has taken the inhabitants voices and is in total control of all spoken words and images, forcing everyone to eat his own brand of tv-food. mr tv is not just a monopolist, he is the personification of evil and totalitarianism, even the swastika appears as a symbol a number of times. he secretly works on a hypnotizing device to control all the citizens minds through his television broadcasts. for this purpose, he kidnaps the only one left with the voice, a beautiful singer, but a tv repairman witnesses the kidnapping and flees to an old tv antenna in the mountains in order to halt mr. tv's evil plans.the production design is stunning with beautiful sets and imagery. although shot primarily with the basic language of silent cinema, esteban sapir also adds a number of fresh techniques of his own, like a combination of typographic and animation techniques. everyone talks with each other through text balloons (usually floating near their mouths), the louder they talk, the larger the characters. the texts themselves can be pushed away or crushed. in the opening sequence, we see a book, titled "la antena", that opens and a city of paper rises from the pages. there are hardly any references to argentina. it's constantly snowing, which gives the film a very un-argeninian feel, while the surreal setting suggests any large city in the northen hemisphere, with only some of the songs revealing the film's argentinian background.the pace is swift and there is so much happening on screen, it's hard to keep track of the film's surreal narrative. not only breathtakingly beautiful to look at, we're also given a few messages about media monopolies, corruption and totalitarianism, but they are breezily packaged. one of the most original films i've seen in years. a delight.the film was shown as the opening film at the iff rotterdam 2007.camera obscura --- 9/10

all y'all hatin' on the fact you'd probably neva make the cut for "second string" need to save it. if more guys out there took their sorry behinds to the gym for once...maybe y'all have a chance....well,...maybe. take shawn woods' "hook" physique for a "perfect" example...and i stress the word "perfect" put that in your pipe and smoke it...!!! you couldn't look better sha-shawn

so forgive the *really* lame game-play scene, cardboard background and studio like stadium. for this part i should have give the movie 5 instead of 7, but read on...from the premise to plot there is a lot similarities with "the replacements". some say this movie rip off "the replacements", while some say this script wrote before it. both movies require some sort of "suspension of disbelief on the basic premise, and this is especially difficult for "second string" since it has nfl license team and all the history behind it. food poison excuse may sound too lame for some people, and not to mention in "second string" bills has to overcome big scores again and again, with the limit budget in shooting the game play scene, this make it look even bad. in "replacements", the premise and the league is fictional yet you know it happen in real life. i believe it is easier to accept fictional story and setting with real event ("oh yeah, this happen before!", rather than real setting/background with fictional scenario ("there is no way bill can win a superbowl!"; some of the scene were actually shoot in pre season game of raven games, real stadium, real audience and some nfl match alike shooting angle.but let say both movies came out on the same day, and we erase the budget factor (thus forgive the game play action scene): overall, i like "second string" over "replacements", not by much, but i like this more. it has "relatively better" character development. in "replacements", keanu character is too "out sync with the world", and all he care is maybe, get a girl? in second string you see the struggle of the qb from getting the job back, and deal with his past with coach. or the fumble guy problem. this "hold the ball all day long" solution of course is not new, but we see progression in fixing it.how about those trick play? i think it is "relatively realistic" than "replacements". the "dan marino" like fake knee pass, flea-flicker, wild cat full back rush, all real, except sometimes this look a bit too easy. but for me it is better than "replacement"'s center catch and rushing for 50 yards call, or how a 60 yards field goal look too easy. oh btw, i am glad they didn't force the te kicker made his shot....of course ---if you objectively review this movie over other football movies all there, this could easily be a 5 out of 10 movie. but some say this is the worse football movie? try "the comebacks".

being a bills fan, i originally found it annoying that they made a movie about the bills and the losing of four superbowls. but once i began to watch, i felt really connected. it was actually nice to see the "bills" win the superbowl, and i must say, that for a tv movie it was actually very well done. gil bellows as the qb, and jon voight as the old-school coach did a very fine job. 8 out of 10

in the year 2000 (keep in mind, this is two years ago, not four), two men had the motivation to create the most miraculous piece of art on this side of the mississippi.thanks to jere cunningham and tom flynn, the world can now enjoy second string, a delicious tv movie depicting a tale of a rag-tag gang of second stringers (thus the title) who are thrust into the position of starters due to an order of bad oysters.because of the motivational direction of both the director robert lieberman and the buffalo bills' last minute qb, dan "give 'em hell" heller (portrayed by canadian actor, gil bellows) the oft super bowl snake-bitten bills find themselves in the ultimate position.with an intriguing mix of internal and external conflict, a love story, comraderie that only the fine sport of football can bring, and an overall theory that the underdog can compete, second string is an excellent movie worthy of viewing every possible moment that it appears on tnt.the only thing potentially bad about this production is the spelling of the costume designer's first name, jenifur jarvis.

for a made for tv movie i thought that it was a great popcorn movie - don't expect anything to be very accurate and don't expect any award winners in this bunch but i do recommend this for a tv type version somewhat like "the replacements". look for cameos from real nfl players & officials.

the emperor and the assassin (w/english subtitles) at 161 minutes is long, but the time is packed with a story that barely fits into it. golden hued palace scenes and dusty yellow panoramas of chinese landscapes background a true story of china's unifying king, circa 300 bce. an intricate plot with a myriad twists and turns is played out with excellent portrayals by the cast. king qin's simple wish for a unified empire for his common people is fulfilled, but not without treachery, plots and counter plots and oh yes, bodies. lots of bodies. this epic story of china's beginnings is a great way for westerners to glimpse little known asian history. emperor qin's legacies include the thousands of life-size terra-cotta figures which are still being excavated today. as an historical person, this film makes it clear that emperor qin should be regarded along with george washington, napoleon bonaparte, alexander the great, genghis khan and julius caesar, to name a few of the world's greatest conquerors/statesmen. i highly recommend seeing the emperor and the assassin, especially on the big screen.

for a feature film, the plot closely follows history--or at least historical gossip. but then the chinese, who know the story very well from seeing it portrayed again and again, would never tolerate it otherwise. the attention to detail is wonderful, especially for anyone who has read sima qian's account in the records of the historian. jing ke, according to sima qian, did indeed make an attempt on qin shi huang's life at the request of the crown prince of yan before unification. sima qian explicitly mentions both the head of general fan and the dagger rolled up into the map, as well as the dagger being thrown into the brass column. although jing ke is described as no stranger to swordplay, he's hardly the invincible warrior portrayed by chen kaige. jing ke is indeed this film's weakest link. in reality (again, according to sima qian), he was a heavy drinker and put off his visit to qin for as long as possible, spending a good deal of time with the ladies of yan before the crown prince finally ordered him on his way. he was, in short, a human being and was not looking forward to death although he was willing to accept it. chen kaige's jing ke is afraid of death, but not his own. he is the classic ruthless killer turned disillusioned pacifist. his love (or maybe just affection) for a woman and pity for several hundred children whom zheng had buried alive (not even two thousand years of hostile confucian historians claimed qin shi huang did this, although there is a legend about him burying 460 confucians up to their necks and then beheading them)is enough to make this former assassin kill again. the melodrama is not convincing and the character ends up being just plain boring. the acting here isn't shabby, though not very interesting given the character. as for lady zhou, in all the numerous stories i've heard about qin shi huang, she's never come up. anyway, gong li is famous enough for americans to have heard of her (thanks to zhang yimou) and there needed to be a love interest, so here she is. it's unfortunate that her performance is almost as wooden as jing ke's character. she's done much better (in qiu ju for example) at being subtle; here she just barely manages presence. but all of this is trivial compared to the extraordinary acting of li xuejian as zheng himself. qin shi huang is for the chinese rather what milton's satan is for us: accepted as a villain, but a noble one. qin shi huang's accomplishments radiate an awe all the way across two thousand years into the present and li captures his frightening will without compromising his humanity. li's performance is enough, but the scope of the film is grand although the photography is purposely drab. it does feel ancient. the score is adequate, scarcely moving though very appropriate to the action. though i've only seen it once, i believe that chen kaige should be given more credit for his camera work than other reviewers have allowed him. the opening credits are exhilarating. if five stars its absolutely average, i given three more for li xuejian's acting and chen kaige as an actor, writer, and director.

this is an excellent film. no, it's not mel gibson in "braveheart," but then, it's not trying to be. actually, "the emperor and the assassin" probably has (thankfully) more in common with a shakespearean production than a hollywood blockbuster.in the third century bc, the king of qin is attempting to unite (in other words "conquer") the seven kingdoms of china. he has already overthrown the kingdom of han. now he needs an excuse to invade the kingdom of yan.this is where the lady zhao comes in. she and the king have been friends since childhood. they are obviously very much in love, but cannot marry for political reasons. together they devise a plot. she will pretend to have fallen into disfavor with the king and escape to yan. once there she will convince the prince of yan to send an assassin back to kill the king. when the assassination fails, the king will have his excuse to invade yan.once in yan, however, lady zhao begins to reconsider. hearing and seeing more and more examples of her old childhood friend's ruthlessness, she begins to wonder if the king may need to be assassinated for real.one sure sign that you're not watching a hollywood production is the final encounter between the king and the assassin. unlike a hollywood movie where the hero and villain are clearly defined and the final outcome already predetermined, this is a fight that could truly go either way.this is a well crafted and well acted story of a tumultuous time in chinese history. there is a mixture of both incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. most beautiful of all, however, is gong li as the lady zhao. i grow more and more convinced every time i see her that gong li is the most beautiful woman in the world.i must say, however, that she does have one unintentionally funny line in this film. early on gong li asks one of her servants "do i have a beautiful face?"duh!!!

after watching the movie a few times, i found so many subtle touches and emotions within the dialogue. jing ke, the assassin has become one of favorite movie characters of all time. this fine chinese actor says more with his eyes and his economy of words and movements then any big screen american actor today. qin, the emperor, is brilliant as he leads the audience to believe the kindness in his heart, only to unleash the most cruel acts upon the people around him. the promises he makes with incredible passion and shattered with an evil fist. gong li, as in just about every movie i've ever seen her in, is simply fantastic. her screen dominance is so graceful and emotionally charged.in case you couldn't tell, i loved this movie.

this three-hour chinese epic, set in 220 b.c., may ultimately amount to a familiar theme of an emperor's idealistic dream of peace through unification mutating into corrupted isolation, and there's nothing inherently challenging about the film, but it's a compelling narrative, crammed with intrigue and passion and betrayal and epic events told in vivid strokes. even for those not drawn to such historical spectacles for their own sake, it's an astonishing feast for the eyes: the scene depicting the coup attempt of the marquis is one of the most staggering evocations of physical space and grandeur in memory, and the battle scenes are memorable both in their scope and their immediacy. the title sums up the film's use of compelling contrasts - huge plainland vistas set against intimate horrors; the noblest of motives set against the most degraded; hope turning to dust. if you've never seen a three-hour chinese epic, this wouldn't be a bad place to start.

this is an epic film about the unification of the ancient kingdoms of china in the third century bc. what makes it interesting is the tragic downfall of the king and all the palace intrigue going on around him. it reminded me a bit of "king lear" and some of the other shakespeare plays.the king starts out with noble ambitions, to unify the kingdoms under one ruler and to stop all the quarrelling so that the people can prosper and lead better lives. he and his childhood sweetheart, played beautifully by li gong, concoct a scheme whereby she pretends to go into exile in a rival kingdom in order to recruit an assassin to kill the king, thus giving him a pretext to go to war. but while she's away, the king becomes sadistic in his lust for power and goes on a killing spree.there are numerous side plots that keep the action going. there is the marquis, who pretends to be stupid and foppish but who's really very clever and wants to become king himself. he fathers two children with the king's mother and manages to keep it secret for years. then there is the prime minister, a political rival to the king, who turns out to really be his father. the assassin is a complex character himself. an adept swordsman and killer, he is undergoing a reformation when the king's lover comes to recruit him. he wants nothing more with killing, but is eventually won over by li gong (who wouldn't be?) when he sees how cruel and vicious the king has become.some spectacular cinematography, especially the battle scenes that are carried out on a grand scale - like they used to say, a cast of thousands, literally. the acting is ok, nothing special. it's the story that's interesting, though at over two and a half hours, it pushes the limit.definitely worth viewing.

i will admit my ignorance of this film's existence, until i saw it advertised on a cable outlet. i was very impressed with the novelistic structure of the film. the film, which is in a language i do not understand, shone with intelligence and nuance for me. i think this speaks to the film's quality. it was visually stunning. the acting was visually entrancing. the chinese theater traditions of movement, used to enhance the delivery of dialogue, is so compelling after watching western film, where actors traditionally focus more heavily on the dialogue. the action in this film comes right at you, without a lot of explosions to get your attention. it is human action that is so affective here. the added advantage that the film taught me history about one of the world's greatest tourist attractions, the funereal clay army of china's first qin emporer, was very impressive. it seemed to give the film an international relevance beyond the film's great ethical themes. this is a film i can comfortably recommend to a wide variety of friends and acquaintances.

i've read some grumbles about the court scenes. these people betray their ignorance. this production went to simply amazing lengths to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story occurred. courtly manners are something few people outside the court ever see. while the acting may appear highly stylized, it is, in fact, as close a replication as possible of the behavior of individuals in their particular stations as the director could create. the actor's facial expressions are a marvel, particularly the duplicitous marquis changxin and the king's mother.there are, of course, reflections of both greek and shakespearian tragedy in the relationship between the king, his parents and his love. the juxtaposition of the king transforming from good to bad and the assassin from bad to good provides much food for thought on the evolution of an individual's nature. this movie would provide much to ponder in a college course on the humanities.at the same time, it almost rushes along, even in the slowest scenes heading towards an inexorable denouement. one suspects the involvement of large portions of the troop movements, which were quite awesome. it makes the lord of the rings battle scenes pale by comparison. few directors have the ability to literally field thousands of humans on the field of battle just for art's sake. i recall one scene in which at least 30,000 troops can be seen moving across a huge plain. the logistics for such a shot would have been staggering.i could go on... but simply, i can't recommend this film highly enough.

angela (sandra bullock) is a computer expert but, being shy and somewhat of a recluse, she does all of her work from the confines of her condo. just as she is about to take a vacation in mexico, a co-worker sends her a computer disc with disturbing information on it. angela agrees to meet with her fellow employee but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash. angela heads to mexico but takes the disc with her. while she is sunning on the beach, a terrific looking gentleman named jack (jeremy northam) makes overtures to her. she falls for them and the two end up on a boat to cozumel. however, jack works for the folks who generated the secret information on the disc and he is out to get it. even after angela escapes from his clutches and lands back in the usa, jack makes things difficult. he changes angela's identity on every computer across the nation, making her lose her condo, her bank account, everything. can angela, a computer whiz, beat jack at his own game? this very exciting movie has many assets. first, bullock and northam are two very beautiful, interesting actors and their presence adds immediate captivation. the script is very clever and sure in its knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their relevance in today's world. the costumes, sets, production, and direction of the movie are also quite wonderful. and, despite how it sounds, there is a great deal of exciting action as angela goes on the run to defeat her enemy. if you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, this is a great choice. it delivers twists and turns with great frequency, making it possible for the viewer to "net" a very good evening of entertainment.

it was a movie that made ya think a little. some parts a little cheesy, some parts pretty good. plot did thicken at times and just when you thought angella (sandra) found a friend the friend was fraud or dead. all i got to say is that dennis miller should have been in the whole movie. his character was the best, very refreshing after all the crap angella went through. he would have lifted me and angella through the dumps.

when "the net" was first being advertised, the ads made it look ridiculous. then, when i saw it, it was actually quite good. angela bennett (sandra bullock) spends her days working on the computer and has never gotten to know her neighbors. then, through a series of events, her identity gets erased by a cabal of shadowy people, and she can't prove that she exists.some parts of the movie are a little bit far-fetched; you'd probably know which parts if you saw the movie. still, it's a good look into what the existence of the internet may have wrought on unsuspecting people. i do recommend it.

you could get into the nitty gritty of this film, and say how it couldn't happen, or how could the main character just walk into offices and start using computers etc without someone noticing and really pick the movie to bits...or you could just sit back with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the acting. personally, i prefer the latter, i live real life and watch the news with all it's doom and gloom, and so would much rather be entertained by my movies, and see the bad guys get their just rewards. don't take it too seriously, and you can thoroughly enjoy this film.

this movie is a warning to all people sat surfing the internet on a typical day at the office. my warning is ,do not reveal too much about yourself, 2 be careful who you cross!! ,there are spies on this internet thing. i thought that it was so scary what that man and woman combination did to poor angela bennett, i did not realise that somebody could take ones life away in one click of this mouse angela i thought did a sterling job of outwitting jack delvin and that awful girl my question is, why does that computer make that noise when it works? like a clicking sound mine does not do this or this one. this film also tells you that there is fraud on this internet also why couldn't angela do the virus destroyer programme at a cybercafe? i also thought that like all computers the transfer rate to disk was slow that is correctly portrayed in this film when you save the programme to your floppy disk the bar only moved slowly!!! i quite liked angela's house at the beginning of the film as well why did no one believe angela???

wow! in my opinion, the net is an excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller that will leave you feeling good all over. when i first saw it, i was feeling good all over for days. when angela (sandra bullock) went to mexico, i thought to myself, "that is a really nice place to vacation." from the moment jack (jermey northam) and ruth (wendy gazelle) began chasing her, i thought to myself, "don't let anything bad happen to her! please!" i also took quite a few deep breaths to prevent myself from screaming any more than i already had. on the bright side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. in conclusion, i give this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller four stars.

this is a solid underrated little thriller, that has thrills-a plenty, with a cool story, sandra bullock is terrific!. all the characters are great, and i was surprised by how unpredictable it was as there were only a few predictable moments, plus sandra bullock is simply amazing in this!. jeremy northam played an awesome villain, and i know what bullock's character in this is all about, because i'm kind of the same type of person(i hardly ever go out), plus this is pretty well made and written for the most part. this should be higher then 5.5 in my opinion, plus denis miller was surprisingly better then expected in his small role. the scene where northam terrorizes bullock on his boat was quite suspenseful, and was one of my favorite moments, and i also liked the chase scene in the carnival, plus i liked the ending too, as it was quite well done, even if i did think northam was defeated too quickly. there are lots of other good chase scenes as well, and it's also clever at times too, plus there are quite a few shocking moments as well, this is a solid underrated little thriller, that has thrills a-plenty, with a cool story, sandra bullock is terrific, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is great!. irwin winkler does a great! job here with excellent camera work, adding good atmosphere, good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace. the acting is fantastic!. sandra bullock is amazing as always and is amazing here, she is extremely likable, tough as nails yet quite vulnerable, and i was able to feel for her because as i said i'm sort of like angela,i hardly ever go out, i really enjoyed her work in this movie! (bullock rules!!!!!!!). jeremy northam is excellent as the villain, he was sneaky, unpredictable and very menacing, he was great. dennis miller is surprisingly ok and non annoying in his small role, and managed to bring some comic relief. rest of the cast are fine. overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5

following the advice of a friend, i got myself this movie. i'm very fond of computers in general - hence why a 1995 film about identity theft on the internet could not be left unseen. i had some bad echoes about it, but in the end, i wasn't so disappointed : the story, though classical, is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres. i was gladly surprised when i figured out that contrary to what we usually see, computer-performed actions are somehow realistic, as they use windows 3.x and normal computers. the storytelling is median and not bothering the viewer. the end is typically american. the actors' performance is globally ok, sandra bullock usually annoys me with her "oh my god why me" way to behave, but this time she seems to have controlled herself. i'd recommend that movie.

i loved this movie!movies and plays fulfill their purpose when they expose social, political, and other problems that affect the majority. this movie served that purpose.i identify with the plot and know people to whom this has happened. at the time this movie was made, concepts presented in this flick were advanced for the public, yet had already happened to friends of mine by way of people in powerful positions. and, i know what it is like when people do to you what they did to angela bennett, because they have done it to me.i greatly enjoyed sandra bullock's portrayal of angela bennett/ruth marx. she portrays a pretty, intelligent, and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid giving up to overwhelming odds, fight hard to keep her sanity and restore her life, and try to protect those whom she loves. losing her self-concept and succumbing to that age-old attempt to bolster a sagging self esteem by indulging in sex with a stranger added a poignant touch of reality.the climax of the plot reveals the only real solution to this kind problem.

why all the negative reviews??? you didn't expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece did you??? what we have is a movie that tried to entertain us and it worked for me. not an oscar contender, just entertainment. you can really see how the movie has aged, especially with everything the internet has to offer nowadays. i still remember when this was first released and the net was still so new. crazy and scary thoughts when i saw this for the first time; i was 15 and seriously thought anyone could get a hold of your information on a computer and destroy you. but, who's to say it can't happen??? i'm not the type of person to nitpick a movie to death, analyzing it until i'm blue in the face. that's not my style. average acting, suspensful and once again, very entertaining. sandra bullock as angela bennett is so cute. this is my favorite movie with her in it because she's like the computer genius, which i find very attractive. of all the movies that were released in 1995, this would have to be my favorite, although, i didn't see it until 1996. my rating, 9/10 because it did slow down a little.

all the comments so far about this movie are negative but i have to say i found "the net" engaging. few movies can keep me on the edge of my seat but this one did. another plus for it is that most action/suspense films are full of language but this one had little profanity. i found it an enjoyable movie to watch. i am slightly biased though, being a big sandra bullock fan. *wink*

when this movie firt came out in 1995, i found it amazingly great. especially with sandra bullock.after having watched her brilliant performance in speed , i was ready to enjoy any of her movies.back to the net, it was a movie that keeps you in suspence.all in all, i enjoyed it so i give it a **** out of *****.

at last!! sandra bullock is indeed a beautiful woman, but i've finally found a film that she gets to be an actress! forget the predictable keanu-fodder of speed, forget the predictable kleenex-fodder of while you were sleeping - this tests her!and she is great! a techno-feminist role that really works well on screen, on a subject that is very close to the bone. the issues raised don't seem far-fetched at all and the whole experience, helped along by a fine supporting cast, makes for quite an un-nerving couple of hours.you may never enter another chat-room again, in fact i'm getting quite nervous just writing this review...er...bye!

this is one of the many techno-phobic movies that sprouted like mushrooms in the mid-90s, after the internet went mainstream.hollywood movies have always had their way in "beautifying" the depicted ongoings, to make them look better and more appealing. the same happens when hollywood tries to show us some hi-tech. the outcome of such attempts varies from being very far-fetched and ridiculous (see hackers (1995), johnny mnemonic (1995), etc.) to being quite realistic (see sneakers (1992))."the net" lies somewhere between those extremes. by nitpicking, one can end up with quite a lot of technical inconsistencies, and a lot of cases where the ongoings seem to be much more "sexy" and graphical than the way things are in real life (as usually happens in movies).however, by simply overlooking those, the viewer ends up with a quite solid, entertaining movie. the characters and acting are convincing, and the movie does a good job in keeping you in your seat till the end of it. the plot is okay (a fairly standard one, really -- based on the good ol' paranoiac design, but with a hi-tech edge this time), and quite convincing (again, when disregarding technical issues). the development of the plot is a bit sluggish, though, and occasionally you can anticipate some supposedly surprising turns in the plot.the bonus here is cutie-pie sandra bullock, which besides being cute (something she does quite easily, apparently), also portrays a solid act. you can really feel her character -- her despair, her emotions.in the bottom line, the movie is entertaining and interesting, rates about 7 from 10 in my scale. it's worth renting from the video library, or even watching in the cinema. whether to buy it or not is up to you.

just a short comment! i want to say that i like this movie very much! sandra bullock is my favourite actress. i like the whole story, from the beginning until the end! i have it on tape and i can watch it a 100 times, it doesn't matter!!!

this movie was suspenseful and fun to view. as i am a fan of these type of movies, i did enjoy this. the premise is kind of scary but the fact that i didn't rate this a 10 was because the movie was a little over the top in some areas.spoilers:cmon:nobody could identify this girl? i understand the concept of isolating oneself but i find it hard to believe that somebody-anybody wouldn't have been able to id this girl as angela bennet. that was over the top and so was the scene where she walked over to somebody's desk and started typing. this was overall a really good movie, suspenseful and keeps your interest. dennis miller was great as allen, really believable, bullock was good as the lonely reserved computer worker the bad guys all underestimated.i think the premise of the movie was really different-and scary. in today's times who knows what could happen? but some of the over the top scenes prevented this movie from being a 10. 8 of 10.

the net is an excellent movie! it's about angela bennett(in a great performance of sandra bullock) who is a computer expert who works for the cathedral company, cleaning virus and testing games for the clients. angela is a typical nerd who doesn't have friends outside of the cyberspace,almost doesn't take vacations and go out, and stays almost all the time connected. one day her friend dale hessman(ray mckinnon) asks her to help him,sending angela a disk with a strange program that has many confidential informations. at the same night, when dale was going to meet her, he is suddenly killed in a plane crash.going to mexico in her vacation,angela meets a beautiful guy called jack devlin (jeremy northam)who shows to be a cold blood killer bastard and one of the guys behind all the secret of the diskette.her life then turns into a nightmare: all her records are erased and she is given the new identity of ruth marx, a woman with serious problems with the police.this movie is great because it shows how we, humans,depend a lot of the computers and machines(sometimes more that we should) and how vulnerable we are if someday ,someone decides to control and change our personal records,without letting us the chance to prove the error.

if you're actually reading this review, i give you a lot of credit. you care enough to actually look up this movie, which most people have forgotten about and then cared to read beyond the first review! so for your reading pleasure...i'm assuming you know the plot line already so i won't waste time typing that out. i will mention that sandra bullock did an amazing job with this movie. she really brought a lot of sympathy to the role of a computer programmer, often difficult to do. i can say this because i happen to be a computer programmer.anyway, i thought the basic plot was a very good one. you can easily build sub-plots upon its mainframe and turn it into a very enjoyable movie. the premise is also scarily realistic in that this can all really happen if the right precauctions aren't taken.to make a long review short...oops! too late! if you enjoy sandra bullock bringing a role to life and want to see a very well made movie for the time, take a look at this little gem. you won't be disappointed. :-)

this is a typical sandra bullock movie in which she plays a mousy (but profane) woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero. sound familiar? there are plenty of holes in this story. things just don't add up and some of the suspense is a little corny. but - that suspense is very good. there is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it. the story starts off slow but kicks in pretty soon and stays that way, making it an involving movie for the viewer. that's why i give it a pretty good rating - the movie gets you involved in it. bullock is more cute than annoying, which she normally is to me, so this is my highest-rated movie with her in it.

i saw this stage show when it was broadcast on pbs in 1983. i was involved in local theatre at the time and had seen some pretty incredible stuff out of the dell arte players, but bill irwin floored me.i was most impressed at how a man of his size (he's quite tall and beefy) could fold himself up into a small box without so much as a pause for adjustment and move across the stage at a dead run without even a whisper of sound from his feet if he chose not to make any noise.most amazing for me, though, in this performance, was the way he rose to his feet during the jack-in-the-box / marionette piece. those who saw this show will recall that when he climbed from the box and collapsed to the floor with his body limp and limbs akimbo, he "pulled" himself up by the top of his head as if by a string, and rose not just to his feet, but to a full ballet point¬óand did it in one fluid, seemingly effortless motion. just consider the strength, grace, balance and focus such a series of movements must take in order to accomplish them the way he did! add to his physical prowess his strong and believable characterization skills, and there lies a consummate actor / performer. my jaw dropped at the movement and my heart broke at the portrayal of a puppet who is determined to be more than just a lifeless thing in a box.as to the unfortunate (yes¬ó"tragic" would be a better word) unavailability of this piece in home media form, i have noticed that much of pbs' works are not available on tape or dvd. sometimes, pbs shows will be available for direct purchase from them for a limited time immediately following a broadcast, but they seldom stay on the market for long. there are exceptions, of course, but these are mainly the science and history documentaries; rarely does an arts piece remain in print for long¬óassuming it ever made it into vhs / dvd to begin with. i don't know why this should be so; certainly, pbs could use the income from home media marketing of their shows, but they don't take advantage of it much. this is a shame. there are many things i've watched on pbs that i wish to own, but pieces such as "the regard of flight" are, i'm afraid, a one-shot, once in a lifetime treat, never to be repeated on pbs again and never to be available for home media purchase. that really sucks. i'm lucky to have caught it when i did.oh, yeah¬óour local library did get a copy of "the regard of flight." and yes¬óit was stolen.

i saw this performance on tv and taped it. my daughter played it over and over again. i loaned out at work and everyone just loved it. it is just brilliant physical comedy. bill made an appearance here in california, (he was working and living in new york) and performed the regard of flight on stage. i was able to take my daughter and her girlfriend to see this brilliant performance.bill was awarded a federal endowment, and my daughter wrote him a letter of congratulations, and bill was so kind to write her a note back and enclose a photograph.people ask me, and i can't decide if he is a comedian, and actor, or a clown. actually he is all three. i really wish this was on dvd, my tape is lost.

this adaptation for tv was a wonderful vehicle for bill irwin to show his ability to perform physical humor. with the backdrop of a struggle between an actor and his writer/director, bill uses his clowning antics to showcase a variety of skills including hat tricks, pantomime, dance and various physical devices.although it takes a big swipe at the entertainment industry and his craft, it is engrossing for people of all walks and ages.this work was televised as a pbs special. bill performed a piece of it on the tonight show, but out of context it did not go over well.

i loved this movie when i was a kid. i saw it theatrically. randy edelman did a good composition of the soundtrack. david seville is the chipmunks' father and recording manager. the chipmunks consist of alvin, who is best known for playing the harmonica, simon, who is a bright and studious chipmunk & theodore, who is the youngest and is always hungry. there is a lady known as miss miller, who looks after the chipmunks and has 3 daughters known as brittany, jeanette & eleanor, who all have the same character as the chipmunks. my favourite songs from this soundtrack include "diamond dolls", the girls of rock & roll", & the touching "my mother". alvin really wanted to see europe when dave had to go there for business. the chipmunks meet the chipettes playing the around the world in 30 days video game which led them to race each other doing the real thing.

to this day, there isn't a movie i've seen more times than the chipmunk adventure, nor has any movie brought me more happiness. this is by no means the greatest film or even the greatest animated film, but to an 8 year old girl in 1988 it was the coolest, funniest, most exciting film ever! i'm still equally as impressed today with the musical numbers, each one a standout song with wonderfully dramatic lyrics in the epic tradition of 80's pop (think pat benetar on helium, only catchier). controversy has stirred over the blatantly suggestive tone of the chipette's song "gettin' lucky with you", which to me seemed much more innocent at the time. however, looking at it as a rational adult, i can totally understand the concern; you've got three young girls in skimpy harem outfits passionately proclaiming "getting lucky is what it's all about". the chipettes' were definitely sexualized tenfold for this movie.but this controversial issue doesn't even come close to overshadowing the chipmunks' otherwise fabulous feature length animated adventure, i encourage parents and childless adults alike to check out this movie. especially if you were a child of the eighties/early nineties like me. :-)

well...it's about time! van damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that's his best film in recent years. the plot isn't too inventive but the whole border patrol theme is interesting and the ex-marines as drug smugglers twist is cool. but what makes this movie awesome is the fact that van damme is back to doing martial arts again. his latest films have been more acting oriented, but in "the shepard", jcvd is back to dropping the bad guys and looks to be in excellent shape. there are some impressive fight scenes and van damme shows he can still pull out the old famous 360-spinning heel kick. for being a low-budget action movie, it does have good sets and great stunts. van damme says some humorous lines and shows that he's improving as an actor. i'm glad he's back to dealing out some van damage...i've been let down by the lack of fighting in his recent films. scott adkins is great in his role and van damme and him have a 1 on 1 showdown at the end. overall, it's one of van damme's better films and it will keep you entertained. a must rent for jcvd fans. i'm just keeping my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic like "bloodsport" or "kickboxer". nok su kow!

the chipmunk adventure there are some movies that i could watch all my life and never grow tired of them, and this nostalgic favorite is one of them. the chipmunk adventure was a 1987 attempt to bring the old favorites back to the forefront of animation, this time on the big screen. in an age when disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation quality and box office, the chipmunk adventure stands as one of the best animated films that disney didn't produce in the 80's.the story is simple and elementary, having alvin, simon & theodore compete in an around-the-world race with the chipettes (janette, eleanor, & brittany). however, as the chipmunks encounter exotic dangers, they are unaware that they are the pawns in a major diamond heist.the chipmunk adventure never was and never will be a film that soars thanks to an engrossing plot. and to people who didn't love it as a child, the film will probably never be more then an enjoyable, yet forgettable, animated movie. but for me, it will always be a little known masterpiece. something about the film just clicks for me in a way few films do.every song is fun, upbeat, and harmless. highlights include the chipettes in a slightly risqu√© arabian dance to calm snakes. there's also a very sweet song in which the chipmunks sing about traveling the world and we get to see them at major landmarks throughout the globe. one thing about the chipmunk characters is that, despite the potentially annoying vocals, the songwriters always managed to write songs that were catchy without ever being grating. this film is no exception... it actually boasts one of the best animated movie soundtracks of the 80's if you ask me.every joke is cute, sincere and amusing. the bits between the bad guys and a pampered puppy are very amusing. and the shock of seeing the chipettes nearly forced into marriage by a child emperor is as well. the comedy manages to constantly play to the kids so that they don't miss anything, but everything remains charming for the adults with enough nostalgia to keep them entertained.it's really just a fun trip that is completely humble in it's ambitions. the chipmunk adventure never aims to be anything more then it is, harmless fun. i'll be the first to admit this is a biased review because i have such a nostalgic fondness for the chipmunk adventure that i would never be able to give it a bad review... but nonetheless, it fills me with such a childish contentment while watching it. everyone has their random favorite from childhood that no one knows, and for me it's this movie. and any film that i can watch over and over whether i am 5, 12, 23 or older is a great film in my eyes.... a- ...

one of my absolute favorite childhood films. the chipmunk adventure packs incredible fun geared for young and old alike. the animation is lively and colorful and the film itself boasts some of the best songs ever put in an animated feature. who could forget the dynamic "boys/girls of rock n' roll", the exciting "diamond dolls", and the heartrending "my mother"? this should be considered a nostalgic classic animated gem from the eighties. it's too bad they don't make them like this anymore. most animated films today resort to violence, crude humor, or sentimental mush... except of course the folks from pixar.bottom line: an amazing and unforgettable adventure for all ages.

i've loved this movie for a long time. i hadn't seen it in a while, so i again checked it out and actually found it even more enjoyable now. i loved the chipmunks cartoon when i was young, so naturally i adored 'the chipmunk adventure.'i honestly can't think of a better plot to this movie. it's not wildly creative, but i've always wanted to travel all over the world, and so i just have so much fun watching it as my longing to travel grows even more. the part with elenore singing to the little penguin always makes me cry...'the chipmunk adventure' will remain a favorite of mine forever, i'm sure. i guess it's because i saw it when i was so young. i don't think it would make quite an impact on someone older seeing it for the first time. (unless, of course, they have a young heart)

i enjoyed it. there you go, i said it again. i even bought this movie on dvd and enjoyed it a couple of more times. call me old fashioned but i prefer movies like this to garbage like die hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving america. van damme moves well for a guy of his age(47 i think), delivering kicks that reminds one of kickboxer. if you like old school action and and explosions, this is the movie to watch. this is one of van damme's best works.van damme and steven seagal movies get released theatrically where i live so i never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen.

this is the best direct-to-dvd effort from van damme that i have seen yet. van damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the united states. the action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with van damme's best. costar scott adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. for further evidence check out "undisputed 2". adkins is so good in fact that before i watched "the shepherd", i thought that van damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen. van damme holds his own though and although he isn't quite as athletic as adkins is, he can still kick with the best of them. all of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well. the only negative thing i can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped. i think van damme's character's motives should have been presented earlier in the movie, especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit. the reason he does is very cool but you don't find out until the very end. there are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a van damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it ain't character development. overall though, this is a solid action movie that i recommend. so run for the damme border!

this film is good in it's genre and that genre is naturally action with a little/average budget. looks like van damme delivers greatly better performances when he has a good director guiding him. there is your basic bar brawl, alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting. some basic drama, but nothing too deep. isaac florentine directs an ok action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it. but the person who steals the show is: scott adkins. how come this guy isn't a massive arnold schwarzenegger caliber action star that i don't know. director isaac florentine has made a movie with scott adkins before called special forces (2003) which has some unbelievable martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiastic. another amazing scott adkins feature is undisputed 2. check this guy out and make a noise, this guy needs to get super action star status and he needs to get it now!what else can i say about the movie? it's van damme stepping up a notch from some of his most recent work. no oscars here for sure, but you already knew that. but never the less it has a nice little town feel and i could find worse ways to spend my time. so i'm giving this a solid 7 out of 10 in it's genre.

after seeing undisputed 2, i knew what to expect from isaac florentine.the shepherd: border patrol is a decent flick (not van damme's best, but definitely not his worst.) there is some bad acting from vd's supporting cast, but it makes sense.the storyline and plot has all been done before, so it's nothing new. i mean this is van damme. we don't really expect much of an amazing plot do we? so lets talk about what we all want to watch this movie for anyway: the fighting.without giving anything away, i thought the way the fights were filmed and shot were well done, way better than a few of vd's recent movies such as second in command, in which the entire end fight is horrible. with florentine behind the camera, and if you've seen undisputed 2, he seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoys it. a few of the fights in the shepherd reminded me of vd's older stuff which is what we all want to see. the fights were good, and i said "hah, awesome" out loud a few times. but i was hoping for just a bit more considering how good i thought undisputed 2 was.something i found intriguing was vd's daughter in the film, i thought "wow she's kinda hot" come to find out, its bianca van varenberg, jc's real life daughter. i have never seen her before so that was a nice treat.all in all, this movie is not half bad. yeah the story has been done before but at least jc was attempting to make a good movie. next time though, add more hand to hand combat! i think he still has what it takes to do another big budget movie...his acting has improved since he's been doing dtv's and he really is in great shape at 47. i don't know about you but i'm one of the ones who thinks that most of his dtv's are actually good with the exception of derailed. all he needs to do is get back into "bloodsport" shape, and make a martial arts movie...and i think people would respond well even though he's not jet li. this movie is definitely worth the rental. =)

well it is a good movie. however, you have to admit that van dame's movies haven't been so great lately. on the other hand if you are a hardcore van dame fan you should watch this as there is a huge improvement with fighting scenes. also what i really liked is the music beautiful music. am sure this will kill time if you are action fan. as for isaac florentine the director of undisputed 2, i don't think he did a good job as he did with undisputed.i cant wait when one day van dame's movies hit the cinemas before the dvd. maybe, one day:).in the end it worth the watch if you got no other action movies to watch, this could make your hour and half fun.

the original female convict scorpion is an all time masterpiece. the first sequel, jailhouse 41, was not quite as good in my opinion, though it's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. director shunya ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film; the story is a bit different here, but still he's managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it. again the action focuses on nami matsushima (a.k.a. "scorpion") and this time she's out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back. after escaping from pursuing police officers, one thing leads to another and scorpion finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother. the prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother (...), while scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison. but scorpion doesn't like spending time behind bars and it's not long before she's back to doing what she does best.the film gets off to a great start as we see scorpion hack the arm off a copper intent on taking her back to jail. from there, however, the film slows down a lot and beast stable ends up being more of a drama than the previous two films. that's not to say that there isn't still plenty of action - scorpion still spends a lot of time in 'revenge mode' and the film isn't exactly short on general sleaze. meiko kaji once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and it's another understated, almost wordless performance. her screen presence is great, however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically. the plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a crescendo of revenge. there are more people who have angered scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up a fairly large part of the film. there's a few surreal sequences, not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second, but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point. overall, i would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality - not as great as the original and slightly better than the second.

since the past couple of days i'm really hooked on the "female scorpion" series and i keep hitting myself over the head because i waited until now ¬ñ which is way too long ¬ñ before purchasing the whole box set. "beast stable" is the third brilliant effort in a row, and the undeniably main trump of this series is how the writers always came up with something entirely new and different for each installment. never before, or after, has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines, settings, themes and filming styles. the original more or less qualified as a so-called "women-in-prison" flick (but already an atypical one), but you can't possibly categorize parts 2 and 3 as such, since they hardly feature any footage within prison walls. and the overall tone and atmosphere keeps changing with each new episode as well. the first film was harsh and gritty, whereas the second was psychedelic and part three is almost mainly melodramatic. don't let this last description discourage you, however, as "beast stable" still features more than enough exploitative themes and disturbing footage in spite of the dramatic ambiance. the opening sequence, for example, is downright fantastic. sasori, still a fugitive from the law, literally chops her way to freedom on the subway when there's no other possibility than to cut off the arm of the persistent policeman that handcuffed her. her run through the city with the cut-off arm dangling on hers while the credits appear on screen, accompanied by the familiar theme song, is just pure and genuine exploitation gold! the story compellingly continues with our heroine desperately trying to lead an anonymous life in the big city, but the poor thing simply can't escape her past or even new types of agony. sasori befriends a prostitute, though without exchanging dialog, and takes on a job in a sewing atelier. her own retarded brother (!) impregnates the prostitute, while sasori gets in trouble with the local pimping and underground crime network. she cleverly prevents a thug from taking advantage of her body, encounters a former enemy from prison and furiously avenges one of the prostitutes when she gets submitted to a barbaric abortion. meanwhile, the one-armed cop continues to obsessively prowl the streets, looking for retribution against sasori. our multi-talented director shunya ito formidably criss-crosses all these story lines to a powerful wholesome and never once loses grip on the visual aspects or ingenious filming style. "beast stable" features some of the most impressive compositions and ingenious camera angles you can imagine, the editing is flawless and the exterior locations are effectively depressing. those who know sasori's character a bit are aware that the film seriously lacks memorable dialogs, but this always gets widely compensated with meiko kaji's wondrous on screen charisma and menacing grimaces. there's very little sleaze, apart from the aforementioned incestuous sub plot, but the brief flashes of extreme violence are terrific and the twisted ending is almost too brilliant for words. in fact, i think part three might just be the greatest (or at least, my favorite) one of the series so far. my only small and totally irrelevant point of criticism is regarding the ridiculous sounds one of the birds produces when sasori is locked up in a cage. that bird sounds like a ventriloquist's dummy with stomach cramps.

time travel into the past is tenuous at best as a topic. in this episode a man who has been thinking about the possibility, finds himself at the date and location of the assassination of abraham lincoln. he tries everything he can think of in the short time available to him with predictable results. of course, he is thought to be quite mad. he is arrested and eventually remanded to the very man he is attempting to stop. serling was bright enough to let him return to the present, but is the present the same? this is kind of a precursor to "the time tunnel" where time travelers on a weekly basis were given the same task, overcoming what had already happened. unfortunately, the implications of the distortion of time and the future always negate the result. unless you have something like ray bradbury's "the sound of thunder."

the kid power hour featured two segments: hero high and shazam. let's start with hero high.hero high was intended to be a new archies cartoon, featuring their superhero identities: pureheart the powerful (archie), captain hero (jughead), superteen (betty), and evilheart (reggie). however, filmation couldn't get the rights to do it so they tweaked it a bit and came up with this. here's the breakdown of characters: captain california (archie), glorious gal (betty), weatherman (jughead), dirty trixie (veronica), rex ruthless (reggie), principal samson (mr weatherbee) and miss grimm (miss grundy). the show featured live action sketches, as well as cartoon adventures. the humor was the typical lame filmation jokes, but at least it had a sense of fun about it. it was entertaining enough for kids, though not quite up to previous standards.the other segment was shazam!, which was very faithful to the comics, unlike the previous live action show. all of the major villains made appearances, as well as the entire marvel family (including freckles marvel, in at least one episode). uncle dudley had the correct wc fields voice and shady character, as well as his perpetually acting up "shazambago". burr middleton, a veteran of 70's tv shows, like fish, voiced the big red cheese, while alan oppenheimer (rudy wells in the early 6 million dollar man episodes and voice of skeletor in he-man) handled dr. sivana.the marvels had always had a sense of whimsy to them, so little alteration was required for their adventures, to meet the broadcast standards and practices requirements (the censors). as such, the stories were very imaginative and inventive. amongst the villains who appeared were: dr. sivana, black adam, mr. atom, mr. mind, aunt minerva, ibac, and the crocodile creatures. mr. tawky tawny also made his on screen debut.hero high is due to be released from bci, but shazam! is still in limbo, as well as the live-action show. hopefully, the proposed movie will help shake them loose on dvd. it is well worth watching and deserving of dvd treatment.

after finishing the zero woman series, i was looking forward to the female prisoner scorpion series; both based upon comics by tooru shinohara. unfortunately, i was not able to see them in order, as this is the third in the series.it starts great as the scorpion (meiko kaji) is escaping from the police. detective kondo (mikio narita) did manage to get a cuff on her, but she proceeded to cut off his arm and get away. if that isn't bad enough, later on a dog digs up the arm and is seen trotting down the street before finding a place to enjoy his treat.scorpion might as well go back to prison as life is no picnic on the outside. first, a local yakuza tanida (v) threatens to put her back if she doesn't put out; and then the gang leader gets her when she gets rid of tanida. but, they don't hold her for long before she escapes and is looking for vengeance.soon they are dropping like flies. some certainly deserved it for wearing garish outfits with shirt collars so big they went all the way to the shoulder. the madam (reisen lee) turns herself in to avoid getting killed.the police arrive at her latest kill and trap her in the sewer. she's in there for a week and the cops find out that a friend (yayoi watanabe) has been supplying her with food. (the story o yuki (watanabe) and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting, but only incidental to the movie.) they try to burn her out, but this is the scorpion, and she has some unfinished business.not the usual mix of sex and violence, this is a slow tale that is beautiful throughout.

there's hell to pay when you cross nami matsushima(meiko kaji), female scorpion, and a dangerous group of thugs(..including their sadistic head pimp and his equally repellent lady), operating a prostitution ring with an iron fist, does just that. hell hath no fury like scorpion, and a determined detective, gondo(mikio narita), seeking revenge for decapitating his arm after handcuffing her, will do whatever it takes(..and that includes intimidating anyone who might know her whereabouts)to catch nami. nami finds an ally in hooker yuki(yayoi watanabe), who provides her a temporary shelter. yuki has a retarded brother who suffered a brain injury during a job, and must take care of him(..in a disturbing revelation, regarding incest, she also provides his sexual needs!)..she, in actuality, keeps him locked up in a room while working the streets! meanwhile, nami is targeted by a vile neighbor once she finds a place of her own(..she works as a sewer), and he threatens to turn her into the authorities(..nami was an escaped convict, who fled a subway from the cops)if she doesn't supply him sexual favors. his wife dumps a tea kettle of boiling water all over his face and body, resulting in death, & the prostitution clan come looking for nami to pay the debt of losing a very important member of their organization. that's when katsu(reisen lee), the pimp's lover and confidant, realizes that the one responsible for the loss of their loyal member is a former inmate of hers, scorpion. subduing her with an injected liquid drug, placing her in a bird cage(!), katsu embellishes in her imprisonment. what ultimately fuels nami's rage is watching a prostitute die outside her cell, a victim of a forced late-term abortion, left to bleed to death. finding a scalpel clutched in her hand(..from the operation room), nami will break free from the cage and prey upon each member of the clan responsible for the hooker's death. the series of scalpel murders provide gondo with an opportunity to catch nami, and he'll trap her in the underground sewers below the city, but can he catch or kill her? especially if yuki comes to her aid?trust me when i say there was no shackles binding director shunya ito or his film-making team because female prisoner scorpion:beast stable is yet another perverse, deranged, and ultra-violent entry in the very entertaining series. equipped with fine production values and a visually stylistic talent for capturing all of the madness in imaginative ways, ito pulls you right(..or he did me)into the twisted drama that always exists when nami matsushima is on screen. when you have a protracted opening credits sequence where your anti-heroine is fleeing through the crowded city streets with a man's severed arm handcuffed to her, the viewer has to know what they're in for! the incestuous sub-plot is simply bizarre(..and it's shot in a soft-core way with the retarded brother humping his numb, cold sister with dead eyes staring ahead!), and the entire abortion sequence is rather hard to sit through. but, the abortion angle, as disturbing as it is, provides motivation for nami's revenge..despite nami's imperfect ways, and her criminal nature, you would rather see her take these cretins out than vice versa. interesting angle with detective gondo, as well. gondo is willing to break the rules, and he becomes a force-of-nature towards anyone who stands in his way of capturing his mortal enemy. his fate at the end, visiting another enemy of nami's, in an isolated cell, while she looks on, perfectly encapsulates what makes these films so ridiculous yet so entertaining. the scalpel murders is a montage of slumping scumbags, in various places, the blades protruding from flesh, with nami leaving the crime scenes very driven to wipe the whole clan out in memory of a fallen victim of unfortunate circumstances. while the film is essentially a comic book adventure, there's a sadness that permeates, and few characters come away without flaws. i imagine many will walk away from this scoffing at how unrealistic female prisoner scorpion:beast stable is(..specifically how nami is able to escape capture time and time again, accomplishing her goals of revenge, paying back all those who have wronged her), but i looked at it as a violent action cartoon, much like the later 80's films, and enjoyed it for what it was. as always, this film features some beautiful asian actresses and some colorful heavies. meiko kaji, almost always reserved/quiet, yet chilly staring down her enemies with violent intent, is in fine form(..in more ways than one)and reisen lee, as her cross-eyed, repugnant adversary, runs away with the picture as a perfectly realized contemptibly abusive foe worthy of psychological torment(..when both are in prison, nami's ways of torturing her are sweet). my favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot, but is so wonderfully wrong, features a dog discovering gondo's rotted severed arm, walking through a street eventually finding a resting place to chew on it!

the third and final female prisoner scorpion film directed by shunya ito. the series' star, meiko kaji, would complete the series in the fourth installment, grudge song, directed by the capable yasuhara hasebe (who also directed kaji in the excellent stray cat rock: sex hunter). the original female prisoner #701: scorpion is one of my all-time favorites. the sequel, jailhouse 41, is nearly as good. it's generally considered the best of the series, and i might agree, i think, if it ever gets a better release on dvd (the original, by image, is very poor). beast stable, in my opinion, is nearly as good as fp701. it's much slower, much more contemplative. it has its share of violence and nastiness, but there's more focus on the story and the characters. sasori (kaji) eludes detectives in the first scene (she is handcuffed to one and lops his arm off ¬ñ and escapes with it in tow, which must be seen to be believed!) and hooks up with a freelance prostitute, yuki. yuki is being hassled by a local prostitution ring, which includes a goofy-looking madame with a cage full of pet crows. what really surprised me is how sad the movie is. yuki's story, which is never resolved, it heartbreaking. the images are startling, and ito's direction is masterful. it's too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the fp701 series. this is an awesome film.

many consider beast stable to be the last of the "true" female prisoner films, as it is the last of the series directed by shunya ito, and is followed by one other film (grudge song) by a different director. i have not seen grudge song yet (but soon will...) so i don't know how it stacks up to the previous fp films - but it will be interesting to see. the way beast stable ended didn't really leave a lot of room for another predecessor - but i guess i'll find out...this entry has scorpion on the run from the cops, where she hooks up with a street-hooker who ends up pregnant with her retarded brothers child (oh yeah - that's no lie...gotta love these sleazy story lines). scorpion ends up being kidnapped by an old rival, but (as she is so good at...) ends up escaping and taking revenge on some people that wronged a few of her hooker friends...i agree with some other reviewers, that this one is a little slower at points and more "serious" then the previous two entries. the story is somewhat confusing and convoluted at times, but a lot of these 70's era pinky films are - and i still love them. beast stable is lacking pretty badly in the nudity area which was pretty disappointing - but i thought it strong in other areas - storyline, cinematography, some good sleaze,etc...definitely worthwhile to fans of this sort of thing, or who have enjoyed the other female prisoner films...8/10

"female convict scorpion - beast stable", the third in the series, is a magnificent piece of pulp sleaze. closer in tone and subject to a nikkatsu violent pinker than other scorpion entries, it is stunningly photographed, directed with lurid enthusiasm, and populated with a rogue's gallery of villains and degenerates. shinya ito, the director of the first installment, returns for this surreal fable which begins with scorpion (meiko kaji) cutting the arm off a cop she is handcuffed to and fleeing into the tokyo subway with said arm still swinging from her wrist. she takes refuge in a red light district where she befriends a prostitute, who is first seen seen having incestuous intercourse with her brother (who ends up impregnating her). scorpion's desire to protect this unfortunate woman eventually exposes her identity and all hell breaks loose. she is beaten, sexually assaulted, and locked inside a bizarre bird cage in the villain's lair. i loved everything about this hypnotic, nihilistic, and emotionally touching movie. it is the superior of the three first scorpion films and features one great scene after another. i can't recommend it highly enough.

the third film in a cycle of incomparably brilliant exploitation movies, and the third masterpiece in a row, "joshuu sasori: kemono-beya" aka. "female prisoner scorpion: beast stable" (aka. "sasori: den of the beast" where i live) of 1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some aspects, but that equals (or arguably even surpasses) them in brilliance. the entire original sasori series with the wonderful meiko kaji stands out as the absolute highlight in wip cinema, and all of the films, especially the first three, uniquely combine exploitation and art-house cinema like no other movie does. "beast stable" is the third, and second-to-last "sasori" film with meiko kaji, the last one to be directed by genius director shunya ito and, in my opinion, the greatest of them all. the first film "joshuu 701-g√¥: sasori" of 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of exploitation cinema and simply the definition of exploitation-art. in the equally brilliant first sequel, "joshuu sasori: dai-41 zakkyo-b√¥" ito added more surrealism and symbolism. the third "sasori" film, "beast stable" keeps up the surrealism (allthough not quite to the same extent as the second), and features even more social criticism than its predecessors. topics like poverty, forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central themes of the movie. this third "sasori" film is ingenious and sublime in all aspects and arguably the greatest of the, generally brilliant, cycle (to me it's this one, with the first one as a close second). once again, "best stable" is both very artistic and very exploitation-like. the visually stunning film features an enormous amount of brutal violence and sleaze again, as well as sequences of enormous surrealistic beauty. the stunningly beautiful meiko kaji is once again brilliant in her role of nami matsushima (aka. sasori). i absolutely worship this wonderful actress, and i'm sure i'm not the only one to do so. the rest of the performances are also great, especially mikio narita is great as a police inspector who is obsessed with catching sasori. the musical score is the same throughout all three films, with "urami-bushi", sung by meiko kaji herself, as the main theme, which is great, since the score is, simply put, pure perfection. as its predecessors, "beast stable" is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of exploitation-art that no serious lover of film can afford to miss. the entire sasori-cycle ranges high on my personal all-time favorite list. "beast stable" is arguably the most brilliant masterpiece of them all! 10/10

i have been looking forward to the release of this dvd (and it's follow-up {female prisoner scorpion: #701's grudge song}) for some time. i very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series. after just watching this film, i would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three. all three of these movies were directed by shunya ito. what is great about them, though, is that, even though they all feature the same lead character (wonderfully played by meiko kaji), they are each vastly different from the others. the first movie (female prisoner #701: scorpion) is more or less a typical women in prison movie. but the character of scorpion is very intriguing - very reminiscent of the anti-heroes of many spaghetti westerns. and the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material. the second movie (female convict scorpion: jailhouse 41) is a real tour-de-force. not so much a wip movie as the bulk of the film has scorpion and six other escaped inmates on the lam. this movie (female prisoner scorpion: beast stable) is the third in the series and the last one directed by shunya ito. this one plays out as much more of a crime drama. once again, our heroine is on the run. but this time out, she has managed to maintain a certain amount of normalcy in her life (relatively speaking anyway). she gets a job, she finds a place to live, she makes a friend on the outside. but, of course, everything has to unravel eventually. fps: beast stable has a more straight-forward story that is told at a more leisurely pace than its predecessors. but i found it to be engaging from beginning to end. and don't worry: there is still plenty of depravity to go around in this movie! but i think these movies transcend most exploitation films because the more disturbing elements are played in a straighter tone rather than being used exclusively for in-your-face shock value. yes, there were definitely moments in this movie where i cringed mightily. but i didn't feel that they detracted from the value of the story (well, maybe a time or two). one thing i have greatly enjoyed about these films is the continued build-up of scorpion's mythos. with this entry character development is used much more extensively than in the previous two. we get to see that she is much more than just a stone-hearted vengeful badass!as i mentioned earlier in this review, a fourth movie followed. it also features meiko kaji as scorpion but had a different director. without giving anything away i want to mention that fps: beast stable ends in such a way as to make a sequel completely unnecessary. the fourth film is still quite good but it seems to play as a superfluous footnote to a mind-blowing trilogy.i would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in out-of-the-ordinary films. fps: beast stable can be enjoyed as a stand-alone piece (as can the first two movies) but i would also recommend watching the others first if you have not already done so.

i wish hollywood would make more movies like the china syndrome. because this one scores on every level. it has an intelligent, believable script. it shows you that it's not only nuclear power itself, but the money involved in it, that causes danger. and the movie also gives you a great behind-the-scenes look of how television is made.it scores as a thriller: the first time i saw it, it kept me right on the edge of my seat. and it scores as a character-movie: i really cared for the main characters. jane fonda, michael douglas, wilford brimley and, most of all, jack lemmon are great.

the china syndrome is a perfectly paced thriller and not slow or boring at all, as some people tend to say. the transitions from one scene to another are great and the tension build up in the film will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire two hours. jack lemmon is great, as always, as the somewhat nervous plant operator and jane fonda succeeds again in bringing some real emotions into the story. you can see this film as a political statement of the time, or just as an intelligently made thriller. either way it is definitely worth watching.

this film is definetly fonda's best film. the plot is amazing, the acting is amazing, and the directing is amazing. an all time classic, this should have won best picture not kramer vs. kramer. though it was not even nominated. jack lemmon and micheal douglas are also at their best. one of the best endings ever. if you haven't seen this film run don't walk to rent it. should have been on afi's top 100. see it not just for fonda but for everything.**** out of **** 4 out of 4

james bridges' "the china syndrome" is a first rate thriller; a model for those who want to make a genuinely terrifying thriller but don't know how.most thrillers end with the standard shoot-em-up and chase that ends with the villain getting what he/she deserves. but bridges understands that such a standard finale isn't the case in some scenarios. "the china syndrome" is thrilling in a way no one would expect. it has the type of ending that's so unexpected, but yet so logical.the film stars three (then) current oscar winners: jack lemmon (best actor 1973 for "save the tiger"), jane fonda (best actress 1971 and 1978 for "klute" and "coming home" respectively) and michael douglas (best picture 1975 for producing "one flew over the cuckoo's nest". this isn't your standard "spot the star" flick that became so popular in the 70s. the acting is so solid and strong that we forget who's playing the roles and believe that the characters are real people. that's a testament to the collective ablities of all three actors. they may be stars, but they're actors first.there is no music score in the film. asides from a few background songs from jukeboxes or tv shows, there is nothing. bridges doesn't allow any directorial style to come through on screen. he is simply presenting the material straightforward. with a strong dramatic story like this, we don't need a score to distract us. it kind of strikes me as a predecessor to the dogma 95 filmseries started by lars von trier in 1997. it focuses on the characters and story rather than style.the story is about a nuclear power plant located in southern california. **spoiler** an accident appears to have happened and basically the film is about lemmon,fonda and douglas try to expose the truth. in a way this is not a spoiler, since the trailer, tv spots, video boxes and reviews all give this away. but from this seemingly simple premise, a surprisingly complex morality play springs and the suspense comes from human nature and the actions of people rather than a villain framing another guy (although this is an element in the film). that's what makes "the china syndrome" so good.**** out of 4 stars

i rented "the china syndrome" recently mainly because i read that it was this film that inspired abc to make "the day after". "syndrome", however, is more of a thriller than a drama. the film is quite political, but i agree strongly with its message - nuclear power, though extremely efficient, is far too dangerous for common use. the risks are simply too high. hopefully, the persons in charge of real nuclear plants are far more responsible and ethical than those depicted in the film. however, given that the real-life near-disaster at three mile island happened mere months after this film was released puts that in question. (in fairness, that case was probably more one of incompetence than of corruption.)"syndrome" is not just critical of nuclear power, but also of modern news media, similar in vein to "network", only much more serious. being a print journalist myself, i am quite familiar with how people perceive the media; but it was a little frightening to see that even in the '70's tv news was already selling out. when jane fonda's character tries to convince her boss to let her do real news instead of fluff, she is advised not to try the change, as "research" finds that people prefer a pretty girl to do fluff, not hard news.what truly makes the film memorable, however, is the incredible suspense generated in its final third. during this period, the viewer is constantly fearing for the lives of the protagonists, whether the danger is coming from hired thugs or the potential meltdown of the nuclear plant. and that very last scene - i won't give it away, of course - but it will keep you guessing.on a final note, i did get a distinct feel watching the film that it seemed at times more like a tv movie than a true theatrical film. this could be, however, due more to the fact that the rental tape i was watching was quite old, and not formatted to fit tv screens the way videos and dvds are today.

this is a pretty good thriller at a nuclear power plant in southern california that was directed by james bridges and stars jane fonda, jack lemmon and michael douglas. fonda plays a tv reporter who wants to be an investigative journalist but is only allowed to be a tv reporter. douglas is an independent cameraman and lemmon is a supervisor at a nuclear plant. fonda and douglas are sent on a routine assignment at a nuclear power plant and an accident almost happens and they get it all on film. everyone tries to cover it up except fonda and douglas, so douglas steals the film. lemmon starts to investigate and finds out the company cares more about profit then safety at the plant. it's a good movie with a pretty good ending.

i loved this show. i think the first time i tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show. wasn't the shop located like right on the beach or something? i actually wrote back and forth with marci for several years. i lost touch and wish i could reconnect now as adults. anyone know where she is now? i wish they would put it out on dvd. i seriously doubt that since i think there maybe like five or six people who even remember the show airing in the first place. they just don't make shows like this anymore, do they? i wonder if it would still hold up in this day and age. do you guys know anyone that could burn dvd's of the show they taped on vhs? i'd be willing to pay(within reason).

the thirty years that have passed since the making of this movie have made the suspense wither somewhat, and will not keep the public as attentive as i am sure it did in 1979. it is still entertaining enough though - and regains some of it's power when one finds out its sad relevance today (check out the story of firstenergy's davis-besse nuclear plant). with the top of the line actors and steady pace one can learn to overlook the dated '70s environment, and see it for the political critique that it is. i doubt however it will survive the test of time. it might not be entirely forgotten thanks to its cast, but otherwise the dialog, setting and score will make a remake of this movie unavoidable . as the oil situation now is comparable to the situation in the 70's, and alternative sources of energy are again becoming a hotter topic, we can only hope the current generation gets blockbuster warnings about the risks of (privatized) nuclear power like this.

large corporations vs. conscientious do good-ers. we seem to witness events (both real life and reel life) of this sort all the time and most of the time greed wins by employing every means (dirty) necessary and the truth gets suppressed. at least in this movie jack godell (jack lemmon) got his points across and paid for it dearly. we have seen several more movies of this sort being made in the recent years, the most memorable of which was 'the insider' where russell crowe played a tobacco industry scientist who tried to blow the whistle claiming that the industry added more nicotine in cigarettes to make smokers addicted. there was also this reporter-protagonist angle where the reporter is looking for the scoop of his/her dreams and the protagonist is faced with this moral dilemma where he/she has to choose between righteousness and his livelihood and sometimes his/her life.jane fonda played reporter kimberly wells to perfection. she plays a reporter who wishes to pursue serious news whereas her bosses value her more as an 'eye-candy'. she and her crew (the cameraman played by post-'coma' michael douglas who is also the producer of the movie) witness an accident in a nuclear power plant while they were on a visit. cameraman michael douglas sneakily/illegally gets footage of that event on tape in spite being a no-photography zone and smuggles it out of the station. the station refuses to air it and informs the corporation that owns the nuclear station. in the mean time the chief engineer jack godell launches an investigation of his own and discovers a lot of irregularities in the equipment that's being used for the reactor. this starts all the dirty politics of corruption and greed.this is a good thriller and it managed to create a lot of tension in the audience till the end and the funny thing was that there was no background score to suggest all the scary moments. now that's great and unusual in movies. performances were all good and i love jack lemmon. we primarily know him for his comedic roles but he is equally good in dramatic roles. i give this movie an 8/10.

it was easy to dismiss this film as hyperbole at the time of its release. fonda, douglas and lemmon were known "lefties", but the accident at three mle island provided shocking context to this fictional drama.this film works on many levels, taking shots at both public utilities and tv news. 1979 was the zenith of the infamous "happy talk" format of tv news (see also "ron burgundy") and it's on display here in all its glory. the sonorous anchor grimly reads a story about a "grinding head-on collision" before cheerfully introducing kimberley wells (fonda), doing a story about a veterinarian who makes house (or is that "aquarium?") calls. the show's producer and the station manager argue about content - or lack thereof - behind the scenes.there are a few technical errors. the pr flack (james hampton) shows fonda and douglas the requisite scale model of a pressurized water reactor plant, built by westinghouse. later, as lemmon and wilford brimley (nicely playing lemmon's friend/colleague, caught between duty and loyalty) fight a sudden crisis in the plant' s control room, they're obviously running a boiling-water plant (built by ge.) a small point, but curious, considering how many details the screenwriters got right.like any good drama, the film asks more questions than it answers. the real-world accident at tmi proves the film's basic premise. the working title for the film was originally "power", and you'll see why. as nuclear power prepares to make a comeback in these days of $3 gas, "the china syndrome" is as relevant today as it was over 25 years ago.

it's some years since i've seen this movie, so forget most of the details. however, i loved it at the time and found the plot intensely gripping, the climax heart stopping. i remember being literally on the edge of my seat at the theatre back in 1979.jane fonda plays a los angeles reporter, kimberley, who stumbles upon an accident at a local nuclear power facility. she wants to go public with the story, aided by her hippie cameraman (michael douglas) who has photographed the event, but a sinister conspiracy attempts to cover it all up. jack lemmon is absolutely wonderful in the role of the nuclear plant's conflicted middle manager, torn between loyalty to his company and 'doing the right thing' by reporting the perilous situation. his facial expressions speak volumes here.apart from the engrossing plot and riveting tension, this film is all about jack lemmon, his character, and his superb acting performance. as for jane fonda (i was a huge fan of hers at the time), i suspect she just moved on from her anti-war protests to taking on the nuclear industry.this movie seems intended as a nuclear scare tactic. chernobyl and three mile island notwithstanding (they're different types of reactors), our canadian candu reactor is safe and well respected around the world. i wouldn't hesitate to reside near the nuclear power plant about an hour's drive away, where my friend works as a very competent engineer. apparently they shut down for every teeny problem, irregardless of the financial loss. i sincerely doubt that there are any conspiracies afoot there. one can hardly imagine any of the managers or highly trained operators willing to risk any sort of meltdown or whatever...it's absolute tomfoolery. of course the moral here is to spare no expense or effort either in building the facility or ensuring its ongoing safety. if we want our western lifestyle, we have to get our energy somewhere. for those who claim nuclear power can never be made completely safe (true, of course), perhaps they should volunteer as a coal miner or else return to pre electricity horse and buggy days. by all means, enjoy this entertaining and highly suspenseful movie, which apparently is based (loosely? embellished?) on a true story. it's a real chiller, a thriller, and maybe (?) even a killer, but please, don't get your attitudes about the operation and safety of nuclear power plants from it.

reporter kimberly wells presents the minor side of the news; puff pieces that don't hold much news merit. while shooting footage on alternative energy at a nuclear power plant, an accident occurs. friend and cameraman for kimberly, richard adams illegally films the men controlling the incident in the control room. jack godell, head of the control room, prevents the reactor from disaster. after an investigation into the incident shows nothing is wrong, jack can't help but feel something isn't right. on discovering that the weld seals on the generator pump are cracked, jack with kimberly and richard seek to tell the public and shut down the unsafe plant.nearly made thirty years ago, the china syndrome is a riveting drama that still holds so much relevance today. nuclear power has always been a hotly debated subject, whether it is the safest source of alternative energy, radioactive waste, and are nuclear plants waiting to be the next chernobyl. just not about nuclear power, the china syndrome explores freedom of speech, right of press and big business. on jack's findings of falsified information, his knowledge halts a massive investment on the construction of another nuclear plant, which many men seek to profit from. kimberly, desperately wanting out on the puff news, sees the fight for truth is more important than boosting her career; constantly pushed by richard, never wanted to be silenced demanding the public be told of the accident.jane fonda, michael douglas and jack lemmon are simply flawless. fonda shows kimberly as a fragile woman on her exterior, yet emotionally hard and determined to reveal this cover-up. douglas brings a strong performance as richard, fighting for honestly and truth. lemmon shines over all as jack., his performance is highly charged drama.the china syndrome is riveting viewing, that still holds much relevance today as it did when first released.

as long as you don't mind paying a little more attention than you normally might for other films, this is one of the best "thrillers" you'll ever see. the film portrays an incident that might occur in real life; nothing in it seems fictional at all, in fact. it also portrays how people might react in real life.in fact, it portrays these so well that is seems like real life. combine that with the lack of a soundtrack, and you've almost got the best news-like movie you've ever seen. jane fonda and jack lemmon are particularly good in this late-seventies masterpiece, evoking concern on her end and genuine tragic pity on his end. i highly recommend it to anyone who likes thrillers.

>>>>author: msgreen-1 from canada >>>>the big problem was the "china syndrome" claim - that if the reactor error occurred and radioactive waste leaked out it could burn its way straight through the earth to china. a lot of people have made fun of this and if the movie makers meant it seriously then yes it should be made fun of. the spill wouldn't make it anywhere near the center of the earth or even the molten rock. even if it did make it to the center of the earth how would it come out in china? it would have to flow against gravity the rest of the way! also china is not the opposite side of the world, the indian ocean is.<<<<< ......... ......... ........................ ................ ..................... .................. .............. ............ ................this point is brought up by the characters of the film, saying that of course it could not happen, as the core would hit ground water and release a radio-active cloud, raining down on the population.before you try to find a weak point in the film, you should watch it first!!!! don't judge a book by it's title...

i work at a nuclear power plant, so i am getting a kick out of these replies.seriously, i do. go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palisades_nuclear_generating_station and you can see where i work.i could not think of a safer industry to work in. we are required by procedures to report events as minor as paper cuts. any issue identified as being a potential concern with respect to nuclear, radiological, or industrial safety is immediately reported in the corrective action process.bottom line is that nuclear plants in the us operate with safety in the front of their mind.

again, i've read all of the comments posted here and agree with the many intelligent ones, but totally disagree with those who think it was/is hokum.personally, i think nuclear is about the only energy left to us, unless our governments (feds and states) increase the grants thinking homeowners will use photo-cells on their roofs. many attractive and pricey homes in southern calfifornia are designed and built to take advantage of the cleanest energy around, the sun. i live in a loft, which is exposed to total sunlight on its roof the entire day. i hardly use the ac - i'm sure it would consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees cooler. we are blessed with "dry" heat in this part of the country. i'm from the gulf coast of the usa, so i know about humidity.......that said, i found "the china syndrome" to be a convincing movie about what could go wrong, if the industry is not busy regulating and inspecting nuclear plants. i think there are enough comments posted here to enlighten those who still fear it like the plague: they are safe. tmi is still on-line....director james bridges carefully guides this plot (by mike gray-t s cook) to build suspense and to a thoughtfully interesting film. all the roles were well-played: jane fonda ("kimberly wells"), jack lemmon (jack godell") and producer michael douglas ("richard adams") are all excellent in their roles, plus all of the rest of the cast. i, too, loved there being no score. it was so interesting to get a true-to-life glimpse of the behind-the-scenes of the tv industry - that shouldn't be surprising. currently, dan rather is sue-ing cbs, and i hope he wins. can you believe donald trump saying "he's a loser" ? trump - who cares? "tiberius1234" posted a very good comment here - i agree. it is my opinion that getting "vaporized" by a nuclear spill is much better than living in a world which has been wasted, and becomes "blade runner" and/or "solyent green". come away from your video-games for a couple of hours and watch this "dated" movie (really isn't), and get a little education on nuclear energy. i recommend it to the whole family....

great film from the late 1970's. says much about corporate corruption at the expense of the common person, so that the powerful can gain gain huge profits and disregard the environment and safety of others.nearly 30 years later this film is compelling about the power of certain corporate entities that since the films release have gained ten fold in their ability to control; it shows the need for regulation of the public against powerful business interests whose primary goal is profit.jack lemmon is brilliant- while jane fonda and micheal douglas are as equally compelling in their roles. the frivolous 70s where damned for much, this film redeems the decade.a film that becomes better after each watching.

i'm sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people. the series started off very good and after the first season it wasn't that good.people tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end. this is not good to do, you should look at the total, not the end result. it is sad that a lot of the "usual" characters died but, damn, we had a lot of nice new characters.please do not attach yourself to a few characters but attach yourself to the series, the plot. please do understand that i didn't like it when boone died, when augur died but well... it needs to be done. can you imagine that everyone keeps living the whole series when they are in a lot of danger all the time? come on, face it, if they didn't die they would be invincible. in this way you will always keep the tension, will he survive, will he die? i do realize that people attach their selves to characters, i do that too. my favorite character was augur, the one who could get into every computer he wanted. he was the one who was mysterious, he could do things with the computer no one else could do.i wish to make one statement to all the people who vote negative, does a series which started so good deserve to have such low rating? should we look at the final season instead of the total? should we not see how good the series was when it started? should we not see how much we enjoyed it?

believe me i wanted this series to work, but the early departure of kevin kilner dealt a near death blow after season one. robert leeshock just wasn't right for the part and jane heitmeyer did an admirable job as lead but the series just got too messy and confused at that point. i don't know what happened in season five, what a mess. sometimes its time to drop the red cape and just stick the sword in the bull, if you know what i mean. the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict. if not for their talents and well-written dialogue they would have been two weird bald man-chicks in a b-movie series.if only this series could have ended at season 4 and picked up later by syfy...

it was on a day in 1891 when scottish inventor william k.l. dickson surprised his boss, thomas alva edison with his remarkable work in the development of motion pictures. after many experiments, dickson was now able to capture scenes of real life with his camera, and reproduce them through his invention, the kinetoscope, as if a fragment of time were preserved in celluloid. soon, dickson's kinetoscope would become an enormous success as a new way of entertainment, with many people eager to pay the nickel that was charged to be able to watch people dancing, or acrobats performing stunts through the "peepshow" of the kinetoscope. however, the invention wasn't complete, in order for it to capture on film the real life as we know it, sound was needed on the movies. so dickson kept experimenting and this short experiment, kinetophone's first film, was the result.in this experiment, codenamed simply as "dickson experimental sound film", director william k.l. dickson stands in front of a recording cone for a wax cylinder (earliest method of recording sound), with his violin on hands, playing a song named "song of the cabin boy". the idea was to record the song into the cylinder at the same time that the camera was recording his movements. in order to show that this was a motion picture, two of edison's "black maria" laboratory decided to do a little dance in front of the camera. unlike what author vito russo claimed in his book, "the celluloid closet", this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality as it obviously is a reference to the environment of loneliness of the lab, akin to the lonely sailors to whom the "song of the cabin boy" was dedicated to (the title russo suggests, "the gay brothers", is actually anachronistic as "gay" had no homosexual connotation in the late 1890s).sadly, dickson was unable to achieve the desired effect, and the kinetophone never could really produce the synchronized audio with images. while he had the cylinder with the sound and the celluloid with the images, the synchronization of the two elements was not exactly effective, and the sudden appearance of auguste and louis lumi√®re's cin√©matographe prompted edison's team to focus on projecting systems and eventually dickson left the company. fortunately, in 1998 dickson's cylinder with the movie's sound was rebuilt and film editor walter murch made a restoration of the experiment as it was intended. finally, "dickson experimental sound film" could be heard with synchronized sound, just as its creative inventor had intended. while it was not a successful attempt, this outstanding film is a testament of the enormous genius of the father of kinetoscope. 8/10

ok, everybody agreed on what was the best season. the first. and killing off boone was a bad desicion. also killing off others was bad. blame the directors and writers for it. bad boys. but. i still think this is the best scifi series ever! sorry guys i can't help it! i see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season. still it's easy to accept liam as the new main character, if you are over boone. he is really... mysterious. the thing that shocked me most was when lilli was written out of the story and how. that was something she didn't deserve! and what do we get? some blonde chick called renee, with absolutely no character! but these taelons stay mysterious, and you stay wondering about theyre true plans till the end. true suspence. the conversations between zo'or and da'an are sometimes brilliant.i understand that, when you jump in on an episode from the 3th,4th or 5th season, you may not understand this show. but when you watch from the beginning, you just cant break loose!the acting is great, the special fx are marvellous, the music is beautiful and the plot intriguing. gotta see this, guys!

the very first talking picture has returned from oblivion, and now you can hear it and see it! in autumn of 1894, at the edison lab complex in west orange, new jersey, thomas edison's associate william dickson tried to combine two existing technologies (the phonograph and the kinetoscope) to record sound and image together. in the event, dickson was unable to synchronise the playback of sound and image, so this experimental film was never released to paying audiences ... and consequently (unlike many silent films which dickson made for edison at this time) it has no official title. the silent image (recorded at 40 fps) has been in the library of congress for years, known to film historians as a mute curiosity. it was also known that the 'soundtrack' had been recorded on one of the crude wax cylinders languishing at the edison national historic site ... although nobody knew which one.but now that's changed. recently, curators located the wax cylinder, which had broken into several pieces. these were reassembled: a playback was obtained, and the sound was digitised. hollywood's veteran soundtrack editor walter murch cleaned up the background noise and tweaked the digitisation to make it synch with the film image, which murch had digitally compressed to 30 fps. sound and image are synchronised at last!the film begins with an offscreen man's voice calling: 'the rest of you fellows ready? go ahead!' (the unseen speaker remains unidentified, but was probably dickson's assistant fred ott.) on screen, dickson plays a violin into an immense funnel mounted on a tripod (one of edison's sound-recording devices) while alongside him, in full view of the camera, two male lab assistants embrace each other for some quick ballroom dancing to the tempo of dickson's music.the film lasts barely 17 seconds: just long enough for us to marvel at this crude technology before being provoked to laughter at the sight of two men waltzing in each other's arms. speaking of which, here's a warning: a well-known but extremely inaccurate reference book ('the celluloid closet', by the late vito russo) includes a frame enlargement from this movie and identifies it as 'the gay brothers'. that's incorrect. 'the gay brothers' is an entirely different movie, made by dickson at the edison lab during this same period. 'the gay brothers' never had a soundtrack: it's a brief fiction film about two brothers who are not 'gay' in the sense russo meant it. the deceased mr russo, for his own reasons, wanted us to perceive dickson's experimental sound film (arguably the first movie musical!) as an artefact of 19th-century homoeroticism. (hmm, what is it about gay men and musicals?) sorry, but there's just no such content here.this vitally important film deserves a rating of 10 out of 10. i've often maintained that no 'lost' movie should ever be considered irretrievable unless it was deliberately destroyed: i'm delighted to report that this film is finally available to audiences as its producer intended it, more than a century after it was filmed!

i'm not saying anything new when i say that "ray" was magnificent. as i proceed to laud this movie i have to mention something that sets it apart from other films. very rarely is a film made entirely by the actor(s). "ray" quite simply was made by jamie foxx. without the wonderful performance of jamie foxx, "ray" would just be another interesting and informative biopic. i always thought foxx was funny, stemming from his days with "in livin' color" and "the jamie foxx show", and i also knew that he was talented, as he used his own show ("the jamie foxx show") to show off his musical talents. but never did i imagine that he could pull off a role like this. i don't know much about acting and what they go through to get into character or other things like that, but what i saw from jamie foxx was extremely impressive. he wrapped himself into that role and made us see ray charles rather than an actor portraying ray charles. the story of "ray" was great yes, but it was given life by jamie foxx.

gene roddenberry never let his fans down. his death ended sci-fi legacy that will never be matched. earth: the final conflict was proof! his pilot film and the first 2 seasons were well written and meticulously produced, but somewhere along the way the roddenberry touch was lost. the loss of lead, kevin kilner (william boone) definitely hurt the series as he was a vital part of what made it work. the story involves the human race being visited by the taelons, an extra-terrestrial race who dub themselves 'the companions'. after 3 years they have given earth new technologies, helpful information about the universe and more. many question their intentions here on earth. the main liaison on earth between the races is da'an (leni parker) and he is to many, the most trustworthy taelon. questions arise: just why are they here? what are their goals, is da'an aware of any suspected plots against the humans? there is an underground group led by millionaire industrialist jonathan doors (david hemblen) who utilizes his millions to investigate the taelons. by the end of the first season things are going well, da'an seems trustworthy, boone assists doors in his investigation while working with da'an and the taelons as a liaison. in the middle of the 2nd season things start unraveling and the once terrific and fascinating series spirals downward, mostly because roddenberry had died and was not around to guide the producers, of whom his wife majel barrett-roddenberry was co-producer. still, the first season remains intriguing and fun to watch.

earth final conflict began like a new world, a new vision from the creator of star trek, something fresh and unique full of great elements. a very good cast with an extremely credible kevin kilner as william boone, an ex cop good begins to work as guard of some kind of ambassador of a mysterious alien race (talons), after the dead of his wife in strange circumstances. but soon the character of kilner joins to a group with the mission to discover what are the truth intentions of the aliens, why they seem to be so nice and care for the human race. soon this resistance group begin to discover the sinister plans of the talons using the humans in they own problems to survive they own destruction. as i said before, the show began great, all was almost perfect, including characters like da'an, the original da'an was a big mystery because he seems to be a nice creature but at the same time he has his own evil plans manipulating some people in earth. soon came zo'or who wasn't bad but... mark the beginning of the fall of this show because he became the first big enemy of humans, the incarnation of evil, killing what could be something greater in da'an. the first seasons ends in a great way with the dead of boone and the second shows a new lead character (liam) an hybrid being of human and kimera (another alien race) with some very interesting powers. he replace kilner character in a good way so another storylines make it better, including the conflict with the jaridians and the atavus. but as i said lines before the evilness of zo'or begin to take more importance so the new conflicts were less realistic as the same talons. with time the whole great storyline of the alien roots of liam where almost totally erased the same with other things of the previous seasons. so when the final season began the original earth final conflict was just an almost forgotten dreams, all the magic was missing, just to let some vain intents to keep alive the show including the return of kilner and liam for a few episodes. the final episode was just the evidence of how bad was the show with so many bad changes (to think the writers of some episodes didn't know anything about the first stories), it was one of the worst end i have ever seen in a tv show. a real shame because earth final conflict began like something unique, fresh, the stories the cast, after watch so many show from usa, something from canada from the mind of the creator of star trek was wonderful but in the end all change to worse. i hope someday someone make a remake of this show, of course using nothing from season fourth and fifth (except the cast, everyone were perfect in his work). i still can dream in a better things.

i remember this film fondly from seeing it in the theatre. i recently found a copy on vhs & it held up to my memory of it. while obviously not a "big budget" film, the acting is quite credible & the scenery, locales, & costumes are very well done. i only wish the mammoths had been in more of the picture, but when you see them, they are also well done (remember, sfx was done in those days without benefit of computers, some poor devil had to actually put all that hair & fake tusks on real elephants!)...the same effect was used on the elephants in "quest for fire". a better than average adventure film & a chance for the star, rod cameron to play something besides a cowboy, which he also did very well over the years.

interesting tale of giant mammoth elephants running amok in modern india. features transparent special effects-elephants dressed in shaggy coats sporting tusk extensions. all this said, we do have a good story and a fine cast at work, and an exciting climax. it's been said that the running time on this one was doubled when it showed in india-courtesy of robert lippert, a master at 'padding.' given a choice, opt for the shorter version.

i can't really criticize this film. it is literally the first film i ever remember seeing and lead to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals. fortunately, seeing it again years later, it held up fairly well. rod cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths. no one believes him, including his best friend, played by cesar romero, whose brother was among those killed. and rod cameron was the only survivor. the film was shot in india and has some good scenery. the acting is on a high level. i don't believe rod cameron, cesar romero and marie winsor ever turned in a bad performance. the mammoths, when they finally arrive are fairly effective. the ending also has an unusual twist, particularly for a 1950's science fiction film. definitely worth seeing.

the jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie. the only sci-fi part is the woolly mammoths living in the present day.elephants are attacking villages in a part of india and these attacks are also killing people. an expedition is sent to investigate and one of the members of this, an american hunter blames these elephants are being frightened by woolly mammoths, which are suppose to be extinct. nobody believes him at first, but they do when the mammoths appear at the end. an earthquake finishes them off.the jungle was shot on location in india and has a lot of nice scenery and some good indian music, including some songs which keep the movie moving along nicely. the mammoths are actually real elephants with fur coats and long tusks stuck on.the cast includes rod cameron, cesar romero (the lost continent) and marie windsor (cat-women of the moon).the jungle is worth seeing, just for the scenery and music. very enjoyable.rating: 3 stars out of 5.

this was a surprisingly very good movie, and an interesting idea.. however, it was just a little bit disappointing in that the 'twist' was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie. whilst watching, it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that, the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist, but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow. there were superb performances, there was never a dull boring moment, so totally well worth watching this one. it kept me interested right up until the end, and for me there isn't many movies that can do that these days. i highly recommend people watch this terrific little movie.

this movie is a mystery. it's not scary, it's spooky. you'll probably jump at some points and for some of it you'll be scratching your head to figure it out. it unfolds its mystery through the main character eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum, don. he needs her to search for some clues to vindicate himself from murdering his mother, and once eve agrees to help him, she completely opens up pandora's box and unleashes some very strange things, including malachi. i won't go into malachi, but i thought the way that played out was complete genius. i know movie buffs won't regard this movie with the same prestige as other classics because it doesn't have anyone very famous in it (angelina jolie's brother was excellent, but maybe he should have asked his sister to show her face just so this movie could get some recognition) but i do think the way the malachi ending works is something to talk about. i've recommended this to my friends, definitely worth the purchase or rental price.

stephanie meyer is going to be so ticked! now, her book "breaking dawn" will not be first with that title. sorry, twilight fans.kelly overton (the ring two) is medical student, eve, who is assigned to interview psychotic don (james haven - angelina jolie's brother). i suspected the twist, and when she found out they both grew up in the same town, i was sure of it.she kept getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that i felt there was a shared delusion going on. at times, she even acted like she had ptsd. i really thought she was losing it.well, she wasn't losing it, and when the end came, i was floored. my whole suspicion turned out to be wrong. the twist was even more amazing than i believed.overton was fantastic and the story is so much better than something stephanie meyer would come up with. a must see.

i caught this movie on local t.v. at about 4:30 a.m. i didn't have expectations for it but after the opening credits i knew i was into something good.there are situations that are left for your interpretation to "find out" what really happened so your attention is a key factor.the whole psychological thriller situation deals a lot with character development and the way things are executed by the main character.your sub-conscience also plays an important part because through a series of events and dialogs you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinion.the technical aspects are very good. really good in fact. kelly overtone is extremely sexy and she's candy for the eye although she's most of the time in her white clothes.the fear factor is almost inexistent but there's plenty of mystery and tension to dig from.i would recommend it for those who enjoy supernatural and psychological thrillers.

i wanted to love this movie. everything seemed to be in place for an enjoyable, if not groundbreaking, film. it was set in southern france, good-looking and recognizable actors led the cast, and i really admired the vibrant african costumes, the proverbs and music. despite all this, i didn't love it. movies are supposed to convey their meaning at the first viewing, but "secret laughter" doesn't do that. nimi and matthew, as played by long and firth (both of whom have played romantic leads before and should have known better), radiate as much warmth and passion as dried fish. i used 'dried fish' deliberately, because it was one of a few - too few - strong lines and moments sprinkled throughout the film. another winner was when nimi catches matthew snooping around her apartment. he finds a book of hers with her first name written on it and says: "your name is nimi. i never knew." then he insists that she call him by his christian name. i watched this scene intently as matthew asked nimi over and over to "say my name", realizing that up until that moment, they always called each other by their last names. i thought this was a turning point for the film, and expected that it get better. it didn't. why do nimi and matthew always seem to stand at ten paces, even in that "say my name" scene? what does matthew like about nimi, aside from her obvious beauty? and why would a sensible woman like nimi fall for a comic book writer who regards his marriage as something he can put on hold when a beautiful exotic 'adventure' comes along? and i'd like to add that it was a little hard for me to get behind a romance built on adultery. yes, jenny is a vicious harpy, but if i were in her shoes, but i'd probably match her cruella tactics to stop my husband from straying. believe it. the story hints at nimi's painful past, but never fully explores it. some critics say firth seemed a little awkward here, and i agree. for goodness sake, the actor summoned more palpable longing and passion as that early 19th-century snob mr. darcy (and while wearing those hideous britches)! as for long, who did shine in 'love jones', there were times when she seemed to concentrate more on her accent than playing her character. even so, there were many moments ¬ñ the 'say my name' scene among them ¬ñ when she was in total control and came across really well. yet, 'secret laughter' is not without its redeeming qualities, and i've found that it grew on me with more viewings. nene was well portrayed as supportive and well-meaning, even if she doesn't fully understand nimi's attraction to matthew. i absolutely loved it when nene faced off with mama fola in those dueling proverbs scenes. my husband liked it, and usually he's the first to sigh and throw insults at the screen if he doesn't like what is going on. he even chuckled at the scene when sammy asked matthew some very frank questions about sex. so there you have it. 'secret laughter' was good enough to entertain an avowed curmudgeon like my hubby, but an avid moviegoer like myself will need more than one viewing to appreciate what the director and writer were trying to convey.

i've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it.the conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and matthew are very touching. the nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually is.although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation; if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place, the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandable.luckily, optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understand.i would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see. i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it.

personally, i think the movie is pretty good. it almost rates an 8. i liked the ethnography aspect as well as the gorgeous photography. colin firth's character isn't the most likable but he does a better than decent job with the role. the heroine, played by the beautiful nia long, is a familiar film heroine in that she's trying to do what she thinks is the best for her child -- marrying a respected member of her expatriate community -- while fighting her attraction for the "bad" man -- one who's not a member of her community (the "outsider"). most of the film is about this mother's struggle: should she do what's expected of her, what she thinks is best for her son or should she follow her heart? i don't want to give away the ending. let me just say that it's a feel-good movie with gorgeous location shots, exquisite african dress (it's worth seeing the film just for the women's brilliantly colored african clothing and headdresses), and likable characters overall. the actor who plays nia long's son is bright and adorable. the plot is a bit formulaic, but i liked the movie nonetheless. if you're a colin firth fan you must see this film. if you like chic flicks, see it. i think i'll watch it again tonight!

i love this film. there is something for everyone. it if funny, saddening, passionate and dramatic. the mixture of two completely different cultures creates a whole new world that the viewer cannot help but want to be a part of. i must admit that i am slightly biased, as colin firth is my favourite actor and so nothing that he does is wrong in my eyes (!), but in this film his tremendous acting talent is apparent and it is furthered even more by the beautiful acting of his co-star nia long. the problems that their love affair suffers makes it, ironically, more believable and the simple features like the contrast between the colours of matthew's and nimi's clothes alone, makes this film all the more enchanting. i defy anyone that cannot be moved by this story. i find it enchanting and have watched it at least ten times since i bought the film a week ago!

this is a great movie. when two people from different backgrounds and social status think that they have nothing to offer each other and in the end they what each other needs it a testament to what the heart knows. sometimes we wonder why one man is with a woman or vise versa and the outward appearances say one thing to our eye, but what they offer each other from within that we cannot see is amazing and unexplainable. when nimi thought that matthew had nothing to offer her and when matthew was only looking for a fling (because he had an open marriage w/his wife jenny), in the end they realized that they could not and did not want to exist without the other. it was worth it to them to resist what family and friends thought and what society said was right to be with each other. this movie kind of restores my faith in love.

when i saw this movie the first thing that jumped at me was the acting of kelly overton a young (and op and coming star) actress that i saw for the first time totally blew me away.. she is amazing on screen and i'm really looking forward to see what the future brings her....the movie it self was good in the sense that it let kelly overton do her stuff and take the wiever for a ride... not much new tho i had the feeling that i had seen it all before.. but a good experience :) i would recommend this movie... if only to see kelly overton.. this stage actor takes the screen by storm.. i give this movie a vote of 7... 5 for the acting performance and 2 for the rest of the movie.and on a last note.. sorry about my bad english.. if this is gibberish for you :p plz ignore me...

*warning! some spoilers!*matt, a rich writer, is in fact still just a boy in his behaviour. he doesn't care about anyone's but his own needs and couldn't care less about the consequences of any of his actions. just as he gets to know nimi and her bonds with her familiy and her communitiy he starts to feel that something is missing in his live.he starts to realize that he is in fact lonely and stuck in impersonal structures that are just convenient but lack heart and commitment. nevertheless he shies away from any responsibilties and is reluctant to change his live. but will he be able to settle again in his old life and ignore the bonds he's already - unconsciously - formed?nimi's situation is the absolute opposite. she is pressed into the regulations of her nigerian community, its prejudices and its medieval values. being a single mother her position is difficult and it gets even worse when she falls in love with matt, a white devil (as the referend would say), a man who cannot commit. the women of the community plan to marry her to the referend to end her single status and give sammy "a name". but that would mean for nimi to give up all independence and self-determination. but is there an alternative for her if she wants sammy to be accepted and herself to become a respected member of the community?this movie has it all: a very sensitive and sensual love story (with very sexy scenes of matt and nimi) and an endearing child who is eagerly matchmaking, a beautiful scenery in lively colours.colin firth (*swoon*) and nia long show a great chemistry. it's just fantastic to watch them. and fissy roberts as sammy is just to die for. you simply want to adopt him. i just love the way sammy and matthew talk to each other. they are both on the same level in many ways. especially when sammy asks matt about sex. this scene is absolutely adorable!!almost nothing to complain about.... wait! that's not true. one thing is not good: that the movie is not long enough! (well, and maybe that the referend is too bad and too silly to be convincing....)10 of 10, by all means!

i've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it.the conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and matthew are very touching. the nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually is.although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation; if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place, the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandable.luckily, optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understand.i would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see. i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it.

a fabulous film,which i have now watched several times over since buying the video only four days ago.yes i am a colin firth fan and colin was his usual talented, natural gorgeous self.the interaction between colin (matthew field)and fissy(sammy, nimi's 7 year old son) was very special and so natural to watch. they were hilariously funny together and also touched my heart strings. the scenes which i loved the most was sammy and matt sitting on the wall chatting and matt then falling backwards off the wall in an hilarious fashion (i won't reveal the content of their discussion so as not to spoil the plot). also very hilarious was sammy quizzing matt about sex, colin and fissy were perfect in this scene and making what can be an awkward subject between adult and child just so natural. colins words and face at the end of that scene were so delightful and said it all! just brilliant. credit, of course, must also go to fissy roberts for his delightful portrayal of sammy. he played such a lovable and cheeky child character. the two actors were just perfect together.the interaction between colin (matt) and nia (nimi)was perfectly balanced and i couldn't agree more that the chemistry between them was wonderful to watch, displaying love,tension and of course passion. it was exciting to see how their delicate blossoming romance gradually unfolded, also showing how their cultural and social divides affected their relationship and was good to see how colin and nia sensitively portrayed matt and nimi discovering, accepting and overcoming these differences. it kept me fixed to the tv and guessing right until the end of the film. colins portrayal of matt's vulnerable and juvenile side was also perfectly portrayed, so much so, that i found it was difficult to watch when matt was so mean and childish towards sammy because he (matt) felt that sammy was getting in the way of his romance/relationship with sams mother nimi.one couldn't help feeling very disappointed, angry and frustrated with matt for treating sammy this way and this in turn threatening to spoil matts special relationship with sammy and nimi. colins special talent of 'getting inside a character's head' and displaying to the audience the different sides of a character, was very much in evidence here and pure magic to watch. i must also mention that colin also has such a good rapport with young actors (see also 'my life so far'a wonderful and not to be missed film).i also loved the relationship between matthew and his wife jenny, both were excellent in displaying to the audience the dark side and tensions within their marriage and that not all seemingly 'happy marriages' are quite what they may seem from the outside. i mustn't forget to mention the reverend whom i thought was very funny, in a serious sort of way! also nimi's mother and family were hilarious as well as bringing across the importance of nimi's culture and her situation.the downside, i can't really find a downside,but to be objective about the film and to give credibility to my review, the only negative comment that i would make is that the script writers didn't explain in enough detail as to why matt collapsed in the car, there was only a vague suggestion, from nimi, of something being wrong with his heart. however, this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film, far from it.i just needed to rewind the tape a little for a 2nd take.i felt that this film had it all, entertaining, uplifting and i loved the rich colours and sunny scenery.the film warmed up a cold winters day and made me smile :-)) all the essential elements were there,laughter,love,tension,sadness,anger,drama and a warm feel good factor, with, yes plenty of those delicious colin firth moments including a very soaked colin in a 'wet shirt scene',not to be missed by any fan, what more could a girl want;-)) i would strongly recommend this film, specially to any colin firth fans ;-)

it is always great to see a movie that teaches us about history in africa as they are definitely too few. however, the movie depicts lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist one..., i felt it hard to sympathise with this kind of leadership, yet the movie is somewhat like a homage to the man. there was too little content, explaining how the man got to rise in the first place, and the whole context of belgium "letting them go". so it is certainly worth going to see as the acting and photography are excellent, especially mobutu himself. i would just have liked a better political analysis.

in the film, lumumba, we see the faces behind the monumental shift in the congo's history after it is reclaimed from the belgians, and we see the motives behind those men into whose hands the raped and starving country fell. lumumba is not a movie for the hyper masses; it demands the attention of its viewers with raw, truthful acting and intricate, packed dialogue. little of the main plot is shown through action, it relies almost solely on words, but there is a recurring strand that is only action, and it is the stroke of genius that makes the film an enlightening and powerful panorama of the tense political struggle that the congo's independence gave birth to. this film is real. it is raw inits depiction of those in power, and those on the streets. it is eye-opening in its content. and it is moving in the passions and emotions of its superbly portrayed characters. whether you are a history fan, a film buff, or simply like good stories, lumumba is a must-see.

first of all, it is interesting to note that one of the users here who commented on this film (from belgium) had to add that lumumba was "communist." if this user indeed watched the film, the message was that he was not communist but pigeonholed (by none other than belgium, the u.s., the un, etc.) as a "communist" leader for other individuals', corporations', and country's political and economic gains. even if one decides to accept that the film partakes in "revisionist history" it would be naive to assume that lumumba was communist, especially coming from the country which "granted" the congo independence, and since lumumba was elected democratically to his seat as prime minister.onto the film...this is one of the most important and powerful films i have seen in quite some time. depicting the struggles of the african freedom fighter, and elected prime minister's struggles as its first leader, mr. peck, does a quite commendable job of putting together all of the pieces into one work. and this must have been quite some task. due to the fact that most people outside of the congo and belgium likely do not know the history of lumumba and the congo, outside of some light coverage of african imperialism (hopefully) in one of their high school/secondary school (or maybe university/college level) history classes, he had his work cut out for him.and to to think that oliver stone's "jfk" took over 3 hours, "lumumba" runs under 2 hours. and a most engaging 115 minutes it was, as we find that his desire to not compromise with western powers (whom he holds responsible for the atrocities to his people, particularly belgium), while trying to deal with power struggles within his own borders, apparently even with some of his friends, it is amazing that the man lived as long as he did.this is a must see for anyone interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics, and true freedom. you will not be disappointed.

good movie, acting was terrific especially from eriq ebouaney(lumumba)and very well directed.it also shows how lumumba was cornered by the belgians, u s a and united nations and how they labelled him a `communist' to scare people as they did to all the honest true african leaders like nkrumah, kenyatta, nyerere and many others. it shows how western countries preach democracy while they have something else on the back of their minds. it is a story of injustice, struggle and brutality.it shows how lumumba couldn't control his people, yes they were his people, but before we put the blame on him, was he getting enough if any from the people he appointed in his government like mobutu? or his colleague had other things in their minds, to find out go and see the movie! certainly mobutu did, went on to loot the country for the next 35 yrs, before he was overthrown and fled the country. died a billionaire.some flaws: there was too little explanation how the man (lumumba) got to rise in the first place. also there should have been more explanation about the country, congo kinshasa (after independence), now known as democratic republic of congo formerly known as zaire when it was under mobutu. there should have been an explanation why he (lumumba) couldn't keep the second largest country in africa in one piece. and also what was going on with tshombe and katanga . just heads up if you gonna watch the movie tshombe was controlling the katanga region which (if i am not mistaken) is the number one copper producer in the world.in all it is a good movie to see. you will learn something new about africa, it's leaders and it's people and probably will open your eyes why this continent is ridden with wars.

i saw the film yesterday and really enjoyed it.although there were several clues which i could realize after second time watching ,i was not able to awake the dow-dawn case. maybe this was my carelessness.the subconsciousness of a woman was became concrete with personalization.'let me go out'the key sentence of the film.let me go out from deep deep inside of your brain and we will both be free.a discrete film that forcing the limits of human conscious and brain.anybody who have seen the 'machinist' would realize the similarities with breaking dawn.a man that could not escape from his conscience (again a psychological and an abstract concept)meets it in an human body.and he will just be free of accepting and realizing there is no way of escape.also i want to mention about the performances of 'breking dawn's stuffs.in spite of having not many experiences, from actors and actresses to director all exhibited separately reasonable performance that have created a synergy which would increase the quality of the movie

the story of how the (communist) leader who freed the congo from belgium imperialism was eliminated by the western powers through the hand of mobutu. a story of struggle and injustice, of hope and the search of freedom. the story could be the one of any african country. a very moving film with images full of symbolism and beauty. if you have to see only one foreign film this year, see this one.

an excellent, thoughtfully produced historical drama--well played, artfully written, shot in ways that convey accurate visual images of the congo, and with more than a few moving moments, especially for those who care about the history of africa and imperialism. however, a fair amount of worthwhile content gets lost in translation, and because names, acronyms, and so forth are hard to follow. so i would strongly recommend checking a neutral source such as wikipedia to get a basic sense of the story being depicted (and the subsequent history) before enjoying the film. if you have the dvd version, there is also some useful historical background. there is a point towards the end of the film where the name of a character who then speaks with an american accent is actually beeped out--a simple google search of "lumumba film censor" or something similar will reveal a truly fascinating (and perhaps disturbing) twist regarding the production of this important film. this film, if coupled with a little outside research, helps contextualize dozens of other films relating to central/east africa and/or imperialism, e.g. hotel rwanda, shake hands with the devil, various adaptations of conrad's heart of darkness, and even "ali" when mohammed ali visits kinshasa.

when it comes to political movies i usually come out feeling empty. they generally take up some moralistic stance and you have a clear good vs bad story line as if it is some sort of batman movie.but with lumumba it is the first movie i've seen that showed politics for what it is, and the real issues of trying to rule a country of broken people who have known no other rule but violence. there were no good or bad there were just interests and conflicts of interest. this is the only political movie in my opinion that one can come out of it truly learning something. especially for anyone with their eye on politics as a career this movie shows you, you cannot rule on what you want for a country, but what the country wants from you.that's why i disagree with a lot of reviews that say everyone comes of bad, i think they come of too idealistic, (the belgians want the perfect colony, lumumba wants a perfect unity congo, tshombe wants wealth and riches, america wants the perfect ally against communism, russia wants the perfect aide for communism). and the congolese? they come off used and abused, ( best example in the movie when g√©n√©ral janssens tells his black troops your government lied to you and it leaves them all in an uproar) they are always being pulled and pushed into supporting this person or another.this movie shows in politics a mistake can cost you dearly and this movie everyone makes mistake after mistake until it escalates and ends up destroying the country. their intentions might be good (or at least in the characters opinion), but it's everyone's mistakes that lead to the downfall of congo. i don't think anyone is bad in this film, i just think they want too much from people sick of giving and want to start taking.overall, it's not just the best political film, it is a great film in general. acting is fabulous (eriq ebouaney as lumumba was perfect casting i really believe him) script flawless, editing perfect pace, and production value higher than i expected for a central african film. a must watch.

to answer the question of a previous reviewer who asked the name of the u.s. official mentioned in "lumumba", the name of the character is "mr. carlucci." frank carlucci is reported as having been at that time second secretary at the u.s. embassy in the congo. subsequently, among other assignments, he was appointed u.s. ambassador to portugal, deputy director of the central intelligence agency, secretary of defense, and is now the chairman of the carlyle group. it's hardly surprising that carlucci's biographical sketch on his www.carlylegroup.com web site fails to credit his service in the belgian congo. if his name was deliberately censored from the hbo version of "lumumba" it may have been to avoid the possibility of hbo's being sued in u.s. courts. carlucci's name, however, is clearly mentioned in the theatre version of "lumumba" that i saw recently. in the event, i expect that he would deny any involvement in lumumba's murder.others have commented on the evenhandedness with which the film "lumumba" treats the parties concerned: lumumba-supporters, other congolese, even belgians. a somewhat more sinister view emerges, i think, from the bbc documentary entitled "who killed lumumba?", based on the book "the murder of lumumba" by belgian historian ludo de witte. when examined closely, these films demonstrate that the fate of lumumba and the history of the congo is not just a matter of black and white. only lumumba's murderers believe that.

i feel very fortunate to have the chance to not only watch this film, but also learn more about this fascinating person and time. lumumba is an outstanding portrayal, giving a full sense of the story without falling into the usual hollywood trappings - yes, he is shown with his wife and children, but the essence of the story is his politics and those of the still-emerging independent congo. the film is brilliantly made, moving along at a pace that is consistently engaging. i look forward to seeing other raoul peck films, as well as more from eric ebouaney!

this movie is the best movie i have seen in a long time. it is also the best movie seen that uses a drama to tell history, without going to speculation such as with jfk,nixon or hoffa. it deftly depicts the clutches that belgium had on the congo. it also teases out easily for us the european and american forces that were behind the power the inflict the congo today. the film was sure to specifically implicate the u.s., rightly so, in the murder of lumumba. this film could never be made in the u.s. for u.s. film rarely criticizes itself in acts of imperialism and murder. (save stone's jfk) it also lets us in on the problems that were present with the inner conflict of the congo, between lumumba, mobutu and katanga. we can see how precarious countries sit in establishing new governments when their history is one of colonization and those who were the colonizers continue to pull the strings of power and force. the film is excellently shot with eriq ebouaney an excellent lumumba. the cast is great and they really draw you into the feeling of the climate in the congo during that time.again, this is a must see for those who love drama with a correct historical background. see my notes on quilombo.

i have never read a jacqueline susann novel, but i have also seen valley of the dolls, based on another of her books. on both occasions i thought the movie is probably better than the book and will further improve with age (certainly contrary to the books). the reason being that a movie focuses more on a specific style in fashion, design and behavior patterns. and in this aspect the love machine offers quite a lot. the set design fits the story perfectly. and all the characters fit in, too. they're perfect in the way that they complete a well balanced general picture. they are superficial and do not develop, it is true, but in this movie i wouldn't want it any different.david hemmings reprises the role he played in antonioni's blow up. and it's more than a rip-off. he's a fashion photographer, looks visibly aged and seems to start going slightly to seed. robert ryan reprises the role he played in max oph√ºl's caught, he is smith ohlrig all over again, greedy, bored and boring, uninspired and uninspiring. it's possible ryan did not want to be in this picture and acted accordingly, on the other hand he might have thought a lot about his part and then given a carefully studied performance. whatever happened, it fits the picture. dyan cannon is great (fantastic wardrobe!), she dominates every scene she's in and is involved in the two highlights of the movie: the burning of a luxurious bed and the knocking down of the hemmings character with a academy award statuette.the title, the love machine, is, of course, meant ironically. robin stone is a kind of a barry lyndon of the pop era (incidentally, the movie is slightly kubrickysh). that he chooses a tv station to work his way up to the top seems to be a mere coincidence. he sees love (meaning sexual favors) merely as a means for personal advancement. there are rather scary hints of a troubled sexuality which are not explored in the movie. homosexuality is treated very casually, probably not the standard for mayor movies of the period. the open cynicism of the tv executives need not fear comparison with other good movies about the subject like a face in the crowd or network or truman show. they are producing crap, they agree among themselves it's crap and they know they will make a lot of dough with it.i did not regret spending the odd 108 minutes with this movie and would not be surprised if it picked up a cult following, provided it's given the chance (meaning a dvd release).

why is there so much angst among the imdb reviewers who hate this film? it isn't a masterpiece, but having viewed it twice it does come across as compelling drama set in the world of network tv. robin stone is the epitome of every dan rather, phillip stone, and brian what's-his-name on nbc. a mannequin of a man incapable of love who succeeds professionally, but fails miserably in his personal life. i worked for eight (8) years in network news and robin stone's do exist!the supporting cast works for me from cannon (who can be annoying, but isn't in this film) to greene (who plays pathos just right) to wexler (who scores as the young model in love w/ the image of prince charming and can't reconcile that image w/ the true ugliness inside). also of note is the ending which some imdb reviewers claim is a cop-out. it's not! listen to the song "he's moving on" for clues as to the arc the robin stone character travels that brings him to finally face his issues. he realizes the answers don't lay w/ the life he's lived and the symbolic walk away from those he's associated himself with, at the end is perfect.

well, where to start? i stumbled across this one in 1993 and just hit "record" on the vcr out of habit, more than anything else. "citizen kane" it sure isn't...but if you've had a bad day and are in the mood for crashing out in front of something not too intellectually stimulating, then i tentatively suggest this might just be your "thing".we have the lot here - great title track, more stereotypes than you could shake a stick at, unconscious comedy, the bitchiest fight scene of all time and more, more, more! david hemmings plays the diametric opposite of his role in the 60s classic "blow up" - still a photographer, still hormonally stimulated but not "quite" the same.john philip law is easy to slam as an actor who makes a log appear unwooden but that wouldn;t be fair seeing as how he had about 5 minutes notice before accepting the role.wexler as "amanda"? suffice to say it was her one and only film role! the real star of this movie, though, is ethel evans who plays a, shall we say secretary (?), with the morals of an alley cat and an ambition to match. the way she manages to reconcile her present life with that of a future with her comedian husband-to-be is actually quite touching in an earthy, gritty, what-is-to-be-will-be way.i actually love this movie when i'm in the mood for it.......and wouldn't touch it with the proverbial bargepole when i'm not.kudos to the cast for keeping a (relatively) straight face when filming.a "classic" in the edward d wood school of cinematic endeavours!

nothing is worse than the genocides of our world's history. this film attempts to describe the horror faced by one particular family - a common narrative device - in the atomic bomb world of hiroshima. the most memorable parts are the graphic and saddening images that the people of hiroshima face in the aftermath of war. the story, however, becomes more concerned with the effect on a specific group of people and how they cope with getting on with their lives; in other words, if you don't really care about them, the film grows boring. it's hard not to care, though, when a family's homeland is wrecked. i'm not sure if i would recommend this film, because it says very little politically and, honestly, did not keep my interest in the family's troubles.

i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date, this year, it is one of my favorites. the story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and i knew what would happen far too early. usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me (like "the others") but even knowing the outcome i still enjoyed it right up to the end. looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from kelly overton (eve), i'm afraid i was not. her performance seemed to be the weak part of the film to me, in contrast to the amazing performance (or characterization) by james haven (don wake) ... i hope we see more of him. what a great little film, highly recommended to all!

in the light of the recent typhoon that hit the country hard (that is, typhoon ondoy), i thought it upon myself to re-watch "black rain" (1988, japan), shohei imamura's haunting black-and-white masterpiece on the destruction and after-effects of the atomic bomb that hit hiroshima in the closing period of the second world war. the destruction and impact of both catastrophes (war and typhoon) may differ in degree and quality, but the trauma and scar (physically and psychologically) nevertheless are still there. it is a testament to a film's power that its images remain as potent and as indelible as when they were first seen. it is only that the difference now, in my case, is that watching those images has assumed a greater sense of poignancy and potency due to a first-hand experience of a near-monumental weather calamity. there is a sense of kinship, so to speak. imamura has always been one of my favorite japanese filmmakers. his films are always a pleasure to watch because of their anarchy, sensuality and earthiness:"the pornographers:introduction to anthropology" (1966), "eijanaika" (1981), "warm water under a red bridge" (2001), his two palme d'or-winners "ballad of narayama" (1983) and "the eel" (1997), to name some. given the mood of his films, who would have thought that he once served as an assistant director to yasujiro ozu, japanese cinema's most austere and minimalist filmmaker? but then, it is ozu's rigorous formality and domesticity that imamura was rebelling against. but then again, with "black rain" one can unmistakably sense ozu's imprints. the father (or the father-figure) being intent on seeing his daughter get married before time runs out on both of them, and the stillness and calmness of the scenes showing all members of the family together (notably, the dinner scenes or in ozu's film lexicon, the tatami) are something that the revered master filmmaker would perennially explore in his works ("tokyo story", "late spring"). essentially, the over-all subdued and deliberate quality of "black rain" is a remarkable contrast to the bacchanalian chaos and instinctual drive of imamura's entire filmography.still, this is not to say that watching the film would not be an altogether unsettling experience. "black rain", as aptly described by american film reviewer leonard maltin, is "filled with haunting black-and-white images." in the film's first 15 minutes, imamura pulls no punches in showing the immediate and graphic horrors of the nuclear bombing, one after another (stiffly-burnt bodies, hanging flesh, walking dead, fires and debris everywhere, madness all over). an assault to the viewers' senses, definitely it is, coupled with takashi kawamata's somber b/w photography (he did the lensing in yoshitaru nomura's crime drama "the incident") and toru takemitsu's chilling score (he did the music in such classics as akira kurosawa's "ran" and masahiro shinoda's "double suicide"). even during the film's supposed "tranquil" phase (that is, five years after the atomic bombing), one can still never have a sense of contentment and order, with the uneasiness and pain still being strongly felt by the survivors, not only in terms of failing physical health, but more so in terms of psychological trauma and social stigma. the human race, it now indisputably appears, has been destined to bear the legacy of the bomb, for as long as it lives. i already wrote a piece about "black rain" some years earlier (posted in imdb.com), but only in comparison to volker schlondorff's magnificent "tin drum", another film dealing with monumental human folly and global catastrophe. moreover, it has never been my practice to write twice about a film that i already wrote something about before. it is in the light of the recent weather calamity that devastated our country that i was prompted to re-visit and write something again about this remarkable imamura film, as there is a wealth of lessons to be learned from both the film and the recent event in regards the imperfections and dangers of scientific knowledge and action, and the long-term scars and wounds inflicted by a wide- scale destruction (whether human- or nature-induced).there have been a number of films dealing with nuclear holocaust and destruction ("testament", "threads", "the war game", each situated within their own respective countries);and "black rain" stands among them, if not more so, for both its unapologetic and somber portrayal of individual and communal disintegration brought about by atomic devastation and the fact that it has a historical event as its basis.few weeks from now, another disaster film from hollywood, roland emmerich's "2012", will finally hit (no pun intended) the big screen. as we all know, this american director's bunch of "disaster/apocalypse" films--"independence day", "godzilla", "the day after tomorrow"-- serves no other purpose than to be of mere entertainment value, with no real insight into the nature and wisdom of apocalyptic disaster and the human condition being affected. i wonder how this "gigantic" movie would exploit the trauma, disorientation and apprehensions still being experienced by our people because of the recent weather calamity. to say that this flick is a precautionary tale would probably be no more than an overstatement. but yes, i will still watch "2012".

saw the film at the hollywood film festival in oct '04 . mark robertson took a huge chance writing an extremely difficult part for his first film and it paid off big in his casting of kelly overton. i had a strong feeling she came from the theater so i looked her up here and ...surprise, i'm right. more hollywood actors should follow her lead, give up the expensive acting classes and get back to theater because only with that kind of training will you be prepared for a ride like this. for all the great things i can say about the film and the director (and there are many) i just can't stop talking to people about kelly overton's masterful performance. we'll be seeing a lot more of her work, no doubt. congratulations to mark and kelly on a daring film. get it out in the theaters so i can bring all the people i made want to see the film asap!

wow, stella shorts are great! lots of patrons from the state and stella, the tv show. i never knew that stella could have gotten any better then they were on the tv show stella or even comedy central presents: stella. i also never knew short comedies could be any good. my favorite ones were pizza, racking leaves, the woods and david arranges to a meeting with his long lost cousin greg. i think over all that david was the funniest one. its funny when he doesn't make sense. i like the music in the shorts. thats something i pay attention to a lot. they always had good taste in music. i wish they still made shorts, either that or bring back there sitcom. i hope they continue making good and funny comedy.

when i first saw stella on comedy central i thought "god, this is horrible!" but i loved wet hot american summer. so i knew something didn't make sense. there was nothing left for me to do but search out for the stella shorts which i had heard contained more dildos than any other comedy troupe out there. when i found them not only were my dildo expectations met, but i found probably the greatest comedy scenes i've seen in years. the set of twenty odd short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs. not only did i laugh my ass off the first time i watched them but continued to laugh harder when i watched them over and over again. it's really a shame comedy central had the restrictions of cable television for the stella series. it would have faired much better on hbo or showtime. their brand of humor can't be restricted by censors or popular culture. given even if it was on hbo i'm sure the "masses" would have voted it canceled in a season or less, but still it would have been fantastic. needless to say i'm now in love with stella and all it's individual members. any stella fan should check out david wain's site with all his short films. they are equally as enjoyable as stella itself. so my hat goes off to michael showalter, michael ian black, and david wain for the unbelievable comedy they have made with stella. i hope to see much more of the troupe in the future.

i've loved this movie since i was a little kid. i remember the night my mother brought this movie home for me. i loved it and i still do. i think it's very funny and original. there are also some very catchy tunes in this movie. lou is also a surprisingly good singer. the actors that portray prince arthur and princess eloise are okay too, but abbott and costello are the best. former heavyweight boxing sensation buddy baer, also brother of former heavyweight champion max baer is good in this movie as the cop and the giant. he's a better actor than boxer. he had a natural talent. the beginning of this movie is hilarious how lou costello keeps crashing the car and how he gets into trouble with buddy baer. the slapstick in the house is good too. i especially like the comedy in the giant's castle. my favorite parts are; the part were lou is climbing the beanstalk and they're all singing as a farewell. jack is singing back to them that he'll return. lou costello is a very good at singing. my other favorite part is the part when jack is fighting with the giant. i like when jack makes exploding eggs and when he tries to make the giant an omelet they keep exploding. abbott and costello are hilarious and the greatest comedians of all time. this is only one of their great movies that i will love and cherish. the reviews for this movie aren't very good and i can't understand why. this is a very good abbott and costello movie. i also love how lou costello comes back to reality in the end and thinks he's back in the dream when bud hits him. he starts singing his song and leaves with an attitude like no one is going to push me around. very good movie.

there is a bunch of movies that we say must be seen twice. in most cases this is mainly a recommendation: you understand the movie anyway after the first viewing, and watching it for the second time helps you catch the plot twists you just did not notice. however, for mulholland dr. this is different. the sequence that worked for me was: see it first time - spend a day in internet trying to figure out what this was all about - and then see it second time. otherwise most likely you will not be able to enjoy this film to the full extent. then you start to understand that this piece is ingenious, camera work is stunning, and the aftertaste follows you for weeks.9/10

mullholland drive proves once again that david lynch is the master of cinematic expression. at the screening last night i witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema. the performances are astounding, the score entrancing, and the photography mesmerizing. david's ability to weave the many elements of film making into a unique and stunning cinematic experience is unequalled. as i watched mullholland drive i couldn't help but realize that with david lynch in this world we are truly blessed. the cinema is blessed as well for, in the films of david lynch, we are shown that one man's vision can be realized with stunning results. we realize that blockbusters are not the only path. we realize that a true cinematic artist has a chance in this world and in that we are blessed indeed.

with an opening segment that imitates the music and cinematography of todd haynes's safe (1995), david lynch uses dream, myth and warped notions of reality to tell the fractured story of a failed bit-part hollywood actress/waitress, diane selwyn, let down by fame and her own demons and obsessed with camilla rhodes, who is engaged to hotshot director adam kesher.the film effectively takes place in diane's drug-fueled head; we are witness to her crazy distortions, her wish-fulfillments, regrets, obsessions and fears. using the dream narrative as a way of presenting two notions of reality in conflict, lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy but actively entangles them. the last 45 minutes are as dream-like as what came before; and the troublesome air of detached, otherworldly ambiguity still pervades, fracturing the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream we expect to see in films about nightmares and dreams.lynch's film borrows from many films, old and new, but ultimately is a film unlike any other with the exception of the director's own lost highway and blue velvet. it constantly challenges the viewer to interpret what is seen, not only intuitively but intellectually. yet it is not as pretentious as one would have imagined because lynch makes us sympathize with the protagonist despite her murderous deeds - an element that was missing in all of his other films except the straight story. he does this by presenting diane's dream alter-ego, betty, as a wholesome canadian farm girl destined for fame. lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that affirms and negates in equal measure. are camilla and diane really lovers or just friends? who is the blue-lady? what does she signify? who is the bum behind winkies? what is the significance of the rotting corpse at sierra bonita? does aunt ruth really exist? is silencio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self-referential take on the film's status as fiction? lynch isn't prepared to answer any question he poses, choosing instead to present his "love story in the city of dreams" as a set of interconnected abstractions and motifs.the acting is top rate, especially naomi watts as diane selwyn/betty, who is yet to eclipse this performance. laura harring has the requisite hayworthesque allure as camilla/rita, while adam theroux as adam brings an freewheeling arrogance and sublimated paranoid aggression to his role. it was staggering and a grave injustice that not one of them was even nominated for an academy award.this is a film that demands to be seen and analyzed closely. the mystery at the heart of the film remains in lynch's hands but half the fun is finding consistent ideas from the maze of seeming incongruities that he presents. upon closer inspection there is a definite sense of a puzzle, perhaps an incomplete jigsaw that teases us with closure but denies the imaginary plenitude of narrative coherence. ultimately, this is lynch's key film.

wow, what a strange film. it's a david lynch movie so it's no surprise that it is weird. i defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film. i can't be done. after some research following my second viewing of this film, i pretty much know most of the story but on a first look, and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help, it is hard to figure things out. so, if you're in that boat and was confused, don't feel bad; that's normal. let me just say the key to the film is naomi watts' character.at any rate, i find the film fascinating. i love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch. the camera-work is excellent and the music is creepy, a la lynch's "blue velvet." there also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes. in all, it's very well scored.like lynch's "twin peaks" television series, this was a film in which the end was pieced together afterward since lynch thought this film was going to be a long, drawn-out tv series. when that didn't happen, he pieced at the last minute this ending. that may account for some of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations concerning characters we see earlier in the film but who mysteriously disappear.the theme of the story, supposedly, is a negative comment about hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed.both watts and the other leading lady, laura eleana harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their celebrated lesbian sex scene. looks- wise, both women were chameleons, looking average at times, stunning at other times.i enjoyed this movie more on the second viewing than the first. it's not just a curiosity piece; it's a very intriguing movie.....just don't feel stupid if you can't make sense of a few things.

hilarious and low-budget comedy at it's best. this set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-referential humor is reminiscent of a really raunchy kids in the hall. be prepared for some of the most random and recitation worthy lines, filled with ethnic slurs and awful language. sex toys included!there should be more comedy like this around today. this collection of sketches on one dvd will warrant many viewings and reviewings in order to appreciate some of the parts. if you enjoyed the state and/or wet hot american summer, get ready for some more glory. if you are even considering this for younger audiences i would say that every child on earth should see this.

david lynch's ninth full length feature film, mulholland drive is a deeply touching story about betrayal and jealousy. if anything, it brutally contrasts our ambitions and hopes to the often bitter truth. every frame of this movie has importance and links to other parts and to themselves at the same time. nothing is what it first appears to be and you're left with a real puzzle as you end up trying to put the pieces together. it is a movie that does not compromise, nor does it fail to fully handle the challenging form and camera language, as might have been the case earlier with lost highway.although one clearly recognizes classic lynchian motifs and devices, the movie remains highly original, even in the light of it being a lynch movie. lost highway marked a new way of telling a story; bred an unconventional mean of setting emotions on to the screen. with mulholland drive, lynch not only managed to control this technique, but takes it to new levels in making it much more complex and multi dimensional. in doing this, he creates a framework of different layers in time and of the human mind. in a press conference on the cannes film festival 2001, david lynch said that striving for perfection at best could give a result where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. talking about synergies like this becomes highly relevant to mulholland dr. where the different sequences and many details contribute to the total; dreamscapes and parallels intertwine to create the story. in some art, the beauty of it lies in its simpleness. this is not the case with mulholland drive, and has never been with lynch. it is the complexity that colors and builds the worlds lynch creates, the same complexity that characterizes the real world.it never gets forced like, in my opinion, for example memento does, using an original way of communicating with the viewers. further comparing mulholland drive to other movies, i think it proves david lynch as a master of what he does and bridges art and film making in a way that no one has ever done. compared to for example alejandro jodorowsky or contemporary matthew barney, i do believe that lynch more clearly manages not letting the artist dominate the film maker or, more likely, david lynch better understands and executes film making as an art form.understanding the plot is no small feat, but lynch's way of working with sound, perspective, chronology and form paints a work of art so dark and frightening that it sometimes feels more realistic than real life. the lynchian cinema is often, and most definitely in mulholland drive, a surge of human emotions. working with emotions is a delicate craft that demands understanding and depth. as lynch puts it: "a little bit too much, and the emotion goes away. a little bit too little, and it doesn't happen." in mulholland drive, david lynch has no problem making this balance. lynch's portraits span all kinds of dimensions and take different directions, creating incredibly realistic characters and situations. watching mulholland drive is a journey through the subconscious. it is a truthful and naked movie with indisputable artistic value. that is why i love mulholland drive and what's taken it to the pinnacle of cinema history. the ultimate movie.

spoiler alert - although this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to completely explain.'mulholland drive' is by far the most successful expression of david lynch's cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his 'twin peaks' tv series. as lynch enthusiasts know, his is a style and vision uniquely blended from film noir, horror movies, surrealism, and parapsychology ¬ñ with a healthy dose of postmodern self-consciousness and black humor thrown in for good measure. all these elements are richly at work in 'mulholland drive,' making for a riveting, hair-raising, and highly satisfying film experience ¬ñ especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to make all the plot pieces fit into a logical, mystery-unraveling whole.the film features wonderful performances by naomi watts and laura harring in the lead roles of young women whose lives intersect in various ways amid a hollywood setting that is itself an hallucinated blend of contemporary reality, retro '50s nostalgia, and satirical self-aggrandizement. their seemingly random initial meeting occurs after the film's opening scene, in which harring's character escapes an attempt on her life thanks to a fortuitous, not to mention horrific, automobile accident. staggering down the hillside from mulholland drive to sunset boulevard (the two most archetypal of hollywood thoroughfares), she finds her way to the very apartment that betty (naomi watts) is about to sublet from her 'aunt ruth,' a purportedly successful actress who is off to canada to begin a new movie. as we later learn, betty had herself arrived from deep river, ontario, shortly after winning a jitterbug contest.a highly energetic and stylized flashback to the contest forms one of two pre-credit prologue sequences that frame betty's descent from the clich√©d would-be-starlet's bright-eyed innocence to the debauched madness of spurned lover and going nowhere bit-part actress. unable to remember her own name, the harring character adopts the name 'rita' from a movie poster for the film noir classic 'gilda' that adorns aunt ruth's apartment. (actually, it turns out aunt ruth has long since deceased and whose apartment we're really in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings.) anyway, betty determines to help rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in rita's purse. the two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to rita's true identity. they also, by the way, become lovers, at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that i cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of lesbian lover affairs (if a lynch movie can ever be designated 'mainstream').at the local winkies restaurant (a recurring location fraught with dream-like significance behind its grubby realistic facade), rita's attention is caught by a waitress's name-tag reading 'diane.' this leads her to a recollection of someone named 'diane selwyn,' whose apartment the two women soon visit and, at betty's insistence, break into. i won't reveal what they find within, but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage lynchian creepiness. subsequently, rita wakes in night sweats speaking spanish and hurrying betty to an all-night magic show/theater called 'silencio,' where the arts of illusion and lip/instrumental- syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the blue- haired lady, as she is noted in the end credits, reigns as the presiding muse. framed by the blue-lit, red-curtained silencio theatre, the blue-haired lady occupies the last shot in the film, perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination ¬ñ rather like steven's "man with the blue guitar" as filtered through bad- drug surrealism.during the silencio sequence, and as rebekah del rio cameo lip-syncs her own powerful spanish rendition of roy orbison's 'crying'), a shattering epiphany occurs when betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in rita's purse. even if we do not delve too deeply into the freudian sexual symbolism of purses, the moment is a singularly hitchcockian one in that the matching of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings. not the least of these reversals is the discovery that betty is the sought-for diane selwyn and the spurned lover of camilla rhodes (i.e. rita). camilla in turn is a latin femme fatale movie star to whom diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and, more significantly, to whom she is emotionally subjugated.after these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in 'vertigo.' while bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of diane herself, other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from 'twin peaks,' including michael j. anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a bob- variant who hangs out behind winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id-like associations.however one fits the pieces together, though, the whole of 'mulholland drive' is much greater ¬ñ and more mysterious ¬ñ than the sum of its parts. lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, provocative, and pleasurably disturbing mind trip. what's more, the film's cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics, the acting superb, and the directing /editing masterful. this may well have been the unacknowledged best picture of 2001 among major american releases.

the case history of 'mulholland dr.' is known: what should had been another excursion (after 'twin peaks') into the rivaled field of tv-series ended up abruptly after completing the pilot. it was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to finish a completely new feature film. the result: one of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade which can be ranked among the best works of david lynch. his earlier movies 'eraserhead', 'blue velvet' or 'wild at heart' kept aloof in an irritating way which hustled the viewer into the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the plot happening such as here.'mulholland dr.' is a puzzle where pieces are missing, others obviously were taken from 'eraserhead' and 'lost highway', but it never seemed to be unfinished work. in the internet i came across with a lot of instructions and essays to explain this film. i am aware now that it loses its magic when you try to decipher it completely. all those detailed solution explanations are not only waste but also the questionable attempt to offer an answer where no such thing is completely required. imagine this scenario: a little child is dissecting his teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific of that bear lies. is it because it wants to destroy his toy? does the secret lie in the teddy bear or actually in the heart of the child? transferring this to 'mulholland dr.' it means innocence is one of the most important conditions to watch and appreciate it.david lynch succeeds not only to picture the surface of human behavior life but also to grapple with everything beneath that. human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - all that what remains unspoken; emotions that are often repressed. 'mulholland dr.' has the intensity calling for a cast that completely takes issue with the substance. actresses and actors who are ready to follow the visions of the director selflessly.laura elena harring, naomi watts, justin theroux solve their task in such an impressing way that you wouldn't want or couldn't imagine another cast. while their acting at the beginning seems to be a little superimposed you soon will realize that this stereo typing is set in with a purpose to manipulate the viewer and to baffle him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible.when you claim the criterion of a well made film in being able to lose yourself and dive into what you see on screen than lynch succeeded in making a masterpiece. a modern masterpiece that manifest david lynch's status as one of the most important, creative and courageous directors of the present. like every film maker who go beyond the limits he is confronted with criticism and ignorance. this will fade as soon as you find the individual key to lynch's world of films. 'mulholland dr.' is more than just a sleeper ¬ñ it is a must see for everyone who loves ambitious cinema. and besides, the film is a pay-off with hollywood, in form and content, which in that distinctness was hardly dared before.

originally filmed in 1999 as a tv pilot, "mulholland dr." was rejected. the next year, david lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie suitable to be shown in theaters. he did so - and created one of the greatest, most bizarre and nightmarish films ever made.the film really doesn't have main characters, but if there were main characters, they would be betty (naomi watts) and rita (laura elena harring). betty is a perky blonde who's staying in her aunt's apartment while she auditions for parts in movies. she finds rita in her aunt's apartment and decides to help her. you see, rita's lost her memory. she has no clue who she is. she takes her name, rita, from a "gilda" poster in the bathroom. so the two set out to discover who rita really is.david lynch has been known for making some weird movies, but this film is the definition of weird. it's bizarre, nightmarish, and absolute indescribable. it's like a dream captured on film. by the 100-minute point, the film has become extremely confusing - but if you've been watching closely, it will make perfect sense. having watched the movie and then read an article on the internet pointing out things in the film, i now understand the movie completely.the acting is very good. watts is terrific. justin theroux is very good as a hollywood director facing problems with the local mob. the music is excellent. angelo badalamenti delivers one of his finest scores. and the directing - hah! david lynch is as masterful a filmmaker as ever there was.is this your type of film? well, that depends. you should probably view more of lynch's work before watching this movie. you'll need to be patient with the film, and probably watch it a second time to pick up the many clues lynch has left throughout the movie. for lynch fans, this is a dream come true."mulholland dr." is a masterpiece. it's brilliant, enigmatic, and masterfully filmed. i love it.

hitchcock would be proud of this movie. even when nothing happens, it is suspenseful. director david lynch overuses a few cheap thrill tricks here and there, but he intersperses them with other cinematographic techniques to keep it from becoming obtuse.altogether surreal, this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible. i am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch things i missed and which may help me understand it better. it is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together, so you must be patient and pay attention. get your bathroom trip out of the way before it starts. and yet, the plot is overshadowed by the theme, the mood, the character development, and the filming techniques.the dual roles of the main actress, naomi watts, showcase her enormous talent. that is, when i could get my eyes off of her co-star. what an acting pair.lynch surprises throughout the movie with unusual camera angles, the length/timing of editing cuts, jumping back and forth between scenes. combined with smart use of music and sounds, it all helps to build suspense in our minds, doubtless a major objective of the director. well, he kept me on the edge of my seat, even had me talking to the actors to be careful here, and not be so naive there. you know, the kind of stuff you want to smack your kids for doing at the movies.

"twin peaks" and "blue velvet" have always been two of my favourite pieces of film-making, and even though past films by lynch have been slightly disappointing for me they have always been worth watching a number of times. to be pretentious, lynch can be like a good wine - he must be savoured and mulled over. but in the end you must make up your own mind about what you have seen, for lynch never gives you the full answers.many people will walk out of "mulholland drive" possibly wanting to throttle themselves over the mind-bending visual jigsaw puzzle that has just unfolded before them. but there is a twisted logic to this film, you just have to look for the clues. betty (naomi watts) arrives in hollywood, doe-eyed and in search of stardom. she then finds an amnesiac in her bathroom who has escaped from an attempted murder on mulholland drive. together they try to uncover the secrets behind the amnesiac's life. this all leads to a club called silencio, where a blue box will reveal all. and that is when the film throws everything out the window. people we thought we knew are entirely different people altogether... is it a dream? a reminiscence about life's previous escapades? you will either love this film or hate it. david lynch always draws such extreme reactions from his viewers. but as his universe itself is always about extremes, it is fitting that his films provoke such reactions.it is best to look at this film thematically, rather than as a straight-forward narrative. and appreciate the fact that lynch is a film-maker who will still let you draw your own conclusions. he has had many imitators as of late, particularly in "vanilla sky", where a mind-bending film decides to give you all the answers in the last rushed five minutes, and you will probably forget about that film as soon as you walk out of the cinema. mulholland drive will haunt you.

after two brief scenes that at first seem unrelated to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired, obviously rich beauty in the back of a limousine. her driver stops at an odd location on mulholland drive, which is a twisting, thickly wooded two-lane road full of mansions overlooking los angeles. just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her, two drag racing cars from the opposite direction come crashing into the limo. only the dark-haired woman survives. she works her way down the ridge to sunset boulevard and hides in a vacationing woman's apartment. shortly after, betty (naomi watts), the vacationing woman's niece, shows up at the apartment and runs into the dark haired woman, who now has amnesia. the bulk of the first part of the film is betty and the dark haired woman trying to figure out who she is, why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse. this is interspersed with oddly surreal threads about hollywood producers and directors, with occasional forays into a land of hoodlums and prostitutes.the above may sound a bit complicated and disjointed, but that's not the half of it. the film is constructed so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation. it's basically guaranteed that you will not understand this film and you will not have very much confidence arriving at your own interpretation the first time around. even if you have a lot of experience with like-minded films--such as memento (2000), donnie darko (2001), the i inside (2003) and the butterfly effect (2004)--you may not understand it on a second viewing, either. the studio was aware of this to the extent that they had director david lynch write "10 clues to unlocking this thriller" and they put it on the back of the chapter listing insert in the dvd. lynch being of a particular disposition, these clues are almost as cryptic as the film itself. it doesn't help when trying to figure it out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex. it takes a very long time to figure out what parts are supposed to be "real" and there is a complex nesting of flashbacks in some sections, with only contextual clues that they're flashbacks.but is the film worth watching, or worth trying to figure out? that depends on your tastes, obviously. on a surface level, the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of surrealism, although it will tend to seem a bit slow and overly disjointed to some viewers. but those qualities, and many other surrealist aspects of the film, are typical of lynch. a prime lynchian moment is the old couple in the beginning bizarrely smiling almost as if they're alien pod people trying to put on a front. if you're familiar with that style and like it, you'll find much to love here, although in many ways, mulholland drive is fairly understated for lynch. it's also worth noting, for viewers who'll primarily be interested in it or who enjoy it just as much as other aspects, that mulholland drive has a quite steamy lesbian scene. it's not gratuitous, although i have no problems with gratuitousness, but is instead an important hinge in the film.like all of lynch's films, it's easy to become enraptured in his unique approach to every aspect of filmic art and his attention to detail. any serious student of film (including "armchair students"/"cinephiles") should study mulholland drive; many will love it. lynch doesn't let anything pass unmanipulated. he includes brilliant color schemes (such as the plethora of reds and pinks) with important symbolism. he makes unusual use of sound, such as the ringing telephone carrying over into the section of score that follows it (when betty first arrives at the airport). he directs his actors to deliver their lines in a plethora of bizarre ways, such as his characteristic odd pauses. he lets his odd and surprising sense of humor poke through, such as the name "winkie's", and the "hot dogs--made for pinks" sign that provides a clue to some of the color symbolism.lynch's attention to detail in production design provides important, subtle clues throughout the film to help one unlock the meaning. it's interesting to note that lynch even apparently demands that the dvd programming be unusual--there are no chapters on the disc; you must either watch the film in real time or fast forward or rewind to get back to particular points.if the surrealism and veiled meaning of the film are attractive to you, or if you're just fond of "puzzles", then mulholland drive is well worth watching for that aspect. there is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad, generalized level. i won't recount the standard interpretation here--it is worth researching, but only after you've seen the film a couple times and have reached your own conclusions. many articles and monographs have been written on the film and interpretations; there are even websites dedicated to it.for my money, however, although i generally love lynch and find many things about mulholland drive attractive, it is not quite a 10 for me, at least not yet (i have a feeling that my score could still rise on subsequent viewings). to me, though, the "twist" aspect of the film is done much better in other works such as the i inside and the butterfly effect. mulholland drive is more attractive to me for its surface surrealistic touches, but the plot doesn't carry them as well as some of lynch's other films.still, mulholland drive is certainly recommended for the right crowd. if you're serious about film and do not mind having to think about what you watch (as if those two would not necessarily coincide), you shouldn't miss this one.

there's a sign on the lost highway that says:*major spoilers ahead*(but you already knew that, didn't you?)since there's a great deal of people that apparently did not get the point of this movie, i'd like to contribute my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense. as others have pointed out, one single viewing of this movie is not sufficient. if you have the dvd of md, you can "cheat" by looking at david lynch's "top 10 hints to unlocking md" (but only upon second or third viewing, please.) ;)first of all, mulholland drive is downright brilliant. a masterpiece. this is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head. not often are the comments on the dvds very accurate, but vogue's "it gets inside your head and stays there" really hit the mark.david lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it - cinematography-wise, has great acting (esp. naomi watts), a haunting soundtrack by badalamenti, and a very dream-like quality to it -- but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before. (after all, when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldn't leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about, regardless of whether they liked it or hated it?)allright, enough about all that, it's time to justify those statements.most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion/a dream sequence.of course, that's too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting "traditional" methods in which the story is laid out in a timely, logic and linear manner for the viewer. but for those expecting that, i urge you to check the name of the director and come back again. ;)md is the story of the sad demise of diane selwyn, a wannabe-actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor, camilla rowles. due to diane's lack of talent, she is constantly struggling to advance her career, and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents' expectations. upon realizing that camilla will never be hers (c. becomes engaged with adam kesher, the director), she hires a hitman to get rid of her, and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces.the movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller; which is some 50s dance/jitterbug contest, in which we can see the main character betty giving a great performance. we also see an elderly couple (which we will see twice more throughout the movie) together with her, and applauding her.no, wait. this is what most people see the first time they view it. there's actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits - the camera moving into an object (although blurry) and the scene quickly fading out. if you look closely, the object is actually a pillow, revealing that what follows is a dream.the main characters seen in the first half of the movie:betty: diane selwyn's imaginary self, used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the "dream-sequence" - a positive portrayal of a successful, aspiring young actor (the complete opposite of diane). 'betty' was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at winkies. notice that in the dream version, the waitresses' name is 'diane'.rita: the fantasy version of camilla rhodes that, through diane's dream, and with the help of an imaginary car-accident, is turned into an amnesiac. this makes her vulnerable and dependent on diane's love. she is then conveniently placed in betty/diane's aunt's luxurious home which betty has been allowed to stay in.coco: in real life, adam's mother. in the dream part, the woman in charge of the apartment complex that betty stays in. she's mainly a strong authority figure, as can be witnessed in both parts of the film.adam: the director. we know from the second half that he gets engaged with camilla. his sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for betty/diane, since she develops such hatred towards him.aunt ruth: diane's real aunt, but instead of being out of town, she is actually dead. diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for camilla's murder.mr. roach: a typical lynchian character. not real; appears only in diane's dream sequence. he's a mysterious, influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair. he serves much of the same function as the backwards-talking dwarf (which he also plays) in twin peaks.the hitman: the person that murders camilla. this character is basically the same in both parts of the movie, although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence (more on that below).now, having established the various versions of the characters in the movie, we can begin to delve into the plot. of course i will not go into every little detail (neither will i lay it out chronologically), but i will try to explain some of the important scenes, in relation to lynch' "hint-sheet".as i mentioned above, camilla was re-produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car-accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie, which left her completely vulnerable. what i found very intriguing with md, is that lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn't. i've already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow, but notice how there's two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo.only one of the cars actually hit the limo; what about the other? even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves, wouldn't they try to help the others, or at least call for help? my theory is that, since this is a dream, the presence of the other car is just set aside, and forgotten about. since, as rogert ebert so eloquently puts it "like real dreams, it does not explain, does not complete its sequences, lingers over what it finds fascinating, dismisses unpromising plotlines."shortly after rita crawls down from the crash site at mulholland dr., and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into aunt ruth's apartment, betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away, staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera. this is the first indication that what we're seeing is a nightmare.although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to betty, i think they're actually her parents (since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest). perhaps she didn't know them all that well, and didn't really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted, so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream. they also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder, and diane's sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life.a rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman. diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept camilla's part in the movie (from adam's party in the second half of the movie), and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream. because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of camilla, a part of her wants him to miss, so she turns him into a dumb criminal.this scene, i think, is also lynch's attempt at totally screwing his audience over, since they're given a false pretence in which to view the movie.gotta love that 'something just bit me bad' line, though. :)the next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at twinkies, who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they're sitting in. after a little talk, they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence, accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene.when reaching the corner, a bum-like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner, scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare. this nightmare exists only in diane's mind; she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder. so, in short, her obessions translate into that poor guy's nightmares. the bum also signifies diane's evil side, as can be witnessed later in the movie.the cowboy constitutes (along with the dwarf) one of the strange characters that are always present in the lynchian landscape -- diane only saw him for a short while at adam's party, but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams, so can he be awarded an important part in her dream. we are also given further clues during his scenes that what we're seeing is not real (his sudden disappearance, etc.)the cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the director, when he meets up with him at the odd location (the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream). also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he (adam) does good, or two more times if he does bad. throughout the movie he appears two more times, indicating to diane that she did bad. he is also the one to wake her up to reality (that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice), and shortly thereafter she commits suicide.the espresso-scene with the castigliane brothers (where we can see badalamenti, the composer, as luigi) is probably a result of the fact that diane was having an espresso just before camilla and adam made their announcement at adam's party in the second half. it could at the same time also be a statement from lynch.during the scene in which they enter diane's apartment, the body lying in the bed is camilla, but notice how she's assumed diane's sleeping position; diane is seeing herself in her own dream, but the face is not hers, although it had the same wounds on the face as diane would have after shooting herself. this scene is also filled with some genuine lynchian creepiness. since diane did not know where (or when) the hitman would get to camilla and finish her off, she just put her into her own home.in real life, diane's audition for the movie part was bad. in her dream, she delivers a perfect audition - leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance.also interesting is the fact that the money that in real-life was used to pay for camilla's murder now appears in rita/camilla's purse. this is part of diane's undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back, as the murder now hasn't taken place.when her neighbor arrives to get her piano-shaped ashtray, another hint is given; she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves, yet later when camilla and betty have their encounter on the couch, we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table, suggesting that betty's encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy.the catch phrase of the movie adam is auditioning actresses for is "she is the girl"; which are the exact same words that diane uses when giving the hitman camilla's photo resume.the blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie, and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed. there's much symbolism going on here; the box may represent diane's future (it's empty), or it may be a sort of a pandora's box (the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open). either way, it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key (which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place). the box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum.club silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s/he is viewing is not real. it also signifies that diane is about to wake up to her reality (her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from, even in her dreams).during the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear, diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears.anyway, that is my $0.02. hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it 'the worst movie ever' or something to that effect, without realizing the plot.as usual, lynch is all about creating irrational fears, and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well.10 out of 10.

10/10plot discussionthis is one of the best movies ever made and i am not saying that because i am being fooled by the seemingly nonsensical presentation. those who dislike the film because they don't understand the story often criticize those who are praising the film by saying that they are assuming its genius because they don't understand it. i don't view this movie as very allegorical. to me, it is a story with a beginning, middle and end. people become confused by the film because they expect it to have a deep, philosophical meaning that they are to interpret from the allegedly meaningless scenes. i feel they fail to realize that the crypticness comes from a chopped-up and rearranged plot combined with a very long and rather explanatory fantasy sequence and not from a chaos of visual allegory. because of the limitation of length, i will try to keep this short and to the point and touch on the major concepts.the general plot: diane moves to l.a. after jitterbug contest to get into acting. at an audition, she meets camilla with whom she falls in love. diane becomes enraged with jealousy since camilla sleeps with other men and women. diane discovers the other man (the director) at a film shoot and discovers the other woman (a random blond) at the engagement party for camilla and the director. motivated by her rage and possessiveness, diane hires a hit man to kill camilla. after that is done, she is overcome by loneliness and slips into an unconscious fantasy world where she lives the life she wants to. diane is then awakened. in her conscious state she is haunted by what she has done.the significance of the fantasy: the film starts out, after the credits, with a 1st person p.o.v. shot depicting somebody collapsing onto a bed and slipping into unconsciousness. this is where diane's fantasy starts. the accident is there as an excuse for her to "bring back" her dead girlfriend and justify the fantasy life. she depicts her girlfriend as meek and innocent because that is what she wished she was. in the meantime, she acts like everything is "like in the movies" because she has an escapist personality. she also, in a sense, kills herself off and assumes the identity of a waitress named betty at a diner. the story revolving around the director is a direct result of her feeling that he was in someway victimized in reality just as she was and "convinces" herself that he was forced to choose camilla. it was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party. camilla rhoades in the fantasy is actually the random blond from the engagement party. she hated her so much that she turned her into camilla and made the ultimate antagonist. she then took the real camilla and turned her into a perfect, submissive out-of-the-movies girlfriend and used rita hayworth as an inspiration. she also paints the hit man as a very clumsy and incapable person to further justify the survival of camilla. her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was a search for diane which ended up being herself and made the dreamworld die by taking her through a series of reminders of reality. the first reminder was club silencio which chanted that "there is no band" and the "instruments" you hear are not really there; this is a metaphor for the fantasy. she begins to shake violently because it shakes her perception of her surroundings. the other reminder is the blue box... actually, the blue box is not the reminder itself (more of a pandora's box, really), but the blue key that opens the box. the blue key reminds her of the actual death of camilla because it is what the hit man said would show up when it was done. along with having love, this entire creation of hers is an escape from reality by living in the idealized hollywood that she expected to be part of when she arrived. this is a story showing the psychology of a very troubled woman who lost a dream. it is not series of random things specifically designed to disturb and it is not a cryptic philosophical message. it is an unfortunate chunk of the human condition that is presented beautifully.however, ultimately this is all my opinion. i may be way off. or it may not be intended to mean any one thing. there are many who disagree with me. great! afterall, why does it have to mean anything? why can't it just be a statement in itself? what if coherent, sensible narratives are shackles for artistic expression? peter greenaway, for example, has spent many words eloquently supporting that idea by such statements as "i would argue that if you want to write narratives, be an author, be a novelist, don't be a film maker. because i believe film making is so much more exciting in areas which aren't primarily to do with narrative." and where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation? there is no such rule because the clarity of the movie is unrelated to the art of it. "i didn't understand it!" so...? "mulholland dr.," story or not, affects the viewers, harasses them, drags them, awes them, lulls them. the way it lends itself to interpretation is amazing. it never gets old. it never loses its luster. its visuals are always effective and beautiful. it is cinematic perfection no matter what. enjoy.

in the beginning, with the careful, remote location and sweeking metal sound, i thought of the opening scene in "once upon a time in the west". when it gets to the city, then it begins to feels like "kitchen stories", or "drifting clouds", even possibly "grimm".then it turns out that this is more similar to "joe versus the volcano" in theme (not style). and the movie executes from beginning to end the same, understated style. letting you observe, take in the steel, blue-grayish tone of the suites, dresses, wall color, furniture, bedsheets, mirrors, cars, music, background sounds and even people's expression. then near the end, there is one shot of a completely different tone - warm orangeish-yellow with soft music and ocean splashing, children and laughter.but maybe the observation is too long for me, i would much rather to see the alternative side or what happens to the character after the ending shot. still beautifully done.

if you were ever a fan of mtv"s "the state," then these three guys will be familiar to you. but even if you only stumbled upon them via the internet like i did, you will soon come to appreciate their unique brand of comedy.born out of their stand up comedy trio, 'stella', michael ian black, michael showalter and david wain produced these brilliant vignettes of surreal comedy to display at their shows, and now after being available only to download from two websites, they appear in pristine glory on one dvd.think comedy sketch show sans censorship, and you'd be halfway there. no stone of decency is left unturned. but for those who like their comedy rude, self-indulgent and bordering on puerile, (and i mean that in the most flattering way) this is the dvd for you!i think it's worth the money for the commentary from the two michaels and david alone, you can't help but take a liking to them as they explain their actions, cringe at their own antics with sex toys and by turn pat each other on the back and hurl abuse.fantastic.it must say something for the appeal of stella that the likes of julie bowen and paul rudd are willing to throw themselves into the action so fearlessly. and you should follow their fine example, throw preconceptions to the wind, and prepare to laugh yourself sick.

the whole movie made me think of the first circle of dante's inferno, where the souls who 'fool' themselves in believing that they are happy go to. they never realize they are actually in an inferno, but nothing is enjoyable, they just move on without any emotion. in that sense dante thought that they the were in the worse part, as they would never actively try to change their situation. nobody can die in that place, but trying to certainly does hurt. i am not sure if the writer based his story on this medieval manuscript or not, but the resemblance is absolutely striking.i didn't enjoy the movie when i was watching it, as i was expecting a climax which never came. nevertheless, it made me think afterwards and now i actually think it's a good film - it surely does stick.

a man arrives in a strange, beautiful, sterile city where no-one feels any emotion and obsesses instead about interior design. the essential sameness of his days is reminiscent of 'groundhog day'; the strange passages in and out of this world more remind one of 'being john malkovich'. but truly, this is a scandanavian movie, a piece of self-satire that is also scandanavian in style: the tone is austere, and even the most fantastic scenes are played straight, daring you to laugh at the absurdity. to my mind, the combination isn't wholly successful: there aren't enough genuine laughs to compensate for the difficulties of taking the piece as pure drama. it certainly is original; perhaps my problem is that the world that it satirises is not one that i recognise. perhaps i should move to scandanavia!

a very interesting addition to the scandavian surrealistic collection. recommended viewing for those who like their movies complicated. my interpretation of the 'strange' ending would be that andreas' journey ends in hell. he dislikes the bland consumer-led emptiness of purgatory; a sort of 'living' but not progressing, i.e. not getting anywhere - even the city's metro trains don't stop at the stations. it has a metro system, like you should be able to travel, freedom, escape, but you can never actually board those trains. he is unable to reach fragrant, sensory heaven and winds up continuing his bus journey to its final destination. the old norse version of hell (hades, not hell the terrestrial city) isn't burning hot like the british version, its cold, freezing, the land of niflheim (land of cold and mists). this appears to be where andreas end up, having just failed to access heaven through that tunnel.

the film is a great watch very thoughtful.i believe it is a film about how your like would be if you lived in a world created by catalogues. the scenes are all perfect recreations of an ikea catalogue they even watch furniture on their tv. when they break into the kitchen they break into another perfect picture of how a kitchen would look like in a catalogue. when he is reborn or whatever you would like to call it he returns to the harsh reality of life. i love the bit when he tells his new love he has left his partner. it pokes fun at commercial bliss by saying you can have it all and whilst it it is nice to have the same things, but some things you do not want to share. a film without children also per say makes for a perfect ten.

scandinavians are pretty good at making me laugh at the drab nothingness of my soulless life, huh.the film-making here was incredibly meticulous, every piece of framing, every deadpan stare, every element of the colour palette, every snippet of muzak or whooosh of those street cleaners was there to hammer home this world's calm emptiness.in fact, i think i might have found the general sense of emptiness overbearing had its absurdity not been genuinely funny and relatable. like when andreas is telling his boss that he misses children and looks up and the guy is smiling and halfway out the door, it's a sort of sad but true reflection of working with people, spending 7/8 hours a day with them, seeing more of them than the folk you love, but ultimately knowing deep down they don't give a damn about your troubles and you the same.this might have been a film the coens had made had they been born in oslo and not minnesota. i think their humour is more aggressive and more wrapped up in cinema's past but they have the same mastery of technique and their films have the same underlying sense that life is pretty inconsequential.i'll stop before i talk myself into taking a bus into the wintry wilderness.

grabbed my attention on netflix instant play because it was only an hour and a half long (it's nearing 4 am here), and because it's norwegian, which i wanted to follow up with dead snow and see what else the country is offering in international cinema right now. a droll and deliciously wry romp, this movie features a man, andreas, who gets shipped out to some purgatory of a brave new world city, where everyone is happy and bland and food has no taste, nothing smells, and even sex loses its appeal. driven to the edge by his lack of common senses, he feels nearly ready to kill himself.after an hilarious botched attempt at latter, andreas tracks down a man with similar complaints and the two discover a tiny, vagina-shaped hole in a concrete wall from which music emanates. the two attempt to break through to see what is on the other side, tracking a tiny bit of light they can barely see. but of course, in fantasy allegory land, desire and nonconformity are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to end andreas' attempt at freedom and sensuality.jens lien and crew create a simple, straight-forward movement to the story, one that flows well with its themes and moves along at just enough of a pace to keep from lagging. the similarities in other similar science fiction aren't worth enumerating, but still the movie has a unique feel and balances some very funny scenes with some pretty horrifying ones. i like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie, some disembowelment and flagellation that will get your heart stammering harder than the passion of the christ simply because it is so perfectly out of place from the gray-toned mise-en-scene. trond fausa aurvaag is a dependably squirrelly actor who physically feels out of place from his surroundings, which works very well. despite the fact that the concept itself isn't anything to write home about, everyone involved makes it work and the movie fully realizes its own world.--polarisdib

enjoyed 'den brysomme mannen' http://ow.ly/pttp (my wife didn't, so i watched it in bits over a few days.)reviewers mainly confused - most agree it's allegorical, but not of what; 'heaven', 'hell', 'socialism', 'capitalism'? that most people don't wish to escape, and it's, essentially, forbidden goes with most of those options.so, presumably you're supposed to project your favourite preoccupation/prejudice/fear onto it. so i'd say it's about an a-epicurean life. a live desaturated of colour, literally in the film, figuratively in the interpretation.

the bothersome man is a smart, surreal movie that makes you reevaluate what you're doing with your life and what makes you tick. when you see these people in zombie like trances doing everyday events and realize that's what we do and what we want in real life it really hits close to home. this is a surprisingly effective movie that at the end leaves you asking questions about your direction and not so much the movie. andreas is the main character whose life we get a 3rd person view of as he tries to adapt to a new life after being relocated. in the beginning he seems to be the most popular guy in town as everyone at work caters to him and he's invited to dinners etc. a good example of this is in the scene with his new boss who offers him an envelope of an unspecified amount of cash saying "here's a little something to get you started". andreas even gets a girlfriend 20 minutes into the movie, which he eventually moves in with. this seems like an ideal living situation as his girlfriend is an established interior designer, attractive, and doesn't ever nag about anything he does. but andreas is unfulfilled with their relationship as with everything else in this world. he then begins an affair with a coworker named ingeborg who he eventually leaves anne for and claims he is in love with. after telling ingeborg how he feels she tells him that she is also seeing other coworkers and says all of the relationships are "nice". soon after we see andreas at a train station where he tries to end his misery and to the audience's disappointment doesn't come about. still looking for salvation andreas meets hugo who has found a hole which music can be heard coming out of. so they embark on a mission to get to the other side, will it be better or will it be worse? "the bothersome man" shows us society's obsession with appearances and its materialistic mindset. it does a great job making fun of us by filling homes with ikea products that the characters spend each lunch picking out. i think he is mostly poking fun at the dull scandinavian society and its high suicide rates. for example there is a scene in the movie where andreas comes across a man who jumped out of a building and onto a spiked fence. also, andreas fed up with this world cuts his finger off and then later jumps in front of a train; this is one of the most weirdest/outrageous scenes i've seen. this world created by lien is equivalent to purgatory where there is no punishment or reward. in this world drink after drink andreas never got drunk, sex was unfulfilling, and no matter how many times he tried he couldn't kill himself. this movie reminded me of "fight club" and how both main characters were kind of out of sync with the world around them. in "fight club" tyler durden creates a second persona that does everything he wouldn't and in this movie the awakened andreas is the equivalent to tyler durden. after a while he wakes up and tries to escape the bland life he is now apart of by escaping through a hole in a wall. lien does a great job with continuity in this movie meaning when a character has a half full cup in his hand and they cut away then come back they have the glass in the same hand and its not full or empty showing that the shot was done another day. nowadays directors are more worried about the sound effects and overlook the little things like is that character wearing the bracelet on the same hand as yesterdays filming? since i took tv production for three years in high school it's hard for me not to look for continuity or voice overs which drive me nuts. lien does the little things well he's got great lighting in each shot, never leaves you wondering why something is in a shot and brings about an interesting topic. this film really worked for me because it not only mocks scandinavians' but the western society and what's wrong with it. the only real issue i had was with the man who commits suicide by jumping on a spiked fence. because you eventually find out this world has no death but he laid motionless forcing you to assume he was dead and this never gets answered in my opinion. andreas is the only main character as others come and go and never do more than support his him. his first girlfriend anne britt is an interior designer who at the surface seems perfect for him but eventually turns out to be dull. this leads him to ingeborg who he starts an affair with and falls in love with. he soon finds out that she was with a handful of other men and that what he felt was not real. andreas eventually meets hugo in the bathroom of a bar complaining about how nothing tastes good anymore and how he can't even get drunk anymore. he follows hugo home to find the hole in the wall with that is filled with children's laughter and birds chirping. lien doesn't have a lot on the resume but "the bothersome man" is more than a jump start to a great career but a preview of an up and coming director. if this is any indication of his talent and potential as a story teller, lien has a bright future and we can only hope that his future movies don't take so long to make it overseas for our viewing pleasure. so take a seat and enjoy the ride as director jens lien takes you from the comfort of your home to the dreamlike world that is "the bothersome man".

synopsis: andreas (trond fausa aurvaag) finds himself alone on a coach, getting dropped off on a desert land, at what seems the last stop of his journey. he doesn't know how he arrived there, but a welcome sign has been erected for him. after momentarily pondering his whereabouts, he is greeted by a man who takes him to his new life. he then enters a world different to the one he came from. as andreas is quickly introduced to his new job as an accountant, he senses that his surroundings are a bit too uniformed for his liking. as he takes his first lunch break, he instantly notices that everyone in the city walks around in grey suits. on this same day, he sees a fellow businessman dead on some fencing spikes, of what looks like an act of suicide. the strange thing is, the city folk pay no attention to this horrific act and walk on by as if it never happened. it is quick to see that these people are genetically desensitised, and their ability to distinguish between anything humane or inhumane is absent. to help andreas settle in, he is invited to go out with his co-workers to a local nightclub. the club appears to be one step away from becoming as exciting as a bingo night..and as andreas drinks his sorrows aways, he realises that no matter how much he drinks, the alcohol has no effect on him. as he tells these observances to a stranger in the men's room, a man in a toilet cubicle starts to utter words which have been on andreas' mind all along. realising that this man is thinking what he is, he follows him to his house, and notes where he lives for future reference. the plot predictably evolves with andreas wanting an escape. he seeks out the man he once followed...hoping that he could lead him to becoming human again...but is it too late?my thoughts: this norwegian film is something which everyone should see, as it holds the answer to the big question! what is the meaning of life? (well, close enough). the film sketches out the dark realities of what has become of today's working man (or woman). it's sole purpose is making people realise that life is too short to be materialistic. it tries to show that small clich√© things, such as the sound of children playing, should not be taken for granted, because the moment you stop hearing that sound, is the moment you're one step away from becoming a robot. the ending of the film reiterates what happens when its too late to escape the mundane routine you've now become used to. you start to adopt the saying of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', and become too comfortable to take a risk of change.even though this film is not to be taken as a piece of realism...its message is more than real. the lack of empathy conveyed in the film, and that of which andreas sees, is a bold statement of what life can become. the director, jens lien has put together a film, which in any other director's hands would have failed. this is a fine piece of cinematic genius, and i eagerly await to see what he does next.the lead role, played by trond fausa aurvaag is perfectly cast. representing the average joe, trond provides a good catalyst in making this picture darkly humorous. the supporting actors also do an apt job, and for some reason, i feel that keanu reeves would have been perfect in this film, as most of the supporting cast required their acting to be emotionless.the score for this film was beautifully composed. the recurring theme was always a delight to listen to, and it provided a very sombre but welcomed feel to the movie.set for a release date in the uk for 25th may 2007, i will definitely be going to re-live this experience on the big screen. this film has gained its way in my top 10...now quickly becoming my top 20! it has some shocking scenes, and is darkly humorous throughout...a must -see!!

i honestly don't know what words imdb will allow me to use in this review, as a result, i'm having a hard time describing these shorts. let's just say there's a good amount of gay sex, some necrophilia, some incest, a fair amount of masturbation, and several artificial.... members. and i loved every minute of it.not that it's all crude humor. it isn't. they stray away from fart gags for the most part, with the exception of one sketch entitled "pizza" in which they use one very well. "they" being 3/11ths of the short-lived sketch comedy group that aired on mtv called the state, namely david wain, michael showalter, and michael ian black.the trio go on adventures, usually playing themselves and encounter strange and unusual people, people that are often actually more normal than they are. the supporting cast is fantastic as well. paul rudd, julie bowen, bradley cooper, zach galifianakis, and sam rockwell all make appearances in various sketches. they're also joined by other the state alums like joe lo truglio and todd holoubek. the musical selections are also very well placed.i've enjoyed these sketches over and over again, but they aren't for everybody as they're pretty vulgar most of the time. if you like clever humor that isn't afraid to push the limits of good taste, then i highly recommend this. if you liked wet hot american summer (directed and written by wain and showalter) or the state, then you should really enjoy this.i think it can currently only be ordered online. check out their website and stream a couple of sketches to get an idea if you really want this first, and then find out how to buy the dvd.

den brysomme mannen is one of the better films of all time and is about a man trapped in a world where there are no senses, no feelings, no love, no truth and definitely no freedom. a world where people become afraid when someone speaks their mind, expresses himself or show affection, a world where no one is free and no one has any idea what the meaning of any of this is. just like the world we live in, the world in den brysomme mannen is a world of lost souls trying to become fulfilled but focus on the complete opposite of what fulfills them, materialism, social acceptance and mediocre satisfactions.den brysomme mannen deserves full attention by every human soul, because we could all use a fresh wake up call.

it would seem we should acknowledge scandinavian cinema for more than merely the dogma 1995 movement as cooked up by the danish all those years ago. den brysomme mannen, or the bothersome man in english, is a surreal and deeply thought through film yet deeply entertaining and rich in content both on and under the surface. as a film alone, it is a scathing comedy on society and attitudes in the post-modern world we live in; a world that judging by the bothersome man has reached the regions of norway and the like. but along with this black comedy feel to it, it would seem the film delves a little deeper and raises issues, at least to me, of metaphorical religious spaces and our human instinct to want to uncover the truth amongst so much material in our world that perhaps seems alien to us.this was, in truth, a fantastic introduction to contemporary norwegian cinema for me. the film very much falls into that category of the european art cannon with its deep themes and ambiguity shrouded atmosphere whilst maintaining an open finale and not so much a narrative as a procession of events that may mean one thing or another. so many times we've seen films that use the set up the bothersome man adopts and so many times it's turned into a close to predictable routine revolving around a detective story or a chase story or something along those lines but this film allows its setting and situation to act as a mere backdrop for its protagonist, named andreas (fausa aurvaag), to explore who he is; where he is and what the possible mysteries behind this location really are.the set up i'm talking about involves said hero arriving at a location with no prior memory or what happened before this. i'll jump right in and say it's in my opinion he's dead and has been sent to some sort of purgatory, as have all the city's inhabitants. everybody in the city that andreas mixes with are of the same age; same mentality and same attitude suggesting to me that most of them are victims of their own suicide and have been sent to a purgatory devoid of any emotion, feeling, colour or most importantly, pain. when we first see andreas, he gets off a bus which he later discovers is uncanny in its abilities, and approaches a petrol station in the middle of rural nowhere. he is scruffy and has a huge beard but soon he will be the opposite, sporting a suit and tie; clean shaven face and a home of his own complete with new job in which the film makes one of the best transforming shifts between the rural and the urban that i've ever seen. but the new job as well as the new city is uneasy; you can take breaks whenever you like; bosses are unusually kind and there just seems to be no emotion or reaction to anything. these ideas are best put across in a cinema when andreas, still a relative newbie to the city, is crying and is clearly affected by a film on show but everyone else watches in stone faced style. there is also the initial example when one man has jumped from a window and lies impaled on some spikes but everybody walks on by without fuss.to back up my idea on everyone already being dead and the city acting as a sort of purgatory, death and harm in general is impossible. there is a particularly nasty scene involving an electronic paper guillotine and someone's thumb, but everyone's reaction to the event is stone faced and it grows back within the hour. similarly, a suicide attempt involving trains later on comes to nothing and instead we get the point of view regarding what it's like to be dragged down tube tracks with invulnerability on your side. the city acts as a barrier, a painless society in which the masochistic need to self-harm oneself is impossible; a place in which sexual relations can occur and break-ups equally so but both under emotion-less and passion-less circumstances; a place in which people can attempt suicide but it is impossible to actually die. the city adopts these powers because the damage has already been done in 'real life' and thus, the film says you cannot kill yourself twice, indeed you cannot feel pain or emotion in an afterlife of purgatory.but the film's best part is the one that sneaks up on you. judging by the closing five minutes of the film and the side-story that opens up involving some music coming from another man's house, it would seem there is a fine line between the spaces the film dictates as 'heaven' and 'hell'. we get to see these spaces only very, very briefly ¬ñ so briefly that they consist of a single shot. the 'heaven' is a colourful kitchen with music and children playing: it offers life, hope, emotion and happiness whereas the hell is a snowy nowhere which haunts you thanks to its hopeless build up and eerie cut off point. the introduction of these two spaces at the very end of the film suddenly informs you of the reality andreas and co. faced: purgatory and everything that came with it, the afterlife just was not ready for andreas and his freethinking, adventurous mind ¬ñ and look where the thinkers end up.

where the heck is andreas(trond fausa aurvaag), exactly? heaven? hell? a parallel universe? when the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an onrushing train, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus; riding solo, the newest arrival, in a dead netherworld where all the suicides go. dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere, andreas is greeted by an official man, who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city, if the eyeballs work, is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited, if memory serves him right. andreas retains the look of a sleepwalker in a trance, a man estranged from people and objects, struggling to find his bearings; at home, or rather, his assigned apartment; or at work, where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. havard(johannes joner), his boss, tells him, "you'll get used to it," which covers more than just crunching numbers, we suspect, in this world, same as the old world.if life is meaningless, like french existentialist philosopher jean-paul satre said, the same can be said for death, as well. the subculture of office life might be heaven for one man, but it looks like hell to us, under the context that "den brysomme mannen" operates on. to work in the afterlife, in essence, is to work for the rest of your life. the social intercourse among andreas' office mates may pass as normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer, as he/she now recognizes the drudgery of white-collar labor performed by white-collar laborers, who kill the hours with their inconsequential small-talk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day like automotons, each and every day, seem irrational in its self-evident absurdity. to see daily life replicated in a speculative light, "den brysomme mannen" makes normal human interaction look like deadpan comedy, as quotidian life becomes a performance, which transforms karl marx's meaning of the word "alienation", because here, the men and women in the office, "do" identify with their labor, like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real. but the bothersome man never fully participates in the facade. he's always aware of the cracks.from a wooden bench, andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper, who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by, indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk. andreas faces the same impassivity from his own co-workers after he purposely cuts off his own finger, with the hope that he'll feel the pain, on a paper slicer. he doesn't. it's just another sensation, in addition to being able to taste and smell that's lost to the bothersome man. this inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures, amplifies the bothersome man's need for love,where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. at a dinner party, hosted by his boss, andreas meets anne britt(petonella barker). they hit it off. he walks her home. she invites him in. they become a couple. he moves in. when they have sex, however, it's good for neither andreas, nor anne, who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design. love is an abstract concept, another sensation that's unattainable in this world, but love matters to the bothersome man, so he tries again with ingeborg(birgette lagen), a girl from work. "den brysomme mannen" deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman. when ingeborg doesn't elicit the same tender feelings for andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving anne britt for her, this norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but odd city, with an open-endedness that's solvable, and offer up multiple interpretations.wounded by ingeborg's apathy towards his avowal of love for her, the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station, stands at the same platform, leers at the same couple aggressively making out, and jumps. this time, he can't die. how can you die when you're already dead? hit repeatedly by train after train, andreas' face turns into ground beef; his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art. when the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp, he seeks out the man from the club, who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead. which is: death, not life, has no meaning.getting to the bottom of the mystery behind andreas' whereabouts drives the narrative, and to the filmmaker's credit, this enigma is satisfactorily addressed, in a scene that recalls spike jonze's "being john malkovich", when andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles the portal to malkovich's brain that craig schwartz charges people to crawl through. andreas' attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox. since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that "heaven is a place on earth". but at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of a hell; the place that andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination.

as you may know norway is the most developed country in the world (regarding to hdi; human development index). this film craftily reveal our future to us. our future would be that of norway since we are all paddling to achieve the best and offer the least. the life that was shown was maybe an exaggeration, yet comparing today's concerns with those of our ancestors it is not far-from-reality reasoning.watching this film free from all of our pre-assumptions, we can find both of our faces; the one that is laughing at the brilliant scene of andreas dumping her girlfriend and the one that is searching through magazines hours and hours to choose some stupid chair among stupid collections.the idea of the hole with the hope of lightness was another magnificent idea of the film. the slight glory; yet the only one, and the effort that was put to reach it makes us feel closer to andreas.although i was attracted mostly to the idea and production of the film, trond fausa aurvaag played pretty well and the atmosphere of the film was quite matchable.

mississippi mermaid is a disturbing and unsettling examination of what it means to be in love with the "wrong" person.truffaut's directing is his usual outstanding work. although this is far from his best. deneuve is very, very beautiful. despite the character she portrays.

this must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time. the kind of title that ruins a film because it neither evokes the plot nor the characters. a title like this makes a film flop, even the french title is not much better. too bad - truffaut & deneuve must have been enough to sell it..this is a long film, but largely worth it. clearly influenced by hitchcock, we have an intercontinental story about a personal ad bride, her rich husband, a theft, an identity switch, and obsessive love. the plot here is actually very good, and takes us on an unexpected trip.the thing that works both for and against the movie is the focus on the relationship. it is an interesting study in how these plot developments are played out in "real life relationship" with these two people. unfortunately, this is what bogs the film down, and makes it ultimately dissatisfying. we do like films to have a real sense of finality, and that is missing here.it was the case in many of her films that deneuve became a canvas for directors to play their fantasies out on, and this time it doesn't work as well. messy here, is the fact that the director clearly just wanted to have deneuve take her top off a few times. deneuve is an actress who always seems very deliberate and thoughtful, so these attempts to make her seem spontaneous fall flat. basically, the script needed to be worked out better before shooting began, to make this film tighter and shorter and to snap. but truffaut didn't snap, did he? so - it wanders a bit, but remains interesting.

i thought this movie was brilliant. it was so funny and so true too. a great idea for a movie. five groups of friends on their way to schoolies. i've got to say that matt newton as mason was probably my favourite character. i wish i could give this movie more than a 10 rating.

all i can say is that, i was expecting a wick movie and "blurred" surprised me on the positive way. very nice teenager movie. all this kinds of situations are normal on school life so all i can say is that all this reminded me my school times and sometimes it's good to watch this kind of movies, because entertain us and travel us back to those golden years, when we were young. as well, lead us to think better in the way we must understand our children, because in the past we were just like they want to be in the present time.try this movie and you will be very pleased.at the same time you will have the guarantee that your time have not been wasted.

i saw a test screening of blurred recently, and i am surprised to say that it was actually pretty good! its a film about different groups of kids, your hillbillies, your rich snobs, your typical teenage couple, plus two geeky guys and one post hippie babe. together, but as separate storylines, each group is travelling to the gold coast for schoolies week. australia has never had any problems writing comedy and australia is never short or actors who can play comedy with subtlety and just the right amount on quirkiness. the cast is full of stellar aussie actors with enormous talent and loads of screen presence. keep your eyes on craig horner, a young graduate, who's optimism for a week long party gets lost in his friends shenanigans. travis cotten and mark priestly, who successfully tackle some tricky physical comedy as two bummed out bogans and jessica gower as a cutie but confused teen angsting about love. veronika sywak makes her film debut as every adolescent boys dream girl, and holds her own amongst an array of considerably more experienced performers. look out for matthew newton, cleverly cast as a seedy limo driver. fantastic aussie

algernon4's comment that ms paget's "ultra lewd dance in (this film) is the most erotic in the history of films" is certainly one doozy of an exaggeration. it isn't even debra paget's most erotic dance. her near nude gyrations in fritz lang's "the indian tomb" make this number look decidedly tame. as for being the most erotic in the history of dance. well! where do i start? salma hayek's performance as santanico pandemonium in "from dusk to dawn" (1996); jamie lee curtis in "true lies" (1994); jessica alba in "sin city" (2005); rose mcgowan in "terror planet" (2007); sheila kelley in "dancing at the blue iguana" (2000), blah, blah, blah.don't get me wrong. i love the sequence and have included it in my "cheesecake dance" series on youtube. i just think that making a claim like "most erotic in the history of film" is really going out on a very fragile limb.

i watched princess of the nile for the first time when i was about 10 years old. i am 63 now and have never forgotten the movie. nor have i gotten over my fascination with egypt. i have searched the internet trying to buy the movie, but have not been able to locate it. it makes me wonder if this is one of the lost movies in hollywood. i loved debra padget and jeffrey hunter together. they have such charisma together. if you were to ask me anything about the movie i could not tell you anything other than who was in it. i vaguely remember a scene by the nile with debra padget a bunch of other women.i have always wanted to see it again. i never thought of it as an escape movie back then, but i can see now where that was probably the case. i do hope they will put it on dvd and i will be able to see it again before i die. it was a wonderful movie.

this is one of my favorite films for many reasons. to begin, there are standout performances from lovely debra paget as a princess/dancing girl, from michael rennie as the villain, handsome young jeffrey hunter investigating crime in her city/state and others. the film is an unusually colorful adventure, and we even see the princess rehearsing the dance she later performs (for once). she manages to skewer hunter before she learns he is on her side; also the photography, the costumes by travilla, lionel newman's music and the film's style are unusually fine. add to this rousing action, intelligent characterization and fine direction by veteran harmon jones of a gerald drayson adams' script set in 1249 ad, and you have the ingredients of an enjoyable grecianized near-eastern. but there is much to praise about the unusual and well--developed storyline here, as there is much more to praise other than the film's swift pace, well-managed physical action sequences and superior technical aspects. classically-trained actors such as michael ansara, edgar barrier, wally cassell, jack elam and dona drake are not commonly found in one "b" film together; nor are there fascinating sets, a variety of locales and a mystery of the quality that is supplied here. one way of assessing a film is, "if i were guaranteed to live through the experience, would i choose to undergo these events and perform these actions?" since my answer is a resounding "yes" in this case, this film remains one of my choices as a favorite and very-underrated cinematic work. could it be that us critics' all-too-frequent disdain for females as warriors and thinkers that as in so many other cases has caused closed minds to misprize this estimable film's obvious anti-tyranny and pro-entertainment qualities?

for the most part, i only enjoy the kind of movie that allows one to escape the current time into the future or past. this movie is pure escapism. the dancing starts almost immediately, and debra paget in her "purple harem" bikini dress simply has no equal in film in my opinion. her dancing, while sultry, is surpassed by her dance in fritz lang's tiger of eschnapur, available on dvd, where she played the temple dancer seetha.one problem with the movie is the closed setting. there are few outdoor scenes shot, and they as well as other scenes are a bit claustrophobic. the same locations are used over and over again, but with some interesting secret passages and waterways. her secret double identity is totally unbelievable with beauty of that magnitude. debra even wields a sabre and holds 2 enemy soldiers at bay on a staircase, she could do it all.what does work is debra paget as a princess. with her beauty, she certainly would be the center of attention anywhere at any time in history. this movie, when hopefully it becomes available on dvd, will be a must buy. overall, taken with a bit of humor, i loved it.

a very interesting plot of the film based on the novel "waltz into darkness" of the writer cornell woolrich. it is a drama rather than a film noir, which tries to send a message that love changes your own life, i.e. your love to any person and the love you received from him/her. a wealthy man really changed his life for love, while his partner finally understood that he was the only one that loved her. belmondo played well as usual, while a somewhat still young michel bouquet played his eternal role of a detective or police agent. frankly bouquet was not so impressive in this film, but less than that was the performance of catherine deneuve. she was not so convincingly in her role as a prostitute then lover/wife of louis mah√© (belmondo). for those who like to visit the world, the film offers the occasion to see part of the ascension island, and also lyon city in france.

this agreeable french movie deals about a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an african island nearly to madagascar named louis(jean paul belmondo). he's a single man looking wife, then he advertises a bride and gets a gorgeous woman named julia(catherine deneuve). when she spontaneously appears turns out to be much more attractive than expected. he marries to julia but she suddenly disappears.a french eye private(michael bouquet) is hired by julia's sister and soon he's on the trail of his previous spouse. later louis encounters her in a dancing-hall under another name. in spite of the romantic delusion and everything, louis goes on enamored with his enigmatic wife.this film is a splendid drama plenty of betrayal,deception, killing, theft and hitchcockian suspense. good performances by jean paul belmondo as young proprietary of a cigarette company who seems determined to fall under the spell of a femme fatale and a wonderful catherine deneuve as suspect heroine. the film gets several references to the american cinema, but truffaut(400 blows) was a fervent moviegoer, such as : johnny guitar, colorado jim, bogart, and hitchcock.the usa version was cut numerous minutes and deserves an urgent restoring and remastering. loosely based on the novel titled'waltz into darkness' by cornell woolrich (rear window and screenwriter of alfred hitchcock hour) who also was adapted in 'truffaut's the bride wore black'.colorful cinematography by denys clerval(stolen kisses) and atmospheric musical score by antoine duhamel, truffaut's usual musician.this is one of the best of his suspense movies along with ¬®farenheit 451 and shoot the piano player¬®. remade by an inferior version by michael christofer(2001) with antonio banderas, angelina jolie and jack thompson, full of erotic and lust scenes.

the film is a joy to watch, not just for the plot, which is gripping, but also for the superb performances of the actors, deneuve and belmondo. though considered a 'flop' on its first release it has become a critical success, and it is clear to see why. deneuve's acting style suited the film brilliantly. she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something, and her character in this film is. i will not spoil it with saying what, though it is divulged fairly early on. belmondo is lovable as the fairly naiive but in love tobacconist. i would recommend this film to all truffaut or deneuve fans. it is a brilliant hitchcockian style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop as the film does. the film is approx 2 hrs, so you feel that you have not been sold short. deneuve steals the show in this film, and it is clear that at the time of making the film truffaut was very much smitten with her. a definite must see for any cineaste or moviefan. 10/10

(contains spoilers)people who put a lonely heart's ad in the newspaper are often idealists. they try to put into a few words everything they are and expect. the exchange of letters is full of hope...louis mahe (jean paul belmondo), owner of a cigarette company on the ile de la reunion (east of madagascar) is so affected by the letters of julie roussell that he proposes to her. but not the expected pretty brunette comes from board of the "mississippi", but - catherine deneuve. and we know from the start that she is a marriage imposter and that a crime has taken place. she shows no interest in "julie's" wardrobe (she does not even get her trunk open) and neglects her canary until it dies. but the most basic tricks of seduction (an open zipper) are sufficient to transform louis into a pliable little dog. first: a joint bank account. and then, when julie's sister draws attention to herself, the flight. with 27,850 millions of louis' 28 millions - she would have needed his signature for the entire sum.louis and julie's sister engage a private detective (michel bouquet). louis contrives to trace marion (deneuve's real name) in antibes where she works as taxi-girl - her gangster-lover left her penniless, or rather centimeless. louis finds himself unable to kill her. she tells her story: orphan. precocious. lesbian experiences. many sugardaddies. jail - and soon she leads him by the nose again. the detective turns out to be sly as a fox and tenacious as a blood hound; louis and marion bury his body in the cellar. they flee to paris, where louis discovers that marion has a costly taste. she worships money like a deity. he sells his firm at a fraction of its value. but when the corpse of the detective is discovered (a flood) they have to flee again - without the money. life in a mountain lodge, together with a whining loser - marion can think of a more cheerful life without this appendage...a high point in the careers of everybody involved. belmondo's self-deceit makes him nearly endearing. deneuve looks beautiful in her wardrobe by yves st. laurent, and her performance is delightful: at first she fakes the fragile wifey - too timid to ask her husband for money, that's why the joint bank account is needed - but after being exposed she sounds like katharine hepburn in the jail scene of bringing up baby. the scenery is spectacular - the tropics, the riviera, paris. truffaut directs with self-evident aplomb: the sixties were the only decade when european films were head and shoulders above american productions. after this film truffaut was able to look his idol, alfred hichcock, full in the face.

in reunion island in the indian ocean, the owner of a cigarette factory louis mah√© (jean-paul belmondo) is engaged through correspondence with julie roussel and he does not know her. when julie arrives in the island to get married with louis, he waits for her in the docks but louis does not recognize julie in the passenger vessel and finds that she is totally different from the picture she had sent to louis. they get married and louis shares his bank accounts with her. when julie's sister writes a letter to louis asking her sister to write to her, louis discovers that the woman is not julie that is missing. further, he finds that the woman has cleared his bank accounts and left the island. louis and julie's sister hire an efficient private detective comolli (michel bouquet) and louis travels to france seeking the woman, but he has a nervous breakdown in nice and is submitted to an intense sleeping therapy in a clinic. he recovers and finds that the woman, actually marion vergano (catherine deneuve), works in the phoenix club priv√© in antibes and lives in the low-budget monorail hotel. louis breaks in her room and when she arrives from the club, she tells that she was happy with him but her former dangerous lover richard had blackmailed her. louis is still in love with marion and escapes with her to the countryside. but comolli is chasing marion in france accused of murdering julie."la sir√®ne du mississipi" is a film-noir by the great director/writer fran√ßois truffaut, with an unconventional love story of passion, murder and love that hurts. the femme fatale catherine deneuve is astonishing, probably in the top of her beauty and is delightful to see her face and the topless scenes on the road and in the room. jean-paul belmondo is very athletic, and the sequence when he escalates the wall of the hotel is impressive. catherine deneuve makes this film worth and gives credibility to the passion and lust of louis. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "a sereia do mississipi" ("the mississippi mermaid")

i've slowly been collecting the films available on dvd of both catherine deneuve and francois truffaut. both actress and director have done some stinkers in their time - fortunately mississipi mermaid is not one of them.next to "the soft skin", coincidentally staring deneuve's sister (the late francoise dorleac), this would have to be my favourite truffaut film.as well as directing, truffaut also wrote the screenplay. something that always strikes me about truffaut is his almost childlike innocence when presenting a story -- one could almost call it naivety.there's a scene towards the end of the film where belmondo returns to the apartment in lyon with the remains of the loot. he rings the doorbell and deneuve answers wearing a negligee. in the time it takes belmondo to reach their room from the street, deneuve changes into her dress, puts on her best pair of stockings and shoes, then lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep. it's a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child - but that's truffaut for you.watching catherine deneuve in her films of the late 60's is indeed a sensory pleasure. she is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch. incidentally, for those fans, there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this film - indeed a sinful pleasure.i disagree with previous posters. i see nothing 'hitchcockian' about the film at all. as for the 'look' of it - i love the look of the older film stock used in the 60's. it certainly gives films of this period a unique look.highly recommended for both deneuve and truffaut fans......

this is one of the best films i've seen in the last years.belmonndo and deneuve shine in their respective roles, he as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic trickster.words won't do this masterpiece justice,suffice it to say that this is a movie that explores the darker side of love and the pain,humiliation and capacity for self-delusion that go with it, although it's dressed as a film noir. forget that feeble remake with jolie and banderas, see the genuine artticle instead and treat yourselves to some moments of great cinematic beauty.

i love this movie. it is the first film master p have ever done. it is based on the story of his life. it is low-budget, but it is very good. it shows how master p grew up in projects in new orleans.not only did master p start in this movie, he also was the writer and director with moon jones. the dvd also has the no limit ice cream party on it. this movie shows how master p goes from bad too good and how he had to deal with the things around him. it also has many of the no limit records roster in this film. you should buy or rent this film.it is a great movie to watch is you like rap, or is a master p fan. i will not spoil this movie for you. go get this movie as fast as you can and watch it. you will like it.

this movie was marketed extremely well. when it was released in '97, during the middle of master p's fame and success anything and everything with his name on it was selling off the shelves. that's why it's no wonder this underground urban drama sold over 250,000 copies and still goin'.if you are a fan of no limit back then or even now check it out. it has a few old school phatty videos and don't get me started with the freaky deaky strippers at the bonus ice cream party. so what i got to say to all the people who don't like master p or no limit records don't watch it because it isn't for you and don't bother voting on it because you're only going to deter tru no limit fans from renting or purchasing this video with your low votes.

jewel thief is one of those suspense thrillers in which the viewers are left guessing till the end who the villain is. suspense builds from the very first scene when the jewel thief becomes a national problem and there are cleverly concealed clues in the film so that you can guess who is the jewel thief. the story portrays that dev anand (vinay in the film) and the jewel thief have identical faces. but you get a 1000 watt shock when you finally come to know the villain. there are many surprises and a lot of fishy stuff going on but there is time for romance and six melodious ever lasting songs sung by lata mangeshkar, asha bhosle, kishore kumar and mohmmad rafi.this film was also talked about for its song's videos. consider the teasing and counter teasing in asman ke neeche. or the blocking of road by dev anand when tanuja was going out with her friends in yeh dil na hota bechara. or the romantic dil pukare are are in the beautiful sikkim. or the wonderful dance by vyjantimala in hotho pe aisi baat. add to it rulake gaya sapna mera and raat akeli hain and you will never forget this film for any reason.able acting by dev anand, ashok kumar, tanuja and vyjantimala and direction by vijay anand (dev anand's younger brother) makes this one of the best loved hindi films of all times even today.

an excellent thriller of all time. vijay anand excels as director and editor. performances by dev anand, vyjayantimala, tanuja and ashok kumar prove to be an asset to the film which has its screenplay worked out to the minutest detail. cinematography adds to the mystery, glamour and other requirements of the story as it evolves. and to top it all, music by sachin dev burman is unforgettable. "yeh dil na hota bechara" by kishore kumar, "raat akeli hai" by asha bhosle, "rula ke gaya sapna mera" by lata, "aasman ke niche" by lata and rafi and "hothon pe aisi baat main" by lata, again reaffirm burman dada's unique stature as a top notch composer with a style of his own.

this story focuses on the birth defect known as fas, or fetal alcohol syndrome, a disease diagnosed too often among native americans. in spite of the down-beat nature of this drama, the great script and the characterizations move the story along very well. this is arguably smits best performance.

jewel thief is *the* crime thriller of bollywood, and why should it not be? it is directed by the biggest exponent of the crime thriller art in indian cinema vijay anand ('johny mera naam' and 'teesri manzil.) i could watch this movie for any of the following reasons (in order of importance):1 vijay anand's direction 2 r d burman's music 3 dev anand 4 vyjayanthimala 5 ashok kumar 6 majrooh sultanpuri's lyricseven if jewel thief is not a bond movie it definitely has bond babes. helen, tanuja, and the mysterious vyajanthimala (and some cameos.) but our sauv√© vinay (dev anand) is anything but bond. he is out of control for most of the story and goes where the story takes him almost always as confused as we are. he even flirts with anju (tanuja) trying to hit her romantic nerve, just so that he can get employed in her father's shop.dev anand might be in a double role - well i don't want to spoil your movie or else i would have told you. that is what most of the mystery is about. dev anand works in a jewelry shop and there is a robbery when he is supposed to be at work - though is not, or at least has a perfect alibi. we wonder who did it, is it dev anand as 'vijay' the person he claims to be or is it 'amar' someone we have not yet seen but many people claim is his look alike. comes 'shalu' (vyjayanthimala) who even claims that he is her fianc√©, in a tense situation dev anand has to prove that he is vinay and not amar. while everyone wonders if dev anand is vinay or amar he is asked to remove his socks. amar we are told has 6 digits on one of his foot. while we watch with bated breath the events that are about to unfold dev anand even finds time to joke. the real life brothers director vijay anand and actor dev anand have many movies between them this is not the best of them but definitely the best in crime thriller. there are moments of hitchcock's north by northwest, but the movies are very different. except for the confusion about who is who, a treacherous female lead and lot of traveling there isn't a lot of similarity. dev anand could very well be amar in addition to being vijay. people have seen him, they identify him where ever he goes. there are too many of those people for this to be a fraud. finally vinay thinks it is better to carry along with being amar to find out what is the truth, and it is a sad mistake. he gets too deep into it, only to be saved by the twists of cinema.when i watched the movie as a kid i was definitely not amused, the ending confused me completely. even now there are parts about the ending that i do not like, but i'd recommend this movie anyway.even as a kid i enjoyed the songs this movie has to offer. 'yeh dil ...' - a definite loafers song in kishor kumar's voice. i could hear 'rulake gaya ...' whole day long. ditto for 'aasmaan ke neeche' which is set 'under the skies' of gangtok (at least the story line suggests that). 'raat akeli hai' among the sexiest song to come out of hindi cinema featuring tanuja as the seductress. 'meri taraf dekho' - helen's cabaret and we 'look at her'. 'hothon pe ...' - now, could there be any better thriller of a song than this. as the song progresses we are more tensed than we ever were and the words 'hidden in shalu's lips' add to it.

unlike bond and other detective movies, alfred hitchcock's hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his acumen and courage (and luck) would get out of it. jewel thief is based on the same principle and so in a way it is vijay anand's tribute to the master of suspense. the tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and establishes vijay anand as a great director himself.it is the story of a common man vinay who one day realizes that he has a double called amar who in fact is a jewel thief. suddenly vinay finds himself in the middle of a hatching scheme and to save himself goes on a wild goose chase to find this amar who remains one step ahead of him. the suspense is almost killing throughout the movie and as the plot unravels you are hit by the brilliance of the scheme. just like hitchcock's movies, jewel thief can boast of a grand climax shot inside the grand palace of sikkim.everyone and i mean everyone; dev anand, vijay anand, ashok kumar, vajyanti mala, tanuja, sd burman, kishore kumar, majrooh sultanpuri etc. etc. are in their top forms. this is one of the best thrillers ever made in india.

jewel thief is a rare breed of film - completely noir in its story but nothing noir about the presentation. a young man vinay, superbly played by a newly face lifted dev anand at age 40+, is estranged from his police officer dad and finds a job in a jeweler's store. soon random people come up to him and call him amar. using just a few pithy moments the presence of a "doppelganger" is established. then a woman shalini (vyjayantimala) comes forward and claims to be engaged to said doppelganger. she is accompanied by her loving brother (ashok kumar) who is so convinced that vinay is actually amar he makes him take his shoe off and prove that he is not aamr, the 6 toed one. the jeweler's super cute daughter anju (tanuja) is completely enamored with vinay. amidst all this confusion there is a jewel thief on the loose and he is stealing at will. slowly we learn from vinay's encounter with a super hot night club singer (helen!) that the thief is amar the doppelganger. many many good looking women (anju mahendru, faryal) are after the hero. the police force, including vinay's dad, are completely befuddled. vinay is slowly falling for shalini/shalu and her brother seems to bless the union. the action moves to sikkim as that is where amar's next heist is to occur. the rest is for you to watch - the duplicate, the girls, the men who hang on to vinay's every word thinking he is their boss amar, the loving brother sister duo - nothing seems quite right, and it takes the deft story telling (and direction) by vijay anand to conclude this tale in a highly entertaining manner. the movie has numerous moments that you will wonder at until they deliciously weave into a grand finale at a dance in a palace in sikkim.i was not a big vyjayanthi fan but she is quite competent here, although at her chubbiest. she is able to add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way, but is best when she is sorrowful or dancing. tanuja is cute as a button and i loved her in this film. i so badly wanted her to get the man. dev was, well, dev. if he were not walking like a man with a congenital shoulder defect (one shoulder always lower than the other) i would wonder who they had found to imitate him! yet his style, charm and charisma were unfailing. in the song yeh dil na hota bechara, only dev could look cool carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached! ashok kumar was simply awesome - dada moni did not miss a beat the entire movie and turned this into one for the history books.sd burman spun magic with numbers like baithe hain kya uske paas (helen in a blood red rooster imitation dancing on a bar top), aasman ke neeche, rula ke gaya sapna mera, and my personal favorite seductive number raat akeli hai bujh gaye diye.if you are craving a great story, with more twists than a pretzel, wanting to be kept guessing, yet amused and entertained - then go buy or rent jewel thief. better to buy it, then you can go back and see it again with your buddies. this one is a keeper.

nice movie. at the begining, i thought it's a medieve detective kind hi-fi movie, but the ending totally surprised me. i guess, the whole movie covers too many subjects, each of them can be the main subject,e.g. avenge, friendship, and dream. but it mixed all of them without focusing on any of them. i think, it'd be a great movie if it's built around the ending from the very begining.

ironically, what makes john carpenter's "the thing" such an entertaining sci-fi film are its genre-defying elements of mystery, suspense, and tight plot structure. it puts to shame such films as "aliens" or "armageddon" that are content to inundate the viewer with special effects while their plots revolve around stunts that butcher the laws of physics, testosterone-laden one-liners, heroes equipped with enough artillery to conquer iraq, and pathetic attempts to inject "meaning" into the barrage on screen with "emotional sequences" that only serve to further insult the intelligence of the audience. the supreme tragedy, of course, is that these kind of lobotomized movies are also the most popular. i think that there is a cause for this, although it isn't very comforting. there is an increasing trend in our culture to passively "surrender" to the media -- to immerse oneself in the images we see without dedicating a single brain cell to comprehending the statement the work is trying to make. this mindset is becoming increasingly dominant in all arenas; even the once-hallowed print medium is being diluted, thanks to the abominable "reader response" theory that pervades our schools and the "tabloid brigade" that lines our magazine racks whose mentality appears to be infiltrating the once-venerable mainstream press. nowadays, we just flip the switch and put our minds on "pause." is "the thing" a "good" movie? for the rare individual who still values his faculty of reason, a more appropriate term would be "entertaining." its plot keeps one guessing, its ending is uncompromising, and it has some redeeming statements to make about human paranoia. upon subsequent viewings, one begins to note a conspicuous lack of depth in the acting, but the taut storyline remains compelling. of course, "citizen kane" it's not, but then again sci-fi never was a thinking-man's genre...

when john carpenter's masterly version of "the thing" was released in summer 1982, it was panned by critics and bombed at the box office. the audiences couldn't handle another 'bad' alien, they wanted et. their loss in the long run.i would kill to be able to see this great movie on the big screen. this is a movie that was way ahead of it's time; now it has influenced a new generation of filmmakers, showing it's trail on things like "se7en", "alien 3", and even "the x files", which unceremoniously ripped it off page by page. and the structure, which eschews character development in favour of incredible sfx, is commonplace in today's blockbuster flicks.carpenter shows the same skills he honed in "halloween", using the camera to create an unsettling and claustrophobic atmosphere. the performances are all fine, and the ending is terrific - still unique today.a paranoid masterpiece.

although i saw this movie in korea, in korean, and therefore did not understand the language, images sure say more than enough. from what i can make of it, this is the story: two superb sword fighters become friends in their service as the king's guard. one of them finds himself opposed to the ways of the king and starts assassinating important men. the other has to hunt him down. this movie is visually great. the swordfighting is great. and the movie has a gripping end. i just hope this movie will be marketed for the western cinema goers. and be released on dvd, of course.

it couldn't.from the cutting dialogue to the super special effects this film was a joy to behold throughout. the immediate feel for the bitterness of the antarctic, the affinity for the characters that is built up at the base level before the real action heats up and the cunning finale combine to make this one of the most memorable and enjoyable films around.up against a long list of films that have attempted to exploit the theme of visitors from another planet, the thing comes out on top and laughing. who can forget the perfectly timed dialogue and the chilling special effects? special effects that are a lot more impressive than the computer generated images that we get to see today. i for one found some of the most enjoyable aspects of the film to be the way that we were introduced slowly to each member of the crew, and the way that they all had some distinctive character traits. this wasn't just a senseless bloodbath-come-slasher-horror flick. this film had feeling. emotion.i truly can't recommend this film highly enough. i have yet to see anything in it's class that comes anywhere near to matching, let alone bettering, the near perfect acting and timing utilised in this cunning polymesmeric feat of cinema.

i first saw this film accidentally when they showed it on tv and i was up far too late... i really lucked out there though. it's truly incredible; from the location (as isolated as it's possible to be on this planet; it made "the abyss" look like et in the council swimming pool), through the interesting characters (keith david is especially good as the reactionary childs -"what if we're wrong about him?" - "then we're wrong.") and the effects (more yucky than alien).moreover, however, the real tension and fear in the film has nothing to do with the effects. it's the people you start being scared of; knowing that one of them may - or may not be - "all they appear to be". it's certainly got the feel of "who goes there?".the soundtrack is great; it really plays up the isolation, fear, and gravity of the situation.finally, the epilogue scene really, really cuts. even more than the "but then again who does ?" punchline of bladerunner. enough said.

"the thing" is john carpenter's best movie. merging his talents for tension building and shocks with decent production values he turned out a perfectly crafted sci fi / horror movie.by filming in truly difficult conditions he creates a very believable isolated research base which sets the tension before anything has even happened. the ensemble cast work well together with kurt russell proving a charismatic leading man even under all that beard.by building the tension slowly with moments of gory horror (courtesy of effects meister rob bottin - currently directing freddy vs jason) carpenter creates a movie that has rarely been matched. considering this came out the same year as et it could not be more different!worth a watch / rewatch. 9 out of 10.p.s. the dvd is excellent. lots of extras plus the best dvd commentary going (with carpenter & russell). plus remixed in dolby digital for even scarier sound effects.

this is one of the most outstanding horror movies i've ever seen in my life time. forget the exorcist and all the other hype horror movies out there.john carpenter as made a tour-de-force horror epic with outstanding special-effects great performances from kurt russell and co and a great soundtrack that will haunt you for ever! the greatest thing about this movie after 17 years is it has'nt dated it looks fresh and new and you don't get many movies like this.back in 1982 this was up against e.t. and of course it failded and was a box-office bomb. over the years the thing as made a cult following from video and t.v sales and as many new fans. in the end this movie kicks ass and to me it as never loss it's edge to scare the pants off of you and to me that a horror movie. long live john carpenter!!

i cannot believe i never added my two cents about this film as yet!this is one of the best films of all time. many critics and movie-goers alike talk of john carpenter's "halloween" for setting trends and being "his best work". those folks have not seen this version of "the thing" because it is right up there with "halloween".john carpenter's work shines in this film. he took a film that was already made and instead of "re-making" the film, he made the book the first film was based on! brilliant.the casting of each man was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, made me scared, made me guess, made me laugh, made me question, even up to today "who goes there?" in that film. this film had no hollywood sweetie pie or funny-type ending, and what a bold move not to have one in 1982. another brilliant move.i was at the screening for this film when i was on vacation in southern california. the audience at the screening went wild! i carry those memories for years, it was so much fun! we all thought that there was no way on god's green earth this film was not going to be a hit. but by box office receipts, it was a dud because of "et, the extra terrestrial" and "poltergeist" two very good family oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came out.this film was what i, as a horror film adult buff was looking for, a horror/thriller with an adult script, and real adult actors. not kids playing adults. not little miss "big-breasted" scream-queen of the day running around screaming for titilation but real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear. heck, being a feminist, i didn't even miss women in this film! and good for mr. carpenter by not putting one in there, it really wouldn't have made sense! (unless, "the thing" was actually feminine! something to think about!)i saw special effects of that time i had never seen before, i saw makeup that made me sit up a few nights. this is what horror/thrillers of today are missing. today, the directors wimp out. today, the studios wimp out. too much cgi and not enough belief, too much cgi and not enough story, not enough imagination. you leave the theater and in a week -- or less -- you forget about the film and move onto the next grand film opening. this one stays with ya. that's one of the marks of an excellent film.on many reviews i've written how now paying $10 for a film is horrid. for films like this one, you'd pay it and not feel slighted. this film is not for everyone.i find it horrific that they lable this film a "cult" film. i find that the audience is broader than many would lead you to belive and although not a commercial success in 1982, this is an example of how releasing a darn good film on the wrong date can make a darn good film look bad. after john carpenter's film, many people copied many techniques, make-up, special effects and story lines from this version of "the thing".i am now excitd to go on record and state that this film is one of the best films of all time, very much under rated. please see it uncut, please see it in letterbox and please hear it digitally. you'll talk about it for years as well.

this being my first john carpenter film, i must say i was very impressed by the thing. right from the beginning, the film draws you in, and never lets up on the tension. the film's special effects and models hold up well even today. other than kurt russell, i wasn't familiar with any of the cast members but they were all exceptional in imparting fear, paranoia, and the desperation to survive. the universal dvd has a wealth of very interesting behind the scenes extras. strongly recommended, 9/10.

aaah...the thing.to see a horror film in which not only is every character over the age of thirty, but distinctly unattractive, makes a refreshing change, and reminds me of those distant times when actors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters, rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover. and carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over-styled parodies. and there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending, or cameo celebrity appearance, or lame pseudo-romantic subplot.and i really miss on-set physical effects; with all those 20 year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics. in the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw alien, the elephant man, poltergeist, the howling, an american werewolf in london, the thing, the company of wolves, a nightmare on elm street...what an era for horror effects! and don't get me started on the death of matte painting. the matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless.what do we have now? third rate cgi, former music video directors and professional stylists, that makes even 'gritty' horror movies look like glossy mtv videos.now i'm going to go netflix 'the howling'.

for me, a ten-star film is one that never dies in my memory, and yet can be watched over and over again with the same pleasure as the first time. this could be a technically flawed movie; the pleasure has nothing to do with spit-and-polish (my personal top-ten is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). john carpenter's "the thing" is one of very few films to fit this criterion.i've been a science fiction fan since i was a child in the sixties, and i read the john w campbell short story on which the film is based ("who goes there") before i saw the original, black-and-white howard hawks film (as with a lot of people, that viewing was illicit, on the tv, when i should have been in bed!). that movie, as with so many that you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed near perfection: the suspense, the inexplicable nature of the alien, the photography; it all just seemed to work. i watched it many times in the years after (and still do, when it is shown on tv). because of this, i avoided the carpenter version for years - seeing remakes of one's favourite film is, i thought, always a mistake. when i did eventually watch it sometime in 1988/9, again on tv because there was nothing else on, i realised that i need to change "always a mistake" to "usually a mistake"! carpenter had produced something different from the original film, closer to the original story, and truly wonderful. from the opening scene of the helicopter and husky, through the viscerally disturbing scene in the dog-pound, to that ending (sorry, no spoilers here!), i was hooked. the sound track alone lives with me - all i have to hear is a close similarity to that bass-over-snare drum beat, and i'm *in* the final scene again ...until seeing "the thing", i had carpenter down as just another gore-monkey, based only on comments and reviews in mainstream press. since seeing "the thing", i think i have seen most of his movies - i haven't gone out of my to do so, but if one comes up, just seeing his name as director is enough to make up my mind to watch it. he is thoughtful, and knows how to build a film up so that it reaches a point at which something will stick in the memory.if you haven't seen "the thing", and you enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favour - sit down in a dark room, wrap up warm, and prepare to have your memory enhanced!

in an era where nearly every great horror film of the 60s and 70s is being remade for audiences weaned on horror flicks of today that are not too terribly good, it is instructive to look back at john carpenter's 1982 opus the thing, which itself is a remake--of a childhood favorite of the director's, howard hawks' 1951 sci-fi/horror classic the thing from outer space. although carpenter's film was not initially that big a box office hit when released in mid-1982, it has since garnered a very large following.in fact, carpenter's film is less of a remake of hawks' film than it is a reworking, as he goes back to the original idea posited by the source material, namely the john w. campbell story "who goes there?", in which a us scientific crew in antarctica is menaced by a shape-changing alien thawed out from the ice after 100,000 years. kurt russell, who had starred for carpenter in the director's 1979 tv movie elvis and the 1981 film escape from new york, heads a cast of stalwart character actors, including keith david, donald moffat, richard dysart, and richard masur, in this tension-filled exploration of paranoia, as the shape-changing "thing", which first comes to their camp in the form of a guide dog a norwegian team is trying to kill, takes over each of them one by one. it isn't long before everybody in the camp begins to mistrust his fellow man. the ending of the film, in which russell and david are the only ones left, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity akin to the similar codas to both the birds and straw dogs.almost universally, when the subject of the thing is bought up, the emphasis is on the extremely gory special effects make-up and alien designs created by rob bottin, who had worked with carpenter on the 1980 horror classic the fog, and on joe dante's 1981 werewolf film the howling. these effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic, and even today, they can also be quite stomach-turning. but all of this would make carpenter's film nothing more than a high-end splatter epic if the direction, the story, and the acting weren't up to snuff; and thankfully, each of them are. when he's not concentrating on the enormously gruesome transformation sequences, carpenter builds suspense in the same hitchcock-influenced way that informed his previous films halloween and the fog, with cinematographer dean cundey's prowling camera-work, particularly through the corridors of the station, a significant help. the acting enhances an already-fine screenplay adaptation by bill lancaster; and we are also given a taut score by ennio morricone, whose work on director sergio leone's classic 1960s italian spaghetti westerns is well known to all, including of course carpenter himself. the thing also features additional fine visual effects from albert whitlock (who worked on many hitchcock films, including the birds), and roy arbogast, who worked on close encounters of the third kind and jaws 2.carpenter's film was not the success it could have been because universal chose to release this graphic shocker a mere two weeks after it had released steven spielberg's far more family-friendly e.t.: the extra-terrestrial (not surprisingly, critics and audiences at the time favored spielberg's excellent film over carpenter's equally excellent but exceedingly different one). also, most of the horror film box office business in 1982 was going to another spielberg-produced film, poltergeist. as a result, at a cost of $15 million, the thing suffered from lack of attention in its time.over time, however, many have come to see carpenter's film for what it is--an extremely gory but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, done with a great deal of flair and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia at the heart of its story. though it is still quite gruesome, the thing should be as much remembered for the skill by which the story is put together as it is for the gory alien designs and make-up effects; for it is the storytelling skill and the suspense that make it so memorable in the final analysis.

a brilliant horror film. utterly gruesome and very scary too. the thing is a remake from john carpenter, but please, do not let that put you off this film. it is simply brilliant. the start of the film has the alien's spacecraft hurtling towards the earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film's title in amazing shining white and blue stating 'the thing'. one of the best opening credits for a horror film ever.the cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their station in antartica is visually impressive on dvd widescreen. it must have been great in the cinema. i regret not seeing this on the big screen.kurt russell is excellent as macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base. all the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected. my favourite scene in the whole film has to be when macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection, it is tense, scary and finally spectacular. i love it because its funny as well.special mention must go to rob bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself. if he didn't get an oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have. this is also debatable as to whether this is john carpenter's greatest film...its certainly a gruesome masterpiece.wait for a cold winter night. get some budweiser from the fridge. sit down and watch the thing, a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and slime.utterly brilliant.ten out of ten.

i must say: out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out. it wasn't as epic as musa-the warriors and didn't develop the characters as well, but it had many nice ideas. simple story: a elite soldier thought dead, returns after years to end the reign of the japanese in korea in medieval days. his counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him. the fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch. the motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end. you might need to watch it again to get all the connections right. and me personally...i loved the end. i could watch it over and over again. maybe a little pathetic, but a real freedom fighter story.... people can be killed, but not the ideas they stand for....

john carpenter's "the thing" is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made. sadly as with most carpenter movies go it is also one of the most underrated movies being panned by critics shortly after it's release for a reason that is almost pathetic. it seems that at the time people were overwhelmed by the idea of the "good" alien. an idea spawned after the success of "i.t.". and the very thought that a movie dealing with aliens could deviate from that idea was regarded as heresy. human ignorance is truly a frightening thing, people need to judge films for what they are not for what they want them to be."the thing" itself is an interesting study on human paranoia as members of a u.s. antarctic base discover the presence of an alien being (refered throughout the movie only as a "thing") able to imitate any form of life. not knowing who might or might not be the creature, we see how every character reacts to the situation. there is no mass hysteria or panic just a slow and gradual descent in to chaos as more and more people turn up to be... not quite human.carpenter succeeds into elevating this movie into something far more than your average sci-fi/horror. there are no "whats behind you?" jumping moments here. instead relying on an intense atmosphere of mistrust and pre-apocalyptic despair along with some nicely balanced moments of visual terror with no small thanks to rob bottin's impressive creature effects, he gives us an experience not matched by many other horror films.instead of just throwing facts and plot elements at our face carpenter offers us a much a more gradual and delicate approach. by implying a sense of mystery he gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret-ate what has transpired in certain scenes, while giving enough plot to those who are not so fond of interpretation in movies.ennio morricone's score works all the way. it's minimalistic and depressing sound perfectly fits the movie's overall tone. although i've always wondered how would it have sounded if carpenter (he has been known to compose all of his movies's osts except this one) did it? characters while not as deeply developed are still memorable thanks to the good performances of the actors especially kurt russel who plays the "down-out" apathetic helicopter pilot r.j. macready. its worth noting how his character transforms through the movie. from his disregardful "don't give a ...." attitude in the beginning, to that of a unifier and leader of the group of men who try to fight "the thing". but even with that said, there are no false heroics here, there are no "laughing at the face of death" moments and there certainly isn't any sort of comic relief, the movie keeps its atmosphere from the very first scene to the last. speaking of which, here once again carpenter keeps his tradition of creating a powerful ending.quarter of a century after its release "the thing" doesn't feel dated. and with the disturbingly growing use of computer-generated effects it feels even stronger then before because it shows the life's work and dedication of human beings not computers. combined with its openness for analyzing it gives the viewer a lot more reasons to watch it for a second or third or fourth or ... time. a masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten.

people with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but the thing is far from being simply a horror classic. the fact that the extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day cgi is only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as a masterpiece. technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing, superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film justice. absolutely essential viewing.

john carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of sci-fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it to the extreme. a remake of the howard hawks produced 1951 original, carpenter keeps the cold-war themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the antarctic setting. carpenter's direction as always is excellent as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body takeover. but here and much like the work of david cronenberg, carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident, as through some fantastic special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore. however, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.9/10

when in 1982, "the thing" came out to theaters everywhere, it had a cold reception and very poor box-office results, becoming almost a failure in john carpenter's career as a horror director; however, time has proved that "the thing" was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the film's fault. nowadays, john carpenter's "the thing" has gained the appreciation it rightfully deserves and is considered by many horror fans as a horror classic, and not without a reason, as this new version of john w. campbell, jr.'s story "who goes there?" (previously adapted as "the thing from another world") is closer to the original tale and keeps a pessimistic feeling of dread and high doses of suspense in a masterfully crafted study about paranoia.the plot of "the thing", begins in the winter of 1982 in a u.s. research station located in the remote territories of antarctica, when the members of the crew notice a norwegian helicopter coming their way. the two apparently insane pilots of the helicopter are trying to kill a husky dog who makes its way into the american base. after the norwegians are killed accidentally, the americans try to figure out what made them to be insane. soon they'll discover that the husky dog the norwegians were hunting was not a normal dog, but a creature able to mimic every living creature, and not only that, it has a tremendous hunger.director john carpenter earned a place in history when in 1978 he directed the seminal slasher "halloween", where suspense and atmosphere were above gore and shock. "the thing" could be seen as an evolution of that style, as even when carpenter makes great use of rob bottin's special effects (which were labeled by critics as "repulsive" on its day), the film still focuses more on atmosphere and suspense rather than in the violent (and very well-done) displays of gore. the feeling of loneliness, as well as the "bad karma" between the members of the crew increase the feeling of paranoia as anyone could be the thing, even our main character, r. j. macready (kurt russell), ending in a situation where nobody can be trusted.this plot element was more faithful to the concept of the source novel, and was blatantly ignored by the previous version (not completely a bad thing, just a big difference), making this version feel less like a remake and more as a new conception of the source novel. bill lancaster's script handles the characters with brilliant domain, giving us enough to distinguish them, but not too much to completely trust them, making them an essential factor in the film's haunting feeling of dread that keeps running through the movie. the mystery and the suspense are at the max, as never one can tell who is the thing and who is normal, enhancing the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent results.the cast is very effective, and their performances as a whole so effective that one can almost feel the bad feelings between their characters as real. carpenter's regular collaborator kurt russell as macready carries the film, and through his eyes we witness the madness and the horror the research station becomes as the situations goes worse. definitely one of his best performances. wilford brimley is also terrific as dr. blair, a scientist that goes insane after discovering the thing's purposes."the thing" is a film so wonderfully crafted that its flaws tend to go unnoticed, although they exist. the most notorious being the very low-key and at times unappropriated score by ennio morricone. it's not exactly bad, but it just feels out of place at some scenes and it's not one of the best works by the legendary composer. also, due to some misshapes with the special effects, some scenes were left out that actually fill some small plot holes, although nothing of big importance or actually annoying.when talking about john carpenter's films, most people will almost instantly name "halloween" as his favorite film, but personally, i would go with "the thing", as i consider it carpenter's greatest achievement so far, and one of the most interesting and actually scary horror films ever made. i would go as far as to call it one of the finest films ever made. 10/10

the thing is a milestone in movie-making and remains one of my favourite films of all-time. despite the film's roots in science-fiction it is ultimately a horror film that brilliantly balances splatter with psychological trauma. today, over twenty five years after its release, the special effects stand up as an example of sheer brilliance and effects man rob bottin suffered a complete physical breakdown for his art. it would be impossible to make the same movie today as the studio would most certainly insist on casting a female character or a paul-walker type.an all-male american science team in antarctica are thrown into turmoil when an alien lifeform able to perfectly absorb and imitate other lifeforms infiltrates their camp. their trust in each other steadily crumbles as they become increasingly unsure who is real and who is an imitation, and this 'body-snatchers' scenario sees their numbers steadily dwindle as one-by-one, they fall victim to the thing. when cornered, it manifests itself as a different nightmarish creature, the metamorphosis always horrific and compelling.the helplessness, isolation and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men with no way out of their situation and no way of help reaching them is expertly sustained. the long hours of darkness and the mounting snowfall provide a bleak backdrop to the terror that unfolds. director john carpenter selected with great care a team of brilliant character-actors and each member of the team fits perfectly into the part they play, whether it be the young and street-wise chef, the elderly and wise doctor or the bitter and cynical helicopter pilot. the point is that no-one here comes close to being an all-american badass superhero with blonde locks and a six-pack and the film's real strength is thanks in no small part to this stark realism. the people suffering on-screen are recognisable in our daily lives.the thing remains consistently enjoyable and affecting even after repeated viewings. i have now seen the film on more than twenty separate occasions and my amazement at the quality of the direction, the acting and the special effects is unwavering. my girlfriend prefers the high-school spin-off of the film -the faculty- which is good and solid entertainment but far more light-hearted and whistful. she still loves and acknowledges the brilliance of the thing however, and thank goodness for that... because i could not remain in the company of someone who didn't love this movie.a classic and then some.

in 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens. steven spielberg's et, and john carpenter's the thing. of the two of them, et was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though the thing debuted first. because people were so entranced with spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from the thing in droves.its not hard to see why. the two are diametrically opposed. one is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart. the other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us. i guess audiences felt et was a much cuter prospect than the thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!it's taken some time, but the thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience. as it should. because the thing is that rare example of a superior remake. it takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways. indeed carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, alien. and that's even rarer!carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than the thing from another world did. it keeps the frigid wastes of antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation. but although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.frequent carpenter collaborator kurt russell returns, hot off the success of escape from new york, cast once again as one of carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes. he plays macready, the helicopter pilot at an antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess). the trouble begins when a norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over macready's, trying to gun down a siberian husky from the air.they end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the husky and add it to their own. except that this husky, is not a husky at all. but a shape-changing alien. the norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail. soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.the thing is one of john carpenter's finest films. in fact i'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made. even surpassing classics like halloween and dark star. the reason why i place the thing at the top of carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic. all the others thereafter have felt like carpenter was slumming it. films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.but the thing had john carpenter at the peak of his powers. never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. not even in the ferocious assault on precinct 13. from the second the alien makes its presence known, carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly. and when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.the film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. an approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. bringing in rob bottin of the howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. amorphous shapes. half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, the thing came under fire for being too realistic!that type of thinking misses the point entirely. it only shortchanges the film's values. and there are many. carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to. its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story. the thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications. characterisation has never been one of john carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in the thing. because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing. we're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who. and because of this, the thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.a special mention should go to the excellent film score from ennio morricone. a pulsing thud thud every two seconds. it creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. the scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.the thing is a pure unadulterated classic. even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. an underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received. and so much better than et!

in following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material, the thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. john carpenter fashions out of what must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched, brilliant puppetry and animatronics by rob bartin (with stan winston also on the team). these effects help set the tone against the harsh, detached environment carpenter sets up with his characters. the film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the shapes of others. it's given a full life by carpenter's choice of tones, and surprises. for someone following in the footsteps of howard hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old film.with the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely follow backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors pull along as a fine ensemble. unlike the squad in predator, these are mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of kurt russell's maccreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in fact). juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of wilford brimley and keith david. and it is refreshing to see how the sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone. i loved the long silences at times, with ennio morricone's spooky, curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in itself).it ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for for its genre/cult audience. it remains one of carpenter's best; a rare breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes. that's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in fact a couple of times it's almost funny. but given that it goes back to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was done completely without cgi. it's disgusting, but it's real, and atmospheric to a t.

the silly saying, "you can't touch this" surely applies here. with all the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time. that's why i always rely on the classics that scared the weewee out of me when i was a pre-teen.the thing is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest, ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that john carpenter, or any other director (sorry, even you mr. spielberg) ever made. what really gives it power, though, is not the gore (it ooooozes of slime and blood and god knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread, isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.you can't get more remote than antarctica, and in this howling, freezing white setting is where the story takes place. several americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. one day, they witness a siberian husky dog running for dear life from gun-wielding norwegians. before they know it, the american outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants. it may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished, but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't tell it among humans or other normal earth animals.kurt russell, keith david, wilford brimley, richard masur, donald moffatt, tk carter, thomas waites and charles hallahan are just a few of the fine cast. this film is the reason why horror can be a great genre. it actually still scares me. the alien blood "jumping" out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes me jump!!!still the scariest of them all.

the thing has to be one of the all time great movies. of course it was ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, i'd never seen anything like that! however, although the effects themselves made the movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the claustrophobic atmosphere of the anarctic as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station that makes it a classic. movies don't get any better than this! in the opening scene with the the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored scientists from some station letting of some steam. yet when you see them continue their chase at the us base you then think that the norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain of cabin fever. yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score that sets the tempo! you just know that something is not right! at this point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. however, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of agatha christie "who dunnit" ( i.e. ten little indians movie) sci-fi style as the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien. suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. the mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses until the final showdown.after 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making production the special effects in "the thing" don't carry the same weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all round with some great performances by the cast.

john carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of john w campbell jr's short story. the secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold. carpenter manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery needed to keep the film heading in the right direction. be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film to me is a perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. the dialogue is spot on for a group of men trying to keep it together under duress, and carpenter's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming thru the film. the cast are superb, a solid assembly of actors led by carpenter fave kurt russell, whilst the effects used give the right amount of impact needed. but most of all it's the ending that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it, lets wait and see what happens indeed, 10/10.

after seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films, i thought it looked very entertaining. before watching the movie i went on to imdb to see what ratings and comments it received. i was worried when i noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings. despite the hype, i watched to movie and to my surprise i found it unbelievable. the story was great (just pay attention) and the characters and their relationships within the film is astonishing. i haven't seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time. i really felt for both characters and sensed a strong bond. as reading previous posts about this movie not being "epic" enough or a lack of martial arts i could not disagree more. this film is what it is, its not braveheart and its not enter the dragon but it is still a wonderful film that does an excellent job combining story both and action.while sword in the moon isn't perfect (what movie is?) it still is wonderful and moving. just wait until the ending scene, with the music and cinematography together, its breathtaking. i only hope more people can see this movie to give it a fair voting.

remake of the classic 1951 "the thing from another world". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in antartica. they are invaded by a thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to. it starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. what are they going to do?the 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. that movie was scary. this one is too--but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material--the novelette "who goes there?") and it's scary in a different way. the movie starts right off with ennio morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and--when the thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding. there's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off, heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first by the thing. the gore effects are strong and real nightmare material. i don't scare easy but i had to sleep with the lights on when i saw this originally back in 1982. rob bottin's effects are just incredible--how this picture got by with an r rating is beyond me!it also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful. you're not sure who is what and carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension. one complaint--no one is given any distinctive personality traits. they actors just remain straight-faced and say their lines. that's annoying...but the movie still works.this was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with "e.t." and many critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie. it's now considered one of john carpenter's best. a must-see...for strong stomaches. not a date film!an amusing note: when this was released universal sent a note along with all prints of the film. they suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. they were afraid that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be close to a facility to throw up!

many people has got a film they think of as their favourite movie. my movie will always be john carpenter's the thing! the main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the splatter-effects created mainly by genius rob bottin and that this is the movie that made kurt russell what he is today (along with escape from n.y.) in my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to do with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting. i have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day the last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even the great "das boot".here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror movies: place yourself in the good chair of your home. be sure you're not interupted by anyone. if you aint got a projector, sit close to your tv and watch this miracle of a film. let it absorbe you, and you'll see it my way!best view time: late february between 5 and 9 in the evening.

antarctica, winter 1982. the team on an american research base get surprised by a couple of mad norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill it. all the norwegians are killed and the americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. that's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film i've ever seen.from the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. helpless and alone out in no-mans land. ennio morricone was nominated for a razzie award for his score. why i don't know 'cause as far as i can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. it really gets you in the right mood.the acting is great! the best performance is probably given by the dog who's just amazing. as for russell and the others on two legs i can say nothing less.you may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? well, think again! you haven't seen it all until you've seen this. bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... rob bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup.the movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known. in fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. nobody i've asked have heard of it. however the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and dvd. twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date. this movie is to be considered a classic.the movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. i've seen it several times, but it's just as good as the first time i saw it. as a norwegian the only thing i don't like about this movie is that macready keeps calling the norwegians swedes!

john carpenter's the thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. what makes the movie so great? it's hard to put my finger on it. everything just seems to work in the thing, it's one of the rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place. the film is even superior to alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell. the fact that it's not only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films. a truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in films.

this is another one of those films that i remember staying up late to watch on tv, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession. this is a great movie, and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before cgi.set on an isolated base in antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (the thing from another world) left off. the american scientists discover a decimated norwegian base some miles distant. everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. the thing is brought back to the american base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. the thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses its path, but also absorbing them, making itself into whoever and whatever it wants. the film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. everyone is suspect, anyone can be the thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. the group splinters and fear rules supreme. who is the thing?the gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. i could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien. the power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although i liked the original version, i prefer this one; the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected. when it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath is huge and the results are horrific.this is one of carpenters best films, right up there with the fog and halloween. all of the actors give strong, realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character. this film has something for any lover of the horror genre. don't miss it.

i am ashamed to say it, but i have to admit, the first time i saw this film was only about a year ago. after seeing it, i immediately rushed out and bought the dvd collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.the film is terrific on many levels. it works as your straight monster or action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look into the human psyche. the incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear, lent not only by carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general. kurt russell (obviously) is spectacularly understated in the lead role of macready, and, as a direct result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all american hero". the other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic film.

this was very funny, even if it fell apart a little at the end. does not go overboard with homage after to hitchcock - owen (danny devito) was lucky he had "strangers on a train" playing at the local cinema, so the movie flat out tells you that that was the inspiration. devito is very funny but also a little sad. he has no friends and all he wants to do is write and have someone like his writing. his teacher, billy crystal, is going through some serious writers block of his own and his wife has stolen his book and made it her own success, which also has him frustrated a great deal.best parts are the book proposal by mr. pinsky ("one hundred girls i'd like to pork") and all scenes with anne ramsey, who is so horrible that even mother theresa would have wanted to kill her, too!

"throw momma from the train" is a simple dark comedy with lots of laughs.billy crystal plays a frustrated writer on the verge of collapse; danny devito plays a man in one of crystal's writing classes. crystal's ex-wife is a *hag* to put it nicely, and crystal hates her. devito, sensing this, offers crystal a deal one night: devito will kill crystal's wife, if crystal kills devito's nag of a mother. crystal does, of course, refuse, but later, corruption deep in his heart makes him say yes. and so as things play out we see what happens when you try to throw someone's momma from a moving train.this story is an interesting character study; a story of evil, greed, revenge, ego, trust, doing what's right, but most of all corruption. we see crystal's white-collar writer become ever-stressed with events colliding around him, and because of devito's constant nagging, he says "yes." but we know deep down in his subconscious he wanted to say "yes," and he's pleased that he said it to devito.this movie is a bit of a dark spoof on hitchcock's immortal film "strangers on a train," and it plays an homage to the film early on, when there is a theater playing "strangers on a train." we see devito watching the movie, and a lightbulb in his head pops on. he gets an idea. throw momma from the train!billy crystal gives another convincing and strangely comical performance as a hassled writer on the verge of collapse. he has been so beaten down by everything around him that his inner-emotions come out and he agrees to throw devito's momma from the train. danny devito directed this film excellently. he uses just the right touch of comic darkness to create a world of corruption and sickness. everything is demented, but not to an extreme like in some other dark comedies. it has just the right touch of darkness that shone through in "the war of the roses."not only is "throw momma from the train" a simple tale of corruption and morality, but is also an interesting character study. definitely worth catching on tv.3.5/5 stars -john ulmer

i saw the movie on its north american premiere (july 14, 2004) at the fantasia festival. i was slightly disappointed as i had been expecting a more epic, ensemble cast movie along the lines of musa the warrior. instead, the movie concentrated only a much smaller number of characters. still, the movie was solid, thoughtful and visually intriguing. there were slightly jarring tone shifts from the dominant thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalties, intrigue and blood, versus the lighter, more flamboyant, martial arts sequences. it almost seemed as though the filmmakers couldn't make up their minds about whether the movie was supposed to be a martial arts "flick" or a historical epic. the story touches nicely on the issue about the need for loyalty versus the need to adapt to new situations. is it really worth your life and those of your friends to be loyal to one's master or does there come a time when one must submit to the winds of change? is there perhaps greater courage in leaving the old ways for new ones? how does one decide? these questions are raised in this movie, and ironically, there is the suggestion that the answer given, may in fact be the wrong one!

i don't understand this movies distinctly average rating!?i really really enjoyed it, i even stayed up till early morning to finish watching it on late night t.vthere are three excellent characters here, excellent characters. danny devito played a gem, quite a feat considering he was directing as well. his down trodden laughable at times character was brilliantly written and was surreal in a absolutely believable way. there are people like that, owen was just on the line without crossing it.billy crystal's comic syle and sense of timing was perfect for his role. his frustration/comedy was interesting and captivating and what's more... you could understand his feelings. to really feel like you know a character is hard to achieve from the writers point of view, to find the right actor to pull it off is an art in itself and both were achieved here thrice over.thirdly, who else could have played momma? there is no one that can play this part so well. there is a style there unlike any other, something you love to watch, i found myself waiting for her to appear on screen... and not because the rest was bad, oh no, but because momma's character was, again, so on the line without crossing it that it was excellent to watch.and what's more? a happy ending with new found friendships, no one getting hurt and everyone getting what they wanted in life... without a big hunk of cheese tied on the end.brilliant script, brilliant idea, perfect cast, great film.

this movie sat in a dusty stack of videos in my house for ages before we watched it. we knew it was there- every time someone wanted to watch a movie, it was suggested. it almost became a joke... "i know, let's watch throw momma from the train"... i don't know why it was always turned down, it just was. little did we know what we were missing out on. it still befalls me why it took us so long...i mean it stars danny devito, billy crystal, and ann ramsy (who we referred to as "the lady from the goonies"), an all star cast that should have appealed to everyone in my household. but there it sat for nearly ten years. until one day it was suggested and we could turn it down no longer....it was like finding king tut's tomb...no movie has ever made me laugh so hard, and i doubt any movie ever will. i had to rewind for almost every line because i was still laughing at the line that came before it, and lost ability to hear or pay attention. not just simple laughing, either... the kind of laughing that expends more energy than running ten miles in the cold. the kind of laughing that you cannot control, that causes rolling around and spasms, and tears and snot running down your face because it's just that freakin funny. once i learned the movie by heart i will say this effect has lessened, but i don't think i will get tired of watching it and finding new quirks in it to appreciate. i think that's all i can say. i would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you don't enjoy it please don't let me know, i will probably be offended.

i thought that the interplay between crystal and devito was great. the movie is rather off the wall, but there are some unforgettable lines. ramsey as "momma" is vulgar and over the top, but also very funny and effective. the character has to be pretty awful for why else would someone entertain thoughts of killing his mother? now crystal's wife -- she is a "slut" whom everyone would like to receive her comeuppance, thus her role, though minor, is also effective, because it has to justify crystal's ridiculous case of "writer's block." while there are certainly dark moments, the movie is not depressing and, despite the murderous urges that the protagonists feel, they have redeeming qualities too.overall, this is one of the funniest movies i can remember, one that i don't mind watching over several times.

in a really neat spin on hitchcock, larry (billy crystal) and owen (danny devito) lead unpleasant lives: larry's ex-wife has gotten rich by publishing a book that he wrote, and owen has the most overbearing mother imaginable. when larry tells owen to calm down by watching "strangers on a train", owen gets the idea that they should do criss-cross murders like in the movie. and just like in the movie, larry thinks that it's a joke, but owen's serious.how they came up with the idea for "throw momma from the train" i'll never know, but it's a hilarious movie. there isn't a dull moment in it. and that ending was a hoot. crystal and devito are at their best, and anne ramsey is as much of a hag here as she was in "the goonies". a modern classic.

you don't see the meaning of the title till much later, but you get the point of it in the first few minutes. this directorial debut from golden globe nominated (for actor) danny devito, also playing owen/ned 'little ned' lift, is a terrific hitchcock-like film about one man's hate for his wife's book (she stole his), and one man's hate for his mother. basically, owen wants to be a good writer, like his teacher larry donner (billy crystal), and he inspired by murder stories. larry suggests he see a hitchcock film, quite ironic, and that is when owen has the idea to kill larry's ex-wife, margaret (star trek voyager's kate mulgrew). owen is inspired by 'strangers on a train', swapping murders, so larry must kill owen's horrible momma (oscar and golden globe nominated anne ramsey). larry was convinced owen killed margaret, and also that he had to/wanted to kill owen's momma, but there is a happy ending when months later both larry and owen bring out books, momma died naturally, and they went on a holiday with beth ryan (kim greist). also starring rob reiner as joel and oprah winfrey. with hilarious moments, a great director/actor and his support, this is a must-see comedy. very, very good!

this movie is extremely funny - the character of momma keeps me returning to the movie time and time again! i can't get enough of her dry lines ... like when she tells her son owen to bury his friend in the back yard before he smells up the place ... and her suspicion that owen is trying to kill her by giving her unsalted nuts! it's hilarious!if you like movies such as national lampoon's vacation, uncle buck, or planes, trains & automobiles, this has similar humor. it's a great, wholesome laugh ... a must see!

just thinking about the movie, i laugh to myself. anne ramsey plays an unforgettable part as 'momma,' probably the most nasty, yet hilarious matriarch ever captured on film. danny devito and billy crystal make a fabulous duo, bringing a true warmth to the film. though not exceedingly complex, the cute story holds your attention, and keeps you laughing the whole way through. it's a fun comedy to lighten things up, and even will entertain the kids. i give it my full recommendation.

the one thing i really can't seem to forget about this movie, is its beginning: classic comedy, brilliantly crafted. i love it. see it for yourself (no spoilers here! :-). the sparring between devito and crystal also glows in this movie, with devito as the perfect oppressed son. one of my favourites. highly recommended for fans of crystal.

this movie was one of the rolling on the floor laughing movies i have ever seen. danny de vito plays owen perfectly. momma is excellently portrayed, and was one of the highlights of the movie.at the beginning of the movie it starts of differently then what you would expect. larry is trying to write a book and is having some troubles. larry teaches a writing class and owen tagged after larry trying to get him to read his story. owen eventually asks larry to kill his mother, and in return owen would kill larry's ex-wife. the whole movie was really hilarious.one of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when owen writes "throw momma from the train". larry gets furious because he just wrote a book of similar plot. it turns out that owen wrote a children's pop-up book.i would really recommend this movie. i gave it a 10.

now, throw momma from the train was not a great comedy, but it is a load of fun and makes you laugh. the title may seem a little strange, but the entire movie isn't literally about that, although it is about something just as sinister.danny de vito basically wants to kill his overbearing mother, and fast forward a little bit, some random and funny events take place. the premise is quite funny, and the things that billy crystal and danny de vito get into were great. some of the scenes seemed to not fit in for me, but this didn't make it a bad movie.for what it is, a wacky comedy, it pulls it off well and should be seen once just to say you saw it.

i am surprised people, after such lousy movies getting to be in the top 250 or just being in the 7.0's, i thought more people would get a kick out of "throw momma from the train". this was a great comedy by two terrific comedic actors, billy crystal and danny devito. together they made a great duo of insanity and obsession. billy is a man who just lost his million dollar story to his ex wife and repeatedly wishes her dead, danny has an insane and senile old mother who just abuses him. when billy gives some "misunderstood" advice to danny, danny offers a proposition to billy, if he kills his ex wife, billy has to kill his mother. this is a crazy and funny story that can always get a good laugh. please, sit back and enjoy this movie, people! it's a good one!7/10

a picture starring danny devito and billy crystal. they are both famous actors, and in this charming comedy entails them trying to murder each other's pet peeve. billy crystal's pet peeve being his ex wife who stole his book and put her name on it, and danny devito's pet peeve being his malignant mother. billy crystal is an author and a teacher apparently and danny devito is one of his students. this comedy classic is very entertaining and for all ages.danny devito seems to act like a child in this movie because of his evil mother who keeps putting him down all the time. she says things like "you have no friends!" and when billy crystal fell down, she said "burry him before he stinks up the basement!". she puts down danny also by calling him "lard ass!" and other things just to make him angry.

this movie is basically a spoof on hitchcock's strangers on a train, which i thought was overrated anyway. the plot has danny devito going to see strangers and then thinking billy crystal wants them to swap murders, for crystal to murder his mother and devito to murder his wife. both devito and crystal are great and so is devito's mother. this is devito's directorial debut and it's better than the war of the roses.

stars: danny devito, billy crystal, anne ramsey, kim griest, kate mulgrew, oprah winfrey and rob reiner.after college class, teacher larry (crystal) wants his ex-wife dead and owen (devito) wants his momma (ramsey) dead. when larry brings up that he wants his wife dead, owen knows what he must do for him, in order for a favor in return, for larry to kill his mother. devito is absolutely hilarious in this as the brain dead wannabe writer that has daydreams of poisoning his mom and sticking scissors through her head. he has a child like role that makes him seem more of a confused man than a killer. ramesy was actually nominated for an academy award for this because of her wonderful performance as mean old mrs. lift. along with having comedy, the film also has heart. one scene between devito and crystal starts off seemingly as a joke, but goes deeper, actually making me slightly sad. danny devito directed the film and did a good job getting the dark tone in to his direction. for any fan of comedies i recommend this.my rating: b plus. 84 mins. pg-13 for language, sexuality and violence.

this is a piece of cinematic beauty, and it shows more of quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province. it takes everybody into a first-person experience of the culture, to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived, breathed, and ate everything maurice richard. the book does this as well as the short, and i'm glad that in all the time i did spend studying french in high school, this was required reading in both languages.i thought it was brilliant to have roch carrier narrate this story. his molasses-thick accent brought a lot of realism to the story. the animation was good, as well, very surrealist, which brings attention to the idea of this being a whimsical daydream, fancying over better days gone by.again, as a symbol of culture quebecoise, this is unsurpassed. one can almost smell the tourtiere being cooked slowly over a wood stove. this whole film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be canadian, and encourage us all to appreciate the finer things of family and our roots. i'm from ontario, and this film made me fall in love with quebec. maurice richard va toujours vivre dans nos coeurs.

i throughly enjoyed this short, even as a toronto maple leafs fan. director sheldon cohen and narrator roch carrier captured all of the boy's emotions perfectly. from the feelings he had for his hero, maurice "rocket" richard, to the excitement, anticipation and hope of getting a new montreal canadiens sweater soon, to the look of horror on his face when he got his sweater from his mother; a toronto maple leafs sweater was priceless and the shame of having to wear this dreadful (in his eyes) blue and white toronto maple leafs sweater; not the rouge, bleu and blanc of the montreal canadiens with richard's number nine, like his old sweater. and worst of all, his mum made him wear this maple leafs sweater out of the house. you could envision and anticipate the ridicule he would get from his friends when he hit the ice wearing that sweater before he got there.i was laughing the whole time and this is one of the best animated shorts i've seen.

this movie made by the nfbc was made in honor of the montreal canadians dynasty years in the 50's,60's and 70's. my 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. i have been a canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life. on a scale of 1-10, i give this film a 117. all hockey fans should see this as i hope it will be placed in the hockey hall of fame in toronto and shown at the bell centre in montreal or here in edmonton at rexall place. watch this film with your family it is a great movie. i also recommend the book in both french and english. go habs go.

last evening i had the remarkable pleasure of seeing the movie hitch. i was stunned and amazed. will smith did a phenomenal job in a role that he isn't always associated with. he proved once and for all that he does not need to be holding a gun to be a great actor in a movie. kevin james was also very impressive. i admit that i've always like him on "the king of queens" but this role really brought him into the light more, and i hope to see him on the big screen a lot more in the near future. the movie was funny and adorable and i recommend it to any guy as the best date movie you could ever imagine. the mix of comedy, romance, and drama left me feeling complete. it's nothing like most "chick flicks" in the sense of tears and sadness, but holds its own and i think can be equally enjoyed by males as well as females. i encourage all couples especially to see this movie but even if you aren't involved with someone you may pick up some great ideas from hitch. two way big thumbs up!!!

i expected a good movie. what i got was an even better movie. the chemistry between james and smith is just incredible. glad to see him in a major motion picture for once!the movie works, because the actors play their parts perfectly. will smith is fantastic with his never ending charm; kevin james is hilarious, and eva mendes...well, let's just say she plays that bitch/sweet/annoying role to the best of her ability.what i loved about the movie was the fact that will smith didn't even have to try to be lovable. he just was!! the "date doctor" had all the right moves, said everything in the most perfect of ways, and never ever went over the top.the funny parts are hilarious...and the cute, romantic parts are unforgettable.i totally recommend this movie. and no, it is not a chick flick.

this film was not about stereotypes, nor dance moves, nor pickup lines, really. this film was about the vulnerability of peoples' hearts. it was hard to believe that kevin james could play in a convincing role, that will smith could satisfy without action, and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way. i don't intend to sound overly endeared with this film - it wasn't "groundbreaking" in any sort of way - but it was a film worth seeing. was it believable? no. new york couldn't be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the "hutzpah" of hitch. sure, there are bar-studs, but not ones that can get any chick, at any time - excluding those raking in seven figures, of course. the thing that worked best for this film was its true focus on the dramatic side of things, not just on the comedy. it was a funny two hours, no doubt. but it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat, become immersed in the characters, and smile.

this was a movie that, at the end, i thought "now that was an enjoyable 2 hours!" i hate spending around $20 (not including baby-sitting $$) for my husband and myself to have that "it was ok" feeling.i think i like will smith better as a comedic actor than an action hero. he was well cast in this. his character was very likable, as was kevin james'. there were several laugh out loud scenes. it's also a romantic movie, so guys, if you want to impress the lady in your life, take her to this. women will like it as much as any chick-flick, but i wouldn't categorize this as one. there is plenty of guy humor in it for men to enjoy. i think that's one of the reasons why this movie is so perfect as a date movie. it has romance and slapstick. i don't usually like slapstick that much, but it wasn't overdone and i can't think of any those scenes that didn't deliver laughs.i definitely recommend this movie. the first thing my husband said to me after it was over was "i want to see it again!"

i wasn't sure about getting this movie on dvd because i really do have something against people making black and white films in the 21st century, but i ended up buying it anyway. i still don't understand why it had to be black and white, but that's the only negativity i can see about the film, and it sure is a perfect example to see the definitive rise of brazilian cinema. not everyone can understand a film like this, but it's quite rewarding to those who do. unlike o homem que copiava, the surrealism fits this movie pretty well, and the acting is at least as good as that one, or other successful brazilian films such as bicho de sete cabe√ßas, cidade de deus, brava gente brasileira, etc.. my only hope is that this gem doesn't get insulted and raped by a crappy hollywood remake. it's amazing to see how those guys spend zillions of dollars and still can't make a movie that's 1% as good as this possibly low-budget flick. bravo to the entire crew! 10/10

fado is a sad almost bluesy style of portuguese gypsy music that is heard repeatedly trough the movie. as explained by one of the main characters (igor) it also means fate.indeed it's fate that bring the two main characters paco and alex together and triggers the problems that ensue.on the whole i enjoyed it quite a bit. it starts out as an 'on the down and outs' drama/road movie an builds into a suspenseful thriller / road movie.there were two things that i found unrealistic that kept me from giving it a higher rating (i gave it an 8). the first is the major point of why did alex give the stuff away. she was so desperate for cash that she sold her passport for a paltry sum and then she gives away things worth thousands to a stranger? her explanation was unconvincing. also how did they get through the gate, where were the cops?

this existential thriller, in portuguese with english subtitles, is a modern version of the american filmes noires of the 40s, complete with a surprise twist at the end. it is riveting from beginning to end. my only criticism is its poor production values. the film looks cheaply made, and it probably was, so the black and white cinematography is vastly inferior to that of godard in vivre sa vie, to cite another film noir of more than 30 years earlier. most maddening of all, the subtitles are often hard to read. when will filmmakers learn and provide yellow subtitles so that they can be read against a white background. i'd give this an 8 overall, although with better production values it could have been higher.

i have read the last comment made on this film and have to utterly and totally disagree with it.you see, i am of portuguese nationality and even though this film may say little to someone coming from boston, it surely says something to both portuguese and brazilian people, as well as immigrants everywhere.and why, you may wonder? well, firstly, this film deals with two sibling nations: portugal and brazil. brazil gained its independence in the early 19th century (by the hands of the heir to the portuguese throne)and since then relations improved greatly. however, meaningful as this may be, there is still a lot of prejudice. because of the economic climate in brazil during the 1990's, immigration to portugal grew massively. you see, portugal is not only a country sharing a similar language, culture and beliefs as brazil but is also a gateway to the rest of europe. some people were thus forced to make the decision to cross the atlantic and look for a better life and portugal was the first logical place to try to immigrate to. as it happens still with a lot of immigrants, they were paid averages below the minimum wage and were treated like "dirt" - only in this case, because the language is similar, they were constantly made aware of their status as immigrants.another curious thing in this film is the idea it conveys of how a man so knowledgeable of the history of his own country still tried to make a quick buck through exporting coveted national resources. it is exactly people like this that keep brazil in a constant state of arrested development, as the country is well endowed in natural resources and could easily climb the economic ladder should it be given a fair opportunity.in a sense, this goes to show how colonialism still exists - pablo representing the exploited people, igor the man whose status as a "nobleman" (or at least rich or "well off") is assured by the foreign colonialist power which is in turn represented by kraft.if you have seen other films by salles you will recognize this as a recurring topic - the struggle against an oppressing power. i do not mean to lecture or be patronising as to teach anyone history but i thought this film was, symbolically speaking, very powerful. i am not saying there wasn't room for improvement (as there always is) but i think the last comment written on it was not only narrow minded but hands down ignorant.one last thing to be said on this, i have to assume you have watched this film with the eyes of an "american film watcher". no harm intended by this remark but i mean "foreign" films cannot all be about "beautiful scenery" - art deals with the problems of its time. you would not expect otto dix, for example, to paint all the lovely places in bayern and the black forest... why should you expect a film maker to focus exclusively on scenery when he feels there are more relevant issues to attend to?in a nutshell, do not judge films lightly and with only two or three criteria in scope. this film is very interesting, its photography is quite good and even the idea the black and white colouring conveys goes hand-in-hand with what it deals with. i believe the image is purposefully grainy... like reality, no? :)watch it and reach your own conclusions...

this show is sheer entertainment and doesn't try to be a greek drama. it certainly contains elements of one what with all the plot twists, but it's immensely engaging and fun. las vegas is the perfect setting for a show and they will certainly never have a lack of material to work with! anything and everything does happen there! the actors in this show are extremely personable and you really do want to see what they are up to and into each week. the show is also very funny. the humor arises from the characters and situations. not just thrown in gratuitously. it's a well-crafted show in that regard. it certainly makes me look forward to friday nights and i'm glad i now own the first two seasons on dvd!

i would assume that this film would get rave reviews in canada--particularly in quebec. that's because the canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the montreal canadians were like gods in canada for decades. as an american, the closest thing we have to them are the new york yankees. if you are a fan, then they are the greatest and winningest team in history. if you are not a fan, then they are satan's team!! well, at least that's how it was as i grew up in washington, dc in regard to the dallas cowboys. so i am pretty sure when this film was shown up north that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction--their national sport and the closest thing they have to a national team in the nhl.now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around ottawa and rooting for the canadians and maurice "the rocket" richard. however, when his mother accidentally buys him a toronto maple leafs jersey and forces him to wear it, i knew right away what a horrible and shameful thing this would be to a little boy. this ability to connect to the character--even though he lives in a far off land is what made this a very special short film. the way the other kids treated him and his conversation with god at the end make this a lovely nostalgic film. very clever and memorable.

i don't usually comment on films or tv shows but had to post a comment about las vegas.naturally here in the uk we are about 2/3rd's through the 3rd season and though i have managed to watch the last series of season 3 ( via other means ) i'm still glued every friday at 9pm.from the very first episode of season 1 i have been a big big fan of this show and own all 3 seasons on dvd, yes i cannot wait for season 4 to start in october.so why do i love this show so much, well i have to agree with the last poster.... james caan, i know one person cannot make a team but big ed deline was made for caan or maybe it was the other way around, i read that the producers were considering martin sheen for ed deline.... do'h no way!!! i also agree that caan's character is getting very soft, i also preferred the tough take no sh*t big bad eddy d that we saw in season 1 & 2, he seems to have mellowed out.as i said no one person makes the team by themselves's and of course the other cast members josh duhamel/danny, james lesure/mike, vanessa marcil/sam, nikki cox/mary, molly sims/delinda all contribute well, even outside cast members such as cheryl ladd as jillian deline, harry groener as gunther, dean caine as casey, mitchell longley as mitch who may feature 6 or 7 times during a season can fit in just as well as if they've been in every single episode from day one.this show has everything, drama, action, suspense, laughs, romance, glitz's, glamour and big time celebrity's who often play themselves's.many may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital tv and i hope it may long continue after season 4.

i adored this, but i am an 80's kid. i loved rainbow bright my whole childhood. i don't know if little ones these days would be very interested in the show, mine wasn't. (but thats okay, i bought it for me anyway. i just brought the little one so the guy at the checkout stand wouldn't look at me funny.)i love the non violent drama, and the colorful scenery. it just reminds me of a simpler time before cartoons had more violence than our local news can legally show. :) although i may be just a little biased on the subject. afterall i was rainbow bright 6 years in a row for halloween........i wonder if they make a rainbow bright costume for adults. lol.

people talk about how horrible the script was, and how horrible the animation was, but rainbow brite and the star stealer really is a japanese anime aimed towards children. if you look at the anime today it's done in the same style, and it's immensely popular. i don't think this movie was ever intended to be viewed by adults. just as i don't think it was ever intended to be serious. the very things that people seem to hate about this movie are the things that i love. rainbow brite is one of the best cartoon characters ever created in my opinion. she's smart. she's funny. she cares about the enviorment. she cares about her friends. this movie can teach so much to young kids. my little brothers even liked this movie. i have to say this movie taught me a lot when i was a kid. when it came out on dvd i was first in line to buy it. it's a great kids movie. so what if it's not perfect, nothing is really perfect when you look closely enough at it.

rainbow brite and the star stealer, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. i felt all warm and tingly when rainbow brite (voice of bettina) and krys (voice of david mendenhall) set out to get revenge on the princess (voice of rhonad aldrich). if you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. to me, she deserved to have rainbow brite and krys seek revenge on him. however, i liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting. in addition, i thought that lurky (voiec of pat fraley) and murky (voiec of peter cullen) were diabolical. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and disney has scored a big hit. in conclusion, i highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to everyone who hasn't seen it, especially die-hard fans of the tv series. i guarantee you you'll enjoy it.

this is exactly what australian television and australian politics needs, people with a sense of humour!!! good on abc for supporting these guys. the show is based around a couple of aussie blokes who know how to take the mickey out of politicians or other people in the limelight. the boys use sydney as their main base for making a splash in the public. keep an eye out for the crazy wharehouse guy or mr ten questions. the guys who perform these acts are the same guys that presented cnnn. if you enjoyed cnnnn and the glasshouse then you will love this show. i am still interested in knowing which stunts are real and which are purely acting because there are some questionable actions made by the guys...

this show is up there with the best comedys made in australia as it makes fun of pretty much anything which is what lots of our public want. some of the best bits in the show are the ad road test which tests out how an ad would do in real life. what is really great about the show is how original it is and the fact that it has people(the chasers)who love doing what they do and who would n't. this show has loads of bits in it that can crack up anybody like the ad road test which i've already mentioned, mr ten questions where he asks 10 questions really fast in front of famous celebrities like hugh jackman and the beach boys, temporary ones like the chasers emmys and ones that have been there from the start like what have we learnt from current affairs this week. overall i rate thin show 98%.

the hilarious team that brought you 'cnnnn' and 'the chaser decides' have returned to the abc with their new series, 'the chaser's war on everything.' filmed in front of a live audience, the chaser team, once again, does what it does best- lampooning key political figures, international celebrities and media personalities.the satire is simply priceless, and nothing is sacred. in recent weeks, the chaser team has chased alongside the queen (during her visit to australia) to try and have john howard dismissed and had kim beazley (aust. opposition leader) threaten to kneecap them.a particularly funny segment is "mr. ten questions," showing an overly enthusiastic reporter who approaches celebrities (recently charlize theron and the backstreet boys) and asks them ten such inane questions as "what is your optimum length of rice grain?" just for the record, theron ignored him and walked away, and one of the backstreet boys got angry and "refused to dignify it with a response."a segment that recently had me in stitches was when one of the team decided to become a 'statue busker' to score some extra money. when he realized how hopeless he was, he put a real statue in his place. the perfect scam! he got thirty dollars in twenty minutes!a brilliant satire of everything in australian society. two thumbs up!(by the way, the show won't be showing for the three weeks after easter, because "though the team are all atheists, they're also hypocrites.")

no matter what country your in you have to buy this show, sure it is australian and if you ever seen any attempt of our comedy's they pretty much suck but with the chaser's they aren't boring forty year old men making bad puns they are a team of people who talk about current affairs (pretty much in australia) make fun of our crap ads, make fun of our politicians and so on.the guys also had a show in 2002 called cnnnn which was not as successful as the war which had only started this year so everything they talk about is current news which is really good considering no matter how boring or tragic it is they try to shine some humorous light on things.

for comedy to work, there are many factors involved:1. don't be afraid to take risks. 2. if anyone or anything deserves to be poked fun at, do it and continue to do it,...but most of all:3. be funny!!!!"the chaser's war on everything" succeeds in all those three things. in fact, the show proved to be so popular and so funny that already only months after it's first episode, a dvd of the first season was released. i picked it up within days of it being released and hit the floor laughing and had so many fu#@ing tears in my eyes- it's that well, good!in short and to save me blabbing on about the show- watch it, buy it, podcast it, whatever will make you watch the fu$#ing best show in the world!!!!!go the chaser!!!!

the chaser's war on everything is a weekly show from the guys that brought you cnnnn and the chaser decides where each week the 5 chasers and firth break down the issues that we didn't know were important.this show goes beyond the mere satirizing of politics and television by not being afraid to take the mickey out of anyone whether it be a counter-girl at subway or even the prime-minister of australia and although this may be familiar ground in say american television it has never been this well executed.the chaser's war on everything is the smartest, funniest and overall most entertaining show on australian television and if you haven't seen it you seriously owe it to yourself to give it a watch.

lets face it, australian tv is for the most part terrible, but this is a real diamond in the rough that not enough people are watching. the chaser crew who do the satirical newspaper and cnnn try something new by mixing live comedy, pre-recorded skits and political satire into one show filmed in front of a live audience, sorta like rove, but funny. they love causing controversy and this causes some of the shows funniest moments, especially chris telling his wife to "f-- off" live on breakfast television and julian handing a novelty cheque signed by saddam heusein to the head of the awb. it has to be one of the funniest aussie shows since the micallef program.

i know one is not supposed to comment on other users' comments, but i will say that a lot of the negative reviews seem to come from people who already knew quite a lot about the manhattan project and were annoyed at things that were left out. (from his book 'smoking in bed' it appears the original screenwriter bruce robinson is another such.) i knew very little before watching the film, however, and found it rivetting. dwight schultz is absolutely mesmeric as oppenheimer - a truly magnetic, charismatic presence, an inspired piece of casting that makes me wonder why he isn't given better roles and more leading parts. john cusack and paul newman are excellent as always. one could quibble with various script or direction choices, but as it is the film is extremely intense and horrific at times and overall i give it four stars out of five.

i saw this again today for the first time in about 6 years. i had forgotten how well acted this movie is. paul newman gets the billing, but dwight schultz holds his own and shows how good an actor he really is.

the movie seemed a little slow at first. but it picked up speed and got right to the point. it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the "gadget". i enjoyed it. it is very close to reality as any movie about the atomic bombs that were to be dropped on japan. i have recommended it to friends. i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz.

this is a weird and compelling film. the topic, about the atom bombs created at los alamos, nm in the usa and used on japan during the latter part of world war ii, is huge, and of course deeply disturbing. the film's plot takes on a lot of heavy issues and the actors have to carry much of the creative tension. i had never seen the film, or was much interested in it i have to admit, until i read the book "smoking in bed: conversations with bruce robinson." robinson wrote the story and screenplay. i think the film was better than i expected from reading robinson's point of view in the conversations about it, but i can see how he thought it got derailed. i think paul newman is pretty good, but is somehow at bottom, miscast. he's too hollywood. at one point, a big, mean-looking guy storms into newman's office and has such a striking presence, i immediately thought he should be playing the character newman is playing. the other lead, who plays the head scientist, is also fairly good, but somehow not brilliant enough to portray the huge angst that goes with the part - the immense responsibility for creation of an ultimate machine of death and destruction. one of the more effective characters seems to be a composite personality, played by john cusack. he is oddly affecting throughout, and in the end, is the character whose fate really hits home and who made me think most vividly of the fate of more than 200,000 japanese people in hiroshima and nagasaki.

i find it remarkable that so little was actually done with the story of the a-bomb and it's development for decades after the manhattan project was completed. my suspicion is that this was due to serious fears in the movie and entertainment industries (in the 1950s through the 1970s) with "mccarthyism" and related national security phobias (including the hollywood blacklist). there was one film in the 1950s (with robert taylor) about col. paul tibbits who flew the enola gay in the hiroshima bombing, but otherwise nothing else. one could glance at a side issue tragedy (the sinking of the u.s.s. indianapolis soon after the delivery of the bombs to tinian) in robert shaw's description of the shark attacks on the survivors in jaws. but the actual trials and tribulations of groves, oppenheimer, and their team was not considered film-able.and then in 1989 two films appeared. i have reviewed one already (day one) which i feel is the better of the two in discussing the lengthy technical and emotional and political problems in the manhattan project. the acting of brian dennehy as general groves and david strahairn as oppenheimer was first rate and neatly balanced. small side vignettes concerning the anti-bomb crusade of szilard (michael tucker) help fill out the story well.that's the problem here. paul newman is a great actor (as is mr. dennehy) but newman approached groves in a different way that while not dreadful is lesser than dennehy's intelligent but soft spoken military brass. newman seems too popped eyed about the possibility of the weapon as the biggest stick to confront the other boys in the after-school yard with. yes it certainly was, but the real groves would have been more like dennehy keeping his mind not on that great toy of the future but on the business of creating that great toy. dwight schultz's performance as oppeheimer helps maintain the film's basically interesting and good production, aided by bonnie bedelia as his wife. but the most interesting aspect of this film is in the upgrading of the two tragedies of daghlian and slotin, in particular the latter, in the character of john cusack's merriman. inevitably in all technological advances people are killed. it's just that these two tragedies (on top of the tens of thousands that were lost in hiroshima and nagasaki) brought home the dangers of the new unleashed power even in a so-called peaceful, controlled experiment. the two tragedies (particularly louis slotin's slow, agonizing death by radiation poisoning) showed how much care was needed in using atomic power - and how the barest of chances could still cause disaster. the only really different thing i saw in cusack's performance (and the script) and the actual incident with slotin was that slotin actually took some time after the accident to figure out where all his fellow research scientists were when they were hit by the radiation from the accident (he was able to show that only he got the full effect of the accidental blast, so that only relatively minor treatment would be needed by the others). perhaps the full story of slotin's actions was too technical for the screen, but given the humongous pain he suffered in the end that he took time off to think of the others shows what a first rate person he really was.

there have been numerous productions that tell of the development of the atomic bomb. the robert taylor film above and beyond (flag waving interservice propaganda really; if you believe this one you think that the army air corps, in the person of paul w. tibbits, ran the entire show!), the nbc produced enola gay (probably a lot closer to the mark), and the bbc-tv series, oppenheimer, with sam waterston in the title role.fat man and little boy takes the same approach that the bbc series did but widens it; it avoids the "gee whiz" technology of the manhattan project and focuses on human aspects; the personalities involved in the work. instead of focusing on oppie, it covers a wide swath of mythical but pretty typical people who were part of it.with reservations, dwight schultz did a good job as oppie, presenting a dreamy, ivory tower academic who struggles to relate his contributions as a physicist to his inclinations to view the world in a wider social and moral context... only to have that struggle won by an overriding lust for personal power and glory. in the day after trinity it was made clear that oppenheimer viewed himself as a "superior being" by virtue of his vast, wide ranging intellectual prowess. in the end that was robert oppenheimer's downfall; he saw himself as a sort of "philosopher/king", a moral and intellectual superior who could (and rightfully should) "wisely" prescribe what was best for the rest of the world re. nuclear weapons development and deployment. unfortunately, wisdom doesn't dictate the actions of nations or direction of events on a global scale. wisdom doesn't bestow temporal power. when it tries to exercise such nonexistent power (as oppie found when he opposed the development of "the super", the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and banished by those who really have the power.i found myself faulting schultz character in one way; his oppie exposes himself too closely and personally to the manhattan project, despite the doubts and fears that tore at his intellectual basis. the real oppenheimer would have had to take a different approach; at the beginning he would have had to come to the firm resolution that the project would result in ultimate good. the ugliness it produced along the way would be an incidental price that must be paid to attain that ultimate good, and it must be ignored... at least until the end of the project when there was leisure to assess the gains and losses. oppie clearly did that, and it resulted in his controversial postwar statements to the effect that science had now known sin, and that was a knowledge it could never lose. while the project went on, such considerations had to be pushed aside if he was to maintain his sanity.because of this ambiguity, schultz character comes off as a weak, frightened little boy who could never have served as "coordinator of rapid rupture", as oppenheimer unofficially dubbed his post.paul newman's take on gen. leslie r. groves is fascinating, and a bravura performance, if possibly a little bit over the top.groves was a civil engineer by training, but first and foremost he was a soldier, and a general to boot! he's accustomed to demanding that things go his way... intensely driven, a foul mouthed, spoiled child who has tantrums at the drop of a hat, who reveres his country and isn't too proud to fall on his knees and pray. in other words, very much like real (ie, non civil engineer) soldiers, aka george patton! grove's mission not only comes first, it is his only consideration... feelings and egos be damned, except for his own, of course! groves couldn't admit it, but he knew full well that he needed oppenheimer; military rank meant nothing in the world of theoretical physicists. oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds he had to straddle.again... i have to fault the script on this, and for the same reason.in reality, groves already owned oppie; if he didn't, oppie would never have been chosen for the post in the first place. history tells of many cases where other scientists, some as stellar as oppenheimer, simply walked away from groves recruitment efforts. at one point groves was so desperate that he proposed drafting the physicists he needed!groves attempts in the film to maneuver and control oppie were unnecessary... they only exist here as a dramatic device which indeed helps make the atmosphere of the film quite ugly.kusak's "michael merriman" is a composite of several real characters, but they're from a different time frame. several research accidents similar to the one depicted happened in postwar weapons research. merriman's radiation overdose creates another ugliness in the film, but one which is, imho, necessary, and pretty accurate. people with weak stomachs will have a hard time handling the hospital sequences; they're all too real.the main idea that comes across, but not strongly enough imho, is the big truth of the los alamos experience. the scientists who signed on were young, idealistic and naive as well as talented. most were on their first excursion out of the shelter of the campus. to them the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without the constraints of budgets or "excessive" bureaucratic oversight. it was not only their brilliance, but their youthful exuberance that produced the atomic bomb. there's plenty here to make the thoughtful viewer intensely uncomfortable about this movie. just the same, if you filter out the hollywood bs (there isn't that much of it really), this is probably a pretty accurate view of the inside of manhattan project.

if you know anything about the manhattan project, you will find "fat man and little boy" at least an interesting depiction of the events surrounding that story. the film is in all ways a very realistic portrayal of these events, and in many ways it is almost too real (such as some scenes involving radiation poisoning). paul newman, as usual, is brilliant in his role and always manages to come off like a real person on the screen. the supporting cast, such as john cusack, laura dern, bonnie bedelia, and natasha richardson, is fairly good as well. this film is not, however, one of the best examples of turning a true story into a movie. great films are able to take a true story and use just enough artistic license to keep its audience engaged for the entire movie. this one, however, tends to drag a bit throughout, and some scenes (such as john cusack and natasha richardson's love story) could have been eliminated entirely without causing the film to lose much. nevertheless, there are enough interesting facts and tiny humorous bits to at least keep the audience interested enough to see the entire film. it does not always entertain, but as far as great depictions go, this is very accurate, fascinating, and will leave the audience with something to think about.*** out of ****

fat man and little boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs that were dropped in reverse order on nagasaki and hiroshina. how these came to be and came to be in american hands is the story of this film.the terms by the way are the code names of two bombs fueled with plutonium and uranium. fat man was the plutonium bomb and that one was dropped on nagasaki and little boy was the one used on hiroshimathe film is primarily a conflict between general leslie r. groves of the united states army and physicist j. robert oppenheimer who led the team of scientists who developed the bomb under groves's direction. with two men from as widely divergent backgrounds as these were, conflict was inevitable.paul newman who all his life has been a disarmament activist plays general groves. to his credit newman does not play a man whose views he would very little in common with as any kind of caricature. groves is a military man first and foremost with an engineering background. he wanted a combat command as trained military professionals would naturally want in this greatest of wars. but because of his background in engineering groves got to head the manhattan project which was what the effort was code named. so be it, newman is determined to make his contribution to the war effort count.most of us first became acquainted with dwight schultz from the a-team as h.m. murdoch the pilot whose grip on reality is tenuous at best. if one was only acquainted with the a-team, one might think that schultz had a great future in comic roles.instead dwight schultz is one of the best actors in the english speaking world with an astonishing range of dramatic parts since leaving that television series. j. robert oppenheimer in life was a complex man who recognized the dangers and benefits of atomic energy. the challenge of the problem also intrigues him. later on oppenheimer got into a real bind because of his left-wing political views and associates which everyone knew walking into the manhattan project. some of the lesser roles that stand out are bonnie bedelia as mrs. oppenheimer, natasha richardson as oppenheimer's communist mistress whose affair with oppenheimer got him in such a jackpot later on, and laura dern as a nurse at the los alamos site.but the best is john cusack who as michael merriman is a composite of some real life scientists who might accurately be labeled as the first casualties of the atomic age. his scenes with laura dern, especially with what happens to him, take on a real poignancy.the debate over the bombs as the use put to them is still a matter of raging debate. fat man and little boy presents the facts and lets you decide what might have happened if an alternative use of them had been taken.

we watched this movie in my chemistry class, so obviously it had educational value. i thought the film did a really good job of intertwining the subjects of the science, moral issues and personal experiences of the manhattan project, but wasn't exactly focused on strong acting. i would recommend this movie for the scientifically inclined or those interested in the moral issues behind fat man and little boy, but if the subject of nuclear bombs bores you, don't see it.

it was a fascinating story waiting to be told. fat man and little boy takes us inside the trials and tribulations of a group of top american scientists handed a lofty task during the second world war: beat everyone else to the atomic bomb. sequestered in a heavily-guarded new mexico compound, the brainiacs slowly turn the idea from ambitious concept into immense reality.fat man and little boy is one of those films that requires your close attention. it's a real thinking person's movie, not only from the scientific aspect of developing a seemingly impossible weapon, but also the moral implications of contributing to killing on a massive scale. characters are constantly torn between that reality and their wartime duty as americans. the film is never preachy about, however, leaving us free to marvel at the enormity of the inner turmoil these men face. the performances deserve special mention as well. paul newman delivers one of his great, understated performances as the pattonesque general in charge of delivering the ultimate big stick for the allied forces.where fat man and little boy loses much of its traction is in the unnecessary romantic component. dwight schultz as the leader of the scientific team struggles with his affections for his family and his relentless obsession with his big project. director roland joffe apparently felt the need to explore the more human angles of this story, but the romantic overtones serve primarily as a distraction. besides, it's the interaction among the scientists and their military hierarchy that give us the greatest insight into the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant men.still, it's difficult not to recommend fat man and little boy. it's a largely forgotten gem that puts a human face put on one of the most intriguing stories in human history.

how is bear¬¥s paw, elephant¬¥s trunk or monkey¬¥s brain for dinner? let tsui hark tell you in this wonderful and lighthearted comedy about the art of cooking the traditional(?) chinese way.this movie shares the common structure of an american sports movie, but instead of focusing on baseball it centers around cooking which makes it all the more interesting. i even think leslie cheung¬¥s character look a lot like charlie sheen in major league...this movie also contains a bit of zhao wen zhao vs xiong xin xin fighting (love seeing more of that after the blade) and a quite funny in-joke concerning a leon lai pop song...perhaps not the ideal movie for the strict vegetarian though.

i have spent many years studying all the great directors, like kurosawa, lean, fulci, lenzi, deodato, peckinpah, kubrick and admire them greatly. my favourite film is once upon a time in america.i have only recently become a fan of d'amato, and while he was no horror master, his films were extreme whether it be soft core, hardcore or extreme.porno holocaust is now one of my favourite films, the way its shot is brilliant and the music is catchy.joe d'amato, wasn't a horror master, he's no fulci or bava, but however he was a master of erotica, no other director could shoot erotic films like him, he also never tried making any films outside of these genre's either.long live joe d'aamto-master of porn and erotica!

i've heard a lot about porno holocaust and its twin film erotic nights of the living dead. both films are interchangeable and were filmed at the same time on the same location with the same actors changing clothes for each film (and taking them off). if you are expecting the d'amato genius displayed in films like buio omega or death smiles on murder, you won't find it here. nonetheless this film has a charm that exploitation fans will not be able to resist. where else will you see hardcore sex mixed with a zombie/monster and his enormous penis that strangles and chokes women to death? only from d'amato. there is some amount of gore in which many of the men are bludgeoned to death. the film is set on a beautiful tropical island. as far as i know there is no subtitled version, so if you don't speak italian you wont know what is going on...but who cares right? in all honesty, gore fans will probably fast forward through the hardcore sex. and if anyone is actually watching this for the sex only, will for sure be offended instantly. i can just imagine modern day porn fans tracing back through d'amato's output and coming across this atrocity! out of the two i find erotic nights of the living dead far superior. but, don't bother watching either if they are cut. porno holocaust is extremely low budget as expected. even the monster looks no where as good as george eastman's character in anthropophagus. the film is worth watching for laughs and to complete your d'amato film quest.

purportedly made back to back with 'erotic nights of the living dead' with the same cast and setting but for certain this one does not have laura gemser. much derided by all i rather like this movie. sure enough the storyline and dialogue are codswallop, but this is so beautifully filmed in such a marvellous setting and i actually like the hardcore. i find it at once naturalistic and exotic, and that doesn't just mean there is a black girl and some limp penises! i find the numerous and varied sex scenes very believable, even if two are set upon a tree trunk at the edge of the ocean with the waves constantly splashing around. the creature does not deign to appear until half hour before the end and is, it has to be said, a disappointment. still, in the time remaining he manages to kill off all but two of the expedition and in the case of the girls having sex with them first (or afterwards in at least one case!) and this film is not as slow as some maintain. moreover there are some fine moments of sexploitation, not least the lady scientist and her urge for two 'natives', and the glorious finale when the two survivors speed off in their boat, gaze back at the island they have escaped from, and find there is still time for one last act of copulation.

before i continue forth with the new millennium, i will go back in time once more because i had completely forgotten about these gems!!!!!in 1987, disney, while still a "low" company in the 80s, was able to start a series of films on television called "not quite human," about a geeky teenager who, like in "inspector gadget," looks like a human but is really a robot!!!!! now this screams 80s, along with other films like "tron" and "honey, i shrunk the kids" because it combines everything of yesteryear with the technologies of tomorrow!!!!!my parents remember seeing this on the tv back then, back when i was just born or something. however, my very first encounter with this film was on the old disney channel (one time, i've seen this, and the other parts, on my 12th b'day in may of '99!!!!!)"not quite human" is a very good series of films to watch, if you can ever find these movies again. has this been shown recently? if so, give me an e-mail or personal message.10/10

crossfire remains one of the best hollywood message movies because, unlike the admirably intentioned gentleman's agreement, which it beat to theatres by a few months, it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying "it's because i'm jewish, isn't it?" it's much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical. somewhat shamefully, the brief featurette on the warners' dvd doesn't mention that novelist richard brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti-semitic one, but it's interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is jewish, there's little doubt in sam levene's performance that the character is in fact also gay ¬ñ not a mincing caricature, but there's definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with george cooper's confused soldier. there's not much of a mystery to who the murderer is: even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows, the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable, but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point: the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy.there's an element of ealing films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix (you could almost see that aspect as a blueprint for hue and cry), but the atmosphere is pure rko noir. set over one long sweltering night, the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style (it cut back on lighting time and allowed director edward dmytryk more time to work with the actors) and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script: a laid-back but quietly charismatic robert mitchum, robert young's maigret-like detective, gloria grahame's tramp and the perpetually creepy paul kelly as her compulsive liar admirer, a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties. but the lasting impression is of robert ryan's excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row. a big surprise hit in 1946, as a reward, dmytryk and producer adrian scott found themselves investigated by the huac, which itself had a notable tendency to target jews. so much for crusading¬Ö

"crossfire" feels like an underdeveloped masterpiece -- it's well acted and beautifully filmed, but thinly written and way too short. as is, it's just a decent police procedural with hints of film noir (at its zenith in 1947) and social commentary (also trendy at the time) thrown in for good measure. it's remembered today as one of the first two hollywood films to deal with anti-semitism, and as being much better than the similarly-themed "gentleman's agreement" (no mean feat). but its real subject is the difficulty that wwii soldiers, as trained killers, were having as they made the transition to civilian life. (for a more genteel take on this topic, try "the best years of our lives.") a man is beaten to death in the first few frames of the film. we do not see his attacker. the movie is about the investigation of this murder, which is actually pretty straightforward, but it takes some unnecessary detours, like when the main suspect, a depressed soldier, winds up in the apartment of gloria grahame, a dance-hall hooker with a really weird pimp played by paul kelly. there's also a civics lecture halfway through the movie that slows the proceedings to a crawl, and the ending is tidy enough for a cop show. but otherwise it's a pretty decent mystery. still, what a great noir it could have been. director edward dmytryk drops a few hints at the subject of the original novel -- homosexuality, not anti-semitism -- like when sadistic creep monty seethes at the image of his friend mitch talking with a strange man at a bar. and the cast is excellent. robert ryan makes for a very credible cretin, and even becomes a little sympathetic in his final scenes, not unlike peter lorre as the child murderer in "m." he deserved an oscar but lost to edmund gwenn that year (you can't beat santa claus). robert mitchum is onhand as a soldier friend of the accused killer. was mitchum a great actor or a great star? someone else can figure that out, but his sleepy eyes and bemused half-smile work very well here since they imply that his character knows something everyone else doesn't. (and he does.) and robert young, as the detective assigned to the murder, is surprisingly gritty, discarding his usual avuncular affability even when he has to deliver the civil-rights sermon midway through the picture. there's no question that bogart or tracy would have been brilliant in the role, but neither of them were at rko in 1947 so you'll just have to deal with dr. welby. still, young is good enough to make you wish someone had cast him in a detective drama instead of "father knows best," which he hated and which drove him to alcoholism and suicide attempts. the man deserved better than smarm and sanka.

**** spoilers throughout **** this is a very strange film - particularly for its time - in every respect. for six years, american movies had shown american soldiers as everybody's son, brother, father.in movies like the best years of our lives and til the end of time, our hearts are tugged by the difficulty that the sweet returning soldiers have in adjusting to peace and their families. yet in this same year, this film shows soldiers as a mix of people rather worse than the viewer - one message of this film is - "lock up your daughters." even the good soldiers - with plenty of time on their hands - are gambling all the time, getting stupefyingly drunk, and are wholly indifferent to whether they even have wives any more. and their reaction to the police investigating a murder is -- to conspire against them.mitchum, the most sympathetic soldier says things like "i don't know if my wife wants to make a go of it now after the war. haven't seen her in two years. do i care? not really. maybe we'll make a go of it, maybe not." another soldier is shown as unusually sensitive because after years away, he would like to see his wife again.later, when this soldier states at the police station that he spent the evening at a whore's home - without knowing his wife is sitting just behind him, there seems to be no question whatever that his wife will be fine. indeed, she is - i guess it's "hey, soldiers will be soldiers".the police detective played by robert young who is trying to crack a murder case, states convincingly and with infinite weariness about someone's account of their actions on the night in question, "do i care? no. i don't really care about anything any more. i've done this too long, i guess." a man shows up at the whore's apartment. he says "i'm just a man like you, interested in" the whore. then he says, "no that's a lie, i'm her husband. i'd like to be in the military, i was turned down before." then he says, "no, that's a lie, why would i want to be a soldier?" he goes through another series of lies when the police ask him who he is. to the end of the movie, we haven't a clue who he is or why he is there!he's one of the strangest characters in the history of movies! a man stands with his girlfriend at a bar talking to four soldiers, when a clumsy soldier knocks a drink onto his girlfriend. she leaves to change her dress - and is right back wearing another, no problem. yet the man doesn't leave with his girlfriend - who simply disappears - but instead follows one of the soldiers when he leaves to go to another area of the bar! the man then extrapolates from the minimal information he's learned about the soldier -- to philosophize grandly about the problems of returning soldiers -- and immediately invites the soldier home because he is drunk and feels sick. this is strange stuff.similarly, a dance hall girl is irritated by the sentimental soldier who would like to take her out "for a real dance - and dinner maybe". yet she does dance with him - and immediately gives him the key to her home! were people in the late 1940s always urging soldiers to come to their homes after they just met them? robert ryan kills his host, a stranger, when he's enraged that the jewish host tries to get the steadily drunker ryan out of his home. the reason for the murder? "no jew tells me how to drink". "how to drink?" huh? what does that mean? this movie is always off-kilter, quite deliberately so - the soldiers act consistently with total complete defiance of the law, and all the characters are as cold and tough as any movie i've ever seen.and yet the movie is utterly gripping! you simply have no idea how these people are going to act - or what new bizarre character is going to pop up - without anyone thinking the person's actions are strange in the least - e.g., the wife's behavior.the acting is about the finest i'e ever seen - from robert young, robert ryan, gloria grahame (who earned an oscar nomination), paul kelly and other actors i'd never heard of.i'd never heard of this movie - and it's a complete delight that i've discovered one that i shall want to see again and again and again. it's really strange but impossible to look away from because you've no idea what these creatures will do next.

"crossfire" is remembered not so much for the fact that its three stars all had the first name "robert" but as being one of the first hollywood films to deal with anti-semitism.the story opens with the murder in silhouette of a man whom we later learn is a jewish man named joseph samuels (sam levene). pipe smoking police captain finlay (robert young) is assigned to the case. an ex-soldier, montgomery (robert ryan) comes upon the murder scene and we learn through flashback that he had met samuels in a bar along with other soldiers who were in the process of being mustered out of the service following wwii.according to montgomery, he and pal floyd bowers (steve brodie) had followed samuels and cpl. arthur mitchell (george cooper) to samuels' apartment for drinks. montgomery tells finlay that mitchell left the apartment first and that he and floyd followed soon after with samuels still alive and well.unable to locate mitchell, finlay suspects him of the murder. he enlists sgt. peter keeley (robert mitchum) to help him locate mitchell. mitchell meanwhile has been wondering the streets in a dazed state. he meets prostitute ginny (gloria grahame) in a bar and strikes up a friendship. she gives him a key to her apartment and he goes there to rest. unexpectedly a man (paul kelly) turns up looking for ginny. mitchell, still in a daze, leaves and goes back to meet keeley and his pals. keeley manages to keep him from the police and hides him in an all night movie house.from mitchell's perspective we learn that montgomery hates jews and is probably the killer. finlay begins to focus his investigation on montgomery trying to prove his guilt. he arrangers to have one of the soldiers, a kid named leroy (william phipps) set a trap for mongomery."crossfire" is considered to be one of the best of the "film noire" genre. in fact it garnered several academy award nominations including ryan and grahame for best supporting actors. it was made on a modest budget in about three weeks.it has all of the elements of classic "film noire", the shadows, low key lighting and the story playing out mostly at night. the requisite "femme fatale" of the piece is grahame's ginny who plays a minor role but is nonetheless your classic "femme fatale". the unnamed character played by paul kelly (in an excellent bit) has been chewed up and spit out by ginny and was she about to do the same to mitchell?robert ryan steals the picture as the brutal montgomery although it would type cast him in similar roles for years to come. robert young makes a good low key detective but robert mitchum has little to do other than befriend the mitchell character. others in the cast are jacqueline white as mitchell's wife, lex barker (who would go on the following year to play "tarzan") as one of mitchum's soldier pals and richard powers (who was previously known as tom keene) as finlay's assistant.director edward dmytryk would shortly run afoul of the house un-american committee as having communist affiliations and spend a couple of years in jail.

crossfire (1947)great message, great symbolism, very good movieit's hard to go totally wrong with robert mitchum, robert young, and robert ryan all together as the three male leads, and with director edward dmytryk pulling together a complicated murder and detective yarn. that's reason enough to watch it once and even twice.you might need a second look to fully catch the plot as it is explained (too much) or shown in flashback (also too much) because it's a little complicated without good reason. but it makes sense overall, and we see early on (too early probably) who the culprit is, and even why.besides the drama, well done in typical noir lighting and filled with those short quips that make post-war films dramatic, there is the social message, the anti-anti-semitic point of it all. it only borders on preachy once or twice, and it's such an obviously good point to make we watch it being made approvingly and wait for the plot and the dramatic acting to take front row. which they do, especially young, who is a brilliantly laconic and patient detective, and ryan, who is mean in a believably crude and angry way (ryan is good at that, his typecasting reasonable). mitchum mostly plays a watered down version of what he is famous for, and the fourth known acting force, gloria grahame, is a great, brief, presence even if slightly dispensable.though the movie is dominated by the sequence of events and by the message, both of which grow in force as we go, it is really easy to watch just for the lighting, camera-work, and acting, including the classic fight scene that opens the first few seconds of the film, all done with shadows. the archetypes of soldiers presented is very deliberate, and this might be something people at the time were very familiar with and could relate to as much as the anti-semitism thread. the shell-shocked soldier rendered helpless (but still intrinsically capable), the modest youngster without confidence (but capable, too), and the weary but outwardly able veteran are all there. and of course, the angry, violent soldier who is a product of the war, too. this last is also a responsibility of society--even the army goes all out to make good on the injustices here, not just because they are criminal, but because they stem from the wear and tear of a long awful war.the audience then, more than now, could really get, but it's there to appreciate still.

i haven't read the source, richard brooks' novel "the brick foxhole," which i hope is not as infelicitous as its title, but i understand the original villain was a homophobe not an anti semite. (and to be honest, sam levene is written as a gay guy who picks up a drunken soldier.) but, okay, you have to go with the flow. consider 1947. not even anti-semitism has been treated on screen yet. many of the people responsible for contemporary movies were themselves jews but anti-semitism had been verboten for years because it was considered unpleasant. so we can hardly blame the makers of this film for not leaving the victim a homosexual. now that's really unpleasant -- and besides there might have been many among the audience rooting for robert ryan to get away with it. we are by no means free of prejudice but we've still come a long way since 1947.watching this again for the first time in years i was impressed with the rather slow pace of the first half of the movie, the many shots of two people talking, the shadows, the time that passes between the question and the answer, the uninspired editing. but i could live with that because of the film's subject matter and because of a few other things.one of the things that keep me glued to events as they unfold so deliberately is robert ryan's performance. the guy does a splendid job. at times he can seem thoughtful, cheerfully subordinate and helpful to the police -- "any way i can help, yes sir." then, alone or with another soldier, the simmering hatred rises to the top, not so much through what he says but the way he looks. that scowl, that penetrating stare, those dark eyes glittering. wow.the film has taken a lot of heat because of robert young's preachy speech about his grandfather's murder. that doesn't bother me at all, although i guess dmytryk didn't have to have young shove his face into the camera while talking about "micks and papists". still, taking the context into account, it's one of the more shocking moments of the film. part of its impact is due to young's almost casual delivery of the message, and part of it is due to the message's not having been heard on screen before.another feature of the film that transforms it almost into the surreal is the paul kelly character and his relationship to the whore gloria grahame. holy guacamole, what elliptical conversation kelly is given to. "you know what i told you? all those things i just told you? they're all lies." his character neatly crosses pathos with creepiness. it's impossible to know what to make of him. he adds virtually nothing to the plot but the movie would be a lot less without his presence.it's a moody, murky film. its people live in the dark. and there is murder afoot. practically no one screams or shouts. the horror that these men have experienced and that some of them still carry with them like malaria seems just beneath the surface.see it if you have a chance.

a bigoted soldier kills a man for being jewish and tries to pin it on a fellow soldier. not as good as the novel it was based on ("the brick foxhole") in which it was a gay man who was killed...but hollywood wouldn't touch that in 1947. that said, it's still a very good film. the anti-semitism is handled very well, but it's hammered into the audience that bigotry is bad...well duh! but this was 1947. the picture is well-acted by the entire cast (especially robert young and robert ryan) and the tone is very dark...as it should be. very atmospheric too. a deserved big hit in its day...well worth seeing.

definitely a "must see" for all fans of film noir.thanks to a fine script and crisp, razor sharp direction a top cast comes together and works like a well oiled clock to produce a crackerjack psychological thriller.wonderful characterizations articulate the movie's powerful message of racial and religious tolerance. it's difficult and almost unjust to single out any one particular performance because there isn't a weak link in the entire company but robert ryan as the hateful and violent white supremacist is truly spine chilling.making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage. now,all these years later, at a time when contemporary movies are dominated by a ridiculous over abundance of foul language, bare breasts, crummy acting and deafening soundtracks it's refreshing to get back to the basics of quality film making with a viewing treat like "crossfire".another low budget gem from the hollywood archives .

as a rule, there are few things more dispiriting than hollywood's attempts to be courageous. mixing caution with heavy-handedness, "message movies" pat themselves loudly on the back for daring to tackle major problems. crossfire is not entirely free from this taint; it includes a sermon on the nature of senseless hatred that is embarrassingly obvious, assuming a level of naivity in its audience that's depressing to contemplate. as late as 1947, it was a big deal for a movie to announce that anti-semitism existed, and that it was bad. (it was unthinkable, of course, for hollywood to address the real subject of the book on which the movie was based¬óits victim was a homosexual.) nevertheless, thanks to good writing and excellent acting, crossfire remains a persuasive examination of what we would now call a hate crime.postwar malaise was one of the major components of film noir, and crossfire addresses it directly. the film is set in washington, d.c. among soldiers still in uniform but idle, spending their days playing poker and bar-crawling. joseph samuels (sam levene), an intelligent and kindly jew, explains that the end of the war has created a void: all the energy that went into hating and fighting the enemy is now unfocused and bottled up. samuels meets three soldiers in a bar: the sensitive mitchell, who is close to a nervous breakdown, the weak-willed floyd bowers, and montgomery, a tall, overbearing bully who nastily belittles a young soldier from tennessee as a stupid hillbilly. the three soldiers wind up at samuels' apartment, where the drunken monty becomes increasingly abusive, calling his host "jew-boy." samuels is beaten to death, and mitchell disappears, making himself the prime suspect for the killing.unraveling the crime are detective finlay (robert young), dry and by-the-book, and sergeant keeley (robert mitchum), a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows mitchell is incapable of murder. among the pieces of the puzzle are ginny (gloria grahame), a nightclub hostess who met mitchell and gave him her apartment key, and floyd (steve brodie), who as a witness to the crime holes up terrified in a seedy rooming house. while there is no real "whodunit" suspense, the story remains gripping, and the trap laid for the killer is extremely clever.the strong noir atmosphere saves the movie from feeling didactic or sanctimonious. the cinematography is a striking shadow-play, with inky darks and harsh lights, rooms often lit by a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke. world-weariness is as pervasive as noir lighting. "nothing interests me," finlay says quietly; "to nothing," is ginny's toast in the nightclub. gloria grahame, the paragon of noir femininity, nearly steals the movie with her two scenes. platinum-blonde, jaded and caustic, she's the quintessential b-girl, poisoned by the "stinking gin mill" where she works ("for laughs," she says bitterly), her sweet face curdling when mitchell tells her that she reminds him of his wife. now and then a wistful kindness peeks through her defensive shell, as when she dances with mitchell in a deserted courtyard, then offers to cook him spaghetti at her apartment. when he goes there, he meets a weasely, crumple-faced man (paul kelly) who seems to sponge off ginny, and whose conversation is a dense layering of lies and false confessions. gloria blows mitchell's good-girl wife off the screen in a scene where she's asked to give mitchell an alibi. slim and frail in her bathrobe, with her girlish lisp, she lets us see just how often ginny has been insulted and dismissed as a tramp.robert young is a nondescript actor, and he stands no chance against mitchum's charisma, but he does a good job of keeping his pipe-smoking character, saddled with delivering the movie's earnest message, this side of pompousness. mitchum, meanwhile, gets some cool dialogue, but not nearly enough to do; still, even when he's doing nothing but lounging in a corner you can't take your eyes off him. the third robert, ryan, creates a fully shaded and frighteningly convincing portrait of an ignorant, unstable bigot; we see his phony geniality, his bullying, his resentment of anyone with advantages, his "am i right or am i right?" smugness; how easily he slaps labels on people and what satisfaction he gets from despising them.crossfire's message seems cautious and dated now, though not nearly so much as the same year's a gentleman's agreement. finlay's speech about bigotry cops out by reaching back a hundred years for an instance of white victimhood, reminding us that irish catholics were once persecuted; next it could be people from tennessee, he says, or men who wear striped neckties. or maybe blacks, or japanese, or homosexuals, or communists? the script seems afraid to mention any real contemporary problems. it sweetens its message by making the jewish victim saintly, as though his innocence were not sufficient; and it takes care to exonerate the military, having a superior officer declare that the army is ashamed of men like montgomery, and stressing that samuels served honorably in the war. still, it did take some guts to depict, immediately after world war ii, an american who might have been happier in the nazi army, and the movie's basic premise is still valid. if monty were alive today, he would have gone out on september 12, 2001, and beat up a sikh.

edward dmytryk directed this shadowy movie about a murder investigation involving demobilized military personnel. robert young gets to lecture us about hatred, robert mitchum walks through most of this picture, and gloria grahame revisits the feistiness she exhibited in "it's a wonderful life." it's robert ryan who gets at the heart of the matter: anti-semiticism. he goes so deep into his role as monty montgomery (imagine parents named lawrence calling their son larry!), that the drama sits squarely on his shoulders, and he is more than up to the challenge. without him, the movie would be commonplace. ryan has played a number of memorable villains in his day ("bad day at black rock;" "billy budd"), but this performance put him on the map. with sam levene as the murder victim.

taut and organically gripping, edward dmytryk's crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely "message" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle.bivouacked in washington, dc, a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where robert ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host (sam levene) to death because he happens to be jewish. police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum, who's assigned to ryan's outfit. suspicion falls on the second of the three (george cooper), who has vanished. ryan slays the third buddy (steve brodie) to insure his silence before young closes in.abetted by a superior script by john paxton, dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs. ryan, naturally, does his prototypical angry white male (and to the hilt), while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role, however, is not central); young may never have been better. gloria grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who's leeched into her life, paul kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable.the politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it's pretty much confined to young's reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit). at least there's no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why ryan hates jews (and hillbillies and...).curiously, crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it's based on (richard brooks' the brick foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale. news of the holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of europe, so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer).but while the change from homophobia to anti-semitism works in general, the specifics don't fit so smoothly. the victim's chatting up a lonesome, drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd, even though (or especially since) there's a girlfriend in tow. it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating ryan's murderous rage.

never has the words "hidden gem" been so accurate. bad movie lovers might search all over for the next hidden obscurity, sometimes coming up short with stuff like weasels rip my flesh, but other times, luck will prevail and you might end up with something like death bed, then hopefully realizing it's not a bad movie at all, it just has a bad title, and not even a bad title, but a humorous one that might throw you off, but somehow death bed still fits into the "bad" category. with a vibe that's somber and empty, death bed is a true masterpiece of low-budget horror, reserved only for those fortunate enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of a vision.death bed involves an incoherent, yet intriguing relationship between a demon in the bed and the sympathetic ghost trapped in the portrait, who only wishes he could spare someone from the awful fate of being devoured by the yellow suds. although not all that scary, considering it's about a killer bed, death bed possesses the qualities that make for successful horror. a dark, desolate vibe, confusion, an eerie, subtle score and that dream quality that this masterpiece almost flaunts. such a quality, or vibe usually seems unintentional. not only is it intentional, but from what i've read, death bed is based on an actual dream, george barry, the director, successfully transferred dream to film, only a genius could accomplish such a task.old mansions make for good quality horror, as do portraits, not sure what to make of the killer bed with its killer yellow liquid, quite a bizarre dream, indeed. also, this isn't quite the brand of b-horror i was expecting, considering the title and all. before viewing this gothic gem i expected something more like class reunion massacre, now thats a bad movie, if you've seen it, you know what i'm saying. after considering all of the above, i feel like death bed deserves only eight stars, but since it stayed so obscure for so long we'll say the bed that eats deserves nine.

george barry's "death bed: the bed that eats" is, at root, a dark fairy tale told via a horror-movie framework. it is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 1970s, and it's downright criminal that the picture was basically stolen and distributed without barry's knowledge (those responsible for this theft should be fed to the bed, asap). if you're looking for overt gore or rabid action, "death bed: the bed that eats" isn't the flick for you. "death bed" is a gentler, weirder drive-in picture; it plays like an utterly strange dream, half-remembered. i'd recommend reading stephen thrower's summation of "death bed" in thrower's fab press book, "nightmare usa" (he describes the movie's vibe perfectly). whether intentional or not, i've noticed shades of "death bed" in everything from the "phantasm" films to michele soavi's "cemetery man" to the magic-realism/slipstream fiction of authors such as kelly link. barry is an original and in a fair world i'm sure he would've followed "death bed" with a number of fantastically bizarre films.

watching "death bed: the bed that eats" is like waking up in the hospital, two days into a suicidewatch, disorienting but oddly stimulating. there are few cinematic equivalents to this disturbing yet often humorous lesson in mythology, morality and surrealist ideology.cocteau's "blood of a poet" and maya deren'sexperimental works evoke a taste of the strange atmosphere found in death bed. a close comparison are the dark adult fairy-tales by literary genius- author angela carter, the short disturbing stories of unicazurn or e.t.a. hoffman. death bed has many recognizable elements of thepast, but displays a wholly unique and original storyline.as a story, death bed is an amazingly simple yet originalvision, something which only one-in-a-thousand independent releases will manage to accomplish. this unassuming film has its technical flaws but overcomes them all with a cast of beautiful non-actorsand lost creepy locations- a true 1970s independent classic. death bed also displays a unique, subversive, 3-dimensional personality-- a deep and continuous layering of dream images and ideas that lend it a "fun-house" type of construct. the passage of time told in flashbacks and historic time travelogues, the bed with its sinister black humor, the rich yet understated symbolism used within its imagery. most pleasing is the image of aubrey beardsly, the suffering artist, forever trapped inside the frame of his own painting as he comments on and fondles with the murdered victim "offerings" gifted to him as love offerings by the demented bed's spirit. -- a sick refrain and wonderful element /metaphor for the "trapped artist" -- nothing but the weirdest in poe or mallarme can equal that. anyone who values the spirit of independent cinema and craves the multi-layered symbolist experience, or craves the surrealist concept of "convulsivebeauty" and the gothic-horror leanings of low budget exploitation film-making will dig this totally unique vision. a simple and fun film with deliciously deep psychic undercurrents. highly recommended. *****

i can honestly say that "death bed: the bed that eats" was a much better movie than i expected. allow me to clarify the plot in case the title of the film is a little too vague - there is a bed that eats. an evil bed. it eats people. several unsuspecting women on an "outing" of some kind, stumble across the sinister "sack" and ultimately fall prey to it's hunger. the bed's devouring process consists of a yellow foam soaking people into it's inner... stomach acid; all complete with chewing sounds. this is a very strange cult flick and the only film from george barry who had forgotten he made it until word-of-mouth of it's newfound cult status got back to him and he decided to release it on dvd. not a bad movie at all, if you can look past the lousy acting and enjoy the hokey effects - the most laughable being the guy whose hands are eaten off and he is left with only plastic looking skeletal fingers... pretty dreamlike tone to it, too, coming across as very surreal and aberrant - mainly the whole thing involving the artist behind the painting and the demonic back story of the bed. if you like bizarre no-budget, oddball flicks than definitely seek out "death bed".

a large bed possessed by a demon eats people, among other things. i'm not making this up.completed in 1977 and not officially released until it came to dvd in 2003, "death bed: the bed that eats" is a movie whose plot is impossible to describe. you most likely know of it thanks to patton oswalt's excellent bit about it, as well as stephen throwers essential book "nightmare usa." while watching it, you wonder the following-who is george berry, and what drugs did he smoke/inject/snort before writing and directing this movie?-is this a horror comedy? a combination of a horror flick and an art movie? a weird prank being pulled on the audience?-what the hell am i watching?"death bed" really defies any explanation. i know, that term is overused, but it couldn't be truer than it is here. this truly beggars description. it is a horror comedy, as well as art film/horror hybrid. but the whole thing is so surreal, it must be seen. the score sounds like the electronic bits from an old candlemass album, the acting is terrible and disconnected from everything, the direction is surprisingly competent, and the movie at times feels like a jesus franco movie-that is, if his movies were intentionally funny.in the end, there really is no proper way to describe this movie. lord knows i've tried, but really, few movies are as odd, unique, or mind boggling as this is. see it...but you've been warned. this is also the only movie george berry has ever done. he definitely left his mark on the exploitation genre with this, i'll tell you that much.

this is seriously one of the best low budget, b movies that i have ever seen. i am not one to stand up and cheer during a movie, but this one was definitely worth it. obviously the premise is that there is a bed that eats people, well...eats is a subjective term i guess, it really secretes acid bubbles to suck the victims into itself and dissolves them in it's acidy goodness. the best part of this movie is that william russ is one of the main characters. the typical family man actually started his career with this movie...and an afro. there is plenty of nudity in this flick, so obviously not for the children, but that should not deter anyone from seeing this movie. it is my belief that everyone needs a little death bed in their lives at some point or other, it's best to get it sooner than later.

as roger corman has said in an interview, low-budget film-making enables film-makers to take chances on offbeat ideas. well, you'd be hard pressed to find a film that thrives on the offbeat as mightily as george barry's "death bed: the bed that eats".the film does have a back story to it, and it's an interesting one at that. i'll forgo relaying any sort of details so you can hear them for yourself if you take a chance on watching it. suffice it to say, the title item of furniture has an insatiable hunger, consuming the unwary with a bubbling yellow foam that dissolves its victims like acid."death bed" is an eerie, haunting little flick that plays out its absurd premise in such a way that it transcends the usual assortment of schlock fare. it occupies its particular dream world in such a way that it was possible for me to take it seriously. it's a truly strange and unconventional horror flick. it dabbles in exploitative ingredients - there's some tasty dollops of female nudity - and yet is also art, albeit art with a completely skewed sensibility.the special effects are not too bad for a film with a microscopic budget, and barry gives the film a good and atmospheric "midnight movie" quality. the acting from the cast is as uninspired as one could imagine, although patrick spence-thomas lends a reasonable amount of gravitas as the artist / narrator, and one definite point of interest is seeing one familiar face on hand: future 'boy meets world' father william russ!this film might not have even found the small cult following that it does have were it not for pirated copies making the rounds; this certainly has to rank as one of the instances where such a practice ultimately ended up helping the film - even if the exposure took years to take hold.if you have a taste for truly bizarre obscure items, "death bed" may be just what you've got in mind.7/10

death bed: the bed that eats.judging from the title, you can guess what this movie is about. and yet there is a lot more (background) story to this film then one might suspect.okay, so the main plot is about a bed eating people and food, but there are also a few subplots. i won't spoil them for you, but they're a nice touch.sadly, the acting in this movie is very mediocre. the fact that most dialog is not even spoken by the actors doesn't really help to improve the quality of the movie as a whole.because there is a lot of voice-over work. the thoughts of characters are also revealed to the watchers. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.the effects are fine. sure, it could be a lot better if you compare it with today's movies. but you really shouldn't; just judge the movie as it is and don't take it too seriously. you have to admit that a killer bed is quite creative. if you are easily spooked, don't watch this movie. you might never want to sleep again...death bed: the bed that eats is a strange horror gem with a low budget, but i'd still recommend it to fans of horror movies.in conclusion, i give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars for it's creative story and unexpected twists here and there.

i watch a lot of movies. a lot of movies. getting a graduate degree in film forces one to watch 2-3 flicks a day for years. it all gets very exhausting. mostly because i feel i have seen it all. so rare is it when i get surprised by something, mostly i hope to see something as good as i expect it to be.death bed is so unlike anything i have ever experienced i actually had to stop the dvd in order to rant about its genius.the rhythm of the piece is psychotic. it's structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay outside of the frame. it's not like something like halloween with all its snappy editing and pov shots; death bed actually comes across as kind of dreamy. the most pretentious way i can phrase it is: this is samuel beckett making a haunted house movie. i mean it's a manic depressive bed that eats people! and fried chicken! out in the middle of nowhere! and there's bone hands! i can barely articulate my feelings about this film. and yeah, copping to liking this will open you up to ridicule. but things get real same-y after awhile. its hard to be a cinephile and consistently stay engaged. i can honestly say this is a fully unique film up and down. from what it is to how its put together. we need films like that, movies that shake us out of our complacency. consider it like existential camp. it's fun and it's stupid, but also brilliant in its weird little way. the worst horror villain of all time? maybe, but at least it isn't a guy in a mask.

i do love b- horror films. i however, am generally not a huge fan of "so stupid it's funny" films. i had to rate this so highly simply because death bed: the bed that eats, is so one of a kind, and so original. there are plenty of question marks, plenty of plot holes, and the wtf factor is cranked up to 11, but i was really not bored for a second. i really couldn't call it creepy at any point, every minute i was saying to myself "what the hell is this bed/film going to do next!" i watched this with a friend that is in no way a fan of horror or b- movies, and even she was pretty into it. the effects were actually very inventive and the colors, and atmosphere were quite good. it keeps a very consistent and even tone throughout most of the film, (albeit an incredibly ludicrous consistency) and the acting wasn't terrible. i can see from the point that there are certain inconsistencies in the actions of the bed that make the suspension of belief damn near impossible, but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept, that that fact didn't really bother me. seriously, for me, this film hit that realm of one i will not only never forget, but i guarantee i will find myself thinking back on certain scenes in the future. does anyone else know of any other films in the inanimate objects that eat people genre? totally fantastic.

this film plunges headlong into the realm of the surreal √† la lynch and jodorowsky--with an atmosphere that is strangely compelling, lulling the viewer with the dream-like intensity of its images.the narration is to be savoured--the narrator being trapped behind a painting (adjacent to the bed), who often speaks for it, vocalizing its desires and reasoning. yes, beardsley would sound like that.there are some flaws, but its strengths overwhelm its weaknesses. the sequence with the woman wrenching herself out of the bed and crawling across the floor, trying to escape, will leave you breathless. the film possesses a fin-de-siecle air about it; and should be read as a disarming cry from the bowels of the 20th century.find this film and bathe in it.

"death bed:the bed that eats" is a supremely bizarre horror film that truly has to be seen to be believed.there is an ancient four-poster bed that just loves to eat humans and it does so anytime it can lure anyone to lie upon it.there is also a long-dead artist,imprisoned behind one of his paintings,who provides a voice-over narration.george barry's the first and only one film offers some truly surreal moments such as the bed absorbing its victims in a mysterious sea of yellow foam and liquid.the atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a little bit of gore,unfortunately the premise is rather silly and the acting is amateurish.still as fan of unusual cinema i enjoyed this low-budget oddity.give it a chance.8 out of 10.

george barry is a genius. "death bed: the bed that eats" is a prototype for much of the 'slipstream' fiction and camp surrealism that is so chic now. truly innovative, maverick, and just effing brilliant. hyper-strange acting, subtly nightmarish atmosphere. i recommend reading stephen thrower's book "nightmare usa" (there is a chapter devoted to barry and "death bed: the bed that eats"). available from fab press. on a related note, "death bed: the bed that eats" and "beyond dream's door" make a perfect double-bill. furthermore, it's trite and tired - and ultimately stupidly ironic - to criticize a low-budget cult film for being 'poorly made' or 'technically inept.' the b-movie aesthetic is part of these films' charm. no amount of cgi could duplicate the cumulative effect "death bed: the bed that eats" has on the viewer with an advanced palate.

a demon, from a tree, removes itself in the form of a human man to make love to a young fair maiden only for her to die. the demon's eyes freeze, two drops of blood fall onto a bed he had specially created for his object of desire. the bed consumes the blood and it's hunger remains..anything that comes in contact with the bed is consumed! this is explained to us by one of the bed's victims, a painter whose soul is trapped "inside" one of his last works, the artistic rendering of the his final resting place(..he was dying of consumption, coughing up blood, deciding to die on the death bed). you see the painter, who we are able to see as if he were trapped in a small room looking through his painting, unfortunately a spectator to the bed's meals. the bed has a dark sense of humor, and we see this through it's allowing the painter to live, even giving him jewelry and other possessions once owned by eaten victims. one victim's skull grows bright red flowers not far from the basement housing the bed. the film features three young women who come across the mansion which holds the basement containing the death bed. the painter(dave marsh)might just have a method to destroying the death bed but it will include a human sacrifice in order to resurrect the body of the one whose death caused it's hunger in the first place. patrick spence-thomas provides the soft, depressing voice of the trapped painter, narrating the film, lamenting about his current situation, telling us about past victims, and often scolding the bed of it's predatory nature.a definitive, genuine cult film..i expect it's status to soar now that death bed:the bed that eats has found it's way to an audience(..such as myself)who appreciates the bizarre and grotesque. the bed itself contains a liquid type of acid with an apple-cider hue where we see the objects and humans(..struggling for naught) consumed. many might recognize a young william russ(boy meets world, the unholy)in curls, seeking after his runaway sister, finding her in the basement, zombie-like and traumatized(..of course, julie ritter pretty much was this way the whole film, in a trance, barely uttering a word)with them both trapped. in one of the film's most demented scenes, russ attempts to stab the bed only for his hands to get caught in it's grip, the flesh acidified with only skeletal bones remaining, the cartilage deteriorating. there's one lengthly attempted escape by a victim whose legs were caught in the bed, almost out of the basement when it's sheets snatched her back into it's belly where she belonged. the film feels almost completely surreal as if we were watching a macabre nightmare unfold. director george barry often features gags regarding the victims who find themselves in the most unfortunate position choosing the death bed as their place of refuge..the painter gives us a recollection of all the various people who were eaten. there's really nothing like this movie anywhere, it's definitely one of a kind.

hmmmm. i'm kinda at a loss here. i mean, i know i liked death bed, i know i'll be spreading the gospel of death bed to all my friends and acquaintances, and if you're reading this, i urge you to see death bed, but i can't really say why. perhaps that's the secret of its charm.plot? well, sort of. there's this bed that eats people (and fried chicken, apples, flowers, suitcases, and any other darn thing that gets near it) by sucking them inside its digestive-fluid filled mattress. amongst its near-limitless powers, bed has the ability to keep the spirit of aubrey beardsley trapped behind a picture to observe and narrate the events of the film. various people then wind up at bed's abandoned mansion (bed's habit of eating anything that moves gave the place an unsavory reputation), and lay down to have sex, or take a nap, or because they don't feel well, and get eaten, sometimes having trippy dreams first. and in the end we have the explosive final confrontation between beardsley, bed's mom (you had to be there), and bed.seems rather straightforward, when i put it like that, doesn't it - well, except for the aubrey beardsley part. but something feels constantly off-kilter, and the story seems to glide sleepily from one scene to the next, even when indulging in cheap laughs or strange gore effects. imagine bunel crossed with bergman, then left to soak in a big vat of herschell gordon lewis. the tone of the story shifts from horror, to fairy tale, to comedy, to existential meditation, without breaking stride - an incredible achievement for a no-budget student film shot in the detroit area.all in all, an astounding little film that, quite probably, no review can ever completely do justice. see it for yourself.

ok, it's easy not to confuse this with the lame stuart gordon movie called "death bed" that came out a few years back, because this one is "the bed that eats". and how do i even begin to describe this? well, for starters, obviously there is a bed that eats. this is as a result of demon teardrops, which of course affect most things, i guess, in a negative way. the bed is in some old servant's quarters or something, and has been responsible for the disappearances of quite a few people in its time. we have a narrator, who is a ghost that sits in the wall behind a painting, and collects all the non-edible goodies (jewelry, etc) that the bed passes on. he died of consumption, one of the few people to lay in the bed that didn't get eaten, probably because he was sick, he theorizes, as we see him hacking blood into hankies.....bleah. the thing about this movie is that is has a very odd sense of humor to it but it's all played pretty deadpan. the movie is divided into several "acts", i guess, "breakfast, lunch, dinner, & just desserts". for fans of the unfathomably weird and bizarre, well, this may just be right up your alley. all i can say is you have to see this one to believe it, it pretty well defies description. 8 out of 10 stars.

i'm not sure what i can add that hasn't already been said in some of these other fine, and quite hilarious, comments, but ill try.so you know the plot: there is a bed possessed by a demon that "absorbs" and selectively disintegrates the bodies of whoever (or whatever) lays on it with its orange soda-filled body. we have the man, in some scenes looking uncannily like robert smith of the cure, hanging out inside the wall commenting on the goings-on, and we have our various victims that just cant resist the comfort of this mystical bed.this is no ordinary bed. no sirree bob! not only does it eat people, but it cleans up after itself, draws the covers back, and it even makes itself. who wouldn't want a bed like that? it can even use its sheets as a rudimentary "lasso" to wrangle escaped victims back in (especially if they're taking up half the length of the film to try and escape).our "main" story (if you can call it that), is about these three girls who go out to this remote area to house-sit(??). i don't recall exactly, but it doesn't really matter though as there are plenty of things that defy convention that you just have to give in and accept. the dialogue in the film is like no other; the characters talk to each other seemingly by telepathy as their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo. one of our girls believes she isn't liked by the rest of "the gang" and makes sure to tell us all her feelings on this matter through an echoey voice-over, but we don't care; character development was thrown out the window a long time before in this film so why start now? there are scenes when the bed laughs, snores, crunches, and makes various other noises that we assume judging by our cast's non-reaction to said noises, cant be heard. this and the telepathy makes the issue of diegesis very difficult to ascertain...but thats ok....this is death bed: the bed that eats and it defies all logic so its ok. it makes for a lush dreamy quality to this most bizarre film if you buy (hehe buy...did i say "buy"?) this dvd, make sure to check out the introduction by the director. he explains that the filming of this "flick" started in 1972, didn't wrap up until 1977, he shopped it for a few years with no luck, and then fast forward 26 years to 2003 it gets released on dvd. supposedly someone somewhere had a print of this in some other country and made bootleg after bootleg of it and it was quite by chance, on a message board no less, that our director found evidence that people knew, and gasp! cared, about his little-known film. its from there that he decided to give it a shot and release it. i'm glad he did. once you've even so much as heard the title to this film, you must see it. i for one am going to buy this and i'm going to preach its gospel around the world...starting with this comment

it's really rather simple. the name of the movie is death bed, the bed that eats. if you are anything like me, you already know if you are going to like this movie. i stumbled across this gem at best buy the other day and picked it up for ten bucks. i got ten bucks worth of enjoyment out of the title, and the box alone.i'm a huge fan of b movies. this is in my opinion one of the greatest b movies i've ever seen. now, it's not for every one.granted, it's not even for most people. as a matter of fact, i suspect their are only going to be a handful of us who truly enjoy this movie.for those of you who like b movies though, this film is a diamond in the rough. it has a great premise, a bed... that eat's people. it doesn't walk, it doesn't move, it doesn't have a siren call to attract people. it pretty much relies on people wandering by and sitting on it.i loved every inch of this movie and have already seen it three times in the scant weeks i've owned it.like i said, after reading the title of the film, you already know if you'll like it. if you laughed or smiled, then give it a go. it's worth it.

everything about this movie is perfect. the set design, the acting, the camera movement, the mood, the colors - everything. you'll be hard pressed to find a better movie. easily, the best film generated in the last 35 years. keep an eye on michael almereydas!!

from the opening drum hit of "we're gonna groove" to the last guitar hit of "whole lotta love", this two-dvd set might be one of the best music dvd's ever to hit the shelves since the beatles anthology was finally released earlier this year.one of the best things about this dvd is that on disc 1, a whole concert and many television appearances can be found. for instance, the whole royal albert hall concert is on the dvd, as well as some of the best performances from the band's last concert at knebworth.in the royal albert hall concert, for instance, the band had a lot of room to improvise. jimmy page's guitar solos make "dazed and confused" a huge rock power ballad as opposed to the laid-back blues song it was on led zeppelin i. next, on dvd 2, is a promotional video for the led zeppelin iii hit song "immigrant song". one of zeppelin's hardest rocking songs, the video is about as sketchy as a pre-mtv video was, but it displays a lot of guitar power by jimmy page, as it was taken from a live performance. after the video ends, we are treated, in transition, with a short picture of fans filling the seats at madison square garden. the following are performances that were supposed to be part of "the song remains the same", but did not make the cut. excellent riffs like those in the songs "black dog" and "the ocean" were both present.after the madison performances, we are treated with earl's court. most of the led zeppelin iv material was played here, like the most popular song that zeppelin ever recorded, "stairway to heaven". it is brilliant as always, even more so than the version on iv.finally, to end the 5+ hours of live material, is led zeppelin's final concert in knebworth in august of 1979. as the viewer watches this, they have to admit that robert plant's voice is getting throatier and deeper from all of the screaming he has done in the past, and it is evident here. on songs like "kashmir" and "in the evening", plant does not have his vocal boost of old, yet, on "whole lotta love", it returns for one more song.overall, one of the best musical dvd's ever released, only next to the great "beatles anthology" boxed set that was released earlier in 2003. the sound, both in 5.1 dts and 5.1 dolby digital, just like the beatles dvd, gives you a feeling of being on-stage with the performers, standing right next to them, as you would feel on the beatles dvd when they are jamming in the studio. even though the beatles and led zeppelin are different bands, though, they each received different dvd's. even though this set comes on only two discs compared to the five disc beatles set, it still feels very filling to the viewer after they have gone through all of that content. it is also a pleasure to watch again and again, not only because of the sound quality, but because of the sheer energy on stage when robert plant begins to sing.a brilliant effort from atlantic.

buy this if you like rock, led zep or just want an amazing experience. world class! i love this band, and the dvd was even better than i had hoped for, believe me, if you took the time to read this thread, you need this dvd. period.

after seeing this dvd, i was floored. it is so wonderful. not only does it capture led zeppelin during convented performances, they span a few years. this only shows the growth of the band, and the growth of their great music. this dvd is a must have! the dvd is over 5 hours long, with extras. the extras are also great pieces, some are of the band performing in denmark, and other various promo spots. this contains footage that was once thought lost, thankfully recovered, and carefully restored to 5.1 dolby digital, under direct supervision of jimmy page himself! includes many timeless classics, such as, stairway to heaven, going to california, what is and what should never be, moby dick, and so many more. great acoustic songs are also included. this will correct any forethought that jimmy page isn't a supreme guitar legend!

i am a professional musician who was inspired nearly 20 years ago to begin playing guitar after hearing jimmy page on led zeppelin ii. while i don't play in the same genre or style, the impact of that man has been huge. now, nearly 20 years later i finally got to see something more than the not-so-good the song remains the same. again, i have seen so many bands perform, some small - some the current 'masters.' no band, no where, no way has ever been able to pull off the magic that you can actually taste by watching this dvd. robert plant can be a bit much at times, and you can nearly sense page's annoyance for him forgetting lyrics, but that didn't matter i guess - especially for the era. bonham's genius shines more on this dvd then on any album with zeppelin, the band of joy or lord sutch. jpj is pretty ordinary - but the magic of this dvd is how well the four of them perform together. the world loved to imagine that they were into black magic(k) etc. - that was only a matter of interest to page. the magic (notice i say this a lot), is that this dvd captures a rare glance to the rawness of 4 young boys who can play brilliantly, no matter how sloppy they are actually playing. it didn't matter. a quick breakdown. the first of the two dvd's is where the true magic is. you should be able to sense the power and rawness zep had in their early days. by the end of the second dvd page is struggling with his sanity during the knebworth songs. (it's no secret that by this time he was severely addicted to heroin). so, i'd recommend the first disk to any music lover, and the second for the only true zeppelin fan.i may be going too far here for some guitarists, but i would say after watching this, page is certainly more creative and inventive than hendrix. yup, i said it. and if you disagree - watch the dvd.

what can i say about this band, i was hooked in 68, i was a ten year old kid, i grew up on the blues though my dad, then these guys from the midlands came along, a fusion of country rock, heavy rock and blues, i wish i could have got to see them live in the early years, i was lucky enough to be there in 79(knebworth) that was the best concert i've seen to date, i hope a full version of that hot august night will be realest soon. this cd gave me a chance to see the boys over and over again, the song remains the same is great but this cd gets down to the nitty gritty.long live the zepp.

this two disc set is incredible! if you're like me and never had the opportunity to actually see the band live, then this is the next best thing. jimmy page, who in my opinion is the second best guitarist ever to walk the face of the earth (second only to slowfingers himself), he puts on an amazing show in every piece of footage in this film. john paul jones, although not as up front as page, puts on one hell of a show. although in the live atmosphere, his rythmic bass lines aren't as defined as they are on studio recordings, except of course in songs like dazed and confused, or what is and what should never be), but his wide array of instumental talent is well displayed in these dvd's. john bonham is john bonham, what can i say? there is no comparison, his beats stand out like no other, and this dvd is proof. last, but not least, robert plant wails like no other can wail. if you've ever read hammer of the gods, you'll be wondering the same thing as page was when he first met robert plant, why the hell isn't this guy already famous? and so concludes my review, sorry about and spelling or grammar mistakes, zeppelin rocks.

the only footage of zeppelin i've seen prior to this dvd is 'the song remains the same' movie from 1976. we used to spend hours round a friends house watching this, but i never really liked it and hated the fantasy sequences....so what of this dvd? i didn't know it existed until browsing for the physical graffiti cd.....'when did this come out?' i thoughtfor some reason i thought that page wasn't a great live guitarist, but to say that watching this dvd has changed my opinion is a massive understatement. there's 'white summer' from 1970 - 10 minutes of guitar wizardry.there's an acoustic set from 1975 - 'bron-y-aur stomp' has a brilliant finger-picking improv section.the 'in my time of dying' and 'trampled underfoot' performances (also from '75) are breathtaking - with page and bonham tearing things to pieces like no one else ever has. demonic possessions of rawk!!the magic continues into the knebworth 1979 section. the rendition of 'achillies last stand', considering their various drug-addled states just beggars belief! a song of complex guitar overdubs, page arranged it in a way that lets him just 'punk it out' live - the effect is totally mesmerising. 'in the evening' - i never liked this on disc but it zings along here. 'sick again' - great piece of sleaze-rock. the footage from knebworth is very interesting, cutting between big screen, various rostrums and bootleg footage to great effect.plant is amazing throughout all the performances. page, despite being painfully thin, looks like a six-year old kid having the most fun of his life at the knebworth concert - and makes infectious viewing.one thing that puzzled me - the 'black dog' performance from 1973 sounds very 'camped up'!! robert plant always did love a little 'mince' and those jeans are absolutely ridiculous - and would warrant an arrest nowadays. all very different from the muscle-bound kick-a$$$ studio version.i love this dvd. it has reminded me how good zeppelin were and remain.

zeppelin is my favorite band, so when i heard that this double dvd was coming out, i was understandably excited. i'll just cut to the chase here, and say that if you are any kind of zeppelin fan, you must run out and buy this right away! it's absolutely spectacular! it blows 'the song remains the same' completely out of the water. why this material was never released before is beyond me. the footage presented here really shows zep at the peak of their game, which i never really felt that 'song' quite did. jimmy page is the best ever without a doubt, and these performances make jimi hendrix look like a chump! be on the lookout for the live jam 'white summer'... whew!viva jimmy page!viva led zeppelin!11 out of 10

just another showcase of led zeppelin at their finest and their absolute rocking best . every band member is at their best jimmy page and his bow and guitar jpj with his thunderous bass bozo pounding away and robert singing like theirs no tomorrow . i have to say when we get into the first song where gonna groove it is the beginning of something very special . this dvd follows zeppelin through their 11 year carree starting in 69 in the royal albert hall then madison square garden 73 followed by a much older and mature band in 75 at earls court and finally a different looking band at their last english show at knebworth in 79. this dvd is fantastic showcase of zeppelin and if your not a fan you will be after . n

i bought my first zep album in 1974 (at 17) and have been hooked ever since. this dvd has now taken pride of place in my music collection. it is not often that a band can boast 4 virtuosos in their lineup but here we can. each member made their own contribution to the band but on the stage together, the electricity they generated was bigger than the 4 individuals. this masterpiece covers the band's entire career from led zep 1 to coda and this is captured magnificently on this dvd as each concert shows how the band became bigger and bigger over the years. recently my copy disappeared, but i'm happy to say was found in my 17yo son's room as the new generation discover just how great these guys were. this is a must have for anyone who has an appreciation of rock music. long live led zeppelin.

i have seen films come and go in my years,and when i see a disaster film i keep hoping i wont be disappointed.and with this one i was not in the least.the story of a whole country sinking into the ocean was a great concept written by sakyo komatsu,a novelist with intense theories on where this earth is going.the characters were top notch,and even though i am not japanese,i didn't need a translator to give the idea of how people in their most desperate needs can come together for the common good.the special effects blew me away,i was literally on the edge of my seat watching the tidal waves lava flows and land explosions that must have taken months of work to perfect.as for the acting i thought yes,this is acting at its best,emotions run rampant throughout the film and i cried at the most severe scenes.for movie goers alike,you don't need to speak or understand japanese to watch this film,you can get the idea and feeling from each person and character to understand it well and to follow it along like you are there.my hats off to shinji higuchi for directing it,i hope he can outdo his work with another mind blowing experience.as i said,....fantastic film.

it's the best movie i've watched this year! excellent detail and storyline (for a remake).it presents to you a "what if" situation wherein the island of japan could totally be wiped out of this earth. a thought-provoking, life and death situation and not to mention all life on earth (well in this particular japan). it also presents a great and genius solution to this massive tragedy.horror, action, suspense, sci fi, documentary, love story and all the human interest story you can get you'll find everything here! but i also warn you that it is a real tearjerker! the casts, actors and all are all excellent, better than any hollywood movie! the thing is...this could really happen to anywhere on earth! now let me ask you this after you've seen it..."what would you do if you are faced in this life and death situation"?

i've never watched a file in a language i don't understand just because i wanted to see the movie and i couldn't find it with english subs. i don't know how much i missed but it wasn't much. probably just specific details which sounds silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact together. i want to mention to the diceman from germany there's no reason to feel that he 'sucks' when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. like i said, i don't understand japanese -or at least only the very small amount i came away with from reading the very lengthy novel -pro- bably my favorite all time book which i could not put down & took the next day off from work just to finish reading! i don't know if there's an english dubbed or subbed version but if the film but if there is i'd love to see it. the film was incredible in japanese anything better is icing of the cake!! slainte', maegi

i don't know what dick steel was talking about, but i found this film to be one of japan's most thrilling epics to date. as for armageddon or deep impact, or for that matter the day after tomorrow is pale in comparison. for what i know of films, most of the catastrophes in films are basically run of the mill asteroid flicks or one of which of global warming. this how ever ran a different course. a course of natural means where the earth's crust is beginning to erode to such a degree, that it will take another piece of land with it for the ride. what the scientific teams had to do was create a way to stop the erosion from going to far and sinking japan altogether. in most cases this would simply be called tectonic shifting on steroids. i found the characters rather appealing in every way, from the child who lost her mother only to face her own demise among unfamiliar friends. or the rescue girl who does all the she can to save lives in the face of disaster. or a man who thought he could change her mind not to be such a dare devil and go with him to safety, only to become the hero himself and save his homeland. and let's not forget, how the rest of the world just shucked them all back only to be forgotten, by having the world turning their backs on the japanese citizens who cried for help. this was a great movie in all aspects. what dick is trying to say is that this movie was not hollywood made, that it was made in japan, that it had characters which rival other actors around the world, that the effects are very gorgeous as he mentioned but it's all he was waiting for, and nothing else. he lacks the vision of what's important to everyone, and why this film had every element of feeling, of grandeur, and of humanity. i thought this film was top rate, and i have seen many disaster films to know that japan sinks was possibly one of the most original and well thought out projects i have witnessed. i really hope shinji higuchi will make another of such films. oh and by the way, i am not japanese, though in many ways i wish i was. i am canadian, born and raised. and an avid movie buff in all aspects. predjudicial visions are bitter and not worth the effort to be recognized as an opinion. dick you should watch it with a more open heart and mind, don't just look for the eye candy which makes a films content, look for what's more important, and understand it. they may not be american, but the japanese have cornered the market lately for some of the most breath taking and down right gritty film making to date. which is why spending 25,000,000 is just what the doctor ordered. you heard right, 25,000,000 to make this film. now you tell me, was it worth it? or was it worth it because american actors weren't in it?

as spectacle, it's hard to fault nihon chinbotsu. the japanese people have benefited from their intimate relationship with the sea, and the concept of the film implies that an entire world and way of life at risk - thanks to its volcanic heritage. from the standpoint of reality it's rather silly to have a drama wherein the entirety of japan vanishes under the waves; why just japan? so, presume instead that we have movie reality, fueled by spectacle (and popcorn), and some may find this quite affecting. compared to adventures with japanese radioactive monsters, this comes off as more mature and better paced. the emotional element is underplayed, and it really works. (it loses a bit with the overblown theme song at the climax, however.)is nihon chinbotsu credible? probably not, but the thrilling eruptions, and the relaxed pacing make for a more pleasing entertainment that one night expect.

i actually caught an ad for japan sinks in a japanese magazine last year, and wondered what the heck it was until i saw the trailer for the film. it was then i remembered that i had seen the english translation of sakyo komatsu's novel some years back. i got it, and it was quite good, as well as chillingly realistic. it's enough to make the reader dread hearing any news about earthquakes in japan.now, i've read the book, and seen this 2006 movie version (the first movie came out in 1973). and you know what? i thought the movie was quite good, even if there are major changes from novel to film (but that's understandable). the story is simple--a major tectonic shift will cause japan to sink within a year. massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis rock the country as frantic efforts are made to evacuate as many people as possible. one scientist has a plan that could stop the sinking of the country and save what's left of the landmass, but can it be implemented in time? i saw japan sinks at otakon 2007, and while there were a couple of problems i had with it--it does run a bit too long, and a couple of the character moments were a little too sappy--i was nonetheless blown away. the sheer concept of an entire nation sinking into the sea was made terrifyingly real, and the effects were some of the best i've ever seen, rivaling anything that hollywood has done. the film also plays no favorites with the main characters, with some not making it to the closing credits.frankly, i've been surprised by some of the negative comments made about this film. difference of opinions, i guess. personally, i enjoyed it. and i've read the original book.

another "end of the world" film that begs comparison to the abysmal "day after tomorrow". following the same sort of structure as dat but with a distinctly japanese style. how does it fare? that depends on your taste for japanese melodrama. i found that the small human touches to be what makes this film compelling for most of it's 2 + hours. also the frequent title cards explaining some of the science. the effects are probably the best i've seen in a japanese film and they compare very well to anything out of hollywood. many of the disaster scenes are truly horrifying even though the human carnage is usually off screen. and that is one of the drawbacks. while the terror of thousands of on- screen deaths like in the recent "war of the worlds might have too overwhelming, we also don't really get a sense of the chaos of an entire nation crumbling into the ocean. a few scenes touch on the chaos but for the most part this part of the story is barely touched on. regardless, this film works on a lot of levels and is way more realistic then dat, that is until the end.unfortunately the story hinges itself on one clich√©d plot device and another plot device that would be at home in the 1960's japanese earth in peril film "gorath". after the reasonably good science and mostly realistic take on the disaster, this makes for a bit of disappointment. the sudden stopping of the film for a pop love song doesn't help either (unless you like the song). this made the "exciting" ending a bit of a drag for me.the overall direction is good and the art design is excellent. acting is all good as well. recommended.

though not a greek i have had a lifelong interest in the eastern empire. its fall in 1453 was the greatest loss to christianity in its entire history. yet while the easter empire is not a topic much discussed in american intellectual circles, the us did not merely mimic golden byzantiums public architecture, the us is much absorbed in the fated byzantine historical cycle and now has faced many of the crises involving certain people of a middle eastern extraction about whom it is said that there is a slight tendency for excessive exuberance on religious matters which humbled great byzantium. i wonder if the loss of the ability to speak plainly was the first sign post on the road to disaster.john romer is to be credited not only for his excellent production but also for his joyful enthusiasm for the subject which is most refreshing.not recommended for americans who like political correctness.

if you want an excellent survey of byzantine history done in colorful fashion, this is for you. this documentary would also be excellent for educators, who are teaching about roman, or medieval history. this documentary is divided into three portions, first dealing with the fall of the western roman empire, the rise of christianity and the beginning of the byzantine empire. the second video deals with byzantine diplomacy and the iconoclastic controversy. the third and final video explains the decline and fall of byzantium. the series is shot in several countries, and beautifully integrates byzantine history into the realities of the modern world, showing the place of this civilization as part of human civilization in general. do, take the time to watch.

this is yet another gem from the pen of daniele thompson - in fact that same year (1999) she wrote and directed la buche, the first of three writer/director credits so far. belle maman is first of all 'french' whatever that means which is, of course, different things to different folks. the premise is simple: at the altar where he is marrying mathilde seigner, the groom, vincent lindon, gets his first glimpse of her mother, catherine deneuve, and suffers what the french call a coup de foudre which we know as love at first sight. in theory the story is either 1) over right then and there assuming he called the wedding off or else 2)just the beginning as he goes through with the wedding and thus lives a lie until it is resolved one way or the other. thompson veers towards #2 but not without hitting us with the odd subplot along the way like, for example, deneuve's cigar-smoking lesbian mother line renaud (in real life, if anyone cares, renaud is in a long-term relationship with stephane audran, who co-stars here) and throws in a brilliant set-piece in a luxuriously appointed men's room at the wedding reception, which takes the form of a hilarious song-and-dance. consummate writer that she is thompson also leavens the comedy with drama like the brilliant climactic scene where vincent finally spews out his feelings for deneuve at a family gathering whilst simultaneously wrecking the joint. this is one to savour. again and again.

wow....it's been a long time since i've last seen such a hilarious movie like this one!!!!! i've never been a great fanatic about french movies, but ever since i fell in love with the beauty and the acting skills of catherine deneuve i decided to see all of her movies... however i didn't think this one would be so fantastic as it turned out to be. lucky me, that i bought it even though i had some doubts! this is really "feel-good-time" film with class and quality. there are some great social topics and moral drama's involved that are very close to today's modern way of living, which are shown very beautiful and realistic. i also liked the dancing scene in the men's room a lot! but my favourite is the rather timid attempt of catherine deneuve to sing.....she brings it the way she is, with lots of grace and modesty at the same time...very tempting! further on i would also like to express my respect and admiration for line renaud, who played a fantastic role (i didn't even know she acted....i've only known her for her music). so, don't wait any longer and go see the movie...you'll be surprised in many ways.

or at least you feel pretty high after this movie. it's the kind of film that the word "rollicking" really can be applied to, though it's rollicking in that entirely casual, intelligent, and open-minded way that belongs to the french.no, catherine deneuve does not spend the entire movie high (sorry to disappoint any puritans with an agenda).. but the one scene to which i refer involves all the members of a wedding party - and it's a musical number! anyway, everything fits pretty seamlessly together, and the unusual, bright, colorful family ( deneuve's mother is a lesbian, deneuve her bon vivant daughter) alternately entertain and annoy us as real families do..but since it's a movie they mostly entertain.don't want to say too much about the ending, but deneuve ends up marrying a man about twenty years younger. this is entirely believable as we see the relationship develop over time, and as the two are naturally drawn closer and closer together. the ending is a happy one; and like the rest of the movie, satisfyingly quirky as well as pitch-perfect.

starting with a "my name is joe" like scene in alcoholics anonymous tbm careers into a mad spiral of infidelity, double standards and clandestine affairs. but what do you expect from a family of lawyers?a genuinely funny film, with some of the most outrageous characters since the birdcage, plot and subplot are intertwined with surreal scenes of decadent parisian life (ever been to a wedding reception in the gents toilet where the brides grandmother and her deranged girlfriend are smoking dope and cracking blue jokes? no, me either!) leading to a final scene of almost arcadian symbolism.excellent.

i always loved french movies because i think they are filled with much more emotion and sense than the americans. this film is a gem.starting with the wedding which is so funny that you just want to join them and in the end where the little family kids tell us who is with who which is extremly funny. catherine deneuve is simply hot and so good that it is absolutely possible that a young man can fall in love with her, and vincen lindon is perfect for that role. the best scene (except the wedding party) is in the family reunion where antoine has got mad and yells his feelings to lea in front of the family. it is such a shame that i could buy this film only from the french and not from the english (so i have to learn in french to enjoy watching it)!!

for all of us american deneuve fans, this little gem is a little tough to get ahold of. fortunately, i found myself so wrapped up in the short bits that i saw previewed on youtube.com that i was willing to go to any lengths. i found it on ebay.com, ordered it directly from france, and changed my laptop so it would play region 2 dvds. let me tell you that it was well worth it. be warned - there are no subtitles (unforunately, pathe shouldn't have released this on dvd, koch lorber should've - they're good about the subtitles). i don't speak a word of french. i can utter a syllable here and there, order a drink and whatnot. that having been said, this film was a treat anyway. i couldn't fully appreciate the supposed "bawdy" humor or the witty dialogue. watching deneuve and her cohorts was enough for me. i understood what was going on without need of the dialogue. it really says something about a film when those who can't speak the language enjoy it. the cinematography is wonderful. london is adorable as the smitten son-on-law. loved the lesbian mom. and, of course, what can i possibly say about our dear mademoiselle deneuve. she is one of a kind. those eyes, that smile. i could watch her films all day. she really goes beyond beauty. people always say she's gorgeous. well, yes, she is. but she is also very talented. i believed her every second of the way. her conversation about chocolate and vanilla with london is too sweet. her character even gets arrested for smoking dope with some 15 year old in the street. not to be missed! fly to france and buy this if you have to. great. 10

i will admit i possibly missed tiny moments when i wasn't paying proper attention, but i got enough of the story to agree that it is a great family film, from director lionel jefferies, who played grandpa potts in chitty chitty bang bang. basically it starts with a happy upper-middle class family living in victorian london. one night the father (iain cuthbertson) is visited by two strangers, and he leaves with them, and does not return. they move to a cottage in the country, and here the children; bobbie (jenny agutter, who i first saw in child's play 2), phyllis (sally thomsett) and peter (gary warren) keep their spirits up, with their fascination for the nearby railroad. everyday they wave faithfully to the passengers in the passing trains, and with courage and vigilance they also avoid an accident and are made heroes. their kindness makes them friends, including important people who can help find the mystery of their missing father. also starring dinah sheridan as mother/mrs. waterbury, bernard cribbins as albert perks, william mervyn as old gentleman, peter bromilow as doctor forrest, ann lancaster as ruth and gordon whiting as russian. it was number 29 on the 100 greatest family films, and it was number 24 on the 50 greatest british films. very good!

the railway children, at least this 1970 movie version written and directed by that long-time british character actor, lionel jeffries, is an unmitigated...classic. it tells a childhood story with great simplicity and charm; the sentimentality is muted; the evocation of childhood adventures is involving; and jeffries brings cleverness and style to his production. the waterbury family is leading an idyllic life in edwardian london. the father is prosperous, the mother is beautiful and loving, the children are well-mannered and affectionate, their home is warm and cozy. then one night during the christmas holidays two men appear at the doorstep, talk quietly to the father, and then take him away. in a moment the lives of mrs waterbury (dinah sheridan) and bobbie, 14 (jenny agutter), phyllis, 12 (sally thomsett) and young peter (gary warren), have been changed. only their fortitude and good spirits are going to see them through. now teetering into poverty, mrs. waterbury takes her children to live in a musty old brick house in the countryside near a rail-line, not too far from a small village with a train station. the children discover the rail and regularly sit on a small hill to wave at the passengers as the train chugs by. one day an old gentleman, going to his business in the city, looks up from his newspaper and finds himself waving back. it's not long before he will play an important part in the story. as time passes, mrs. waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to bear on her children. she begins to write stories to earn money. she teaches them their lessons and provides a home of warmth and security for them. the story, however, is about these three children, especially bobbie. at 14, she is old enough to want to share her mother's worries, yet young enough to enjoy the adventures she has with her sister and brother. they find a poor man at the station who cannot speak english. they discover he is a russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and child are. they insist he must come home with them, and their mother takes him in. before long the children have written a large sign to the old gentlemen on the train asking for his help. they help a young man taking part in a steeplechase who breaks his leg in a train tunnel. soon, he is at their home recuperating. they decide to have a birthday party for the station master, a man with few friends and several children who is a stickler for his dignity. it's not long before the children help him realize the difference between friendship and charity. in other words, the three children encounter all sorts of problems in their childhood adventures, and manage to be instrumental in seeing that all the problems have happy endings. but what of their own problems? bobbie finally learns from her mother that her father was taken away because he had been accused of treason, of giving state secrets to the russians. will bobbie be able to find a way to help? will the old gentleman be something more than simply an old gentleman on a passing train? will their father's case be reopened? will there be a happy ending? jenny agutter was almost 18 when she filmed her part; she plays the 14-year-old bobbie with great naturalness and charm. as important as the other players are, especially dinah sheridan as the mother, agutter is the heart of the story. for me, it is jenny agutter's talent and lionel jeffries' style and restraint that make this movie so memorable. the story's problems come with no serious doubt but that they will be solved. and jeffries does not just give us an expertly adapted and directed movie, he adds touches that are barely noticed but which charm us. this might include just a split second of a freeze frame as two people talk; or a slow close-up of a small, yellow wildflower in the grass outside bobbie's home, then a slow pull-back from a yellow oil lamp being turned up inside; or the realization that a delightful interior shot or a view of the green countryside or a look at the train station from a hill...all suddenly recall those charming edwardian hand-tinted drawings of a perfect by- gone time. perhaps this gentle story can't compete for the time kids need nowadays to perfect their nintendo monster-splatting skills. i'm almost positive it would never capture the attention of most of their parents, especially those weaned on batman and leone. still, it's a perfectly put together movie and shouldn't be forgotten. as an aside, 19 years later the story was retold as a television program. this time, jenny agutter played the mother.

i think together all the reviewers have captured this film really well. i have seen it many, many times, but i still feel a sense of joy and warmth just as i did the first time. my emotional response to this film never seems to fade. the final scene certainly brings me to tears, but so does the scene between perks and the children on his birthday. and as for the kindly gentleman. something else is going on with that character. the generous provider and solver of problems. he knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere. a perfect father to run to and make us feel safe. i do not know how the film does it, but it touches something very english deep inside, which has long gone from our daily experience, but yet we all instantly recognise and yearn for again.

in victorian times a father is separated from his family when he is falsely accused of treason and they are sent to live in the country. the children adapt to their new situation, make friends, and enlist the help of a kind old man they wave to on the train to help reunite their family.actors who direct movies are often not very good at it. jeffries however, the great veteran actor of dozens of british comedy classics, is one of the few exceptions. his brilliant conception (he also wrote the script, from the novel by e. nesbit) of a classic british children's story is what raises this film to art. whilst the story may be highly idealised, the wonderful performances and the fabulously evocative yorkshire dales settings combine to make a truly memorable movie. the photography by arthur ibbetson is the definition of good movie-making - not a shot is wasted in telling the story but at the same time the images combine to create a fabulously romantic atmosphere. agutter is simply perfect as the kind-hearted bobbie (okay, i fell in love with her at an early age, but i defy anyone to disagree) and cribbins, whose comic acting pedigree is on a par with jeffries, is unforgettable as perks the humble-yet-proud railway porter. this is a film out of time; romantic, charming, hugely enjoyable and with a beautifully naive sense of good-hearted kindness towards all.

i try to catch this film each time it's shown on tv, which happily is quite often. but i keep forgetting to video it. as it is, i practically know the script by heart, but that doesn't stop me having a good cry, in fact it probably adds to it as i cry knowing what's coming next. it's such a lovely film - well made, well cast, good photography. i love it. one of my top ten films.

i have watched this movie countless times, and never failed to be charmed by it's homely simplicity, sincerity and goodness. great characterizations by all of the cast, and the lovely little steam trains that play a such an important supporting role.i confess i fell in love with roberta in 1970, and she still touches me today. shown on tv in new zealand on christmas day, the nicest present i could have had.

an extremely powerful film that certainly isn't appreciated enough. it's impossible to describe the experience of watching it. the recent uk television adaptation was shameful - too ordinary and bland. this original manages to imprint itself in your memory.

the railway children was on tv again this weekend, and i had forgotten how good it was.if i have a criticism, it is that the episodic structure sometimes shows a little too clearly, there being little narrative flow from sequence to sequence. the charm and beauty of the film are such that this matters very little, however.i won't revisit the comments of others, other than to add my vote for the final scene on the platform as being possibly the single most emotional scene in the history of british cinema: as a cynical old git passing through middle age rather too quickly i, too, find i cannot even think of that moment without being hit with a severe case of "i've got something in my eye." in fact, it's not just something in my eye, it moves things around inside me, too, with that beautiful happy pain we sometimes feel.and jenny agutter was exquisitely beautiful in this film, standing with one foot in childhood and one in young womanhood, and bringing qualities of both to her portrayal of a girl having to grow up rather too quickly.plus a quick plaudit for bernard cribbins. regarded mostly as a lightweight actor, he deftly created a perks of great humanity.

proudly and defiantly working class porter perks(mr b.cribbins)is eventually won over by upper middle class family down on their luck. father(mr i.cuthbertson) incarcerated for treason - for which the penalty was death in those days,lest it be forgotten),mother(the very beautiful miss d.sheridan)brave and resourceful,loyal and loving,and - principally - older daughter (miss j.agutter) tottering on the cusp of adolescence - hurt and confused about the fate of her father. mr perks,like many working people of his time,will have nothing to do with anything that he considers smacks of "charity" and it is a key moment in the movie when he finally accepts that birthday gifts he has been given by the children do not compromise his principles. although the lovely miss agutter has received all the accolades it is mr cribbins and miss sheridan whose performances dominate "the railway children".they both know how edwardian society works from opposite ends of the spectrum but there is an unspoken mutual respect and understanding between them. but this is basically a movie about family.in an era when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and hold her to ransom and be considered as "socially inept" rather than unfit to live in decent society,and when two "human beings" can beat and kick a baby to death without being charged with murder,"family" may be seen as an old - fashioned,elitist, racist even homophobic concept,but a century ago it was the glue that held society together at all levels.mr cribbins' and miss sheridan's families are archetypal for the age.strong and loving,sticking together against outside influences,integral units with a moral certainty mocked in the 21st century. what might seem to be a dull,preachy political tract is turned by mr lionel jeffries into a delightful hymn to hope,faith,optimism and courage. that all those attributes were once considered the norm and are now too often the subject of scorn and cynicism is a reflection on our society rather than miss nesbit's. no one with more than a passing concern for the human condition can fail to be considerably moved by this quite perfect movie.

edith nesbitt's best book has been adapted into a truly magnificent film, i love it. the film itself has gorgeous cinematography, and fine realisation of the subject matter. the ending is enough to have you in tears, as it is so beautifully done. lionel has directed some truly excellent films, like the amazing mr blunden, but this is his best film as director by a mile. the costumes were absolutely lovely, that matched the beauty of the countryside, and the sparkling and conveniently-faithful script helped matters. however, it is the quality of the acting that holds this film together, as it is nothing shorter than incredible. dinah sheridan is suitably sincere as the mother, a much-needed characteristic of the character, and bernard cribbins was hilarious as perks. in fact, i preferred perks on film, as he isn't as humorous in the book. the children were perfect. gary warren and sally thomsett both gave spirited performances, but it is jenny agutter's enchanting portrayal of bobbie that impressed me the most. another special mention is the gorgeous music by johnny douglas, the title music reminded me of charlie chaplin's smile. in conclusion, a funny and poignant masterpiece, that is better than the book, i think. 10/10. bethany cox.

what is enjoyable about watching random movies at random times is that one never quite knows what to expect or where the next great piece of cinema will emerge. recently, my viewing has taken the form of stapled classics like "raging bull" or "raiders of the lost ark", but this time my vcr took me away from modern conveniences and plopped me right down in front of lionel jeffries' "the railway children". this is a skillfully directed film about three youthful children, a mysterious event with their father, relocation to the open fields of england, and eventually the rewards inherited by merely waving at trains. at first glance this seemingly simple children's film doesn't seem all that hopeful as it has been lost on vhs rarity for some time, but within the first fifteen minutes of this film, one realizes that it is more than just your common place children's movie ¬ñ "railway children" was created during a time when purity was more than just saying "no", when family meant everything, and where adventure was ready for you around every railroad track bend. this is more than an adorable film, it has amazing cinematic techniques used, it keeps the regular viewer glued to the screen with unanswered questions, and gives three perfect companions to follow along this 110-minute voyage. "railway children" is a lost treasure that needs to be seen by families and film aficionados alike.there are several moments that stand out proudly in "railway children" that transform this from mediocrity to excellence ¬ñ one happens to be our three children; bobby, phyllis, and peter. modern cinema assures us that these three children cannot provide ample darkness, laughter, and insight into the world surrounding them, but jeffries' children prove otherwise. from intelligently spoken lines (both from acting and the script), to sincere kindness and dedication to this small village, all the way to the final meeting at that train stop; these children are more than just child stars advancing a story, they are leading us with emotion, persuasion, and a realism unseen by today's children. there is more imagination packed in this small vhs than i have witnessed in film for years. a favorite scene that could have been handled with generality, of which i have seen in other films, was the birthday scene for bobby. the way that jeffries floats her between guests and gifts was exciting and refreshing, keeping our eyes excited about each scene, as well as our mind. another scene that captured my attention was when the children were working on gifts for perks, when asking one man for a gift, jeffries has him merely state, "no, i will not. i don't like perks." the children's reaction is hilarious ¬ñ providing moments for both children and adults to enjoy throughout. filmed in the 1970s, this tiny feature provides genuine laughs than most modern comedies. it is a creative film coupled with great choreography and direction.that is to say, as much as i loved this film, it wasn't perfect. jeffries does a great job of keeping us guessing as to what happened to father, but it did feel like the event occurred, the children were kept in the dark, and it suddenly resolved itself by the end. more detail to father, not much more, would have solidified his character and given us the opportunity to see more of the children's reaction. also, there is one scene in this film, one of those grandiose wide-screen shots of the english countryside that is just breath-taking, but when looking a bit closer you happen to see cars in the background. it made me chuckle, but didn't distract too much from the overall picture. cinema like this is sorely missed today, and oddly, it seems that only the british have the gumption to produce it. films like "love, actually" or "vicar of dibley" demonstrates the power and excitement for community towns, places where everyone knows everyone and we aren't afraid to be neighborly. this is more of a theme that american audiences could have more of ¬ñ more understanding of what is happening outside, instead of remaining secluded to your own events.overall, i loved "railway children". i didn't know what to expect when i first put it in the vhs player, but from the opening scene, to the exploding train set, to perks birthday, jeffries proved that he could handle the most child-friendly story with ease. his ability to make the child actors feel like real characters, to involve the adults less, and to involve the children like they were adults was outstanding. this is a film to be viewed as a strong alternative to anything disney releases. the continually occurring themes of friendship, kindness to strangers, and forgiveness blasts through the tv with grace and power. "railway children" is more than just a kid's film; it is a feature that should be a staple to modern audience viewing. not only does it give a great visual to the english countryside, but it also teaches (and shows) how life would be greater with an emphasis on imagination and courage, instead of fighting any cgi bad guys.grade: **** ¬Ω out of *****

this brings back so many childhood memories. (i'm not old, i'm 19) it's brill. the trains, the old house, the fallen runner, the really scary landslide (well it is when you're 6), the drama if the children can stop the train, or will it crash? this is a children's film without a doubt, but it offers great harmless no blood/guts/guns etc for children. and it's got bernard cribbins in it, who's cool. 8/10

am an ardent vijay fan. i have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this.it has all the regular clich√©s that one can expect from a commercial entertainer. a hero who is bad in studies but a star in his forte i.e.kabbadi. his friends to fill in the comedy quota. a heroine in a life-and-death situation. a villain, which i say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist. high octane chase and action sequences. music that can make one dance. and above all that a perfect storyline to keep all the above factors within an enjoyable circle. perfect.the director doesn't give any chance for the audience to loosen up. he just goes on from one nail on the head to the next. and one can see the lighter side of vijay in this film which he rarely executes.all said.....this movie was and will be perfect for many years to come....

if you have seen the telugu version of gilli "okkadu" you will find this to be very similar in story line, but gilli has different songs and takes place in tamil nadu not andra pradesh. although this is a remake of "okkadu" you will find that vijay and trisha make this a unique film, vijay and trisha make a great pair. a few negatives were when vijays character slaps trishas character for going to buy a present for him, he never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end. good action and songs make this an all around great movie i recommend it.i give it a 10/10, one of the best i have seen.

the first time you watch this movie you may hate it, but the 2nd time you see this movie i guarantee laughs all around. the owners of the dogs are so ecclectic that you can't help but look at them and laugh. from the littlest toy poodle to the announcer, everything will make you laugh. and you may learn every single nut there is!

i recently saw this movie for the first time. i enjoyed it so much that i went right out and bought the dvd. this movie is pure genius and only gets funnier with each viewing. anyone can write jokes or funny dialog and have actors memorize them, but the basis of this movie is improve!! how do they do it? thank you, christopher guest!

"best in show" tracks the stories of a handful of human contestants as they prepare for one of the biggest dog shows in the calendar. any amateur psychologist would say that an unconditional love and obsession with a pet is a sign of something missing in someone's life, and each of the characters in some way fills this cliche. there's the former high school hottie who's now married to a geeky man, the childless, label-obsessed yuppie couple, the solitary outdoorsman, the young wife of a wealthy old codger (along with her short-haired dog trainer), and the gay couple.what makes this film so funny though is the way it portray's these stereotypes in a completely believable way - almost affectionate, in many cases. every ridiculous thing one of the characters does or says - with their dog as an innocent onlooker - seems like the kind of behaviour you'd totally expect to see at a dog show.the biggest laughs come from the commentary team of an all-american style sports announcer, comparing moments in a dog show to parts of a baseball game, and his english, canine academic, foil.the trials of the geeky husband as his blonde wife meets an astonishing number of men from her past is also always good for a chuckle, as is the demented behaviour of the yuppie couple as the pressure builds, while their hound stays completely unflustered.well worth watching - even if cats are more your bag.

i saw this movie with an open mind, not knowing what to expect. i was pleasantly surprised to see that this movie was written, directed and acted in such a manner that every minute of it is a delightful watch. the people don't seem like they're acting, more like they are real people who really train dogs and lead the lives portrayed in this movie. there are some wonderful moments where you laugh or chuckle, some jokes may be dry but are presented in a very viewable fashion. highly recommended!

this film isn't a comedy, its an expose. i've always hated dog shows, considering the ridiculous get-ups people put their dogs in and the idiotic names they give them. hence, the reason for my uncontrolled cackling while watching this film. i get a kick out of something being taken so seriously, even though the gains are small and insignificant. it's like miniature golf, or jump roping championships or the need to set some obscure world record. the acting was much more refined in this film than waiting for guffman, and its mainly due to the more fluidity of the characters, who seem more comfortable with their specific acting partners in this film than the previous. eugene levy was great, as was michael mckean and fred willard. however, it was the dogs who eventually stole the show. but then again, who wants to see a bunch of humans in a film about dogs anyway.

well in to 2002 i've got some catching up to do. and looking back on a lacklustre year, best in show shone. no great storyline. little action. just a cavalcade of magnificent characters. particular reference to fred willard and jim piddock as a rattling pair of tv commentators. well done. well worth the effort.ron (viewed 24mar2001)

this has got to be the funniest movie i have seen in forever. chritopher guest is truly talented. he has a gift for humor. i almost died laughing. actually, when i saw this in theaters, i considered walking out because the movie was so dumb. but it is dumb in a good way. it is funny-dumb. and this is a really good combination. you will be laughing from start to end.this mockumentary style film follows an array of characters all competing at the kennel club dog show. the cast includes parker posey, fred willard, eugene levy, catherine o'hara, john michael higgens, michael mckean, larry miller, bob balaban, jennifer coolidge and tons more. this is a truly funny movie that will have everyone laughing. someone born without a personality would laugh at this film. it is presented in widescreen to give the image that you are viewing an actual documentary and that is probably what adds to the hilarity. best in show: 5/5.

this movie brought together some of the old spinal crew for another mockumentary film, this time revolving around the world of the dog show, how their owners prepare and train for the show before moving on to the show itself.we meet several teams as they hope to win the top prize- the fleck's, cookie who seems to have slept with every man ever, and gerry who tries to cope with his wife's old escapades and the fact that he literally has two left feet. harlan, whose dog talks to him, and enjoys ventriloquism. the swan's who have taken far too much coffee and scream at each other. donalan and vanderhoof the gay couple, and cabot and cummings who have won the last two years. fred willard commentates on the show, and is very funny as always. funny scenes include the 'look at me!' scene, and any with levy. unfortunately some of the best scenes were deleted or filmed later- willard interviewing leslie cabot, and the alternative epilogue with gerry is one of the funniest things i have ever seen. if these had been included, i would give the film an extra mark. but...7 out of 10

i have to admit that i absolutely loved this movie. of course as i'm sure you know that "malcolm's in the middle" star frankie muniz, and the ever so sweet amanda bynes "the amanda show" starred in this children's comedy as two friends that i'm sure that we can all re-late to. the movie is about a boy jason shepard(frankie) and his friend kaylee(amanda)going onto an adventure in hollywood.spoilers aheadas it begins jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day life's problems. one day jason is hit by mr. wolf(the big bad director). jason's english paper is stolen by wolf and begins the adventure along with kaylee to earn his father's trust back. they fly to hollywood in search of wolf to get him back. frankie and amanda do all sorts of crazy stunts to get wolf back, and all he has to do is call jason's dad and tell him he stole his idea. but the end is no real surprise, being the good proveles and wins.the story is cute and fifth grade humored but what do you expect it's rated pg. i really belive this is one of the years best family comedies. not only is the childrens acting great, exceptional casting, well written, but it's good clean fun. it made me laugh as well as fall in love with it's innocent message. i highly reccomend it and would like to disagree with that someone who gave it a zero out of ten. the unemployed critic isn't unemployed for nothing. i give it (well i voted a ten out of ten) a perfect.

this is the best of the films (so far) that christopher guest has created using his very talented ensemble cast. previously, they'd made the excellent waiting for guffman and following best in show, they made the very enjoyable a mighty wind. as for their latest, for your consideration, the less said the better.the film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular. you follow these few chosen dogs from pre-show preparations all the way to the big night where one of them is chosen best in show at the fictitious "mayflower kennel club". however, none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts but talent improvisational actors that parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world. amazingly, even though the characters are rather outlandish, there is a lot of truth to the personalities they are parodying--as decades ago i had some experience with dog shows and this is a very cutthroat group of people! my favorites of the dog owners were the incredibly high-pressure and tense yuppie couple who just exuded anger and volatility. i also loved the openly gay couple, as they were terribly funny and clever. however, the best performance probably wasn't from any of the couples but from fred willard who played the world's stupidest and least talented announcer in human history. his comments were uniformly inane and often betrayed his as an incredibly stupid person--how he got to be the announcer for such a prestigious show is anyone's guess. the other contestants featured were also quite funny--the high-priced professional poodle handler and its rich owner, the country boy and his hound as well as winkie's "parents" who could barely scrape together enough to make it to the show.despite the improvised style of film making, the pieces all fit together wonderfully and told a very funny and compelling story--one that is not for dog owners only. exceptional acting made this one of the best comedies of the last decade. clever and consistently funny.by the way, try to find this on dvd as the extras were actually worth seeing. while a bit painful to watch, i loved seeing harlan pepper and his beach ball collection in particular!

this movie should go down as one of the funniest movies in history. its cousins a mighty wind, spinal tap and waiting for guffman are terrific in their own right but best in show takes the cake. a movie about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners that show their dogs competitively, it's the intricacies of the characters that make it so good. after watching the movie about 75 times i have come to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this film. there is very little interaction between any of the "groups" of characters but that only seems to add to the beauty of the film. if you watch this movie and don't find it as funny as i am billing it as, watch it again. the first time i saw it i thought it was serviceable but not overly hilarious. it is a film that grows on you. defininatly a movie that you will find yourself quoting frequently. characters: hamilton and meg swan: a+ if you get the dvd check out how these characters were "born" amazing that these two could hit it so on the head. and to find out that they really didn't go by a script and sort of made it up as they went. gerry and cookie guggleman: a cookie is especially funny and she does a fantastic job of selling the cookie character. gerry (eugene levy) delivers his standard stellar performance of the hilarious discombobulated type weaker half. stefan vanderhoof and scott donalan- a+ find me a funnier character than scott donalan, i dare you! he will forever be typecast as this character to me as he was so natural and didn't seem forced at any point. stefan (micheal mckean) was very good as well and they interplay here (and a brief appearance with the gugglemans) goes to show why he is always in these films. a great actor with razor like wit. harlan pepper- b+, i don't want it to seem like he isn't funny, he sure is but being the only "solo" act he can't be quite as funny as the others above. he does use the dog more than others and has some other idiosyncrasies going for him.the rest are all great as well, there is no weak character. see this film at least twice. buy it, you will not regret it.

i love the mockumentary format that chris guest and crew have developed over the years. i actually like this and "waiting for guffman" better than "spinal tap", which was the first of the group (and made by rob reiner but starred guest and several other of his mockumentary regulars). this humor is not for everyone. it's rather subtle and not too physical, so some people may not relate. however, as a dog lover (and a dog show fan), i loved this movie. there are so many funny lines in it! my daughter and i quote them to each other often. i find it amazing that these people can ad lib so much funny material for each movie! what a fun bunch they must be. i highly recommend this to people who prefer their humor on the cerebral side.

functioning as a sort of midpoint between "waiting for guffman" and "a mighty wind", "best in show" portrays a dog show and the various people who bring their canine friends to participate. some are weird, some crazy, and otherwise, but they all make the movie good. director christopher guest is particularly funny as gay harlan pepper, very much trying to promote his dog. eugene levy, parker posey, michael mckean, catherine o'hara, and bob balaban also do great jobs (i can't imagine them not doing great jobs, at least not in a christopher guest movie). as someone who's never attended a dog show, this movie is my main exposure to them. they sure look neat.

this is the funniest movie i have ever seen. however, i have laughed harder at plenty of movies. this is because best in show's brilliance lies not in slapstick or one-liners, but in sophisticated and layered verbal wit. the improvised dialogue is is so quick that you end up laughing not at each individual joke, but only until after several jokes build on one another, each disarming your senses until the jokes climax and you can't help letting loose.it's a well-shot film, but what makes it extraordinary is the acting. i was impressed on my first viewing, but when i watched it after having learned that virtually every scene is improvised, i was amazed. it was thoroughly enjoyable to see the comedians work off each other, build jokes out of nothing, and completely immerse themselves in their characters.i imagine the golden days of second city were like this.

you know, this movie reminded me so much of so many people i know, i think that's the reason why i loved this movie so much. i was just on the floor laughing because this had such a serious and document feel to it, but the dialog is so hilarious, that you can't help but have a good time. basically the movie is about these crazed dog owners who are competing in a big dog show to see who is the best of the best. whlie it seems like it should be the dogs who take this competition seriously, it turns out the owners are just as insane. megan, one of the dog owners, goes almost serial psycho killer on the hotel manager because she cannot find the special bee squeaky toy for her dog.there is another couple that is just great, gerry and cookie, this complete nerd and attractive woman that are just so lovable. in the beginning of the movie, gerry describes how many boyfriends cookie had. throughout the movie, her "lovers" see her and hit on her even in front of gerry! it was just great and fun to watch gerry's looks. this whole movie is just a hoot, and you can't stop with the recognizable faces that keep popping up. it's a great movie is just fun to watch, i'd highly recommend it! now, i have to find a nice way of showing this to my friends who are like these couples to see the mirror image of themselves. :d 8/10

this is the only christopher guest movie that rivals spinal tap and princess bride for sheer entertainment value, but somehow never gets near the recognition. the plot surrounds the contestants--dogs--and their owners as they venture into the world of competitive dog...ok, it's about a dog show. the owners truly are characters, as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs. that's really all there is to it, but that makes it funny enough.you'd never be able to convince me that a mock-u-mentary about dog shows would be funny prior to catching the hilarious scene where levy and o'hara visit larry miller's house on tv...but that's really all it takes to convert any doubters. spinal tap was non-stop hilarity, joke after joke whereas best in show was had a few more lulls (and by that i mean say 3 minute at most where something riotously funny doesn't happen), but the big laughs are even bigger.the casting in this one is great and even the typically out of place in, uh movies in general parker posey does a fine job. in fact, her tirade directed at ed begley jr. and a pet store owner over a lost dog toy is probably the funniest running gag of the film.what's amazing about this movie to me is how the writers somehow managed to weave a plot, simple as it was, around these great jokes so that it actually felt like it had direction. i guess there's a freedom in having such a minimal plot. everyone's role is pretty well crafted here and the characters are rarely over-the-top. the realism of how pathetic they seem to the outsider is what makes it funnier than mighty wind or the uneven guffman. i actually encounter wierdos like this now and then. if you like guest's stuff at all, you should definitely own this one.

in the era of the farrelly brothers and the jackass series, to have a movie made and performed by americans come out that is well paced and full of charm as well as hilarity is well-nigh miraculous. this ensemble has been behind some other efforts, most recently "a mighty wind" which was so subtle it seemed to be an actual documentary without the overlay of entertainment, but "best in show" hits on all cylinders. it is superbly cast with some of the best of current us actors, parker posey, who exudes energy even when she stands still, eugene levy as tolerant everyman who is nobody's doormat, even when he appears to be (or maybe, 'indomitable doormat'). the brilliant stylings of fred willard, the understated performances of so many others, which is a characteristic not normally associated with americans or american actors. one of the few humorous movies i can watch again and again.

big fat liar is the best movie ever! it is funny, and cool. jason shepherd (frankie muniz) proves that he was not lying and goes to los angeles to get his paper back from marty wolf( paul giamatti). along with friend kaylee(amanda bynes), mess up his life since marty won't call jasons' dad and say he wrote the paper! yet it all turns out good and is a good movie to watch!

well it might be a kid's movie...perhaps but i'm not gonna let my kids from 9 watch it!,so the one who say it is a kid movie hmm?!,it is teenager movie i agree..,so but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very good..,so good that at the end nobody nows truth or lie.anyway it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a 8 for screen play and story ...i think they writers mend a litlle lesson whit it...''the truth is never overated''.

this is a really sad, and touching movie! it deals with the subject of child abuse. it's really sad, but mostly a true story, because it happens everyday. elijah wood and joseph mazzello play the two children or lorraine bracco, a single mother who just tries to make a home for them. while living with her parents, a man, who likes to be called "the king" comes into their life. he hits the youngest boy, bobby, but the two brothers vow not to tell their mother. but finally she finds out, after the bobby is hurt badly. the end kind of ruined it for me, because it is so totally unbelievable. but, except for that, i love the movie.

well...i like this movie first of all because it's very well thought of... and well..because the um...director and others chose an extremely great actor to play mike....and also my last reason because ( my opinion) elijah wood is so so hot!!!

"radio flyer" is one of my most loved american movies.the really great job of two boys, joe mazzello and elija wood, (in spite of terrible performance of t.hanks at the beginning and ending...) with marvellous script of d.m.evans and powerful and emotional directing of r.donner plus absolutely incredibly peerless music score of h.zimmer allowed the "radio flyer" to win one of the first places in my family's rating of movies.it's so pity that that very good movie was underrating by some movie critics.i just can't help waiting to see it on dvd.

where do i begin? i first saw this film in 1995 and had no idea of what to expect, i was actually at the time searching out films that elijah wood had starred in and this one had come highly recommended. i sat down and watched the film once and didn't know what to think. i watched it a second time a few days later and the floodgates just opened. never before in my life had i ever really cried while watching a film, and i was blubbing, every high and low the film i was riding right alongside, on an emotional roller coaster.it struck such an emotional chord in me on many levels, the intense sadness and elation we see in the film, the wonder and innocence of childhood, the yearning for a time that once was, but is no more. more than anything, this film reminded me of my childhood (except for the abuse) during a time in my life when i'd shrugged off my childhood some years before and not even really noticed, i'd given it up and moved on to a life entirely devoid of it. the radio flyer made me wake up and suddenly realise what i'd given up without really even noticing. from that day forward i immediately set about to change my life and myself, and i did.this is going to sound corny but basically i rediscovered my inner child, i started down a path that has been ongoing over the past 6 years and has changed me so much, so much for the better, embracing and living that part of myself. i've been finding out who i really am. i don't think it was simply a case of the right film coming along at a crucial moment of my life, the radio flyer really did something very special, and i still look upon it as an incredible piece of work in all respects, an incredible film.in closing i cannot fail to mention the music. i am a great fan of hans zimmer and this is among his very finest works. the sheer breadth and depth of emotional expression he has put into the score of this film is a huge part of what makes the film what it is to me. like subtitles to a foreign language film, his soaring music is a crib sheet to the intense emotions this film will take you through. find the soundtrack at all costs, it was sadly deleted long ago, i never expected to find it but amazingly did, after chatting with someone i met on a hans zimmer fansite guest book.watch this film, let yourself live the emotions, don't get bogged in trivial nitpicking of the ending, be that child again

i am a 20 year old bloke from england. i don't cry at films. but this one moved me. i cried like a girl! this is absolutely the most moving film i have ever seen, even though the story was questionable. joseph mazello's little face when he dreams of crying made me sob every time. how could anyone hurt such a sweet looking kid? i'm going to cry now just thinking about it! remarkable.

young elijah wood and joseph mazzello are outstanding in this excellent film about two boys who have promised to "take care of their mother," and how they cope when their new stepfather begins beating the younger boy. the supporting cast around the boys is top-notch as well. the script really gets inside the mind and heart of an imaginative child. it's hard to believe wood could grow up to look anything like tom hanks, but that's nothing new in hollywood. that's honestly my only criticism of the film.

this story is an excellent tale of two boys that do whatever they can to get away from there abusive drunkard father. "lord of the rings" star elijah wood is outstanding in this unforgettable role. this movie is one of the main reasons i haven't touched a single beer and never will as long as i live. that might make me sound like a nerd, but that's what i have to say. it is a wonder why this isn't hearld as a classic american tale.

i first saw this movie as a younger child. my sister had told me about it and i thought it would be more of a kid's movie. however it remains to also be an incredible movie. true that the subject behind the movie is ruff but also true this movie will never stop touching your heart.i was only 6 when i first saw it and just yesterday, 7 years later, i saw it again. for the first time in a long time. even after i knew how it ended, i knew that i had seen it a billion, bizillion times i wept like a teeny weeny little baby. when i saw it a few years back i finally got the idea and the seriousness of the film. so i stoped watching it for a while. but yesterday i didn't change the channel, i watched it. by the end i was astonished at how much it still made me laugh, cry, think, and above all, believe in mericals again. i haven't belived in a long time and this movie got me out of my shell and opened up my heart. this movie wasn't just impacting. i was also so impressed with the actors. especially bobby. so if you are wanting to see this movie for the first time i suggest seeing it alone. with tissues. and being ready to discover your young, sweet, innocent side and the side that still has hope. this movie touched my soul when i was only 6, and even in this time of trying to figure out who i am this movie helped me realize both what i don't and still do want to be in life.

this has to be the best movie of all time (in my opinion). it really taught me when i watched when i was 10 (in 2000) that the freedom of a being a child slips away sooner then we expect it to. also joseph mazzello has to be my favorite actor ever, and i think that him and elijah wood did a great job in the roles of brothers. this movie is quite sad, and some people don't understand the ending. but the story itself is quite incredible, the thought of a poor 7 year boy (bobby)getting abused by drunken step father is horrible, and what the two boys do about this is sad, and important. my favorite part of the movie is when tom hanks (older mike) lists the 7 things of being a kid that are lost to the grownup world. however there are some parts that could have been done better in this movie, such as the casting of the mother (lorraine braco), who i think is a horrible actor. "the king" played his role well, since it is a hard role to play. joseph and elijah definitely were the stars of the movie. i couldn't believe how well they played victims of a abusing stepfather, being the age that they were (7 and 9). but overall, i recommend this movie to anyone, who loves great child actors, and a great movie. :)

my take on the ending. bobby died at the hands of his step father. mike had tried as he may to get bobby out. only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly. bobby died.... mike as a child survived by creating an alternative ending in his mind...on how bobby left....mike made a plane that flew bobby out. children who are sexually and violent abused often create whole other worlds in their minds to survive.was also great seeing my old housing area. we called it san jose boulevard and i lived right around where these house were filmed. it was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses...not studios... it was my kitchen, bedroom and living room. and those hills...we use to hike them as kids....looking down on our little valley....seeing glimpses of the bay. was a real nostalgia trip for me.

this movie was a heart-felt piece of cinema that helped show the darker side of childhood, and the little things that shaped who tom hank's was. using a very cryptic story, they were able to give you an idea of what truly happened to tom hank's character as a child. and while scenes like the flying machine may have never happened, it helped to show how even denial can help tell the truth. in all good conscience, i could not rate this lower then a 9 out of 10, great performances from all the actors, and while many may not have understood the cryptic ending in which the brother is murdered by his step father, and tom hanks covers it up using a far-fetched story about a flying machine, pay close attention to the little details, such as the turtle that he still has, even though his brother "flew" off with it. truly, a beautiful piece of cinema, and every actor deserves recognition for it.

i am surprised that so many viewers didn't find all the symbolism in the movie.....it's what made the movie an incredible work of art! the story deals with some of the saddest content a movie could hold, yet it is one of the best movies i've ever seen because of the need for your own imagination and the brilliance in the storyline.if you will pay close attention, the message is there. the younger brother is killed by the stepfather. the older brother made up the story about the wagon flying as a way to deal with the pain of his brother's death. there are those that would argue why would he lie to his own children with the story. to me the answer is because he doesn't want to share such ugliness with his own children, or that he has blocked it out and replaced his memory of the horrific event with the thought of his brother flying away to safety. i've read some of the reviews that believe he was an only child and that he created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered. although this is an interesting idea - i love the imagination used to come up with that. i don't think he would have lied to his own children about having a little brother. but, i do find it plausible that he would have lied about his little brother's death. however, i like that idea of an ending much better than the notion that the movie had no symbolism at all.there are many different takes you can have on the movie, but if you take the movie at face value.....two brothers creating a wagon that flies to escape an abusive stepfather - you've missed the brilliance. the fact that i was able to see the subtle messages in the script were what made the movie so incredible to me. it requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work......dig deep when you watch it. you'll be amazed at the genius contained in the film. the only other movie i've seen as close to this in symbolism and subtle messages is pleasantville.....but that's a comment for another movie!

this film, based on the book by pascal laime' -la dentelliere- is an acclaimed film of excellent cinematography and costly italian language. set in a "scholastic" 19th century, balzac-style set, it portraits the story of a mad love story: a man and a woman. there is an infamous line at this shadowy-mussolinni strike which reads: "she does not smell like tomatoes." sage perfumery of this italian masterpiece, scola is a director of the stature of mussolinni: his cake will jump in your strawberries and if you let this director he will cream your olives as a superman. remember nietzsche? this one will scare the hell out of you: don't forget to visit mussolinni's cake next to the colisseum in rome, across the via appia. this movie will wipe your pampers inside-out and outside-in, it will make you cry out of romantic joy! if you liked ulysses, you will wipe it good with these strawberries until the end of the roll. enjoy!

a clever and bizarre angle to "beauty is in the eye of the beholder". at times you think this is campy and over the top, but the underlying poetic soul comes across strong and believable thanks to the performances of the two leads. one worth tracking down.

ettore scola's masterful rendering of this epic of the heart deserves a much wider audience. it is a worthy successor to the risorgimento classics such as vischonti's senso and il gattopardo, as well as rosselini's vanina,vanini. the 19th century is indeed a fruitful source for italian filmmakers. the period settings and trappings are beautifully realized here, but the story is timeless and could occur in any period. what is so intriguing in this story is that the hero becomes trapped in a claustrophobic situation in which he finds himself the vigorously pursued object of desire and he is quite powerless to extricate himself from the alarming circumstances. handsome and callow giorgio (giraudeau) is frustrated by his inability to visit his charming but light-minded married mistress (antonelli) and falls prey to the dangerous passion of enamored fosca (d'obici), the ugly and sickly daughter of his stern commander (girotti). the resulting anguish and ensuing tragedy this unlikely pair undergoes make them both understandable, pitiful and immensely sympathetic to viewers. bernard giraudeau's stellar performance will captivate and leave a lasting impression. not to be missed.

this is one of the few movies that was recommended to me as absolutely brilliant, that really is. if you give this movie a low note than you really missed the point. you could describe fosca as manipulative, but what if it is really serious, that she gets ill when the love she is sure of isn't answered. but what would you do when you are sure that the other one loves you, and is 'only' rejected by the fact that you are ugly. wouldn't you fight for it. at least i think it is better to fight for it that die in bitterness. and it reminds me of the fact how i, as a man, react at first sight completely on the physical ugliness of fosca and don't look further at the person she is or might be. this movie confronts me with very solemn questions about respect, trust, feeling manipulated and so on. how do i now if someone manipulates me or is just trying everything to make contact? what i think to be the most outstanding feature in this movie is that ettore scola made it absolutely believable that giorgio falls in love with fosca.

in this unlikely love triangle, set in 19th century italy, `the beauty and the beast' is being turned upside down and inside out and then some: giorgio, an army officer and the very image of male beauty, is being transferred away form his (married) lover clara and sent to a small garrison somewhere in piemont. there - initially much to his horror ¬ñ fosca, the grotesquely ugly cousin of his commander, develops an obsessive love for him. he suffers her passionate and demanding displays of affection out of pity and concern for her health (she is gravely ill), but becomes more and more fascinated by her ¬ñ until the dramatic finale¬Ödo not miss this most unusual love story, as twisted as it may sound. valeria d'obici, who deservedly won a price for her portrayal of fosca, is as alarming as she is touching. buy the video, read the book, go see the musical!

i don't know how i would feel if i lived in usa. i would watch some preview scenes, advertisements, i would know, sidney pollack directed it, harrison ford and kristin scott thomas starring in. i would watch this film as soon as possible without reading any bad review. would i be disappointment?i read a lot of review which is said how bad this film was: this is boring, long film without passion emotions and it is not interesting. harrison is wooden, cold. the sublots should be cut. too serious, particularly for harrison ford. i am interested in the subject, and i like harrison ford in the films which are not actions. i like sidney pollack and kristin scott thomas too. so reading the reviews on imdb website then in other sites then in february in the hungarian movie magazines i was wonder and wonder what the film was. anyway there are films, directors, stars what/who i want to see despite any reviews.i can understand people who thinks this film is boring and cold and has got not any passion, but i feel different. it is true i liked sliding doors, the forbidden woman (this is a french film, i don't know what its title in english, or in french). basic of these films is development of a love.i think random heart is a nice and interesting film in its own way.it may be true that the sublots -the congress election and the cop's investigation after a corrupt policeman- are not written well, are not worked out in details but add something to the leading woman and man character.after his wife's death and betrayal emotion, angry of dutch comes to the surface during his work. he will be suspicious and almost lost his best friend (then the woman too). the film shows two ways to survive the tragedy: our wife/husband's death and cheating. one of them is the woman's: this is tragedy, but the life is continuing. she doesn't want to mourn forever. what she wants to know-what her husband's lover-the cop's wife- thought about her she will not learn never. she is forced to behave in this way. the elections are comes, and anything about his husband may become scandal. she wants her daughter not to be disappointment with her father. the man is a cop.he suffering from the fact he lived in lies. he wants to know -maybe every men would want to know in this situation-when his wife started to cheat him. how long had she got lover?. he needs the woman's help but she doesn't want, but the guy is stubborn and steady/persistent. the woman can't stand him because he always steps into her life and she cannot forget. their relationship is tense at the beginning then slowly developments a type of silent sympathy which is prefer an alliance against the outside world, the tragedy. (i said it in spite of that they made love in bed) however the cop, can't stop with investigation, can't stop close and can't allow the woman close to him but he starts the "love", and the woman wants their relationship to continue. but it can't. the woman realizes it. the end is a bit sad, but logic, and nice at the same time.it was pleasant for me to see again peter coyote-i like this man's face- sidney pollack. i hardly knew bonnie hunt but she was good.i think harrison ford did an okay job. his eardrop is unusual but at the beginning then finally i believed that the woman liked being at his company in spite of his temperament. it was pity he had not got any joke. but ford has got a good sense of humour. a reviewer noticed (in hungary): "ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic notice. but dr jones is not smiling at us".. but he smiles at the end and it is soooo good. with the rest i agree. i very like him in this role- he is good in acting of this a bit rough, cool but somewhere in his soul smart cop.. the character of kristin scott thomas is a woman who is determined, self confident, but she is closed inside a ivory tower and she keeps aloof from her emotions. but she is a really woman who become indecisive and find support on the cop.the two cool, reserved- people find each other.maybe the script is not good. it is full of common, banal sentence, but there are some humorous sentences from the woman and movement particularly from the man. it is a good film but not for everybody, not for the general big audience. i watched the females under 18 and males above 45 liked this film better. about the latter, maybe sidney pollack made this film for his age-group which doesn't go to multiplex. anyway i advice the people who like energetic plots with action scenes, who like only ford's action films miss this movie.

i read the other comments here about this movie before watching it. if you've read them, you will know that they are almost all negative. i really don't understand that. i admit that it is far too long (it needs about a half hour cut out to speed it up a bit). the music is often inappropriate. but, strong performances by ford and thomas are indeed enough to carry this. with all his fame as a movie star, i'd forgotten that harrison ford really can act! this role as a man who has defined himself based upon a lie is remarkable. i find it completely believable that he wants all the details he can get so he can see what was real and what was deception. thomas is always wonderful and this is no exception. her initial denial which leads to confusion and then to inner calm is tremendous. this movie is never going to be on anybody's list of great flicks, but it isn't that bad. i'm glad that i waited to see it on video, but it is worth the $3 or $4.

why do people need to follow the opinion of the herds of masses and critics? random hearts, directed by the brilliant sydney pollack (who has a small role in the film too) is another harrison ford vehicle. as such, it is quite good and entertaining. surely, anyone who goes to see it has this in mind, or read the book which is no better. even kristin scott thomas fans, myself included, knew it would be a variation of her again playing the love interest of her eldest uncle. even as such, the film is satisfying. what's so bad about this movie that is much better in the other (much higher rated) harrison ford vehicles? this film is no masterpiece, but it's not as bad as the masses would have the potential viewer believe.

i really enjoyed "random hearts". it was shocking to see such a low rating on imdb, but chacun a son gout and all that. i am a big fan of harrison ford, but i do have to admit that he was ill cast in this movie, and the reason i gave it 9 instead of 10. kristin scott thomas, though, was just wonderful. she was believable and beautiful, in spite of being made up for half the movie like she'd been crying for days. could "random hearts" have been better? sure, but it is very much worth seeing as it is.

okay, i'll admit that if i didn't have kids, i never would have seen this film and would never see it. but, considering all the rotten kids movies i have seen (such as spy kids 2 or babe: pig in the city), this is a significant improvement. and, it had enough in it that i wasn't totally bored out of my skull or contemplated suicide (something i did repeatedly in the other two movies). sure, the performances are pretty broad and the plot is kinda silly--but it is a kids film. and, compared with other films in the genre, this is definitely better than average. frankie muniz and amanda bines actually appear to have some talent and probably will continue to have careers after puberty--at least on infomercials or doing voice-overs.so, if you are looking for a film to see with your kids, you certainly could do a lot worse!

it is a nice comedy. it has the great features of the childhood, lying or trying to get away from own generated troubles. the casting is great, great acting. and the special effects ? well, some stunts are really impressive. watch it! :)

for a tv movie this was definately worth seeing. all the acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme. i have not read/seen the original and as a rule i can't stand shakespeare, but i enjoyed this movie(the civil war setting was very well done as well). dont expect to see an epic, however you should find it moving enough to enjoy. by the way (on a side note) don't compare this (or any other movie for that matter) to the original work. movies aren't supposed to transfer a book to the screen, but rather take the general idea of it a then adapt a story from it. when people say "the book was so much better" (they're usually wrong anyway) what they are really trying to say is the book was so different.

never having read or seen the bard's original work, i can't begin to compare this work to his story. so i won't. instead i will just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects (and some that looked a little lower in budget, but still decent enough to enjoy). i thought all the primary actors did a fine job performing. the style of magic seemed more black than white and is almost certain to offend anyone easily upset about that sort of thing, but i thought it was well done.

...but it's still an entertaining tv movie. the transposition to the civil war makes a nice change of pace, and adds a few subtexts (such as ariel's servitude to prosper/prospero) that you might not otherwise see. thankfully, they didn't try to make it a mini-series: at 90 minutes, it's just about right.

this is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more. a mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it). but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold. it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work. a very rare type of film these days - it holds the attention and stirs the emotions without abandoning artistic integrity and succumbing to manipulative, superficial shortcuts.

can't grade this very well, because i can't say i liked it. but it is the story that bothered me, not the realization of the film. the acting, directing, atmosphere, music were all good. it's just that after you see a bunch of people doing things you can't truly relate to, the movie ends. it is educational in the way that it shows the horrors of war as seen from home and the way feelings don't need to make any sense at all and still be strong, but that's about it.the plot covers a period of a few years in which the poet dylan thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex-girlfriend. he is married, brings his wife and later the kid, while the ex (knightley) marries some other guy. but the tension is there, dylan is a self obsessed jerk and the new husband comes back home from the war with a slight case of ptsd. add in some pretty temperamental characters and you have your hands full.bottom line: you have to be "in the mood" to like this film. the hard part is defining this mood. i don't think i've ever been in it yet. ever. so it is probably better watched by adults with a grasp on weird complex human behaviour and maybe a curiosity about dylan thomas.

although i am very familiar with poet dylan thomas, i know nothing of his life. whatever his life and specifically his marriage involved, i would imagine that the edge of love (based on the novel) manipulates things a bit, but unless you are a historian or a poet, who cares.the movie is less about thomas and more focused on the two most important women in his life. one is his wife kathrine, and the other is vera who was his first love. one romantic night on the beach as youths is something that both have tried to put behind them but cannot, now grown up they are good friends. i forgot to mention that this is set during the war. vera becomes engaged to captain will killing who he gets her pregnant and leaves for war. while he is away, vera starts to fall for thomas again, and kathrine has fallen out of love with him. she is also carrying another man's child. things get even more emotionally complex when capt killig returnsas you can see, it is a very soap operatic plot, and it takes shape in a fairy drab slow manner, with perhaps one too many sequences of sappy dialogue. but all is not lost yet. for a non- hollywood production, i think that the edge of love is about as stylish a picture as one can get. it is certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about 90% of contemporary romances, hollywood production or not. some of it has to do with being set during the war, which sets up emotional conflict that feels more convincing and less artificial, a bit like atonement. this one features acting and cinematography of equal talent to joe wright's oscar nominee, but it is in far greater need for stable pacing and progression. things are okay at the start and finish, but the middle section is where your attention span may be tested, unless you are deeply and profoundly rooted in the story. i doubt if the edge of love will have that kind of an effect on the viewer, but is a good film to check. it might even make a good date night movie, considering it is so much smarter than the chick flicks that boyfriends are forced to endure today.

given that dylan thomas is an icon of modern anglophone poetry i expected a movie that would be prone to a hagiography of the subject. on the contrary the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible, a drunkard, a bad father, a lier and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward. of course one could argue that all those things are an advantage when some one is an artist and especially a poet since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality but still i do not thing that a positive role model could crop up from such a bundle of personality traits. any way i found the other male hero of the story captain cillic a more endearing character. the two female roles were played by actresses knigtley and miller and were truly charming especially the first when she performed songs in slim outfit to inspire bombarded londoners during ww2. another good point is the role that sexual jealousy plays even in relatively progressive milieus that think that age-old conventions can easily be surpassed.the atmosphere of the blitz was also convincing as well as the portrayal of the distinct outlooks among people who have experienced war as opposed to those who talk about it theorizing on it's possible political outcomes.i think one would recommend such a movie.

this is primarily about love in wwii, yet we must remember that it's also a biopic for dylan thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life.the movie's timing is just great. it really captures what i think would have been the spirit during those times; smiling and hoping you're not going to get bombed. while it may prove boring to some, the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it.at one point, my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax. it really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors. cillian murphy is on fine form here, as is matthew rhys. both are polar opposites and it makes for an interesting watch. the relationship formed between sienna miller and keira knightley's characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank (and watch out for a cameo by suggs of 'madness'). despite all of this, it's a rather slow movie. coupled with the fact it's just shy of two hours, it's quite a slog to get to the conclusion.overall, it's a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of well-known british names behind the scenes. but it really does drone on for too much at times. still, a worthwhile watch. 7/10

'opera' (1987) director: dario argento (deep red, suspiria) screenplay: dario argento and franco ferrini (the church, sleepless, demons) photography: ronnie taylor (a chorus line, sleepless) music: claudio simonetti (phenomena, 'goblin')story: betty (cristina marsillach) is the lady macbeth understudy of a very stylized staging of verdi's macbeth opera. betty's time to shine comes when the diva star breaks her leg before opening night when she is hit by a car running away in a tantrum. the famous curse of macbeth takes a more sinister and calculating turn when right away the body count begins to rise. it seems betty gets her first fan via a stalker who ties her up and tapes needles to her eyes to force her to witness the grisly murders of the people around her. story: 3 of 5acting: acting in a lot of these italian films can sometimes be hard to judge. english, italian, french, german, spanish can sometimes all be in the same flick as they usually speak their native languages making dubbing rule of thumb and hard to judge. i usually cut them some slack in the area as a result. acting: 4 of 5 direction: giallo maestro argento enters again the genre helped pioneer. 'opera' shows him at the top of his game with an exquisite blend of gore, tension and beauty. direction: 4 of 5visual: this has to be one of argento's best looking films. gorgeously filmed by taylor, 'opera' features some stunning and inventive camera-work that keeps the film running fast and hard and keeps the eye-candy coming. the camera always seems to be in notion whether it is a wonderful shot of the camera going up a spiral staircase or a sequence towards the end of a bird's eye view of said bird circling the crowd at the opera house. visual: 5 of 5audio: frequent argento collaborator simonetti (through his various bands goblin, demonian and solo effort) compliments the screen action with zeal as his score touches from the classical (verdi) to metal musings (with a little help from brian and roger eno and bill wyman) and lends music muscle to the screen's bloody gristle. the sound design give you all that you need from stabbings to gunshots, fire to screams and masterfully remastered on the anchor bay disc in glorious 6.1 for every crunch and caw. audio: 5 of 5technical: the editing keeps the film flowing and moving wonderfully. combined with the camera-work, the editing help keeps the surreal dreamy imagery flowing. the exquisite opera house is one hell of a location and perfect for staging the horror version of macbeth. one can't end a review of an argento film without having to comment on the kills. argento dispatches characters with glee this time around with a brilliant stabbing sequence, crow eye-gouging and the film highlight of a gun blast through a keyhole into the eye and out the back of the head shot that once again sends argento's ex-wife daria nicolodi to the movie morgue. priceless! technical: 5 of 5wrap-up: a nearly flawless giallo that suffers from a slightly unnecessary epilogue in switzerland that delivers all the visual thrills that argento fans crave.overall: 4 of 5

dario argento is a filmmaker i'm slowly getting into, following the iconoclastic efforts of deep red and suspiria; he's not a filmmaker to always care directly about silly things like "plot". that might be his one minor (but, for me, apparent) liability: he won't let a little thing like common sense screw up his plan for his elaborate killing sequences, as his killer(s) can go through any kind of elaborate set-up of being invisible, until revealing past the point of the pov tracking shots of said psychopathic killer. but it's thrilling to see a filmmaker take chances like this anyway, of a pure italian aesthetic making its way into the soul of a hitchcockian warp (in fact, as a note of interest, if one has recently seen the scorsese short film where he took three pages of an un-filmed hitchcock film, which also took place in an opera, argento had it beat by almost twenty years, probably with no knowledge of the text). it's also unabashedly 80s (cd players and heavy metal and the hair, oh my!) and with an absurdity that makes it all the more palatable to swallow.the story is simple: an opera of macbeth is being produced, with high-stylized pyrotechnics and trained ravens. there's even a talented up-and-coming star replaced at the last minute, betty, played by marsillach. but a murder occurs during the premiere- interrupted not by that but by a falling light- and now the killer is after betty! she can't go to the police (how can she let out that the opera is really cursed?), but will that matter in the face of a killer who won't let up? one has probably seen premises like this played out in other argento films- girl being chased by a killer- but it's how argento, like de palma, constructs and executes his sequences, and adds a distinctive flavor of his own to add touches of bizarre humor (the breakout of the ravens to attack the killer, and the subsequent version of pointing out in the lineup), a kind of over-stylization ala leone (the bullet through the peephole through the door probably inspired a similar shot in kill bill 1), and even sado-masochistic inspiration with the pins taped to betty's eyes, more than once! argento puts his actress through the wringer, and she's all game for it, even when things seem to just go into 'what-the-hell' territory (i was throwing up my hands almost saying i give up when she is led down the secret passage by the little girl, as if suddenly we're in aliens now). and through such dark genre material argento keeps the violence thick and fresh, the suspense about as much as that with opera music coming right out of a speaker of a stereo system, and a cinematographer who may have had a few drinks (and rightfully so!) during some scenes the way they're shot and vibrate to a heart-beat. it should be considered trash, but it's elevated past any limitations of the genre by the ballsy attitude of the director, this in spite of a silly ending- sillier than anything that preceded what came before it (thanks little lizard)- and an attempt to break the macbeth curse, which, unfortunately, didn't seem to happen in real life on the set of opera. 8.5/10

i consider myself a casual fan of dario argento. for every really good flick by him (such as "deep red" and "tenebre"), there seems to be one that's equally uninspired (his output since "opera" has tended to disappoint). still, there's no denying that when he's at his best, there are few horror directors who can top him. i consider "opera" to be argento's finest work.this is definitely the film where all of his trademarks are present. there's no well-developed characters and the plot makes very little sense once you begin to scrutinize it. still, think of argento as an european equivalent of brian depalma - the style is all that matters here, so much it becomes the substance. typical to argento, there's some beautifully filmed murder sequences. those unfamiliar with the man's work may perceive that as a sadistic remark (and it may be, considering the often time misogyny of them), but its really true. argento stages murder with an intricacy to eye-popping visual detail. he truly makes graphic violence an art form. plus, his direction and the look of his films is impeccable.fortunately, "opera" is one of his most frightening products. argento is the only director whom i feel booming rock music works well for horror sequences (when others attempt to pull it off, it comes across as cheesy). the acting varies, with cristina marsillach playing a beautiful and reasonably sympathetic but never particularly animate young opera performer. the rest of the actors are workmanlike and get the job done, but again, with argento, the acting is never the point. its the beautiful colors, the terrifying violence, and the overall fever dream / nightmare atmosphere. (9/10)

one of his lesser known films, many horror fans have yet to catch this dario argento offering, which is unfortunate. it is underappreciated mostly because of the fact that really not enough people have seen it. the film boasts grade-a argento gore, with his customary close-ups set to savage rock scores. while it true that this script is not very complex, it is not nearly as bad as other entries in its genre, or his own personal resume for that matter.this movie symbolizes more of the 'dread' that he likes to portray in his films by his own admission. worth a good look on any night.

no matter how much it hurts me to say this,the movie is not as good as it could have been.maybe i was misled by the countless exaggerated reviews here on imdb,but i expected so much more...sure,the idea is a good one,the violent scenes and the camera-work are outstanding,the imagination of genius dario is breathtaking, but the movie is "soiled" by a couple of mistakes that i find unforgivable. first of all, am i one of the few people who feel that the heavy metal music played in the most intense scenes simply rips the atmosphere apart??? with a different kind of music (goblin????) during the "needle" scenes,it would have been soooo intense!... instead,the soundtrack destroys any chance for tension... secondly, the final killing scene and the last few moments of the movie are simply silly and uninspired. i don't want to say "amateurish", cause i love argento's movies.the ending left me feeling empty.talk about a final impression! this is hardly what happens in most of dario's films! though,admittedly,suspiria also suffers from a rushed finale (even if most of it is brilliant)....in short,watch this movie,try to make the most of its good points,but be prepared for some bad ones as well. this is not a perfect movie by any means.

betty is as an understudy in a production of verdi's macbeth who is asked to go on when the diva is hurt in a car accident. however, in the grand tradition of "the scottish play", the production seems cursed with problems, not least of which is some madman slicing up the crew. unfortunately for betty, the killer seems to have special plans for her ...this is one of several must-see argento mad-slasher flicks, in this instance primarily for the extraordinary photography by the great british cameraman ronnie taylor. i haven't measured it, but i reckon around two-thirds of the shots in this film involve either pans, dollies, tracking or cranes - the sheer amount of camera movement is just astonishing and makes the movie ten times more exciting than a standard thriller. the imagery is wild and dizzying - closeups of the heroine's eyes forced open with nails, a swooping glide around an opera house from a raven's point of view, shots of the killer's brain squirming, a bullet fired through a peephole, a swallowed chain dug out of a victim's trachea. conceptually it's just amazing and could only be realised by this director. the movie isn't without some shortcomings though; the cast are variable at best - marsillach and barberini are both a bit shaky (and his dubbing in the english version is appalling, even by italian standards), although argento regular nicolodi is fun and charleson gives a thoughtful performance in a role that is more than a little autobiographical (a horror director much maligned for his remoteness and reliance on technique). the material is a nice three-way mix of the phantom of the opera, shakespeare and slasher flick, scripted by argento and his usual collaborator, franco ferrini, with shifty suspects galore and the usual disdain for boring expository scenes to explain what's actually going on. full of all sorts of different music - brian eno, claudio simonetti, bill wyman, puccini, and of course, verdi. the scenes in the beautiful opera-house were shot at the teatro regio in parma. for some bizarre reason the uk print of this movie has the alternative title terror at the opera.

often considered argento's last "great" film, this entry into the giallo canon is unquestionably better than any argento film that has followed it (though i have yet to see "mother of tears"), but to call it his last "great" film might be stretching it a bit.the directorial and stylistic flourishes - the hallmark of all argento films - is indeed present, with some of his sequences of suspense ranking up with his best (the "peephole" sequence is especially memorable), and the cinematography by ronnie taylor is outstanding (the fluorescent lighting is beautiful).however, the narrative - which is hit and miss in all of argento's films - is missing here. there is indeed a potent sense of mystery and intrigue, but the plot resorts to what is essentially a string of murder sequences, with one following the another, leaving no real time to fully construct a right, focused mystery to be solved. all of this results in a climax that is... well... anti-climatic, as the film did not invest enough interest to make us truly care.regardless, this is recommended simply due to the masterful direction and beautiful imagery that argento evokes. i wouldn't' recommend this as a starting point for argento's films, however (for that, i would recommend either "deep red" or "suspiria"), but if you enjoyed those, or even any giallo, then this is a very good addition to your viewing repertoire.

i did not expect to enjoy this. in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasn't credited. knowing dylan thomas, and really being appreciative of his poetry but aware and rather disconcerted by the man, i didn't feel i needed to see a twee adaption of his lame bohemian life laid bare. and this was not it. critical and yet appreciative it was. it made me cry. kiera knightley was superb, even with that slightly strained welsh accent,and it is a sad tale that they tell. dylan thomas is not the hero as sadly he was not throughout his life and neither really are the so called 'feisty woman' of the pr spiel. it is cillian the william of the movie. a man that leaves the woman he loves to fight a war that they ignore. his challenge to reoonnect with that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance from that actor. i thiink this film is underrated because it was marketed so badly. dylan thomas fans will expect something more from their so very flawed hero and get less, and well that is how it was marketed. it is not a film about dylan thomas and it is much more interesting for it.

horror-genius dario argento is one of my personal favorite directors, and his films "suspiria", "phenomena" and "profondo rosso" range high on my personal all-time favorite list. "opera" of 1987 is yet another tantalizing and brilliant film that no horror lover can afford to miss, and that will keep you on the edge of your chair from the beginning to the end. this stunning and ultra-violent giallo could well be described as the master's nastiest film, which is quite something considering that argento's films are not exactly known for the tameness of their violence. the violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes opera a film censor's nightmare.- warning! spoilers ahead! - just when betty (christina marsillach), a young opera singer, is becoming successful, a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath starts stalking her... the murders are truly brutal, and of particularly sadistic nature. the killer attaches needles to the tied up betty's eyelids, so she has to keep them open and watch while he brutally murders people close to her in abhorrent ways. when done with the butchering, the killer releases betty and leaves, just to come back for other friends of hers...as usual for argento's films, the violence is extremely graphic and very stylized. "opera" truly is a brutal film, and what a stylish and atmospheric film it is. this film is absolutely tantalizing and pure suspense from the beginning to the end. the performances are entirely very good, especially christina marsillach is brilliant in the lead. a stunning beauty and great actress alike, marsillach fits perfectly in her role of the talented singer, whose fear and horrid experiences are slowly making her crazy. other great performances include those of ian charleston as a horror film director who is directing an opera, and director argento's real-life girlfriend daria nicolodi, who has a role in many of his movies. the camera work is excellent as in all argento films and the huge opera house is an excellent setting that contributes a lot both to the film's beauty and its permanently creepy atmosphere. the score, which is partly classical music and partly heavy metal is great too, even though i slightly missed goblin's brilliant progressive rock soundtracks that are such a distinguishing element of most other argento movies. "opera" truly is a terrifying and absolutely breathtaking giallo experience. this is an absolute must-see for any horror lover, and i highly recommend it to any other film-fan who is not too sensitive when it comes to extreme violence. excellent and absolutely tantalizing!

beware the scottish play! in his riveting and harrowing opera, dario argento returns to classic form, regaining the composure he lost while filming convoluted and delirious psycho- shockers like tenebre and phenomena. indeed, predicated on a simple narrative that is offset by opulent set pieces, imaginatively brutal murder sequences, and refined photography, the film feels like the argento we once knew. opera's only real infraction is its lack of a score by goblin, who provided unusual, iconic, and timeless music for many of argento's greatest films (the opera selections used here are wonderful, however).the production is filled out by several competent actors. while she's no jessica harper, annabella sciorra lookalike cristina marsillach manages enough pluck and compassion to grasp the role of the tortured heroine. ian charleson is interesting as horror-film-helmer- turned-opera-director marco. and daria nicolodi is fantastic as always, even in her relatively brief role (watch the making of featurette on the dvd for a hilarious interview with nicolodi about her role -- clearly brash and resentful over the end of her relationship with argento!) fans of stage fright (another excellent 1987 giallo, directed by michele soavi, who served as the second unit director for opera) will barely recognize the final girl from that film, barbara cupisti, as a stage manager here (i think it's the glasses that do it).with me, it's often the little things that matter, and argento's fascination/obsession with solitary nightmarish images makes him my ideal filmmaker. opera is full of minor details that left me smirking. for instance, i love that we never see "the great" mara czekova's face. i also love the scene where the killer is scraping the tip of his/her deadly sharp dagger across a television screen showing betty's performance as lady macbeth. finally, i defy even the most grizzled slasher veterans not to cringe as the "pin grates" are placed over betty's eyes.in short, opera is a clean, tense, and taut thriller. with its solid performances, lucid focus, and literate cinematography, it begs to be in the same league as deep red and the bird with the crystal plumage. might opera be the last great giallo?

being both a dario argento fan and a phantom of the opera fan, i was dying to see his first take on the story, before the so-bad-it's-good "dario argento's phantom of the opera". the film is just terrific, even the plot, which here is one of argento's best at a coherent story. the way he turns a classic romance story into a creepy slasher is just terrific. the film has a very nightmarish feel, which helps on keeping you on the edge of your seat. the colors have never been better in an argento film since the jaw-dropping "suspiria". the murders are clever and gory, all done in argento's trademark style. the thing with the eyes in this film is just unsettling, and done some much better than in fulci's splatter. the acting is so-so, but once you seen the movie more times you understand the characters' motivations better, and you get used to it. my two biggest complains about it is the use of rock music. i think it was a clever idea to mix beautiful opera fragments with heavy-metal, but it's not executed very well here. the ending is very disappointing, which is the worst thing about the movie, seeming to echo argento's previous "phenomena", but done terribly, it just didn't need to end that way. the same thing happened in the director's cut of "the exorcist". i wished they kept the original ending. but still it's a fantastic motion picture and really a must-see, if only for daria nicolodi's memorable murder sequence.

an opera diva has an accident, which leaves the door open for her understudy to take over the role. betty (marsillach) is now the star of mac beth, but someone hiding in the trenches has an opera of his own planned out. he gets his kicks out of tying betty up, putting needles under her eyes (so she cant close them) and murdering members of the opera company before her very eyes."opera" is certainly one of argento's more ambitious films, like mixing it up with shakesphere's macbeth there is of course the fact that the opera performed in the film is giuseppe verdi's version of macbeth but also argento, just like shakespeare uses ravens as an omen of death and misfortune. and like the ravens circling the castle dunsinane, foreboding the demise of the scheming macbeth, the ravens in opera play a key part in the downfall of the killer. furthermore just like in the old play the murderer acts on the exhortation of his lover. but i don't want to go as far as saying opera is intended to be a remake of the either the phantom of the opera or macbeth, the similarities are far too subtle. it's just a typical argento masterstroke, and with it he gives this otherwise quite basic thriller a vivid hue of gothic mystique.although this movie does have it downsides like the heavl metal soundtrack just doesn't fit in with this movie and the final scenes in this movie are a bit strange.all in all "opera" is something of a flawed masterpiece but still good.

after the lead actress of the opera is killed in a car accident, her young understudy, betty, is brought to the forefront. that's very lucky for her, with one problem: she has an admirer that has decided he will kill all her friends and make her watch. what is his connection to the opera, and what is his fascination with betty? i love dario argento with every part of my body. and i'm not an orthodox fan, i think. many people, particularly critics, praise his earlier work ("suspiria" and "deep red") but really frown on later films, such as "sleepless", which i liked. my favorite, "phenomena", is usually vastly underrated. "opera" tends to fall somewhere in between. some consider it one of his last great films, others see it as part of his so-called decline. i loved it.the picture is crisp, the music is great (unlike other critics, i love the metal soundtrack), the female lead is someone i can feel for (not unlike jennifer connelly from "phenomena"). and the imagery... wonderful. great cinematography, and some amazing kill scenes. the concept of taping needles to a person's eyes so they cannot blink... brilliant. my assistant tina thinks this looked fake, but even if it does, the idea is more than enough to pay off. and some great effects, like a knife blade coming up inside a man's mouth? awesome.jim harper calls the film "stunning" and calls attention to the "innovative cinematography, well-constructed shots and exceptionally violent murders." i agree with this completely -- one shot follows the camera through winding tunnels, and there is a very interesting visual use of crows throughout the story. mike mayo likewise calls it "visually fascinating eye-candy" and lauds the "crisp editing and flowing camera-work". it's really a wonder that this is not one of argento's more highly-praised works.argento returned to the opera with "phantom of the opera", which was a bit of a failure despite the casting of his daughter asia and julian sands. even more interesting, this same year offered the release of michele soavi's "stagefright", which (like "opera") has a killer loose inside a theater killing off the people involved with the presentation. both are great films, with soavi's more on the slasher side. (soavi actually served as second unit director on "opera"... you can make your own conclusions.) my only complaint with this film is the length and pacing. while it is very beautifully shot and the kill scenes are glorious, they are not as frequent as they should be. the first one takes over a half hour, and then we get down times between them. the lead actress should be in constant terror, but she is given time between kills to calm down as if everything is normal again. not cool, dario. we need to keep the suspense low and the intensity high.

even if it's not labeled as a slasher flick, it has all the elements. the fact that slashers are well known for it's low budget, lame plot, cheesy effects, and everything you may add, it doesn't means that there can't be good slasher movies. "opera" fills the description. even though it's part of italian giallo; which is far from being a slasher sub-genre.dario argento proves that he deserves the label of one of the best directors in horror. "opera" is one of the most stylish horror movies from the past 30 years. though the movie takes place in a beautiful, shinning place; the situations and gore turns it to be one of the scariest places ever used in a horror movie. i think of "opera" as a stylish slasher although there's in depth plot and character development. the cheese factor often used in most slasher flicks is not present here but in exchange we got a suspenseful, visually stunning gore tale. the movie's plot is simple (as in every slasher). there's a psycho in the opera that is somewhat obsessed with the lead actress/singer and forces her to watch gruesome deaths. the death scenes are extremely gruesome and are the best thing about the movie. the infamous "peep-hole" death scene is the highlight of the movie in my opinion. it's a terrific death scene that none other than argento could release. the knife through the neck (and mouth) is another gruesome scene but less violent than the scissors death. the gore in "opera" will please the wicked and lovers of violence.what i didn't like about the movie is the lack of coherence or logic. i mean, after watching the first death, the lead female, calmed as if nothing happened gets a ride home and doesn't makes much of a big deal about what she saw. also, she's left alone in home and doesn't take security measures. still, the suspense in the movie makes you forget the lack of logic. argento knows how to create tension and how to scare the subconscious. for example, when betty's friend tells her that someone was watching her from outside she freaks out and sets suspense in case that something happens. the direction of the movie is great. for an italian giallo it's excellent. argento's creative pov shots are impressive. the ravens also added a creepy feeling to the movie. argento add his unique spice. "opera" is one of the most underrated but popular through the horror community for these reasons, in my opinion: -the peep-hole death scene (brilliant) -the ravens attack in the end -the opera setting -the knife through the neck and mouth -the heavy metal score combined with opera music (this music never freaked me out before) -the killer's ferocitythe only thing i don't like about "opera" is the heavy metal songs used in death scenes. it's ok to disturb the audience but i think that the opera music could've added a creepier feeling. still, the "shocking" use of heavy metal is a singular disturbing aspect in the movie.watch "opera" even if you don't like gore. there's a lot of suspense and tension that could scare the most skeptical person. this is no "suspiria" but it deserves to be among argento's finest.

this film flopped miserably in the uk, and it didn't deserve to. the trailer of this film is slightly misleading, and i guess it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was "atonement: part 2". while the film was marketed that way to capitalise on the earlier success of joe wright's bafta-winning film, it's very different in tone. it focuses on an imagination of sorts of welsh poet dylan thomas' life during the second world war as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort, and his subsequent return to wales. director john maybury quickly introduces dylan's (matthew ryhs) childhood sweetheart vera phillips, played by keira knightley. she was dylan's first love in their homeland, but the moment has passed, and singer vera only wants it as a beautiful memory. or does she? vera unexpectedly strikes up a close bond with the other woman in dylan's life, "queen of ireland, love of my life, mother of my child" caitlin thomas (sienna miller). the three form a sort of menage a trois in war-struck london, but vera then falls for a dashing soldier, william killick (cillian murphy). they quickly marry, with killick leaving for war. a frightened vera convinces the thomas' to return witb her to wales, but the three are faced with the realism of the birth of vera's child, william's jealousy and shell-shock after returning home, and caitlin realising she cannot share dylan with her best friend.filmed on a low budget, this is more of a mood piece than anything else. it works best as a realisation that some memories and feelings need to be treasured but not renewed. the performance of sienna miller is particularly excrellent (unfortunately the paparazzi nonsense detracts from the fact thats she's quite a talent), and knightley and murphy are once again very good. the let-down is rhys as dylan, who, while the welsh poet himself was no bed of roses, lacks charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in dylan. the writing is very choppy, some beautiful moments interspersed with sloppiness. it's certainly worth watching, however.

keira knightley and sienna miller stars in the story of two of the women in the life of dylan thomas. knightley is thomas's boyhood sweetheart he re-encounters during the blitz. meeting at a bar they reconnect, however things become complicated when thomas' brings his wife (miller) along the next time he meets her. the women hit it off and things proceed at pace until the trio are joined by the man who will become knightly's husband. this further complicates things as jealousy begins to show its face.beautiful to look at, extraordinarily written and wonderfully acted (everyone disappears completely into their roles) this is a sumptuous feast for the eyes and the ears. it's so nice to see a film about adults being adults. on a purely visceral level i really enjoyed watching the film because the film is so artistically pleasing. rarely have i ever seen a film that is this beautifully crafted.the trouble with the film is i'm not entirely sure of everything that happened. something seemed to be missing and a couple of times i had to replay the film to see if i missed something. its not bad, but its not completely satisfying as a result. (i tried to look up on line to see how much of the film is true but i couldn't find anything) still i think this is a film worth seeing. it's a beautiful film for adults with probably the best acting the leads have done.

welsh poet dylan thomas excused from serving in active duty is doing his bit for the war effort producing bits of prose for some propaganda branch of government in whitehall.thomas is portrayed as a freethinker believing in free love married to a woman with an equally demanding artistic streak and likewise with a penchant for extramarital romance. thomas writing and reciting his poetry in systematic domestic mayhem throughout becomes somewhat priggish towards the end, resting somewhat uncomfortably on his society connections and pulling rank on a war veteran, who had shot up his house, and who was incidentally married to the woman he had been having an affair with.the real story of this film is the love of two women, one (keira knightley) whose first love was thomas (matthew rhys), the second (sienna miller) who is thomas's wife. at times it reminds of the singing detective, as in very good television with slightly sinister overtones laid on top of scenes of surreal camp absurdity.

where would hollywood have been without fredric march as robert browning or dennis price as lord byron, famous lovers in their day? even an actor as normally straitlaced as michael redgrave once brought some moody charm to a portrayal of w.b. yeats. writers' lives are an endless source of inspiration.but of all poets it was dylan thomas, the roistering, free-loving welshman who enjoyed a pint or two (and drank himself to death in new york at the age of 39), who was closest in spirit to the film industry. during world war ii, he produced scripts for british propaganda documentaries. he even wrote the screenplay of a vapid melodrama called the three weird sisters, in which three old maids in a welsh village plot the murder of their rich half-brother. all that is now forgiven.in john maybury's the edge of love, thomas is played by the welsh actor matthew rhys. it's not a full-scale biopic. the film covers four years in the poet's life during world war ii, when he lived with two women: his wife caitlin (sienna miller) and a former lover vera phillips (keira knightley), whom he met again by chance during the war. it seems he loved them both. the relationship of these extraordinary women -- to thomas and to each other -- is at the heart of maybury's absorbing film.how it came to be made is a story almost as remarkable as that of the lovers themselves. rebekah gilbertson, the film's producer, is the granddaughter of vera phillips and william killick. william, a war hero (played in the film by cillian murphy), married vera while she was still in love with the poet. gilbertson was inspired to make the film when she discovered a book about her grandparents, dylan thomas: a farm, two mansions and bungalow, by david thomas, describing their tangled lives. sharman macdonald, who wrote the screenplay, is the mother of knightley. the part requires knightley to sing, and her mother included songs especially for her. surely no film with such felicitous family connections deserves to do other than succeed.we begin in london during the blitz. bombs are falling, sirens are wailing, and phillips is singing to sheltering crowds in an underground tube station. in a pub, by chance, she meets thomas and discovers after all these years that he has a wife and child. phillips and caitlin form a friendship untroubled by jealousy or rancour and are soon sharing beds and bathtubs, listening to thomas read his poems, exchanging intimate secrets and smoking their heads off, as everyone did in wartime. caitlin turns out to be more experienced in the ways of the world ("my first was augustus john, he seduced me when i was 15"). but it's the refined and soulful phillips who stirs thomas's deepest responses and eventually succumbs to his charms. in the meantime, she has reluctantly married killick, who has seen her in the tube station and been instantly captivated by her beauty (if not her singing).it is an intense and strangely beautiful film, though thomas himself may be its least impressive character. he is best remembered for under milk wood, his verse radio play about a day in the life of the mythical welsh village of llareggub, whose name spelt backwards was not something polite english teachers drew attention to. i once had a vinyl recording of richard burton reading the poem (he appeared in a film of under milk wood in 1971), and i've never forgotten the creamy, seductive quality of his voice. the legendary charisma, the magnetism of the man, is something i missed in rhys's performance. thomas comes across as a strangely pallid, even secondary, figure compared with the women in his life.in his previous film, love is the devil, maybury explored the turbulent life of painter francis bacon and his sadomasochistic relationship with his lover and model, george dyer. the edge of love seems to me a richer and more satisfying film. if you ask what insights it offers into the springs of thomas's creative inspiration, i would have to say llareggub. but as an insight into his egotism, his smouldering moods and his general indifference to the feelings of others, it is wonderfully sad and revealing.thomas had a good war, boozing and writing while other men (including killick) were being traumatised by the horrors of battle. in one scene near the end, thomas's behaviour towards his friends seems unforgivably callous. but this is not, after all, thomas's film. murphy gives us a magnificent study in doomed passion and the emotional debilitation of war. miller is charming and pathetic as the wife. and knightley looks almost too exquisitely delicate to be real (as she did in pride and prejudice). but this is probably her finest performance. and in every respect the film is worthy of her.

with its ww2 timing, falling in and out of love, and easy on the eye kira, this is re-atonement. this a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of ww2. poet dylan thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky blitz london and later in windy wales. vera's ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share. an easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace. would work well with french subtitles but then i may have been to too many art house movies lately.

from the start of "the edge of love", the viewer is transported to the striking world of ww2 london. we follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie, an exploration of female friendship and the strains caused on it by marriage and infidelity. except one of the characters is named dylan thomas, perhaps the greatest english poet of the 20th century. and his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but at times truly despicable. this movie is based on thomas' writings about love and romance. these were adapted with a sharp screenplay by sharman macdonald (keira knightley's mother). the director, john maybury, does claim that the three other lead characters were actual people. all four are performed very strongly. sienna miller is dylan's wife, keira knightley is the cabaret singer vera phillips. matthew rhys is dylan thomas, and cillian murphy is william killick. the first section of the movie takes place in london during the nazi air raids, with vera being pursued by willaim, a soldier waiting for deployment. by a chance encounter, dylan meets with his first love, vera. from there vera meets caitlin, dylan's wife. while the three are drinking, william successfully breaks vera's guard. the film follows their lives as vera and william are married and he is sent to war. vera has become pregnant, and returns to wales with dylan and caitlin. there they face a gritty existence, with vera supporting dylan and caitlin with her husband's war pay. through these times, vera's and caitlin's friendship grows. so does dylan's infatuation with vera. she gives in. this creates the first test for the two women. when william returns from war, he barely recognizes his wife, and has no bond with his infant son. things get worse, as dylan idly watches his friend struggle with battleground fatigue (post traumatic stress disorder). william realizes something has happened between dylan and vera, and in a drunken rage shoots up dylan's house."edge of love" starts as a stylish romance in war torn london and ends in the stark, gritty life of motherhood, infidelity, and attempted murder in wales. the treatment of ptsd is well done, and should speak to an american audience. some day (see ending).each star has a great moment. miller when she is yanking out stitches in her head in response to her abortion of another man's child. knightley and murpy when he finally bonds with his son. oh hell, almost all their scenes are awesome. and rhys when he purgers himself on the stand to get vera's husband sent to jail. yet, the real star of the movie is jonathan freeman's cinematography and john maybury's direction. they seem to understand that no matter how good the story or how historical thomas is, this is a film dominated by two great actresses of our time. and they cherish their scenes with stunning shots. while this isn't best picture material, it is a very good movie (much more engaging than "the dutchess"). it has a visual lyricism that accentuates the use of thomas' poetry. also, this is clearly knightley's second best performance of her career, and perhaps miller's best. i have always had a weakness for the artist in struggle, whether it's hulce's mozart, or hoffman's capote. but i was stunned at how little sympathy i felt for dylan thomas. his struggles with alcohol are well known. but his antagonism of william and caitlin to gain possession of his first love vera makes him out to be.....a bad man.so is this academy award worthy? clearly no. at least, not this year. it will be released state side in march, 2009, making it ineligible for the academies. this is 9 months after it was released in britain. between atonement, miss pettigrew, and brideshead revisited, the us has had its fill of ww2 british period pieces. too bad. this film is better then the other ones, except atonement. but in this one, knightley's soldier does come back, but as a shell of the man who left her.
