i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film. while i am not at all a fan of british drama, i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made. i was in tears by the end of the film. every scene was mesmerizing. the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive.i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character.*******spolier alert******** i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance! ****end spoiler*****keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was sienna miller's performance that was truly oscar worthy.i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards.

felix in hollywood is a great film. the version i viewed was very well restored, which is sometimes a problem with these silent era animated films. it has some of hollywood's most famous stars making cameo animated appearances. a must for any silent film or animation enthusiast.

a gem of a cartoon from the silent era---it was re-discovered by cartoon network, and was broadcast for likely the first time in decades, if ever.what makes this so enjoyable are the varied cameos...douglas fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitos; will hays pays a visit as 'boss' of static studios; as well as appearances by chaplin, keaton, and william s. hart. the image of chewing gum decimating the shoes of the populace (a money-making idea for felix's near-bankrupt shoe-=salesman boss) cannot be described--it must be viewed. a terrific cultural gem.

errol flynn's roguish charm really shines through in this entertaining and exciting, but historically bankrupt biopic of the famous (and some would say infamous) general custer, that follows his career from his first day at west point, through the civil war and out west to the battle at the little big horn, all the while butting heads with rival arthur kennedy and romancing pretty olivia de havilland.some might say that flynn, who delivers a great, flamboyant performance as the general, is basically playing himself playing custer!a lavish production (that should have been in technicolor) well directed by raoul walsh, they died with their boots on features some truly well-staged battle sequences. also, it's a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse.the previous year, flynn played jeb stuart opposite ronald reagan's george custer in santa fe trail (also with de havilland), another action-packed warner brothers production designed to make you fail history class!

warner brothers tampered considerably with american history in "big trail" director raoul walsh's first-rate western "they died with their boots on," a somewhat inaccurate but wholly exhilarating biography of cavalry officer george armstrong custer. the film chronicles custer from the moment that he arrives at west point academy until the indians massacre him at the little big horn. this is one of errol flynn's signature roles and one of raoul walsh's greatest epics. walsh and flynn teamed in quite often afterward, and "they died with their boots on" reunited olivia de havilland as flynn's romantic interest for the last time. they appeared as a couple in seven previous films. this 140-minute, black & white oater is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action sequences, humorous romantic scenes, and stern dramatic confrontations between our hero and his adversaries. one of the notorious errors involves colonel philip sheridan who is shown as the commandant at west point before the civil war. indeed, sheridan was a lieutenant at this point. in fact, the commandant was robert e. lee as the earlier flynn film "santa fe trail" showed. another historical lapse concerns lieutenant general whitfield scott; scott was not the commander of union troops throughout the civil war. warner brothers presented custer as a drinker (probably because flynn had a reputation for drinking), but in real life custer neither drank nor smoked. nevertheless, these as well as other historical goofs do not detract from a truly splendid film."they died with their boots on" opens with custer riding into west point military academy arrayed in a fancy dress uniform with an african-american carrying his luggage and tending his dogs. after the sergeant of the guard realizes that he has turned out a honor guard for a future plebe instead of a high-ranking foreign general, the sergeant turns custer over to a ranking cadet ned sharp (arthur kennedy of "city for conquest") to take charge of him. sharp plays a practical job on custer by installing him in the quarters of major romulus taipe (stanley ridges of "task force") who promptly runs custer out. naturally, the volatile custer attacks sharp in a public brawl. general phil sheridan (john litel of "the sons of katie elder") is prepared to dismiss custer from west point for conduct unbecoming. as it turns out, sheridan cannot expel custer because custer has not enrolled. once he enrolls, custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with alacrity to fight and accumulate demerits galore. when the american civil war erupts, west point graduates cadets who have not completed their education and rushes them into combat. one of the last cadets hustled off to war is custer. avid as he is to get into the fight, custer encounters his future wife, elizabeth 'libby' bacon (olivia de havilland of "santa fe trail"), and they pledge themselves to each other, despite mr. bacon (gene lockhart of "carousel") who detests the sight of custer. it seems that bacon ran across custer at a saloon and insulted one of custer's friends and our hero reprimanded bacon.meanwhile, back in washington, custer desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment, but major taipe has him cooling his heels. custer befriends rotund lieutenant general winfield scott (sidney greenstreet of "the maltese falcon") and they share an appetite for creamed bermuda onions that becomes one of custer's characteristics. not only does scott see to it that taipe assigns custer to the second cavalry, but also custer appropriates taipe's horse to get to his command. during the battle of bull run, 21 july 1861, custer disobeys orders from none other than sharp, strikes his superior officer and holds a bridge so the infantry can cross it. wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital, custer receives a medal rather than a court-martial. when confederate general jeb stuart threatens the union army at the battle of gettysburg, in pennsylvania, scott is shocked by the chance that the south may triumph. when a brigadier general cannot be found, scott goads taipe into promoting the first available officer. a mistake is made and custer is promoted. incredulous at first, custer embraces the moment and cracks stuart's advance. after the war, custer idles down and starts boozing it up with the boys at the local saloons. sharp shows up as a crooked railroad promoter and with his father they try to enlist custer to serve as the president of their railway so that they can obtain funds. eventually, libby intercedes on his behalf with general sheridan, who was in command of the army, and gets him back on active duty as the commander of the 7th cavalry. when he takes command, custer finds the 7th cavalry a drunken lot and is not surprised that sharp commands the liquor at the fort. meanwhile, custer has his first run in with crazy horse (anthony quinn of "the guns of navarone") and takes him into custody. of course, crazy horse escapes, becomes custer's adversary, and they fight.once custer has quelled crazy horse and the indians, sharp with taipe as a government agent conspire to destroy a peace treaty with the sioux and other indian nations. they also see to it that custer is brought up on charges for striking taipe in a saloon brawl. on his way to washington, custer discovers the perfidy of sharp and taipe who have drummed up a gold strike in the sacred black hills. settlers rampage in and the indians hit the warpath. custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men at the little big horn in a slam-bang showdown against 6000 redskins. "stagecoach" lenser bert glennon captures both the grit and the glory. the long shot of the 7th cavalry leaving the fort at dawn is spectacular. as an added premonition of custer's imminent demise, libby faints after he leaves their quarters for the little big horn. "they died with their boots on" benefits from a top-notch max steiner score that incorporates the regimental tune "gary owen."

so keira knightly is in it...so automatically we compare this film to attonement. aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning, these films are totally different.the actors work well, i think one good thing is there is no memorable person, they are a team.if you want a film where things happen, then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physche's damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined.this film have genuine interaction, perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath. no its not exciting, but it is gripping if you can empathise with these characters. at moments i wondered if this film may have been better as a theatrical play rather than a movie. we expect a lot from movies as everything is possible, and yet with theatre we allow for interaction and rely on belief.there are things wrong with it if your looking for a blockbuster, if you look for nothing and allow the film to take you in, move you, allow yourself to forget these stars, and not to judge them as actors but let them become people, you will truly ind yourself moved.go on!! give it a go!

can you capture the moment? when first you hear rain on a roof? some things are beyond the sum of their parts, expressing the poetry of life. the things that matter.poet dylan thomas captured the seemingly inexpressible "a good poem helps to . . . extend everyone's knowledge, of himself and the world around him." (bob dylan named himself after him). so why has it taken so long to make a film of the great dylan thomas? a simple biopic could have missed the point. writer sharman macdonald has taken a different, better approach.in the edge of love, she creates the world of passions and complexities that fill the poems so we can swim in them. the lives of four friends. dylan, who lusts and loves to the full. wife caitlin (sienna miller), his feisty support. war-hero william (cillian murphy), who saves him from a street brawl. and then there's his childhood sweetheart. vera. dear vera. take your breath away vera. she's caitlin's closest friend. william's wife. and, like a muse, the 'star' in dylan's dark sky.it all kicks off in the 1940 london blitz, with bomb shelters in the underground. enter vera (an impressive keira knightley) under makeshift stage spotlights. she meets dylan for the first time again in years, her heart is flushed. their eyes shine through the smoke of the room. the purity of their former passion. dylan (native welsh-speaker, matthew rhys) is no sanctified, sanitised poet. master of his vices he must experience them all fully. he introduces his beloved wife then continues to woo vera.the edge of love is a visual treat. the soundtrack leaves you wanting for more. performances are possibly the best by these actors in their careers. as a lush love story it's pretty good. as an insight into dylan thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives, not bad at all. and as a tribute to a great man, inspiring.the production has been at pains to project the spirit of dylan thomas without compromising historical accuracy too much. dramatic tension involves a pull between artistic freedom and conventional morality. audiences looking for an experience based on the latter may be disappointed. and it will play less well to audiences whose boundaries are those of albert square.sharman macdonald seemed aware of the headstrong nature of artistic freedom and its limits when she spoke to producer rebekah gilbertson (granddaughter of the real william and vera). "think of all the things that you don't want me to write about," she said," because i have to have carte blanche." for macdonald, the limits were if she should cause offence to dylan's memory. but for many artists, especially men, the limits are those which wife and family could set on them. a woman is not going to let lofty ideals interfere with practical common sense issues, and will even put her children's interests before her own (this occasionally happens the other way round, as when towering genius virginia woolf refused to let loving leonard bring her down to earth - in the hours).in spite of the tension between caitlin and vera, these two women become closest buddies. it is one of the main (and very beautiful) themes of the film.the film's colours tell a story in themselves. in a drab, wartime britain, caitlin and vera are vivid highlights in an ocean of grey. shortly after meeting vera's lit-up-in-lights stage persona, we encounter caitlin through her searing blue eyes, sparkling in a darkened railway carriage. her dramatic red coat cuts a dash through streets of colourless homogeneity, triumphing on a beautiful staircase as she reunites with dylan. but vera's lipstick red brightness is less enduring. for her, marriage is second-best, even when she has become possessed with genuine love for her husband.outstanding cinematography extends to using montage to juxtapose images, in a manner similar to poetry's juxtaposition of unrelated words to create further meaning. horrific war scenes in thessaly are intercut with screams of vera in pregnancy. giving birth or is it abortion? we are not told immediately. pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present day.constant echoes of dylan's poetry throughout the film lead us beyond earthly opposites. it reminds me of marlon brando reading ts eliot in apocalypse now. a light beyond the horrors of the world. a different way of seeing things. "i'll take you back to a time when no bombs fell from the sky and no-one died  ever," says dylan to vera as they walk along the beach. elsewhere, caitlin recalls childhood with vera: "we're still innocent in dylan," she says.there's a time to leave your knickers at home or share a universal cigarette. (not literally, perhaps.) a time to be inspired. enjoy what is possibly the best british film of the year.

this was unusual: a modern-day film which was ultra-nice. in fact, it was so nice it bordered on being too hard to believe in parts. as i watching this based-on-a-real-life story, i was thinking, "nobody is this nice, this tolerant." mainly, i was referring to ed harris' role as "coach jones." i think they went a little overboard on his character, but that's better than the reverse: showing him worse than what he was in real life. odd to see harris playing the role, too, since he has a long resume of playing nasty, profane characters.anyway, i never complain about a nice, feel-good film, and it is nice to see a bunch of well- meaning, kind people. those folks direct their friendship, love and compassion to "james kennedy," better known as "radio," a mentally slow high school kid played by cuba gooding jr. the story takes place in the mid 1970s in south carolina. gooding does a nice job with the role, too. however, like sean penn's role of a mentally-challenged man in "i am sam," an hour-and-a-half of a character like this is plenty. after that, the loudness of those guys gets tiresome to hear.note: it was interesting in one of the documentaries on this dvd to find out that, in real life, in took years for "radio" to make his transformation, not months as shown in the film.

not much to it but a validation of small town values and the embracing of a mentally challenged young man into its heart.i read some of the reviews and was surprised at some of the hostility it engendered. i felt cuba gooding handled the part with dignity and respect unlike sean penn's drooling fool portrayal in "i am sam."the fact that this is based on a true story makes it all the more heartwarming. sports are taken seriously in small town high school america (and elsewhere, i suspect) and i felt the portrayal of these competitive students opening their hearts to one less fortunate rang true, at least for me.the coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and radio but rather came gently to the decision himself under radio's loving and open ways. very well done to all. 7 out of 10.debra winger, we need more of you in pictures!

corniness warning. as many fellow imdb users already know, i'm not a corny, cheesy person. if you don't want to read this kind of review, then go.to tell you the truth, you're hearing this from a man who laughed through titanic and almost broke his parents' tape from continuously rewinding the propeller scene.---spoilers---one day, i went off to the theatres with two friends to see dickie roberts: former child star, last year in august. the boring trailers rolled on until one started off so calmly. it was for radio. the moment i saw the trailer, i just had to see this movie on opening weekend. when that weekend rolled along, scary movie 3 was out too so many teenagers were there waiting in line that friday night. it turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie, they went and also sold out good boy and radio. i couldn't get a ticket and the following weeks, i was busy with more important things. about 5 months later, my friend rented radio. he let me borrow it and i watched it in my room. i'll tell you this now, this is the only movie i have ever seen that got me crying ever. when radio's mother died, it just came out automatically. the next day, i went off to blockbuster and bought the dvd.well enough of my stupid personal story, let me tell you about the movie.cuba gooding jr. stars as a mentally challenged man nick-named radio. ed harris co-stars and this movie is directed by mike tollin. based on a true story, radio is a teenager who has a life by spending most of his day alone. he goes around with a shopping cart picking up whatever he can and is always carrying a radio around. he's got his own collection. at the end of every day, he goes home to his mother. he never went to school until later in the film. one day, radio passes by the local high school while the football team is practicing. a football flies over the fence and radio picks it up and continues on. ed harris plays mr. jones, the football coach. they meet and this is the life of radio.throughout the whole movie, radio and coach jones spend quality time together, both teaching each other things. it is beautiful to see how the movie goes to the highest joys, the lowest lows, and just seeing radio live his life. you will laugh, cry, and live the life of radio with him. this movie holds a special place in my heart along with toy story and others. this is a must-see for the whole family, by yourself, or if you're someone who just wants a great drama. radio is one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen. radio will never be forgotten by me. never.as ed harris' character said greatly near the end of the movie:"we're not teaching radio, radio is teaching us."my rating: 8/10eliason a.

this is one of the best films i have ever seen! how anyone can knock this movie just befuddles my imagination! first of all, gooding's and harris's performances were simply spectacular, especially gooding. that is the only way i can describe the acting: spectacular! you have to imagine how difficult it would be to play a character like that and pull it off; then you see gooding, and his performance was magical. as for the plot, since it was based on a true person, it goes where the lives of the characters go. for all the action buffs, it might be a little slow, but then it's not an action film. i definitely give this movie a 10. it deserves nothing less!

excuse me!!! helloooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!! cuba gooding,jr. should have won an oscar for his portrayal in this film!!! he was the film! while the film may be lacking in some areas, cuba was awesome... and for me, this is the best role that he has ever played! the scene in the movie where he finds out that his mother has died made me break down and cry in the theater!! i guess i could really relate to this film because i saw the same treatment of people just like that at my own school growing up... what a tragedy! getting to see the "real" radio and coach at the end of the movie was really special too! if you can watch this movie and not be moved to tears, you need a heart check! if you liked "simon birch" and "the mighty", you'll love "radio" too! i wish they made more movies like this...radio is the real deal!

the fact that the movie is based on a true story contributes to a better and, of course, more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the movie. the story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps the viewer at all times from figuring the ending out. in one moment you think that something happens to coach jones or radio. well it does, but certainly not what you'd expect.the film becomes at no point boring or too sentimental and the acting performances by ed harris & cuba gooding jr. are some of their best in my opinion. the ending puts a long lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right. well i guess that was what michael tollin & mike rich were trying to do. first-class movie.esbjørn nordby birch. denmark.

spoilers !!! to understand what really happened first you have to be a warrior, to stay alive in real war, to think off-line,analytically,critically and not linear. otherwise you will come to false conclusions that maj.gray was dumb or unstable person. truth is something completely different. he was firm hardened veteran and only way he could be killed by capt. o'malley is that he wants her to kill him. it was his way out. he choose it. he was not man who will retire. if you've never been on a first line you can't understand it. he intentionally prepare his own suicide. first he seduced mary jane, than intentionally acted as a dumb, than stageed argue - shutting incident before witnesses (to protect her later after she done what he wants her to do if it comes to trial), than gave her son a bullets (to assure he could load her gun later), came that night, loaded her gun, woke her up, put her gun in her hands, acted as he was attacking her, after shot first time he raised knife and cried "one kill" so she shot him again and before died he put knife off like he was trying to took him back again after first shot. he also gave her a message with his last cry. "after first kill everything will change inside your mind and destroy your life, this is the the only way for me to die as a man, yet to be killed by somebody i love is my choice and my only prerogative, war and army is not what you thought so far, grow up finally and save your life till you can". she left military life at the end. she did understand him. and he did not die in vain. the man who helped him to prepare all that and after to carry out the trial and the outcome of that trial was col. sam doran with help of lt. tim macy. macy didn't know what is really going on and what will be the outcome but did what he was expected to do. he took photos of mary jane and maj.gray by order of col. sam doran who gave that order because maj.gray asked him to do that. after she refused to leave army (what col.doran asked her to do) col. doran convinced prosecutor to charge her with a premeditated murder (he knew she cant be found quilty) instead of manslaughter (there was some possibility to be found quilty) with taken photos. col.doran also suppress argue-shutting incident to escalate to prevent prosecutor to have any doubt about premeditated murder charge but let it be revealed during the trial what greatly influenced the jury. i have no doubt about outcome of that trial. why col. doran did that way? because he will do anything maj.gray ask him to do. why? because he saved his life on a battlefield. why mary jane choose to go to trial? because she was a person who have integrity, a principles. and that is why maj.gray choose her. it has to be somebody deserving, somebody honourable. keeping his secret about what really happened that night she also prove her honour.miroslav

this movie reminded me of the live dramas of the 1950s- not like the recent "failsafe", which seemed more of a stunt than anything else, but a true moral drama that is both engaging and thought-provoking. anne heche is more than credible as the army officer having an affair with her superior, played by sam shepard, and eric stoltz is wonderful as her lawyer defending her against the military establishment. i found myself waiting for their affair to begin, if only because they look so good together. this movie is apparently based on a true story, and it's a relief to be asked to think about real issues for a change. directed by christopher menaul, who also did the passion of ayn rand (with stolz) and the prime suspect series, this is a movie with panache and style and is absolutely worth seeing.

certainly this film has the ring of truth about it, as it purports to be based on actual occurrences at a marine base. it deals with the attempted cover-up by the local marine commander of unacceptable conduct by a marine major which resulted in his being shot to death by his former girl friend, a marine captain. the man and woman had been lovers, but the captain attempted to break off the relation when she discovered her boy friend was married. he continued to stalk her, going so far as to fire his side arm in her direction at one time. finally he broke into her home, attacked her with a knife, and was shot twice with her service pistol and killed. the civilian prosecutor ruled the killing self defense, but the marines decided to charge the captain with murder. the major, you see, was a decorated hero from vietnam, and an old friend of the commanding colonel at the marine base. the captain, too, had made some enemies in her motor pool command, rejecting some male advances in a very butch style.there is considerable psychological freight motivating and controlling the actions of the principal participants in this drama, which the very capable cast gets across nicely. the director and editor, however, seem determined to obscure the happenings as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and shifting points of view. you're lucky if you know where you're at most of the time. bear with them, though; it's a worthwhile story as the captain's court martial trial unfolds, and it seems every man's hand is against her, even her attorney at times. the verdict? well, after all, this is rather a suspense story, so you'll have to see for yourself. there is a kind of "pacifist" message folded into the film, but forget about that. sure, "war is hell", but sometimes it can't be avoided. we'll need those marines then, even if they aren't always the best champions of fair play internally. as kipling says in his poem "tommy atkins":"it's tommy this and tommy that, and tommy wait outside. but, it's room for mr. atkins, when the troopship's on the tide."

excellent cast, story line, performances. totally believable. i realize the close knit group that exemplifies the marine corps. but this movie brought fear to my heart. the marines let principles be damned. it seems that this film was based on real life incidents. it shows how difficult it is to go up against the establishment. anne heche was utterly convincing. sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering. and eric stoltz as her attorney was so deft balancing his loyalty to the corp but also his loyalty to his client, while high above on his tightrope. he knew what his true course of action had to be. but he was pulled apart by his immersion in the marine tradition, loyalty to the corps above all else. i sat riveted to the tv screen. all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.

the man who knew too much{1956}is a remake of a film that alfred hitchcock made in england in 1934 with the same name. in my opinion, his later effort is far superior. many critics and fans of alfred hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and doesn't have the spine tingling suspense of the original with peter lorre. in both films the plot is essentially the same, except the original is set in switzerland and the remake in marrakech . it tells the story of a married couple {james stewart and doris day}vacationing with their young son and meeting a suspicious man, that is very curious about their past. it just so happens, he's an agent that's looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leader.then he gets stabbed in a marrakeck market because of it being found out that he's a spy,and proceeds to fall into stewart's arms.dying,he tells him the whole story of the assassination plot.stewart and day then find out that another couple they met were the couple the agent was looking for and have kidnapped their son.the film contains excellent performances by stewart and day,in a straight dramatic role,as worried and frightened parents.this film proved that doris day could act in suspenseful dramas as well as carefree musicals.the direction by alfred hitchcock is top-notch.the film keeps you on the edge of your seat every minute.the scene in albert hall is a classic.the original is so slow-paced and drab.i don't know how people can compare the two.just watch the remake and you'll enjoy it.i give the movie a 9 out of 10.

a gem from japan, where so many of the world's best films are being made today. stylistically, this isn't anything all that special. it's just a simple drama (with some comic overtones) about recognizable people going about their lives. yuko tanaka, best known for voicing the character lady eboshi in princess mononoke, plays a 50 year old spinster. she's takes pride in her health, spending each morning in a vigorous workout as she delivers milk up and down the steep hills of nagasaki. after she is done with this part time job, she works her regular job as a clerk at a grocery store (called s-mart, which made this army of darkness fan giggle). along her milk route lives a 50 year old man, whose wife is dying. it turns out the milk woman and the man, a child services worker, dated in high school, and each apparently still have something of a crush on the other. the film actually has some major narrative problems. when the screenwriter actually wants the two unrequited lovers to unite, he uses a pretty unbelievable deus ex machina technique. the climactic sequence is also really forced. but most of the film is beautifully small and observant of the two main characters, as well as many side characters. the film also has several subplots that seem like they will eventually weigh the film down, but never end up doing so. i think the best thing in the film is tanaka's heartbreaking performance as the lonely milk woman, who has resigned herself to being alone for the rest of her life. whatever the problems were, the film mostly transcends them.

some people may call "cooley high" the same sort of thing as "american graffiti", but i wouldn't. for starters, in "ag", everyone was white, whereas in "ch" they're all black. moreover, this one has a motown soundtrack. specifically, the movie focuses on several working-class african-american students in 1964 chicago and their antics. the movie deals mainly with home life and relationships. in their apartments, we see that there's never any dad around. but these young men always know how to live life to the fullest.one thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible, worrying about missing school. two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene, and the one white guy in the movie. but overall, the main star is the soundtrack. it is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history (we even have it on vinyl here at home). a classic in the real sense of the word.

you want a movie that'll take you places? well this is a good pick. if you were an adolescent in the era portrayed in this film--the hayday of motown--or if you want to reach back and see what your parents made so much noise about, i suggest you pick up this flick and give it a watch. at the risk of sounding cliche, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll reminisce and remember. you'll go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight. you'll recall with fondness your best friends from school. it's a feel good movie with an edge of angst and pain and realism--misconceptions, losing friends, deciding what to do with your life. i think everyone regardless of race, age, socioeconomic standing can pull something from this movie and really enjoy it. so take a couple hours out of a lazy day and check out this film; there are much worse ways you could spend your time.

at the surface cooley high is a snappy ensemble comedy masquerading as a period piece (set in the early 60's, complete with a flawless motown soundtrack). but there's so much more to this film - it gets better every time i see it. the cast of unknowns (at the time) is excellent, and it is notable as an all-black-cast film that doesn't fall into any blaxpoitation clichés - at times cooley high almost feels like an updated, urban neo-realist film, with lots of edgy humor added in. at times, the rather tight budget does show, but the constraints actually serve the film well - there's a grit and honesty of emotion here that lends the film an immediacy lacking in most similar-minded films (like schultz' later car wash, which was more popular, but largely pointless) warm-hearted but also true-to-life, this might be one of the sleepers of the 70s - celebrated at the time, it seems that few film freaks know about this one today. their loss - this is a fine, fine film.the bare-bones pan-and-scan dvd (no widescreen!?!) is testament to just how little cared-for this excellent film is.

this film held my interest from the beginning to the very end with plenty of laughs and real down to earth acting by the entire cast. glynn turman, (preach jackson) is the star of the picture playing the role of a smart guy who likes poetry and had a very sexy girl friend. lawrence hilton jacobs, (cochise morris) was an outstanding athlete at the cooley h.s. and even won a scholarship to a famous college. there are scenes in this picture with the chicago police department chasing all these dudes in a cadillac and a visit to the lincoln park zoo with monkey dung being thrown around. the music is outstanding and there is great photography around the city of chicago. great film, enjoy.

the movie was very good when it came out, i attended cooley high and cooley upper grade center ,around 1968 i was also home coming queen and grew up and lived in the area of cabrini greens, i knew a lots of people in the movie, it was nice to see friends in the movie that lived in the area also, and they had a chance to be a star that may have been a once in a life time experience for them, i had good times growing up on the north side and tough times i can relate to the movie cooley high is no longer standing but a person like myself and others still remember the fun we had growing up attending cooley high, there is a lot of history around this north side area to be told .

cooley high was actually a drama with moments of comedy. it was a reflection of high school life back in the day. i attended coolidge high in washington, d.c. from 1976 to 1979 and much of what was in cooley high was an every day thing at coolidge. as a matter of fact after the movie came out everybody started calling coolidge "cooley high." getting high, shooting dice, chasing girls, basement parties, and fights, that sums up high school life for many in d.c. back in the day. i can't forget motown because motown music began and ended many a day back in the 70s. the hits just kept coming. however, cooley high adds a layer of humanity over the craziness because when all was said and done just like in cooley high my classmates and i had a lot of love for each other. and like the characters in cooley high there was life after high school, but there was nothing like waking up every morning and experiencing each day to the fullest from homeroom to seventh period. thirty years later we are getting ready to celebrate those good times. cooley high is definitely a period piece that just gets better with time because like it or not the only thing left from those days are memories, some good, and some bad.

this this coming of age dramedy set in chicago in the early 60's, we follow a group of highschool friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives. the two central characters are leroy "preach" jackson (turman) and his best friend richard "cochise" morris (hilton-jacobs.) both of these boys have promising futures. preach is a great writer but a lazy student, and cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball. when they're not hanging out at the local diner shooting craps with their friends, or hanging out at a friends house or chasing girls, they're skipping school, riding the trains through chicago or going to quarter parties on the weekends.things go wrong when preach and cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and go joyriding in a stolen car. the police pursue them and they are arrested. but thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher (snl's garrett morris) they are released. but the two hoods are not, and vow to get revenge on preach and cochise, thinking they blamed the whole thing on them.this movie is very episodic, but it still works because thats what life is, a series of episodes. some funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. the film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic, and the situations are all believable and relatable. like preach romantically pursuing a beautiful girl, or a party turning violent when some asshole decides to start a fight, or dealing with a bratty younger sibling. but even when a situation isn't personally relatable, like the guys pretending to be undercover cops to con a hooker out of some money so they could get all their friends into a movie, the sequence is still hilarious.'cooley high' was the basis for the classic 70's sitcom 'what's happenin!' which aired on abc from 1976-1979. even though the show is most famous for the character rerun, he is not in this film, nor is there any character remotely like him. the humor of that show was very broad, but still funny. the humor of 'cooley high' is truer to life, and thus more entertaining.additionally, the soundtrack is wonderful. classic songs from that period by diana ross & the supremes, the temptations, martha & the vandellas, and smokey robinson play throughout the film, adding to the fun, youthful, exuberant tone of the film.

...instead, watch it as a great coming of age tale about african american males in the mid 1960's in the ghettos of chicago. for all of you out there under the age of 50, "what's happening" was a light-hearted rather quirky sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted four years (1975-1979) concerning a group of young african american high school kids living in a working class neighborhood. i liked it a great deal - it just has no real connection to this film. "cooley high" started out as being the basis for "what's happening", but its serious nature did not register well with test audiences, so it was redone as a comedy, even though the credits on "what's happening" still read that it was based on this movie.this film starts out light, but touches many aspects of life unique to the turbulent 1960's and also some other aspects of growing up that are timeless. the guys deal with sex, betrayal, joblessness, hopelessness, and even early death. the ending is quite powerful and serious, and the film has a great motown soundtrack. highly recommended. unfortunately, this film is not new enough to be played on premium cable channels and not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and played in the few venues for those films either.

cooley high is considered one of my best all time movies. it certainly reminds me of days of my youth growing up in the cities of cleveland and chicago during the early, mid, and late 1960's. what ever happened to brenda and pooter? some one need's to track those two down. brenda for her beauty and pooter for his innocent wit. they both deserve to be recognized even 31 years after this film was debuted. i think a lot of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun filled movie. i certainly think this movie should be entered into some type of movie hall of fame. all of the cast of this movie was great. my opinion is of " cooley high " is turn back the hands of time, those were the fun years.

cooley high is such a great film that even with the period's sound track, urban landscape, wardrobe and slang...it still doesn't feel dated. the sound track by the way is a timeless classic in itself.instead it absorbs you right into it. that is a staple of a good movie. from start to finish it doesn't miss a beat and i never grow tired of watching it.it's ending is unique in the respect that it's one of the saddest and at the same time uplifting of all movie endings. there may have been a few since (backdraft comes to mind) but cooley was the first and much more emotional.

"cooley high" is one of my favorite movies ever!!! i think i saw this movie years ago on late night tv with my mother when i was little and i thought it was so funny. this movie was also referred to as a "black american graffiti". glynn turman is wonderful as preach and lawrence hilton-jacobs is great as preach's friend cochise. there are some other great characters in it as well, and this movie has a lot of humor packed into it. from the beginning of the movie where cochise goes to preach's home to get ready for school to the sad ending of cochise's funeral, this movie is one that will get you laughing all the way. there are a lot of scenes in this film that i like a lot. the scene where pooter (another one of preach and cochise's friends) go to the zoo with them and gets the gorilla's feces thrown on his shirt (very gross, but funny as well), the first scene in the street corner cafeteria, the quarter party at this girl's house which became a disaster due to a fight, and some others are wonderful to watch. this movie even has a wonderful companion soundtrack album, which is packed with a lot of wonderful motown hits and artists from the early 60s (only 6 songs on the soundtrack were done in '75, while the rest were from the '60s). the movie is mainly about two friends who dream about getting away from their impoverished and rough neighborhood after high school, but their futures seem almost out of reach, due to their innocent joy ride in a stolen car that two other hoods were responsible for, and preach's relationship with his girlfriend, brenda (played by cynthia davis) almost gets put in jeopardy. go out and rent or buy this movie, and be ready for a load of comical entertainment!!! get the soundtrack, too. it is a lot of fun as well!!!

this was the very first movie i ever saw in my life back in 1974 or 1975. i was 4 years old at the time and saw it at a drive-in theatre. i did not grasp that this would be a classic at the time (i went to sleep about twenty minutes into the movie). after seeing it on the television-along with two of my other favourite movies car wash (my favourite movie) and the wiz which seemed to come on every year about the same time all together-about 40, 50, 75 times i knew that here was a movie that i would have as one of my favourites. those three movies were the only live action shows that i could watch as a child. i would not consider this to be a blaxploitation movie but rather an urban interest movie.cochise and preach reminded me of some of my uncles especially the wild irish rose that they drank. my mother also told me about some of the quarter parties that she attended and that some of the things that occurred in the movie were similar in nature to what occurred in real life. if you are one of the two or three black people over thirty who hasn't seen this movie yet then i recommend that you buy the dvd right now. i'm glad that i was around to witness some of the goings on of the era.

read this:boyz 'n the hood is a scene-by-scene, complete rip-off of this movie.two friends in the hood, one's focused on intellectual pursuits and the other is an athlete. the friend who's an athlete gets involved with the wrong people and gets killed. (the athlete just happens to be washington from 'welcome back, kotter'.)it makes me mad that people don't know this. it blows my mind everytime i go into a video store and boyz 'n the hood is in the 'drama' section while cooley high is in 'comedy'. it's an embarrassing disgrace. this movie is both funnier and more dramatic than john singleton's rip-off. at least singleton could have had the dignity to speak out that his film was homage to cooley high, but no, he never said a word. boys 2 men, however, named their hit record after this film.

this film set the standard for african-american film excellence when it was made. i heard on various stories on the film through time, that there was a push for an academy award nomination when it was released. this film plays on various emotions, and you definitely feel for all of the characters. sure, some of the acting is a little wooden, but fortunately, those parts aren't pivotal. the music is sensational, and if you don't think the ending is a tear-jerker, you have no heart in your chest. if you watch "cooley high", you will see that many, many films have copied various elements from it in order to strengthen their own films. the biggest example of this is "boyz n the hood".

now, i am not prone to much emotion, but i cried seeing this movie. it certainly has more appeal among blacks than other ethnic groups, but there is something here for everyone. the classic song "it's so hard to say goodbye" really makes this one worth watching at least once.

i just watched this film this morning and i found it to be a great showing of the richness of faith. babette gave them another way to look at life; not a replacement, but an enhancement. she shared all that she had with those who gave what little they had to her. i see the story of god in here. he sent his only son to man. man could not possibly give anything that would equal that. so, for our small sacrifice, we are given an ultimate treasure and are transformed because of it. in this film the bickering townspeople have so consumed themselves with a small interpretation of god. babette showed them that life and god can indeed be beautiful in it's fullest sense. the love that god's son showed to man is the love we should show to one another and our lives will be the richer for it. even the film is a metaphor. it seems slow in the beginning, but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end. it was truly a feast.

i don't know whether this film hits my heart the way it does because of the feelings of friendship, love, closeness to others or the warmth of that transformation babette's cooking creates, but when the feast starts and for the rest of the movie, i choke up often. yes, this is a feel-good movie, but without a speck of mawkishness or facile sentimentality. please note that elements of the plot are discussed. babette's feast tells its story with restraint and care, and it lets us discover for ourselves the values of grace and love. all we need to know is that babette harsant (stephane audran) was a french refugee who was given shelter by two aging sisters in a tiny community on the coast of jutland. the sisters lead what remains of their father's flock. he was a pastor of conviction who taught that salvation comes through self-denial. the sisters made their sacrifices to duty and faith. those who still remain honor the now long dead pastor's teachings and his spiritual guidance. still, as they have grown older the tiny community has become querulous and argumentative. the sisters do what they can. for the pastor's 100th birthday, babette wishes to cook the dinner for the small group the sisters will invite. the sisters reluctantly agree, but when they see the supplies babette has ordered, they and their guests become uneasy. they are used to the community's usual fare of dried cod, boiled, and a soup made of bread, water and a little ale. even though babette over time has made improvements, what they are seeing now seems close to godlessness. at the dinner also will be a visitor, general lorens lowenhielm, who years earlier had chosen ambition over his love for one of the sisters. what do we experience? there is the austerity of the aging community's faith and the stone, wind-swept cottages they live in. there is the warmth by candlelight of the sisters' small, crowded dining room. and then there is the transforming power of babette's artistry as we watch her cook, watch erik, a young boy helping her, serve and pour, and watch the old parishioners, with the help of fine wine and exquisite cooking, gradually rediscover their community and love and friendship. the general serves as our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes they are eating. the general tells a story to his uncomprehending dinner companions, a story about a famed woman who was the exemplary chef at the famed café anglais in paris. "...this woman, this head chef, had the ability to transform a dinner into a kind of love affair...a love affair that made no distinction between bodily appetite and spiritual appetite." he, too, is being transformed into a man who will accept what he has become and yet will always know the value and the love of what long ago he chose not to accept. an old couple kiss. two old men remember past friendships. and babette, who spent all that she had won in a lottery on this dinner, has had an opportunity to be the artist she once was in france, an opportunity she accepted with love and friendship. babette, now as poor as she was when she arrived penniless years earlier, will continue with the sisters. the general in a carriage with his aunt returns to her estate. and the elderly guests leave the sisters' home to return to their own cottages. they pause and look at the clear night sky and the stars overhead. they spontaneously hold hands in a circle and dance and sing this hymn... "the clock strikes and time goes by eternity is nigh. let us use this time to try to serve the lord with heart and mind. so that our true home we shall find. so that our true home we shall find." they smile at each other. all has been reconciled. babette's feast is a wonderful movie, full of restrained emotion, unspoken understandings, wisdom...and, of course, a meal that will leave you with a growling stomach as you exit the theater. if you win a lottery so you could afford what babette created and have her skill and artistry, here's what she served: potage a la tortue (a rich turtle soup), served with amontillado sherry blinis demidoff au caviar (small buckwheat pancakes with sour cream and caviar), served with veuve clicquot champagne cailles en sarcophage with sauce perigourdine (boned quail stuffed with foie gras and truffle in puff pastry with truffle sauce enriched with madeira), served with clos de vougeot, a fine burgundy salade cheese and fresh fruit baba au rhum with glacee fruit and fresh figs coffee and a fine brandy

food always makes a good topic in movies, as "chocolat" showed. "babette's feast" is the same type of thing. babette harsant (stephane audran) is a french cook who flees her native land after the repression of 1871. she moves to a very religious danish village. the people in this village simply have no use for joy. that is, until babette cooks them one of her exquisite meals.it's not just that this movie deals with bringing fun to a place that has never known it. like other scandinavian movies (and non-hollywood movies in general), it shows that a movie can hold your interest without the use of explosions, car chases, etc. this is one movie that you can't afford to miss.one more thing. do you think that the danish word for "feast" sounds a little bit like "tastebud"?

marigold is by far the best "outsider's" take on bollywood i have ever seen. (i didn't grow up with bollywood, but i've seen a few hundred of them now.) i'd say it leaves gurinder chadha, mira nair, and even merchant and ivory (of bombay talkie) almost in the dust. willard carroll, the director, really loves bollywood, and he has the self-confidence to allow us to know it - there's humor, but no arch, ironic distancing, no "of course i don't really mean this" stuff. as jerry lee lewis would say, he "gets it," and so he can let us have it too - the joy of a bollywood movie experience, along with touches that are supplied by a westerner's stepping into the story-teller's role.it's a story about a caustic, bitchy, beautiful american b movie actress (she's only been in movies with numbers in their titles, like fatal attraction 3) who finds herself in a different bollywood movie from the one she went to india to be in (kama sutra 3 has folded its tents while she was en route, apparently because its producers are now in jail). salman khan, in real life a bollywood mega-mega star, is the dancing master of the delightful written-on-the-fly movie she has now been pulled into ("is this before or after i go blind?"), and through the sweetness of his mildly psychically gifted character, she learns more than how to find her inner ecstatic dancing ability.the strong beginning gives you both bollywood - a super-energetic troupe of dancers in front of the taj mahal (both funny an familiar to the western viewer, as well as providing the high-velocity musical thrill we love in a hindi movie), and salman on screen from the outset - no bollywood 20 minute wait for the hero. he has on an indian costume embellished with kit carson-style western movie fringe (all in white).ali larter's actress character is pleasing to the western viewer - she's blonde, which is "traditional" for a "white" person in a bollywood movie, and visually understandable casting - but she's a robust girl, not the ethereal kind of blondie we're usually presented with, and she's a more or less three-dimensional total bitch, carrying on profane and abusive cell-phone conversations with a boyfriend and agent in the us.we also have scenes of women who are having problems with each other going out to a bar to deal with them - the capacity for people not getting along to relate and have emotional conversations is traditional in hindi movies, but we seldom see much of any such thing going on between women (other than the discussion between mother and daughter about the daughter's choice of groom), let alone "strangers" - unrelated people - let alone bar-going. so the spirit is the same, the details are fresh, and i was completely delighted by this.i only saw it once, at a preview showing, attended by the director, a fine speaker and question-answerer - he and salman got to be "brother-like" good friends over the making of it, he loves india, he has plans to make a wizard of oz movie in india. i can't get too detailed about songs when i've seen them just once, except to say i liked them all. they range from a happy parody of the bollywood number in the movie-within-the-movie - the ladies' costumes, with leghorn hats and seashell-cased bodices (it's a beach scene) on flowy dresses - are worth the cost of a ticket alone -- to a lovely reflective many-scened romantic song in a sadder and more serious part of the movie.mix of hindi and english in the music, and it works.salman khan gets a lot of credit from me for openness to unusual projects - this and jaan-e-mann - and good judgment about which ones to be in. carroll said he was full of suggestions and ideas all along the way, and totally fine (i.e. not narcissistic at all) whether carroll accepted or rejected them - clearly just a pro who loves being involved and collaborating.

it's a unique film, as it gives us our only chance to see the young noel coward in all his ironic glory. because he seems so reserved & detached he's perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter-of-factly uses all those around him. however in the deadly serious (no pun intended) last act, when coward must make like the flying dutchman, he's much less comfortable.but his way with an epigram is peerless, and hecht & macarthur have given him some gems (macarthur, really -- he was the wit of the pair).the film is superbly lighted by the great lee garmes, but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence. hecht and macarthutr cared about one thing -- getting their dialogue on screen. (note: h&m themselves have blink-and-you'll-miss-'em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene).the most notable supporting player is the one and only alexander woolcott, notorious broadway columnist and close friend of both macarthur and coward, who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher coward.curious that woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary algonquin round table, of which he was a founder, and macarthur something of an auxiliary member.the scoundrel actually won an oscar for best story, though that victory is probably due more to coward's imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot. it's coward, woolcott, and the dialogue you remember...

i saw this film over 20 years ago and still remember how much i loved it. it really touched me, and i thoroughly enjoyed noel coward's work in it. highly recommended: atmospheric and touching.i think of this film from time to time, and am disappointed it hasn't enjoyed as much of a revival as many classic films. hadn't realized til i searched for it today that it won an academy award for best original story for ben hecht and charles macarthur.basically it involves a nasty character who destroys another's career and is cursed because of it. he dies, but is allowed redemption if he can convince someone to shed a tear over him. the bulk of the movies shows him in pursuit of this goal. well written and lovely. i had known him for his plays so i was surprised to see him in this role on tv late one night in new york. a must see if you ever have the opportunity.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** it's easy to see why the script for this film won an oscar. at least during the first half. my head was spinning from all of the snappy lines whizzing by. noel coward plays a new york publisher (`why don't you publish books that you like?' - `what? and corrupt the public?') who charms and manipulates his many hangers-on. then he dies in a plane crash and the story turns into a bizarre flying dutchman take-off in which coward must find someone who truly mourns him before his soul can rest in peace. very enjoyable until it gets bizarre. viewed at cinefest in syracuse in march 2003.

noel coward is perfectly cast as a suave, vain, selfish well educated, upper class publisher. the literary crowd that congregates at his office is equally lacking in depth and seems concerned only with their status and success. they constantly meet at noel coward's publishing office in the hope of gaining favor for their next book and to make sure they are not left out on the latest gossip in the artistic realm.cora is a young idealist and poet who believes her love can change noel coward and that they can establish a long lasting relationship. she ends her relationship with her fiancé to become noel's lover. however noel returns to his playboy ways after 6 months and ends the relationship. this breaks cora's heart and she eventually returns to her fiancé who has since lost his job and self respect after losing cora.the story picks up when noel coward leaves new york city by plane chasing after a new lover, a concert pianist who is just as shallow as he is. however a storm is encountered and the plane crashes into the sea killing noel. god takes pity on him and grants him one month on earth to find someone who will cry for him, otherwise he is condemned to wander the earth, never to find rest, for all eternity.the climax takes place on a dim, rainy night and ends with a prayer and a miracle. a strange redemption occurs. the death experience teaches noel the true values of life, although his former associate artists are incapable of understanding his message.the film has beautiful music and the scenes are classic film noir. unfortunately it is not on dvd or vhs. for those who enjoy this type of movie it is a classic masterpiece. noel coward's dialog is sharp and witty and no one could play the part better.

"the piano teacher" is all about huppert's character; a middle-aged classical piano instructor with a stoic facade behind which lurks a powerfully compelling aberrant personality. unsatisfying as a story but intriguing as a character study, the film follows the huppert character through the term of her anguished relationship with a pupil delivering superb performances in the process. not for everyone, "the piano teacher" will play best with those into foreign films and character-driven dramas dealing with dark issues. (a-)

this film is utterly amazing. from the performances of huppert, girardot, and magimel, to haneke's screenplay and direction there is not a single misstep. the film may put some people off with it's hard sexual subject matter and with it's slower pace, but it really is a masterful piece of cinema... so do not let it's challenging ways keep you away!powerful, and deserving every award it won in cannes!

be prepared for the trip to haneke's "la pianiste"...the psychological sickness of the main character, wonderfully played by huppert, goes beyond any limit you could expect. the most stunning part of it is that you start feeling compassion for the character erika. trash-sexuality (no nudes scenes though), perversion, masochism, incestuous relations...haneke gives us a crude meal, heavy to digest; sometimes, the only way you can escape the extremism of some scenes is to start laughing at it. the "mise en scène" is maybe not the most appealing part of the movie, it has obvious austro-germanic, sometimes scandinavian notes : static, long scenes, but never boring. the vienna settings, the french language used, make the whole look like a european blend. the permanent germanic music background (schubert) is beautifully chosen. above all, both of the cannes awards for best actors are well deserved: one of the greatest performance of the year by one of the greatest french actress ever.

yes, i felt like i had been gutted after first seeing it. but not until the next day did i begin to see the true brilliance of this creation. i won't repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film, but there is one new area i want to touch on... **spoilers** why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in the student's pocket? most reviewers have noted that it only reflected her cruelty and reaction to an unsatisfactory performance. i must disagree. watch the scene again. huppert is moved to tears as she watches her student playing on stage. the student is quite an expressive girl (crying & vocalizing her fears)- just the opposite of huppert's character. there is a scene later in the film, after the girl is injured, when huppert discusses the accident with the girl's mother. the mother, visibly upset, states "we gave up everything so she could study piano" and huppert immediately snaps "you mean she gave up everything, don't you."so it was my thought that huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from her own destiny. she didn't want the girl to end up like her, repressed & hardened, condemned to a life of recitals...gradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection. maybe she saw herself on the stage years ago, before things grew bad. maybe she wished she had escaped when she was that age. is she ruining the student's life, or simply freeing her?for me, that realization made all the difference in what i experienced through this film. brilliant.

this movies made me suffer and i loved it! loved it! it haunted me for days. i think erika is the kind of character you simultaneously loathe and lament. the most terrifying sex scene ever caught on film. this is the best of haneke's work so far. he is the only living director to redefine pace since kubrick. the violence in this film is gorgeous. in a word, the film is about self-hatred. in a sentence, the film is about trying to find love in order to stop hating yourself and finding that that is a hopeless hope.

reading through the comments, there seems to be a lot of nonsense about the emotional banality of la pianiste. i find this hard to comprehend given the outstanding performance by isabelle huppert. huppert is gripping - she manages to convey perfectly the woman on the edge, full of self-hate and delusion.the film is wonderfully paced and judged. it would be so easy to portray the lead as a ridiculous figure - consider the scene in the porn store for instance. somehow, huppert is able to carry it off, partly because of her brilliant performance but also because the director makes her surreal life real and identifiable.don't ignore this film. it is one of the most startling and engaging films (and performances) i have seen.trust boris!

if it is true that sadomasochism is a two-sided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites, then the cinematic portrait of erika kohut has its reality. professor kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself. her outward expression projects her desire. that is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse.along comes talented, charming, handsome young walter klemmer (benoit magimel) who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity. he wants to become her student so as to be close to her. she rejects him out of hand, but because of his talent the vienna conservatory votes him in. he falls in love with her. again she pushes him away, but he will not take no for an answer, and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of self-respect.the question the viewer might ask at this point is, who is in control? the sadist or the masochist? indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist? it is hard to tell. is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically, who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment, or is it the person who is rushing out the door, sated, giving the order that no one is to know what happened.but erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak. she is a sex extreme freak. she wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability. actually that isn't even true. she says she doesn't care what others think. she doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love. love, she calls it. for her sex and love are one and the same.at one point walter tells her that love isn't everything. how ironic such a superfluity is to her. how gratuitous the comment.the movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by michael haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified (as in the bathroom when walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find erika within). he also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another. this is particularly important in the scene in which erika, like a blood-drained corpse caught in stark white and black light, lies under her lover, rigid as stone. here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery. we don't need to see any more.the part of erika kohut is perfect for isabelle huppert who is not afraid of extremes; indeed she excels in them. i have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul. like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense. what matters to her is the performance and the challenge. no part is too demanding. no character too depraved. it's as if huppert wants to experience all of humanity, and wants us to watch her as she does. she is always fascinating and nearly flawless. she is not merely a leading light of the french cinema; she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work.i think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in the lacemaker (la dentellière) from 1977 when she was 22 years old. there she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing pomme, a parisian apprentice hairdresser. her character was shy about sex and modest--just an ordinary french girl who hoped one day to be a beautician. here she is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and entirely depraved.huppert is fortunate in being an actress in france where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets. (hollywood could never make a movie like this.) in the american cinema, only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty. huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range, but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles, here and also in la cérémonie (1995) in which she plays a vile, spiteful murderess.do see this for isabelle huppert. you won't forget her or the character she brings to life.

overall i found this film good: exceptional acting with disturbing scenes (some essential, some useless) and weak second half. contains spoilers the film is divided in 2 parts. i thought the first half of the pianist was terrific. we meet erika kohut (wonderful isabelle huppert), a piano teacher, and get introduced to her world. she is single, struggling to find her space against an over-protective and borderline tyrannic mother. we understand that she has lost or has seldom experienced love as a physical+emotional chemistry: she protects herself by being sharp and offensive to people, releases her sexual tensions in sex-shops, as a voyeur, or in sadistic self-mutilations ... this first half is very clinical and builds an incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable.then comes walter, a young, handsome and outgoing man (played superbly by benoit magimel). though he gets to feel erika's coldness in the beginning, he seduces her and slowly wreaks erika's fortress. he loves her deeply but she needs him to fulfil her sadistic desires. then when she is about to fall for him, he is disgusted by her world and in the end we discover that erika is unable to love or feel at all (especially since walter is portrayed as someone impossible not to love). this is the second half of the film, very touching as we see erika's inability/inexperience to love lead her to self-destruction. this second half seemed less mastered by haneke, and sometimes had non-credible (ie. too shocking) scenes which paradoxically lessened the drama.of course, this is a crude film at least in the french version: you see porn sequences from the sex shop, daring mutilation and sex scenes. the much talked-about fellatio scene between magimel and huppert was quite good i thought, and is central to understand erika's sick relation to love. as to the actors, huppert is marvelous all through the film, magimel gets better and better up to perfection, and girardot (the mother) is excellent.

first of all, i must say that i love this film.it was the first film that i saw from director micheal haneke and i was impressed that how good the direction was good !haneke surely knows how to direct actors. what i found intresting is also haneke's scenario. at first, you saw a woman who is very straight and seems to be a good piano teacher and very well loved and respected from everybody in her entourage. then you realise that she has a mother who is a controle freak and is too much present in her life. now you know that she is deranged, that she has emotional problems, but you don't know exactly what. and then you fall into her dark side, but her dark side is only reveal when a student sendenly fall in love with her. she can't controled herself anymore.the roles are very complexed and difficult to play, but isabelle huppert is marvellous in her role and she deserves the recognition she had at cannes festival. benoit maginel is very solid too, but a little bit eclipse by huppert's performance.there is one thing that i found strange in the scenario is how the character played by magimel is not very credible. he is too talented! it is rare that a person is a piano virtuoso, but pass the most of the his time to play hockey and study... it think that it is a weak point, but only a minor flaw.i just saw the movie once, so i can't do a very complete critic, because i didn't analysed the movie. i like what i saw ! so i give the film a 8.5/10oh yeah... as for the end, haneke showed that he really wanted to shock his audience. a motivation that don't think is necessary to make movies, but haneke does it with style and precision, that is why his film is better than baise-moi for example.vince

i totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me who bashed the film. having read the book, being impressed by it although this is a kind of literature that you cannot really like (similar to hubert selby's writing) i expected being shocked but the effect was more subtle than this. isabelle hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi-layered character. there are many scenes that totally focus on her and her subtle changes and i can imagine few actresses who would do so well, with so much disregard for their own reputation or image. there is this coldness, distance, cruelty and at the same time there's this helplessness, hurt and pain. there's a person who's in control and controlled at the same time. maybe this is not realistic - although when you read the newspaper you'll read about much worse than this - but there's a truth to it that is very difficult to bear. i think it's an excellent film but i did not enjoy watching it.it's not boring but there are times when i wished it would end. btw, her male counterpart is very well acted as well (and i think well chosen, too).

isabelle huppert portrays a talented female piano teacher who is staid, unfriendly and distant in public, and bitter towards her students. privately, she seethes with violence and frustration, and her sexual life is solitary and perverse. she lives with her overbearing mother, who obsessively drives her to become noticed (and so advance in life) as a talented pianist. the key to the characters of both mother and daughter is 'obsession.' these characters cannot change their impulses anymore than a rabbit caught in headlights can avoid death.the piano teacher meets a young, attractive, talented pianist who from the beginning is attracted to her. they start a relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the outset she makes perverse and violent terms that he must perform on her, which sickens him enough to want to terminate the relationship before it has really begun.the film ties itself to the female lead. isabelle huppert amazes with a brutal, completely convincing performance as the piano teacher. she cleverly shows a woman who is drawn to beauty and perversion, but her violence is fed by her perverted impulses. as a film that is so character driven, you know it would not work half as well, had she acted poorly.this is powerful, intelligently acted, and intelligently and sensitively adapted from the novel. the camera work also suits the film. there are what i can only think to call, framing shots where the director holds a scene and forces the eye to dart about. this is done extremely effectively against a blank bathroom wall, and is a further testament to the director's mastery.expect to be disturbed and sickened by this film. but, be brave - have the guts to go and see it. this is a very private look into essentially one person's life, but do not expect to be entertained in the hollywood sense....there are no car chases in this film!

at the end of my review of cache, i wrote that i was intrigued with haneke as a film maker. this is what led me to get the dvd for la pianiste, which i just finished watching about a half hour ago.it's all been expressed, here at imdb and in many of the external reviews - the gruesomely twisted pathology that would 'create' an individual like huppert's erika, who is still trying, after years and years, to please her mother, at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life, beginning with her self. she's repressed everything that would free her from her self-imposed bondage, including, of course, her sexuality, which has literally imploded, to the point of madness, to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving impulse would feel like.this is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple, one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult. i think this subject relates to all of us - we're all striving for autonomy, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even on the conscious level. it also deals brilliantly with the contrast between what one fantasizes about, sexually, and the reality of those fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another human being. huppert's character gets what she asks for in the course of the film, and it is hardly the emancipating experience she had imagined it to be. regarding the much-discussed scene in the bathroom: i really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge (for the viewer, i mean) sucked out of it because of the prior scene, where she put the glass in the girl's pocket. by the time she's acting out her let's-see-if-this-guy-is-worthy scenario in the bathroom, we've already found out that she's dangerously disturbed and so it's not a turn on, her little domination session with our poor unsuspecting dupe.i think another incredible achievement of this movie is how, about halfway through it, i completely forgot that it was not in english and that i was reading sub-titles. that has never happened before, in any foreign movie, and i've seen quite a few. in this film, like cache, the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow, but unlike cache, we do at least get some sense of finality, despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether huppert's character is alive or dead. after experiencing la pianiste, when it comes to michael haneke, i am, needless to say, more than a trifle intrigued.

based on actual events of 1905, silent film the battleship potemkin concerns an imperial russian ship on which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny. shocked by conditions on the ship, citizens of the port city odessa rally to the mutineers' support--and in consequence find themselves at the mercy of imperial forces, who attack the civilian supporters with savage force.potemkin is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members, and it achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of the groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences. amazingly, each of these sequences manage to top the previous one, and the film actually builds in power as it moves from the mutiny to the citizen's rally to the massacre on the odessa steps--the latter of which is among the most famous sequences in all of film history. filming largely where the real events actually occurred, director eisenstein's vision is extraordinary as he builds--not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence--some of the most memorable images ever committed to film.to describe potemkin as a great film is something of an understatement. it is an absolute essential, an absolute necessity to any one seriously interested in cinema as an art form, purely visual cinema at its most brilliant, often imitated, seldom equaled, never bested.gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

this film is a benchmark in non-mainstream cinema history. the use of montage represents a quantum leap from the relatively simple juxtapositions of strike (eisenstein's 1st film). take the scene on the steps and note the repeated shot of the soldiers descending, to reiterate the point of the horrors that actually did happen! a highly intelligent monumental film, a must see for all film students!

eisenstien's "potempkin", (bronenosets potyomkin), is among the finest films ever made and possibly the best of the silent era. eisenstien was a pioneer of film form and his use of montage editing has influenced films to this day. the odessa steps massacre footage is as powerful today as it was when first seen over 70 years ago. do not pass up the chance to see this film!

this 1925 film narrates the story of the mutiny on board battleship potemkin at the port of odessa. the movie celebrated the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905, which was seen as a direct precursor to the october revolution of 1917. following his montage theory, eisenstein plays with scenes, their duration and the way they combine to emphasize his message, besides he uses different camera shot angles and revolutionary illumination techniques. the "odessa steps" sequence in potemkin is one of the most famous in the history of cinema. the baby carriage coming loose down the steps after its mother has been shot was later recreated in brian d' palma's the untouchables. it is clear that the film is one of the best ever made considering its time and how innovative it was though you need a little bit of patience and to be a real movie enthusiast to go through its 70 minutes.

spoilers every major regime uses the country's media to it's own ends. whether the nazi banning of certain leaflets, or the televised chinese alternative of tianamen square, governments have tried to influence the people through different mediums since the beginning of time. in 1925 though, celebrating the failed mutiny of 1905, the russian communist government supported the creation of this film, battleship potempkin. a major piece of cinematic history, it remains powerful and beautiful to this very day.set aboard the battleship potempkin, the crew are unhappy. in miserable living conditions and with maggot infested food, they are angry at their upper class suppressors. now though, after the rotten food, enough is enough. led by grigory vakulinchuk (aleksandr antonov), the crew turn upon their masters and fight for their freedom.as far as propaganda goes, "battleship potempkin" is perfect. presenting a positive light on the first, unsuccessful, communist mutiny, the film was a useful soviet tool. eighty years after the films release though, and the ussr has disappeared completely off the map. the amazing thing about this film though is that whilst the country it's message was intended for has disappeared, the film remains a powerful and worthy piece of cinema.written and directed by sergei eisenstein, the film is surprisingly a joy to watch. it is true, that it is far from what we would nowadays consider 'entertainment', but the film is a beautiful piece of art.whether it be the scenes aboard the boat or the often talked about scene on the steps of odessa, everything about this film is perfectly made. the music is powerful and dramatic, the lighting is flawless, even the acting, whilst slightly overdone, is perfect for the piece. basically, there is no way to fault this film's end product.it's impossible to know how the russian people received this film upon it's release. praising a country which has not existed for fifteen years, it's difficult for us to know the full spirits that the film inspires. as a piece of art though, it is magnificent. beautiful from start to finish, it is far from an easy watch, but it is well worth the effort.

the photography and editing of the movie is exceptional for the time period. eisenstein builds upon each scene of the movie leading to the the sailor's revolt and the massacre at the town. as much as the movie is a high point in the cinema, it is also an example of szocialist realism. by 1925 the soviet government actively used the arts, including film, as a means to spread the message of the revolution. eisensteins portrayal of the revolt on the battleship potempkin offers the viewer insight into the message of the soviet elite. marxist theory and perspectives of class struggle are demonstrated as the sailors who represent the oppressed workers and the officers who represent the elite of society. much of the film demonstrates the communist party message and how film was used as a tool of propaganda.

the movie touches the soul of the audience very much,some scene in the movie is ultimate and tears comes out automatically,i'm surprised by seeing this movie that any director can direct this type of movie in the year 1925.as a student of cinema i can say this movie helps a lot to understand use of montage.first time when our teacher told us about this movie means genre of this movie we thought nothing could be there in this movie to understand but finally when sir explained it then we came to know how great this movie is.lastly i can say it helps a lot understanding films.and being a cinema student i can the viewers that they can see this movie.

it was surprising that a silent film could be so easy to watch. the economy with which it has been edited and the films structure itself are the main elements that contribute to this.the film really captures the spirit of the revolution that it is dealing with - you really sympathise with the sailors and citizens. of course, this film has it's own agenda, but as it is a practically redundant cause, it can be viewed as a piece of entertainment in a much clearer sense.the tension created on the screen is excellent - starting with the battleship itself, and then moving onto the mainland. things escalate believably and for a film of it's era, it really is quite unflinching in revealing the sacrifices made by the characters in the film.this really is worth sitting through, (that is if you can adjust your modern viewing habits for 90mins).

a terrific, fast-paced screwball-like comic strip/drama/farce set against france's 1939 implosion. played with wide-eyed, straight-faced intensity by a talented cast and chockablock with action, satire, social commentary and authentic period details, from slick brillantined hairdos and marcelled hairdos to a fleet of citroen "tractions," a rollicking soundtrack and brief but credible impersonations of charles de gaulle and marshal petain. it's simply some of the best entertainment recently shown on screen, devoid of presumption and "message." if movies were trains (and there is a creative recreation of a trip on a steam-driven train that works despite there being no steam locomotive --an expensive prop, no doubt) this would be a tgv.

bon voyage is fun for the audience because it combines the requisite silliness of a comedy with just enough sobriety to keep viewers actively engaged and invested in the outcome. most importantly though, the film is also historically instructive; it captures the tension of the so-called "phony war" and, later, the french aristocracy's flight from paris ahead of the german onslaught. yet bon voyage is not a "war movie." it is a comedy about the lives of a handful of people set against the backdrop of extraordinary times. bon voyage conveys the chaos, confusion, and emotional bewilderment of a nation of the brink of collapse and the wide spectrum of french reactions to the new political order. this film is a comedy which entertains the audience, a romance which skillfully utilizes many clichés, and a story of a handful of people whose nation is collapsing around them.

i found this dvd in the library and based on the jacket notes, it looked like it might possibly be interesting: a black comedy set in 1940 france, just as the germans are marching in. ("boy, that should have them rolling in the aisles") but it does! this is a clever, original, suspenseful and funny film. i don't recall seeing anything like it before  foreign or u.s. that the writer/director can find humor when we know part of the outcome (the germans will occupy france for four years) is remarkable. that he does it with such charm is part of the delight. what starts off as black comedy and fluff even ends up having a couple of serious moments  including a race to spirit out a cache of "heavy water" (which was part of the preliminary research for the a-bomb) and a quick history 101 intro to the beginnings of the collaborationist vichy government that would govern southern france for much of the german occupation.* but don't let any of that that scare you off: the movie itself is funny, charming and romantic and races ahead at steady clip.one of the best things about it is the combination of actors we've seen many times (adjani and depardieu) and others we've never heard of before. along the way, there are two star-making turns: virginie leydoyen and grégori derangère. both are impressive, but mr. derangère is especially so. according to imdb, he was in ten films before this one  but he also won the cesar as "most promising actor" for this role, so apparently he was not all that well known even in france. he is a combination of romantic lead and comic actor  and he makes it all seem so effortless. you may be reminded of cary grant in "bringing up baby" and "arsenic and old lace"  it's hard to do comedy on film because the risks are enormous that the actor can come off looking inept. but grant pulled it off charmingly, and this guy does also. i should think we're going to hear more about him in the future.to be sure, this film won't please everyone  there's a little bit of violence, although nothing you don't see on tv every day. but if you're up for something original, you may feel after you've seen this that you've unearthed a cinematic gem.* the so-called "spoiler" in this comment.

i saw bon voyage 2 days ago and i found it an excellent production. the film is supposed to entertain, and it does! it emulates the style of the american screwball comedies of the 30s, but von voyage is more refined. adjani and depardieu are simply excellent in their roles. the plot is simple. the film starts with people involved in many situations that, apparently, should have nothing to do between them. it is very funny how those situations become linked during the film. it is good to see a french film with this kind of sense of humor. i find it, principally, a film in which love is the main theme. peter coyote as the german spy in france shows once more to be an excellent actor, too.

first, a word of caution. the dvd box describes this film as a comedy. i don't think that was the intention of anyone connected with the film other than some marketing morons. while light and a little bit funny in places, it is not a comedy and if you expect that you will be disappointed.i had never even heard of this film and had absolutely no expectations one way or the other. considering that the other two dvds i picked up were big disappointments, i was so happy when i saw this film. the acting, writing and direction were excellent. the story itself definitely interested me, as you don't usually see films about the final month of france before the nazi takeover in 1940. it gave some insight into the parasites that gave up so quickly and agreed to partitioning their beloved country. along the way, there are plots involving a selfish and weak actress played very well by isabelle adjani--who looks marvelous after all these years. she kills an ex-lover and then finds a poor sap to take the fall. this sap escapes from prison and finds her--with another lover--a high government official and weasel played by gerard depardieu. in addition, a subplot about a jewish physicist trying to smuggle deuterium out of the country is introduced and eventually this becomes the main plot. the story has a lot of nice twists and turns, a light sense of humor (without trying to be a comedy) and some genuine suspenseful moments. together, they create a nice package this is sure to please.

i think that the costumes were excellent, and the hairdressers also performed well. it has the very authentic feeling for that period of time.i don't know if it was the computer magic or if it was real. some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background. i was especially impressed with the scene of that bridge.the main character the actress also performed well, she showed us a nervous, witty woman who knows how to use herself to seduce men to get what she wants.some of the scenes were hilarious. even though it was about 2 hours long, but it was never boring. a very good entertaining movie.

i don't know if i'd go as far as to say that this movie belongs to the 'aussie trash' pile, but it's fair to say that there are no academy award nominees here. what must be considered is that most of the actors in this film weren't actually actors as such, just kids with nothing better to do at the time. there were many others that were offered roles in the film but turned them down to go surfing up the coast; all things taken into account, it really wasn't a bad movie for its time. in some respects it's really not unlike today's times, where peer pressure is still alive and kicking, just without the mobile phones, computers and other similar gadgets that kids lived without, unlike this generation. anyway, i have to rate this flick as an old fave that i watch once in a blue moon and never take too seriously...

movie about two australian girls--debbie (nell schofield) and sue (sue knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer guys.i caught this at an art cinema here in america in 1981. technically i was still a teenager (i was 19) so i was interested in seeing how australian teens acted. script wise there's nothing new here. it shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating, sex, suicide etc etc. i always knew what was going to happen before it did but i was never bored. what i found interesting was, despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair, these teenagers aren't much different than american teens. they had many of the same difficulties and hang-ups. also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventures and (i heard) it was a faithful adaptation of it. the acting was just ok but the actors were attractive and this was well-made and pretty interesting. so this is no unsung masterpiece but a pretty accurate portrayal of what it's like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids. i give it a 7.

i was actually satisfied when i played this game.the graphics were something new.the missions were great.but yet,i felt i wanted more out of this game.for a james bond game its pretty good but not as good as his other games.it would be great if they could make a 360remake for it.it would be much better then.this may just be cuz i'm into games as resident evil,dead rising and those kind of games.so it could be better but it was ok to play.one thing i absolutely hated about this game was natalya!she was irritating dying all the time and she couldn't run either.i recommend this game for those who like fps games more than i do.7/10 stars

the best bond game made of all systems. it was made of the best bond movie of all time. if you don't have the game goldeneye you should rent it and if you don't have the movie goldeneye you should rent it also to better understand the game. the best bond game of all!!!

two years after its initial release, goldeneye still sits atop the field of first-person shooters for the nintendo 64. even the quake and turok series have not had the combination of graphic detail, sound quality, enemy intelligence, challenge and overall fun that bring me back to this game over and over again. the missions each have specific objectives that force you to think as bond, not just to shoot up every baddie that pops up on your screen, but also to avoid cameras, disable security systems, rescue hostages, protect the bond girl, and so on. q gadgets abound in this game, including the famous watch. the game is loosely based on the movie storyline, including all the major characters and the best scenes of the movie, from the dam bungee-jump to the prop-plane escape to the tank chase through st. petersburg. even the layout is preserved where possible, so you'll recognize various situations if you've seen the film. other levels are added to challenge the player and string together the scenes a little more. with each difficulty level the mission objectives are more difficult, the enemies smarter and the bullets more lethal. i still have not gotten through the 00-agent levels. cheats can be opened, not by entering codes or pushing buttons, but by completing certain levels within a certain time frame, and additional characters can be opened up for the multiplayer. the multiplayer is still the best among the first-person shooters. it's not as crisp as turok but it doesn't slow down nearly as much... tons of options give your friends reason to blow each other up over and over again, and one more time just for kicks. there are better games for the n64, such as zelda and all things star wars, but rare has continued their streak of outstanding games with a first-person shooter that has not and will not be surpassed until they top themselves in 2000 with perfect dark.

this is a superb game for the n64 with superb graphics and a great one-player story-line and even better multi-player game best played with 4 people.the many levels and options for weapons mean that this is one of the best games around for years.

this is my favorite game for the nintendo 64 platform. i've played many different first-person shooters, and i've never really liked any of them much, but this game has a certain something that i can't put my finger on that makes it an amazing amount of fun. maybe it's the extraordinary detail put into the game. maybe it's the fluid movement of the characters. maybe it's the gadgets and weapons. maybe it's the suave character of james bond. whatever it is, this game never seems to get old no matter how many times i've played it.

definitely the best game for n64 ever. i most say i was farely disappointed with tomorrow never dies, but the world is not enough promises to be better then goldeneye (according to the website).i love goldeneye so much i find something to do every time i play it. i have even made up my own missions for the levels. multi player is the best of any game out there, and the graphics are astounding even now. the first day i got this i remember wishing that they would go back, and make all of the bond movies into games. can you imagine driving that speed boat in live and let die and making those incredible jumps, or fighting off ninjas or fighting jaws in the spy who loved me and moonraker. (i think fighting him in those games would be more fun then in the aztec) what about chasing sanchez in the gas trucks or scalling st. cerils in for your eyes only. oh well let me get back to the game at hand. all of the levels are unique and make for very fun killing environments. there are many places to hide so you can sneek up on people (especially statue park) well this game is not worthy of renting you really need to buy it today.

this game is not exactly the best n64 game ever. sure, it's good, but only when there's 4 players. without 4 players, the only fun thing to do is take remote mines and see how many people you can kill. but half of this game are levels where you have to save natalya, so you'll have to limit your use of remote mines in those levels, and that gets quite boring. the graphics don't exactly reach the level of super mario 64 or even mario kart 64. and if you're talking a great multiplayer in a 1st-person shooter, you'll have to go with perfect dark. at least you can play "multiplayer" by yourself.

this game requires stealth, smart, and a steady hand. the gameplay is simply the best; on top of that though are the interesting extras - bullet holes stay in the walls, enemies react to specific points where they have been hit by bullets, there are tons of motion captured animations that make the enemies seem very real (for instance when looking through a window at a guard he will stand there swatting flies away, sneezing, or scratching himself), the list goes on. this is the best licensed/movie conversion ever and it puts you in the shoes of the suavest super spy. this game is the best reason for owning an n64.

what can be said about one of the greatest n64 games ever? that the action is fast enough to keep even a seasoned fps veteran sweating bullets quite literally? that the graphics are great, down to the explosions that everyone loves to see? that nothing is quite as fun as playing multiplayer mode, and shooting your friends and siblings in the back with submachine guns?very little beats goldeneye 007. about the only thing missing was voice acting, and a bit more intelligence in the enemy soldiers. if you have an n64, and you like shooting people and things crossed with espionage, get a copy of this.

ever since i first played it in 1998, goldeneye has been one of my favourite video games. in fact, i recently bought an n64 purely so that i could own it and play it more often! the game is pretty much near-perfect: the single-player mode does a fantastic job of immersing yourself in bond's shoes, with varied mission objectives, convincing weapons, and great level design. even though the enemies' artificial intelligence is pretty basic by today's standards, that only adds to goldeneye's appeal. the method of obtaining cheats (completing levels within a strict time limit) was also innovative when the title was released, and even now i still haven't cracked some of them!the game comes with a wonderful multiplayer mode for up to four players, and while this isn't as advanced as the combat simulator in the game's sequel "perfect dark", it is still incredibly satisfying to blast your opponents to smithereens with a barrage of rc-p90 fire! ;-)

this game has cartoon graphics, not much violence and really short levels - then why do people say it is so brilliant?!? because it always holds your attention, it captivates you and refuses to let go! you will try for hours to try and find that damn flight recorder, try to work out how to get into the room without alerting the guards, etc! the levels are short only when you know what to do - until that, you will spend hours trying to figure out where to find correspondences, where to find helicopters and so on! and you'll have fun all the while you are doing it! well worth a rent!

in my personal opinion i think this is the greatest video game ever created! i first played this game at my friends house years ago, the very next day i went out and got my own. since that day close to seven years ago i have not stopped playing it. i can't help it i just can't get bored of it. i've been addicted to other games on other, much newer systems but i keep coming back for more goldeneye. every mission is amazingly fun and challenging, the multi-player mode was like none other. i hope you can be as fortunate as i was to have played four player multi-player mode because i had brothers and friends who would get together and play this game all the time.

i saw this movie alone when i was an early teen in my hometown in india, at a time when the only thing that fascinated me aside from girls were tigers. i came home after watching it, with a glazed look in my eye, wanting to be that bloke in the movie that befriended the tigers. what a movie and what a moment that was! the theatre i saw it in does not exist any and has given way to a shopping mall. i don't know how i'd feel about it now after so many years and do not want to spoil a childhood memory by finding this movie available on dvd or something similar and not finding it interesting anymore. i have learned from previous experience that a childhood memory is often tarnished when one travels life's jaded highways occasionally trying to rediscover their unadulterated past by way of movies, only to find its gushing innocence completely soppy and not welcome anymore. and i do not want to throw away the experiences of a memory of this movie into the wind. i do not have kids, so i probably am being selfish in leaving this movie in a sepia toned area of my brain, not wanting it on dvd. but if you are at a precocious age and want to recollect in later years memories of an endearing childhood, try to watch this film(if you can ever). it'll be really worth it.

if it were possible to award a 10+ .... this would be the one film i would choose.i remember catching this film on tv many, many years ago - and fortunately being prepared enough to video it. now my video copy is getting old, video technology is outdated and i'm starting to worry that i may not be able to enjoy the delights of this movie for much longer.as a wildlife film it is superb. as a film about the relationship between man and nature it surpasses anything screened before or since. how can the film industry allow such a classic to go unnoticed and forgotten? if such a thing as a lobby/pressure group exists to push for the re-release of this film, count me in and send me the details pronto.my guess is there's a mint to be made by anyone able to re-release this in today's market.

the feeling of the need to have someone play the role of arbiter of public taste and political correctness always manages to get under our skin. it does seem that these self-appointed, self-superior, pseudo-intellectual types do appear everywhere; be it in one's family, church or bowling league.these are the guys who would have society completely disregard and ignore all that went before us; unless, of course, whatever 'it' is does not fly in the face of today's "acceptable" language, mores and general "standards" of "proper" behavior.so it is that these latter day, high tech book burners have targeted a great deal of what was hollywood's greatest achievement; namely their participation in our own allied propaganda via their unselfishly crafted message and theme films.coldly brutal in its generation, the banned code and list of now unacceptable extends into the wartime cartoons that don't meet with the new touchy, feely socially engineered 'official' attitudes; which these "thought police" have foisted down upon us.we were truly surprised to see that there seem to be volumes of such animated short subjects. the majority we are aware of are from warner brothers' looney tunes and merrie melodies; featuring bugs, daffy, elmer & porky, all in conflict with hitler, goerring, 'il duce', tojo and the like. surprisingly though, we found an ample supply of cartoons from mgm, walt disney, lantz, paramount-famous studios and the brothers fleischer.you're a sap mr. jap (famous studios/paramount pictures, 1942) is a prime example of just what we're talking about.being virtually indiscernible from the cartoons that were the output of the studios of max and dave fleischer before the 1941 business coup-de-tat that moved them out, bringing the new name of "famous" studios, you're a sap mr. jap bore none of the bland plot elements that would reduce the latter day popeye cartoons down to the level of the ultimate formula short movie.we all remember how we'd have popeye and olive oyl together. enter bluto, usually the exponent of wolf whistle and an on acceptable on-screen version of a male reaction to feminine pulchritude. olive falls for bluto's less than honorable attentions; until he gets a little too physical and invariably blurts out, "hey babe, how 'bout a kiss?" at this point we hear "help! help, popeye and the diminutive sailor shows up to save the day; replete with the obligatory can of spinach! do we exaggerate, schultz? once again this jap sap cartoon is nothing like any of that. oh sure, it follows the storyline of now having popeye in the u.s. navy. the brothers fleischer put the little guy in the service in 1941 to conform to the mood in the country and as an open gesture of support for the men now being conscripted in the first peacetime draft in united states history. max and dave even put popeye in service aboard the mythical battleship, the u.s.s. pensyltucky.our point is just this. you're a sap mr. jap and others like spinach fer britain aren't cartoon vehicles for comic relief in the theatre's program at all in the true sense. rather they are a sort of grouping of editorial cartoons much like those from any "great metropolitan newspaper". these animated shorts, much like those still one panel illustrations, have characters that are highly symbolic and representative of nations, ideas and ideals, such as a just and lasting peace. in most cases, the hero (popeye, bugs bunny or whoever) is alone with the symbol of the enemy. both are highly exaggerated visual metaphors for abstract concept and thought; even if they are cloaked in humorous trappings for wider palatability.our liberal stupidgencia (the antithesis of intelligencia) may not see themselves this way; but for this sort of behavior, they are no more than neo nazi book burners.please, allow the future generations to view and appreciate a view of past happenings that is both historical and humorous.poodle schnitz!!

if you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes, this cartoon is not for you. but if you are strongly interested in seeing a rare piece of wartime animation, come on in!in this cartoon, popeye is patrolling the seas and discovers what looks like a japanese fishing boat. the two japanese fishermen trick popeye into thinking that they want a peace treaty signed. but looks can be deceiving; the fishing boat turns out to be a japanese navy ship! what follows is considered today to be morale-boosting propaganda.be forewarned, the representations of the japanese in the film are done in a mean-spirited fashion. keep in mind, though, that there was a war going on at the time. but i strongly recommend this cartoon to those who are interested in the wwii era.

this world war ii popeye cartoon had some very good sight gags in it, and its decidedly above-average for its genre. it was nicely drawn, too, with some great angles, good detail and....well, lots of interesting sights.what it amounts to is popeye out at sea in his little boat and accidentally running into a small japanese boat, with two guys on it. (incidentally, why were the "japs" always pictured with big, round glasses and bucked teeth?). anyway, these harmless-looking japanese sailors want popeye to sign a peace treaty. oh, boy, thinks the gullible popeye, "wait until the admiral sees this!" in one of those great artwork scenes i was alluding to above, we slowly see how that little japanese ship is really a big destroyer.....and popeye is in deep....um, water! "why, you double-crossing ja-pansies!," yells our sailor man.how he gets out of the situation is fun to watch.

this short was the first short released by paramount famous studios and was one of several done by the studio showing popeye engaged directly against the enemy, most often the japanese. while warner brothers, disney and, to a lesser extent, other studios, did shorts often depicting germans as foils, the majority of famous studios efforts focused on the japanese. given pearl harbor and popeye's naval ties, this is quite understandable. this is an average short. seein' red, white an' blue and spinach for britain have aged better. but it's still worth watching. recommended.

i loved the great lighting and was warmed by this story of american working class society and seaport life in the first half of the 20th century. i was drawn in by the timeless watchability of this realistic performance. see and feel the star power. melancholic "greek" comedy. anybody in the mood for a shot with a beer back?...or a little ginger? hey, waterboy !!

viewed this great classic film of greta garbo and thought her performance was excellent. however, the german film version which had english captions was her greatest performance. greta garbo even mentioned to the press that the german film was her favorite where she had to make the change from silent films to sound. greta had a high pitched voice and had to take lessons in order to lower her voice for her future roles in films. this story was very sad because greta garbo(anna christie),"ninotchka",'39, was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as a coal barge captain. there were many scenes of old nyc, the brooklyn bridge, coney island and the sky line of manhattan. charles bickford(matt burke),"days of wine & roses",'62 a classic veteran actor gave a great supporting role.

039: anna christie (1930) - released 2/21/1930; viewed 3/10/06 on october 24, 1929: black thursday, the stock market crashes. now the country and indeed the world will look to hollywood for escape from the worldwide great depression.births: anne frank, june carter, yasser arafat, bob newhart, barbara walters, doris roberts, ed asner, dick clark, roy e. disney, gene hackman.doug: at long last, our odyssey resumes in earnest with greta garbo's first sound film, a simple character study called anna christie. an excellent performance from ms. garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (i wanted to see some of her silent work, but netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them. how odd). one thing i noticed over and over was the way the swedish accent sounds, like replacing the letter j with a y sound. anna ends up being the only character i liked; i didn't really care for her estranged father or her would-be suitor. it looks like the sound-recording systems are getting better (nobody leaning in to talk into the mystery-can), but the camera still isn't moving. we'll be sure to watch for that to change as our odyssey continues.kevin: our first film of the 1930's is the first sound film of silent starlet greta garbo, anna christie. this is a very simple movie, with only about five different locations where we spend long stretches of the film's 89 minute running time, often with a static camera. it was great to see marie dressler in sound as well, and quite hilarious as what we hear is an endless chain of heartfelt yet inebriated slurs. i very much enjoyed garbo's performance, as she sustains the film through even the most meandering moments. i didn't really like george marion or charles bickford, maybe because i wasn't sympathetic to either of them, so i was relieved and excited when anna finally stands up for herself and shows them that she doesn't "belong" to either her estranged father or her muscle-bound irish boyfriend. it's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.last film viewed: speedy (1928). last film chronologically: the love parade (1929). next film: the blue angel (1930).

the magnificent greta garbo is in top form in this, her first talkie. she gets fine support from the rest of the cast which includes charles bickford the rugged sailor who captures her heart. ms. garbo gives a great performance as she usually does as the estranged daughter of a sea captain who returns after fifteen years. also in the cast is that great actress marie dressler. a great movie!

'anne christie' was garbo's 14th film and the first in which her husky swedish voice was heard. she plays the lead character, anna, who has struggled with being abandoned by her father chris (a drunken barge owner played by george f marion), and with the misfortune of the life she has has to lead to keep her head above water.meeting irish matt (charles bickford) may mark the turning point for her ... or does it? garbo looks and sounds great in this drama which, although looking rather clunky and moving at a slow pace, still manages to interest and engage an audience nearly 80 years later. marie dressler makes an impact in the role which gave her a second flush of movie success in films such as min and bill, dinner at eight, and emma; while marion and bickford are more than adequate.an interesting slice of movie history. garbo would do better talkies in the years following, but 'anna christie' will always be remembered for the first time she talked on screen.

viewing both of these films concurrently is not a bad idea to get a sense of early film production and acting for the camera styles. i give the nod to garbo(but not by much)in regard to her naturalness. robeson is majestic. but his performance is aimed for a large proscenium theater. something else that struck me was the movies themes of empowerment for women and minorities. there hadn't been any films coming out of hollywood yet that allowed the voices of marginal characters like anna and brutus to take the foreground. these were very progressive films for their time. it's quite probable that o'neill saw the writing on the wall way before everyone else did about the future of america.

greta garbo stars in 'anna christie', a very early 1930 mgm 'talkie', the first time 'garbo talks'. 'anna christie' is a powerful movie but not for everyone. the movie is filmed like a stage play, short on sets and cinematography, long on dialogue and dramatic characterizations. eugene o'neil who wrote the play 'anna christie' is known for his dark work and garbo's character anna christie is a bleak figure with a tortured past.the sound quality on the dvd was mediocre. not helping matters is that george f. marion who plays anna's estranged dad, chris christofferson, is verbally hard to understand. marion gives a good performance as the old drunken seamen who’s teetering on insanity with his fixation of the evil 'devil sea'. but his dialogue is written with a very heavy swedish accent, this is true to o'neils original play. marie dressler's dialogue as marthy owens is equally hard to understand. dressler believably portrays a broken down old drunken women, a 'wharf rat'. her dialogue also is true to o'neils original play as is charles bickford as the irish seamen, matt burke who pursues anna in a troubled relationship. garbo is actually the easiest to understand.the films strong point is greta garbo. she delivers a gut wrenching performance as the victim of neglect and abuse, leading to a life of prostitution. garbo was a huge star at the time and considered one of the most beautiful women in hollywood. here her look isn't glamorous, it's tortured. her body posture nearly doubles over in agony. she scrunches her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen. garbo conveys these angst-ridden feelings to the viewer to convince us of her misery.this is dark subject matter and garbo brings it to life. it’s not light fare, not fun, not for everyone. ‘anna christie’ is strong emotions dredged up from the depths for examination, this is one helluva ride.

anna christie (1930)anna christie has some terrific parts, and some amazing performances, and yet it should be even better than it is. it has drama. some of the scenes are really atmospheric, and if the interior shots around the table are a bore, other shots at night and at sea are really pretty exciting. then there are the nearly historical, lively scenes set in coney island (even a brief jittery roller coaster ride), and the episode where two women are behind a netting in separate beds, and visitors to the midway can throw balls to try to tip them over, and the women (scantily dressed) egg the men on is weirdly sexual come-on kind of way. all the while garbo (at the front of the crowd) watches.garbo of course is what makes this movie more than just another very good early talkie. she plays all sides of her character. she is coy and skeptical and in some kind of inner anguish. she laughs and cries, withdraws and pushes outward. in some ways it's a forward looking, remarkable movie (directed by clarence brown, who has a whole series of significant films from this pre-code sound era).though based on a successful eugene o'neil play, it's the writing that struggles a little as the actors seem to go through the paces at times. marie dressler is great in that exaggerated way she almost trademarked. and then there is greta garbo, who really does have a natural presence, even if it seems she's overacting, just slightly, at times (but then, so is everyone else). garbo is of course famous first as a silent actress, and this is her talking film debut. audiences loved her enough that she made a german language version the following year.

this film is worthwhile despite what you may hear. the performance of marie dressler (i hope i am spelling it right) as a drunken old sot is reason enough to see this film. it is an amazing performance. she is in a drunken stupor in three scenes for a good long while and she never does the same thing twice. you can actually smell the alcohol when she is done. amazing. and greta of course speaks her first lines on film and shes great. the eugene o'neill story is solid and like most o'neill stories, very deep and intense. this is not light entertainment but if you appreciate those great character actors from the 30's and 40's you will like it. some of the film is technically fuzzy but all in all worthwhile.

and with those words one of the great movie publicity campaigns came to a conclusion. 'garbo talks' and she spoke those words in her first sound film, an adaption of the eugene o'neil play anna christie. unlike with some other players and some other studios, mgm took great care in finding the proper vehicle for greta garbo. many players who were fine in the universal medium of silent film would lose their careers because of talkies. their heavy native accents would get in the way, some didn't know any english. it was no accident that anna christie was chosen for garbo. first of all it being authored by one of america's leading playwrights, it was the kind of literary property that would have appealed to her. secondly since the title role was someone who was swedish, the accent could be explained. finally a lot of the kinks from early talkies had been worked out, even though anna christie still made use of title cards.like most of o'neil's work it's short on action, but long and deep on characterization. the story takes place on the new york waterfront where garbo as anna has come to live with her father george marion. marion ran away to sea years ago when anna was a baby and marion abandoned his wife. anna has had to do what she could to survive in the adult world and that includes prostitution.marion of course is glad to see her, he even kicks out marie dressler, the old waterfront crone he's been living with for years to make room for his flesh and blood. of course both marion and garbo have their problems adjusting to each other, not made easy when they give shelter to a sailor played by charles bickford who takes a fancy to garbo.marion is repeating his role from the original broadway production. the role of anna on stage was done by pauline lord. anna christie ran for 177 performances in the 1921-22 season on broadway. it's one of o'neil's best known works and one that's revived frequently. of course garbo's performance with perfect diction even with a swedish accent was acclaimed and her future in sound films was assured. greta garbo received an oscar nomination for best actress and the film also got nominations for clarence brown as best director and william daniels for cinematography. daniels should especially get a lot of kudos for the way he photographed the waterfront scenes. and brown created the mood around the waterfront where the film is set.eugene o'neil's work is timeless so anna christie even with a lot of the trappings of early sound films does not date the way many films of that era do. garbo also shows she mastered the subtlety needed to work in the sound medium. anna christie is a classic, all the way around.

i'd read all the negative reviews for "anna christie". you know, the gripes about the static camera, out-dated acting and wordiness of the screenplay. but when i viewed it yesterday i found it remarkably affecting and enjoyable. yep, clarence brown's camera remains stationary for the most part, and i'm pretty sure one of the microphones was concealed in the ship's light. yep, there's a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences. it's an early talkie with primitive technical aspects. but... then there's garbo, marie dressler, george f. marion and charles bickford, all proving that great acting is timeless.i believe "anna christie" is still one of garbo's most iconic performances. and it's a wonderful performance from the divine one, in a role that is really quite atypical for her. yes, we've seen garbo weary and almost beaten, yet never with bags under her eyes or her knocking back shots of whiskey. garbo played so many (delightful) costume roles, that to see her play a contemporary woman is fascinating. she's not weighed down by heavy dresses or make-up. this performance seems quite raw from garbo.the plot, from the o'neill play, follows weary swedish ex-prostitute anna, and her reunion with her boozy, seaman father. anna's had enough trouble for any girl of twenty, as she tells drunken, slovenly marthy (dressler)in a bar. she finds solace in a life at sea, and romance with a rough-hewn, but good-hearted, fisherman (charles bickford). but her past threatens to ruin it all.charles bickford is overlooked in garbo's long line of (largely inferior) leading men. he's one actor who can actually share the screen with her and not get swallowed up by her magical presence. the pair have great chemistry together and seemed to enjoy working with one another. dressler can never be accused of underplaying, and once again the grand dame is up to her old tricks, but she's terrific and convincing in her role, never annoying as in the dreadful "dinner at eight". i've never really heard of george f. marion before, but he was wonderful as garbo's father.this is pre-code, and rather gritty and dark by mgm's standards. i really enjoyed it, and while it may creak in some places, it's still wonderful.

for greta garbo's first talking picture, mgm wisely chose eugene o'neill's pultizer prize winning 1921 play anna christie. also wisely, the producers backed garbo up with not one but two members of the original broadway cast (george marion as anna's father, chris, and james t. mack as johnny the priest - transmuted to "johnny the harp" for films so as not to offend). this little change is interesting. like too many films accused (by those who want movies to be movies and ignore their origins) of being "little more than filmed stage plays," the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldn't be more faithful to the property. by diluting a great cinematic stage work so it wouldn't offend anyone, or opening it up because they could, too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place. fortunately, the respect the studio had for both o'neill and garbo allowed anna christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in frances marion's generally sensitive screen adaptation. wonder of wonders, marion even allows the point of the scene where garbo's anna reveals her past on "the farm" to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact! what the league of decency must have thought of that! the source play's greatest problem has always been that chris's friend marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that anna can take stage - the two sides of the genuinely good woman men don't always recognize. the perfectly cast marie dressler (who had cut her teeth on the broadway stage as well before going to hollywood) is the perfect balance for garbo's anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only 90 minutes, doesn't allow us too much time to miss her - one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original - and screenwriter marion is wise enough to stray from o'neill to bring dressler back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of julie laverne's second act appearance in show boat. anna and marthy's early scene together on screen (16 minutes into the film) taking each other's measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece. not to be missed. anna christie is great tragic play and a good film drama. it's hard to imagine that a latter day remake, which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake (it was first filmed without sound in 1923 - also with george marion's original broadway chris) could improve on this excellent filming. the internal scenes hew closest to the play, but the exteriors shouldn't be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere. while the background screen work is not to modern technical standards, the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set (especially in the new york harbor).nearly all garbo's naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly (only the too often parodied death scene from camille, 7 years later, will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies), but this anna christie, together with the variety of her 1932 films, mata hari and grand hotel, and the sublime lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy, ninotchka ("garbo laughs!"), surely stand as her best.o'neill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded "sea plays," should track down the fine world war ii shaped film released in the year before the u.s. entered the conflict, the long voyage home (1940). it is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from anna christie, and features a youngish john wayne in one of his rare non-westerns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way.

this film really used its locations well with some amazing shots, dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly, but constantly keeps you watching. modern love worked well in the gold coast film fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an australian cinema that is usually neglected. most importantly it is refreshing to see australian cinema not taking on the cliché aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years. this film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings. the performances and characters are well developed, and the cinematography is fantastic. an interesting exploration into family relationships, and environments.

john and his wife emily, accompanied by their child edward venture from the comfortable environs of suburbia to the village where the husband spent some of his childhood. there has been a death in the family and john must begin proceedings to take control of an old ramshackle cottage, situated by the seaside and once inhabited by an old man who has apparently committed suicide.sceptical about the circumstances of the death, john divorces himself from his family and from reality, puts his own life in peril, and puts on the clothes of the old man who is now dead.the film now changes - nothing is what it seems - the people of his past appear, in full gothic/hillbilly glory - his wife worries about his mental state - and his son disappears into the reeds.john finds that the old man didn't commit suicide, that his death is far more mysterious and strange. in a spine chilling finale, we learn that the events of the film actually never happened and that the entire narrative was imagined by the little boy, edward, who is struggling to come to terms with his parents' divorce proceedings.modern love is a macabre piece of high art cinema, a puzzling and perverse piece of pretentiousness, full of vague suggestion and unexplored red-herrings. it is humourless and seemingly unconcerned with current indie trends which both validates its creators, but also renders it passé.but the weaknesses of this australian film are fully outweighed by its sheer muscular cinematic vision, its bloody-minded and uncompromising precision and its oddball euro horror. the bastardry of script norms and lack of slick dialogue pales into insignificance against a backdrop of noir and a lead performance that needs to be seen to be appreciated.one of the most aggressively weird australian films in years.

we see a man move from city to "out-back" and change dramatically - his family asks questions, but he goes mad.strange, brilliant film for screening here in israel. wonderful locations, great actors, a film which masquerades as a "thriller" but which is more a case-study of madness in the lead man.the film was way above the other films screened as part of the aice festival here in israel. best of luck to the team who arrived at this film. it's a grand guignol, a little masterpiece of noir.my only criticism which prevents a "10" is that the sound and the music is overpowering at times. it tends to get in the way of the images, which speak for themselves.

okay, i know that's cliché. taken on its surface, this is a bad film- perhaps in a league with "plan 9 from outer space". the dialog is suspect (but the singlish is quite enjoyable...), the plot is not quite believable, gavin's character overacts excessively. while watching the movie, somethings happen that truly make you wonder... handsome and kim making out on a tank, gwen eating a banana in a bath, just about everything gavin says and does ("psssssssssssssssycho!!"). these things taken separately are perhaps flaws. taken together, however, they are merely quirks. watching this movie with an open-mind (especially if you're not familiar with singaporean culture), and with an open-minded group of friends is guaranteed to deliver a lot of laughs and a memorable time. you can't go into this movie expecting a masterpiece, or even expecting to take anything serious at all. if you can take this film for what it is - an underdog film about underdogs, filled to the brim with its own quirks - then you should have a good time watching this one! i've already seen it three times and i wouldn't hesitate to watch it three more times!!

jacques audiard's directorial debut see how they fall aka regarde les hommes tomber is our old friend, the film with two different stories that gradually converge and turn out to be the same story after all, simply told from different sides. it's a shaggy dog story, with matthieu kassovitz's simpleton following unlucky-in-cards drifter jean louis trintignant with mutt-like devotion that even stretches to killing for him when he's asked to repay his gambling debts in kind. meanwhile, in a slightly different timeframe, jean yanne's over-the-hill travelling salesman becomes increasingly obsessed with finding the hit-man who put his cop friend into a brain-dead coma, his life, income and relationships gradually stripped away as he gets closer to his prey. yet while it may offer the perfect setup for a modern-day neo noir, the film is often more surprisingly playful, more interested in quirks of character and a slightly skewed sense of humor (aptly served by the occasional ironic captions and alexandre desplat's half-jaunty, half-discordant score) than the traditional thriller set pieces and plot mechanics.unfortunately the film is ill-served by one of the worst region 1 dvds released in recent years: the picture quality on synkronized's disc is so poor at times you keep on expecting to see the audience's heads in front of the picture like a pirate disc.

"dominion" is a good movie,but not original.it blends some elements of slasher movie and adventure flick.the setting is wonderful,the acting is acceptable and the film is fast-paced and exciting.highly recommended for any thriller/adventure buff.

this movie is a real thriller! it was exciting from shortly after the start till the very end! if you are a real suspense nut, this is the movie for you! the characters were very well developed and the scenery was beautiful. the story was very well written, similar to some others i have seen, but quite different in several ways. a must see!

this is a very well written movie full of suspense right up to the end! the setting is beautiful in contrast to the frightening action taking place there! it is not your typical suspense movie, but a movie well packed with interesting twists and surprises which leave you wanting and hoping for a sequel. i recommend this film to all suspense lovers!

michael kehoe has accomplished quite a feat, especially considering it is only his second start as writer, producer and director. generally "first timers" lack vision and direction when helming a major production but "dominion" proves mr. kehoe is going places in hollywood! set with beautiful scenery, dominion boasts experienced cast members (especially thomerson & james) who communicate kehoe's vast vision with exceptional clarity. few films can mix the slasher/horror genre with a genuine action/adventure feel, but dominion accomplished this completely. this film certainly qualifies as one of the top-notch films in both of these categories. if you are looking for fast-paced action with more than a modicum of suspense, look no further. i look forward to kehoe's future projects with great enthusiasm. well done!!!

by now, the game's stale, right?the jokes have been done. its all over. the creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone, after all.wrong.the game is still intact, the jokes are here, folks. sure, they're all rehash, but so was monkey island 2. and 1, for that matter.the difficulty is well placed, somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the ridiculously hard 2. the ship fighting sub-game is badly innappropriate, in the tradition of sub-games. and this game has the best joke of the whole series. when asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach, always select "you don't need to see my identification." its worth the price of the game by itself.

lucasarts have pulled yet another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of great games. if any further proof was required that they rule this genre of gaming, then this is it. before actually playing the game, there was a little concern about how the writers were going to keep up the pace of gags after the first two games. fears were rife that it was going to wear a bit thin.play the game and see how quickly those fears are allayed. from the introductory video with guybrush in the dodgem boat (!), to the closing stages in the funfair, the jokes just keep on coming. i was a great fan of the first two games and the other lucasarts works (day of the tentacle, sam & max, etc) and this one does not fail to deliver the quality. you will not be disappointed. (well, i wasn't.)

first i played the second monkey island game, and i liked it despite the low quality graphics and sound. then a few months later, i found out a new game was made. i tried it out and liked it a lot. first thing you notice is the great graphics. the areas are huge, colorful, and detailed, with lots to explore. the game requires you to use your brain, a lot, as always. the game is challenging, with all point and click games, frustrating. the jokes haven't gotten old a third time around. the animated cut scenes are a great addition to the game also. this is the best mi game out there, perhaps the best p&c game too! if you like cartoony games that play like a movie, get this game!

what can i say? curse of monkey island is fantastic. the story is good and solid, but appropriately silly, the jokes are hillarious, the puzzles are puzzling... you couldn't ask for more in an adventure game. the "you don't need to see my identification" bit is in itself well worth buying the game for, not to mention murray, who has become the hot topic among many of my friends (only some of whom have played the game). you will love this game. and if you don't, too bad!

being a huge die-hard monkey island fan, i fugured this one would be terrible since ron gilbert didn't make it. boy was i surprised! although it's still not as good as the first two, it has the comedy that i wanted. i was a little nervous about the new graphics, new scumm engine, and just the fact that it was on a cd. but it all came together, and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters. i especially enjoyed that sword fighting had returned. and the whole story about finding the big uncursed ring was just incredible. go ahead and try out this two-cd adventure. and now we can rejoice, because monkey island 4:escape from monkey island is coming out really really soon! this fall!

destined to be a classic before it was even conceptualized. this game deserves all the recognition it deserves. at a time when first-person shooters like quake iii arena and unreal tournament are garnering all the attention of computer gamers, graphic adventures are a dying breed. with great pun and humour, the curse of monkey island is a game that people of all age groups would enjoy. life can only improve after playing the curse of monkey island. *prediction* the sequel escape from monkey island is already destined to be a classic too. i guarantee it.

this was my second experience of the monkey island series, the full seven years after i had been shown the first game. what was my response? "oh, great, we're playing a cartoon." i'm glad my brother shut me up then and played on, because the jokes caught my attention once again, as well as armato's wonderful voice-acting of guybrush - not to mention everyone else done well (i still think cmi's elaine sounds better than emi's). the cutscenes do well to illustrate something happening, and the art of both the game and cutscenes are excellent. when we found the cd with the originals, secret and lechuck's revenge, we were both ecstatic and spent hours working through revenge - one such moment was where we just sat down and blew half a day on it. however, cmi has to be the monkey island game i've played the most, especially for the return of swordfighting and combat on the high seas. that moment when you encounter kenny and he tells you he's gone straight and then, "i'm running guns!" had both my brother and i in tears from laughter. and that's not the best part of the game, not by far.

the curse of monkey island is a brilliant video game and its a stroke of genius from the video game designers at lucasarts to have created this sequel. all the characters are brilliant, the voice overs for the characters were realistic and funny. a lot of effort went into this game and it deserves the 10 i gave in the vote, keep up the good work lucasarts!

on account of my unfortunately not being able to find them anywhere, i have not gotten to try any of the other entries in the series, although i certainly would not mind, and trust me, i have looked. for anyone who does not know, this is a point-and-click adventure title. that means that the mouse is what you use to interface with everything that you can do so with in this, though there is one particular case in this where that is inaccurate. i won't spoil it here, for anyone who haven't yet tried it. nevertheless, regardless of how little experience you have with computers, you can sit right down and try this. there isn't even terribly many bits of this where you need to be fast or have swift reflexes. heck, you can adjust the speed of the text(if you have it have subtitles on), and thus, of the talking in it, and it's not enormously awkward or forced when slow. accessing your inventory is easy, as well as combining or using items. clicking and holding down the button at anything you can affect gives three options for what to use with it(be it a person, a specific part of the surroundings or an object): hand(push, pick up, open, etc.), eyes(examine, look through, etc.) and mouth(eat, converse, etc.). this all adds up to a welcoming, friendly environment, where you can approach the plentiful puzzles(the amount of them is varied, based on which of the two difficulty settings you try this on) at your own pace, and explore and take in the dozens of individual, creatively done characters and areas in this to your heart's content. the length of this will be determined by how much time you take to do such(you'll hear no blame from me, they're worth it), and your skill at figuring out the solutions. there are a few points in this where you get to decide if you want the harder way of completing that or not. this can be enjoyed by anyone, from any age. there's no material that isn't acceptable for children. this is one of the products that help prove that that very fact does not have to mean that it is intolerable for older audiences. the animation is quality work, smooth, everything moves as it should, and the 3rd dimension honestly isn't that sorely missed when trying this. the story-telling is well-done, and you're never unclear as to what is going on. there are numerous well-directed cut-scenes, kept in the same colorful, mostly bright 2d world as the rest, with well-done camera motion. "cartoony" is an appropriate word to describe this, and not only the visual style. it can be applied to all of this. the entire world of this is very similar to, but not quite the same as, ours, with a mix of past and present, inhabited by people and filled with things that we can sort of recognize or understand at least portions of, but the absurdity makes them funny. that would have to be one of the greatest strengths of this, right there: it's hilarious. a lot of that comes from the lines spoken(what is said as well as how it is), and those who dig british efforts with focus on verbal, the likes of 'allo 'allo or the blackadder franchise will want to check this sucker out. however, there are several different types of jokes, including, but not limited to the following: satire, cleverness, dark, spoofs, irony, gross-out comedy(not exactly my favorite aspect of this) and more. there's self-awareness, with the lead addressing you, personally, and, for example, explaining why he isn't going to do what you just asked him to. there are references to pop culture through a couple of decades. almost all of it works, hardly any gags fall flat, and if you aren't in stitches during this, my best guess as to the reason would be that it's simply not compatible with your sense of humor... a situation that warrants no judgment, and if one suspects that could be the case, and wishes to find out, i suggest the demo version, where you, for free, can see if you care for the brand of play and/or laughter. the plot is well-written(nearly all of this is, really), develops nicely throughout and keeps your interest well. the audio is all excellent, crisp and well-done. the sound effects are spot-on. the music is well-composed with no exceptions. the voice acting is impeccable, with a celebrity or two. armato is fantastic as guybrush threepwood(gotta love that name), whom you control. boen is incredible as lechuck, the deceased(and still threatening) zombie villain. the designs are immensely well-done, highly imaginative and all fit. in spite of the relatively limited disposition of our hero when it comes to pirate deeds, you do get to engage in some. steer a ship, board that of others, and match blades in a rather unique, and marvelously thought up, way. the re-playability lies mainly in the choices, during dialog, etc. this is linear, with a tad freedom as far as the order goes, so the buccaneer sitting down with this, for at least the second time, has not got that large an amount of possibilities as far as being challenged by this goes, unless he or she has forgotten what to do in the meantime. ah, nothing is perfect. anyone who would care to delve into a thoroughly well-crafted and fascinating fictional universe, and crack up countless times should get a real kick out of this. the good kind, not the ones that hurt and potentially leave bruises. don't forget, kids, do *not* eat books... that is just begging for a paper-cut. i would wager a guess that those who like the others would appreciate this one, too. and they're not the only ones who may get into this. i recommend this to, apart from members of aforementioned group, any fan of this genre of vgs, as well as anyone to whom this review appeals. 8/10

another fantastic offering from the monkey island team and though it was a long time coming and had to survive the departure of ron gilbert it's another worthy installment. my only gripe is that it was a little short seeming in comparison to the previous two, though that might be because of a glorious lack of disk-swapping. roll on mi4.

the curse of monkey island has always been my favorite of the series. a vibrant visual look, an excellent soundtrack and brilliant voice-cast all create a memorable and humouristic adventure.graphics wise the game is definitely not a let-down. though some corners have been cut the over-all feel of the game is reminiscent of disney feature length animations. the gameplay is simple and even a novice will get the hang of it soon enough. the game also offers a little extra for the more experienced players with its mega monkey mode.the voice-cast is one of my favorites. dominic armato's sympathetic voice makes guybrush complete and alexandra boyd is simply charming as elaine. earl boen makes for a wonderfully sinister yet over-the-top villain, lechuck. also the game's charm is added by memorable characters like wally (neil ross), murray (denny delk) and one of my personal favorites haggis mcmutton (allan young, voice of scrooge mcduck). my hat also goes off to the late, great kay kuter and his memorable secondary-role as griswold goodsoup.michael land's tropical and wonderful soundtrack once more graces the monkey island adventure, comprising of some of the best tunes in the business. the game isn't perfect and some locales are not as well detailed as other, but i had no gripes with the simple ending of the game which i found very satisfying.

i had only written one review on imdb prior to this, as i consider most games as unworthy of the time and effort...curse of monkey island is different.having played and been impressed by monkey 1 and 2, i had great expectations for the third release...and was not disappointed. the first thing that hit me was the substantially improved graphics. don't get me wrong, for games made in 1990 and 1991 respectively, monkey 1 and 2 were ground-breaking and provided the goods well, but cmi steps up and delivers a superb cartoon-style game-play which is both fun and satisfying. all scenes and settings have been carefully crafted and well thought out, and suit this type of game perfectly. the animation/cgi is a mixture of realism and exaggeration; a fantastic combination in this case. for me the script has been crucial in the success of the previous two games. the cmi script is clever, appropriate and, above all, absolutely hilarious. added to this, the script is now audio unlike the previous two where speech is displayed in text format at the bottom of the screen. dominic armato's voice is perfect for guybrush: witty, clear and slightly naive. all other voice talents fit their characters perfectly, especially earl boen who is the voice behind lechuck. i loved every single character throughout the game: not just their personalities and wit, but the way each character is animated superbly and distinctively. whilst on the subject of audio effects, the soundtrack is worth a mention. the soundtracks for monkey 1 and 2 were both monotone, and despite this were very effective at giving atmosphere and representing a change in mood. cmi's soundtrack is, once again, a step up. each scene is complemented by a catchy, subtle, playful and piratey (if that's a word) tune. with a change in setting or mood, the music also adapts, adding to the entertainment and amusement that the game offers.the whole idea behind monkey island is to solve puzzles and problems in order to progress. this might sound easy, but is actually devilishly tricky in many places. some may be put off by the level of logic and amount of thinking that goes into monkey island, but in reality this makes the game even more entertaining and fun, and also adds to the replay value. the option of "the curse of monkey island" or "the curse of monkey island: mega-monkey" (which involves trickier and more abundant puzzles) suits players of all abilities and also gives good cause to play the game at least twice. whatever difficulty level you choose, you are guaranteed a different game each time you replay, with numerous speech options and other puzzles to solve that don't affect the outcome of the game, but are just there for fun. the most entertaining section of the game is ship combat, and the sword "fights" that follow. these were particularly well thought out and make the game completely worthwhile. add to this a stupendous story that is non-violent and suitable for all ages which will keep you hooked and wanting more until the very end.finally in conclusion, a uniquely special mention must go to the designers of this game. the way each complex puzzle and problem is thought out is simply astonishing. whilst gathering up items and objects during game-play, you can't see how each one is going to help you progress, but with a little thought and perseverance solutions present themselves, and for that the designers of cmi must be highly commended.10/10 for the best game i have ever played (not an exaggeration)

the curse of monkey island. released excactly 6 years after the success of monkey island 2. you would think with monkey island 2's wierd ending that it would finish monkey island once and for all. but, it all turned out to be a trick to lure guybrush into captivity. but enough about that, the whole jist of this is that monkey island has returned, and the voices are just phenominal. if lucasarts were to make a movie/cartoon of monkey island, this would probably be what it would look like, and sound like. it's plot is real good, and everything about it is just awesome. if you haven't heard about the monkey island series, buy the monkey island archives or the monkey island booty pack and play through all the games starting with the secret of monkey island, then monkey island 2, and the curse of monkey island. monkey island 4 was real good, but this one tops them all.

"curse of monkey island" is a treasure; in my opinion the series as a whole was the holy grail of adventure gaming, not to mention lucasarts.but to return to "curse," whats beautiful about cmi is that its not afraid to be itself. it does deviate from the first two but still remains faithful to the ron gilbert productions (if only the same could be said about the 4th installment of the series!). the voice work is impeccable, with dominic armato playing our favorite protagonist guybrush threepwood. the animation, while quite different than the classic pixelated characters, is done beautifully. it really is just absolutely gorgeous. and the music is fantastic! its never annoying and you never have the urge to turn it off.although i'm not too big a fan of romance, the romantic scenes and themes are not at all overpowering. they also have the rare ability to come off as sweet instead of cheesy. that says a lot from a girl who routinely falls asleep during chick flicks.then, of course, is the classic mi element of humor. cmi is quite adept at delivering deadpan lines, altogether absurdist humor, and simply good fun. gary coleman makes a cameo as a budding young entrepreneur, and world events are discreetly jabbed at without stepping out of the bounds of the game.its not entirely fair to compare cmi to mi and mi2 because it truly is in a realm of its own. personally i can never find a favorite between the 3 as they all are quite different from each other. however, if you want a swashbuckling good time with the flair of the classic series, i insist you give this game a shot. you will not be disappointed.10/10 stars, hands down.- emily n

a group of evil businessmen need to knock down a building to build a huge complex, but they can't remove the tenants. the tenants and businessmen with their hired thugs clash until the film ends with one of the funniest fights ever! the guy with the ginger hair who goes 'eeeeehhhh' every time he throws a punch and the other guy who poses with a knife in his mouth instead of fighting, only to be beaten off camera, make this essential viewing if you like to laugh at films rather than with them.

one of the classic low budget 70's movies, this film was found in a bargain video shop in london for only 50p. (interestingly, the package lists the star of the film as 'charles bone', who sounds like a porn star, but once the credits role it's obvious that the picture is aligned to far the right of the tv screen, so that all the cast members have the last letter missing from their names)from the moment the narrator lamely introduces us to the situation that the desperate tenants of a grimy new york city apartment block, you know you're in for a rollercoaster ride of fromage. the direction is from the 'ed wood one-take' school - if one or two extras were looking at the camera crew, then what the hell?the films finishes with a plot twist that puts the usual suspects to shame. buy it now.

this movie stands for entertanment. its the funniest movie i have ever seen. the lines, the acting. and the clothes, wow, talk about 70:s. if you ever see this little gem, buy it. its worth every penny. by the way, the opening song is awsome. if anyone know where i can find it. plese, send me an e-mail.

"death promise" is a lost 70's exploitation gem and deserves to be seen. technically somewhat of a mess and boasting a stock of amateur new yawk types, this film never bores. i highly recommend tracking this down. it's a hoot and a half.

first time i ever saw this was at a friends house. it ended up in his parents hands by a fluke; some videostore/bicycle repair shop!! went bankrupt and treats like this was up for grabs. we saw it two times in a row and almost wet are pants how hard we laughed. i've seen historical documents like ninja mission and plan 9 from outer space, and they still remain good runners-up in comparison to this one. almost 15 years after first contact it is now considered the best cult movie of all times (in my circles); i've showed it to all my friends... we now have a tradition of searching for movies in the same category: the un-rateable one.it can't be explained or reviewed in any normal way because every scene, every take, every move, contains at least one mistake regarding editing, dialouge, directing etc.for any cult-movie buff this is the ultimate prize, the gem of all gems.raiting: as for craft it can't be rated, because it would even be an insult to homemade videos of birthdays and weddings.as for pure amusement it is the funniest movie i have ever seen; funnier than any comedy ever made past or present. anything less than a 10/10 should be regarded as an insult to good sense of hum our.

one of my favorite movies. i like horses, i like happy endings, and i like walter matthau. i miss him and am glad to have a great film like this to remind me why he was so wonderful. watch it with your kids (or your horse).the story of an old hard boot horse trainer with kids, and down on his luck. if you have ever had or appreciated horse racing you will appreciate the rags to riches storyline. it may be a little below "seabiscuit", but not a lot. the story is the same one, except it is the quarter horse version. well acted, correct racing terms and equipment, and nice racing scenes. don't take my word for it, get it and make up your own mind.

another of the endless amount of cookie-cutter 'kickboxers fight to the death for the amusement of wealthy scumbags' films that there were so many of in the 90s... y'know, the ones created by taking the words 'death', 'blood' and 'steel' and the words 'ring', 'fight', 'match' and 'cage' and putting them in a random generator! saying that though, death match is a pretty good entry in the over-used genre, thanks to its exciting fight scenes and the surprisingly good acting of its kickboxer cast.the story concerns two buddies - ex-kickboxing world champion john larson (played by pug-faced middleweight kickboxing champ ian jacklin, probably previously best known for his awful performance as the main villain in ring of fire 2) and nick wallace (nick hill, a likable guy probably best known for the role of street-fighter sergio in bloodsport 2) who work the l.a. docks loading crates onto ships. one discovery of a boxful of guns and a brief fight later, our two heroes are jobless and propping up an l.a. bar. sensible john larson decides to head north and look for a job; headstrong nick wallace has heard of a guy paying good money for fighters to fight in private kickboxing matches. "why should things change?" says john, " if you need me, i'll be there." predictably enough, it isn't long before nick has gone missing and his good friend is fighting in the deadly 'ring of death' trying to find a lead to his missing buddy.sure enough, there are no prizes for originality here, but like i said before, this films strength lies in its action, its cast of real-life fighters and the fairly good performances it manages to wring from them. ian jacklin in particular surprised me. previously i'd just seen him as the bad guy in ring of fire 2 and in bit-parts in tripe like the steel ring, and i've always been quite amused at how bad an actor he is (good fighter though!). but in death match, he's pretty good! given a decent script and a haircut, he proves himself to be quite the charismatic leading man! and his friendship with nick is very well portrayed. jacklin and hill have a nice chemistry and you really believe these two characters care for each other. enough for one of them to lose a job, travel halfway across the country and risk death to save the other - i wish i had a friend like that! it was also nice to see matthias hues as a villainous henchman with a little more depth than we're used to seeing from his many 'villainous henchman' roles. however don't be fooled into thinking he's the star just because he's on the video cover (with, it seems, his head stuck on the body of michael bernardo from the cover of shootfighter) - he is good while he's on screen, but he isn't on much..on the negative side, the film is pretty slow when there's no fighting going on, with lots of unnecessary scenes (whats with gangster jimmie fiorello's pointless story about his grandfather??), and the end fight is disappointingly short, but on the whole i enjoyed it! plenty of fights, most of them good. isn't that all we martial arts really need? and of course eye-candy, here in the lovely form of the very pretty renee ammann. all in all, a pretty entertaining kickboxing movie.

this is a decent effort for a b-movie martial arts actioner. ian jacklin, a former north american cruiser weight kickboxing champion, is the lead and acquits himself well in the action scenes. the muscular matthias hues gets a chance to add more to his martial arts bad guy persona in this film than in all of his many others and if you are a fan of the teutonic titan, rent this movie now!renee griffin is also noteworthy as the romantic interest in this film. she starts off with attitude but soon warms up to the hero and they make "the beast with two backs" in a very stylish fashion.the fight scenes are good in the american tradition (no hong kong acrobatics here!) with added realism from having benny "the jet" urquidez playing himself as john larson's (jacklin) trainer.all in all this film seems to have more sub plots than most in its genre so you get more of a story.

this show is absolutely fantastic. it provides all the great drama and romance of teen shows like the oc and dawsons, but it's a whole lot funnier. it's a show with morals and values, without everything being sugar coated and sanitised (ala 7th heaven.) we don't have sororities or fraternities in australia, and our university system is completely different, so i have no idea how accurately greek life is portrayed. but i don't care! because this show is my new favourite! any writer that can make me love a racist, homophobe confederate flag-waving bible basher must be genius.and cappie is my new pacey. sorry josh jackson, you've been dethroned!

i just saw this movie tonight(5th nov. 2005)for the first time. i wanted to watch it cause i saw the basketball diaries(leonardo di caprio) and loved that but this was far more heavy going. i think it had a good depiction of drugs to an extent. i empathize mostly with nick stahls character, probably because if i someone i was crazy about was on that stuff i'd want to help them get off it. a promising student and athlete who spends all his time training and studying-well it's understandable that he'd want to try teenage life(the crazy side of it) and in his efforts as what begins is helping his friend he ends up addicted because he wanted to see what it is all about and because of his horrendous family situation which results in his most tragic death. a truly sad film but one flaw i noticed is that you don't get a good enough insight into the damage it does to families but apart from that, excellent performances on a truly heartbreaking movie.

i wasn't planning on watching wasted when i saw the mtv preview but since i had nothing better to do or watch on a sunday night i watched it.wasted was no requiem for a dream but it was a very good movie considering it was made by mtv. one thing that drew me to watching it was summer pheonix the sister of the late and wonderful river pheonix stared. i suppose talent runs in the pheonix family because she was good and so is jaquien though niether are river. nick stahl also gives a great preformance as a junky jock. there isn't much else to say about wasted. it was a dark depressing and insightful look into the lives of three small town junkies. i recomend it to those who like the subject. 8/10

i saw this movie yesterday night and it was one of the best made for tv films i've seen. it was very well directed and the acting was superb, very convincing. the music was good and the cinematography was beautifully shot. take out the hopelessness out of requiem for a dream and you get wasted. an excellent depiction of the world of drug addiction and its consequences given in a very open way in wich anyone can relate to. cudos to mtv for giving us a good flick for a change from !*$*% like crossroads.

what can i say? i couldn't sleep and i came across this movie on mtv. i started watching it with every intention of changing the channel if it started to get lame as so many anti-drug movies do but i got sucked into this movie and i couldn't stop watching. nick stahl did an amazing job with his character, and in my opinion he really made the movie something worth watching. i was interested in purchasing the soundtrack to the movie (or even the movie itself) and mtv.com was no help at all, but believe it or not amazon.com is taking pre-orders for the august 5th release of the movie on dvd. i know i had a hard time tracking it down, and i'm sure other people might have had the same problem. i'm buying my own copy so i can drool over nick stahl while bawling my eyes out at the same time thanks to the emotional storyline!

this movie is about three teens who have been best friends for the longest time, and go on the most messed up ride of their life. when heroine becomes the choice drug in their town, these three teens find themselves wrapped up in it all. this movie portrays heroine addiction very well, and is something you can't stop watching. mtv has never been the best at doing made for tv movies, but this one has to much good content to not watch it. i enjoyed this film, at the beginning i thought it would be the worst movie i've seen, but then as it went on it got better, and i couldn't turn away.

being a high school student,i have to take a health class. this year, the topic is drugs. we learn about the harm they can cause a person. from what we talk about, i still believe and know that drugs can really mess a person up. anyway, my teacher wanted us to watch this. naturally, we groan and start to sleep, but like the rest of my class, i actually did enjoy this movie. it was totally real, and not sugar coated at all. the characters were amazing and believable. even the plot was outstandingly realistic and believable. what i liked about this movie mainly was how it got the point of the effect's drugs can take on an abuser, and the consequences the person has to deal with. everyone reassures themselves that nothing bad will happen to them. well lets get serious. anything can happen in a small town, even to your best friend, like sam and chris. this movie shows it. a person can really learn a lot from watching this. it was pretty effective.

i thought this was a beautiful film. it is not my favourite of his films - chungking express holds that spot - this one is quite different from anything else i have seen of his. it is slow (but not annoyingly so) - it takes its time and ponders the characters.. there is minimal movement in the frame - the camerawork is wonderful. the acting is great. the film feels like a long warm comforting drink.

the plot of "in the mood for love" is simple enough: a married man and a married woman (though not to eachother) slowly develop a romantic attachment to one another. the film's pace is numbingly slow and precious little actually happens between the two. yet the backdrop of hong kong in the early 1960s and director wong kar-wai's keen sense for capturing the beauty of the setting as well as the principal characters make this film a joy to watch. actors tony leung and maggie cheung are both excellent and wong kar-wai has done an extraordinary job in capturing the feel and nostalgia of the past (something so many films and directors try to do but usually fail miserably). there are so many little details that add charm to the film (a trademark of the director) and the colors and cinematography are what send this otherwise simple story over the top as a marvelous cinematic achievement. 9/10.

the chinese film title of "in the mood for love" is "fa yeung nien wah." it can be interpreted as "those blossoming years (that once were)."the whole film is a well-composed piece. a complex love story told in simple visual approach. writer-director wong kar-wai has choreographed a dancing of the hearts - it's she, it's he, it's love. i can hear galasso's theme: dum dum-dum, dum dum-dum, and the strings - almost like heartbeats. a piece with prelude, stanzas, and epilogue.director optimized the use of music (michael galasso's score, nat king cole singing in spanish, and chinese songs/tunes). the rhythm and lyrics prompt viewers to what she and he is feeling/thinking rather than verbal dialogs. i can hear nat king cole giving us the clues: "aquelloojos verde" (that thing, fling, eyes green) plays when the two meet, and "quizas, quizas, quizas" (perhaps) when she's undecided.nostalgia pervades throughout the film. design details plentiful: handbags and ties; japanese rice-cooker novelty; the ridged pattern green glass cups & saucers and plates (i remember dad treasured those at home); mahjong session; kitchen area; bedroom furnishings; the thermos for the take-out noodles that she swings when she walks. maggie cheung, slender and shapely, looks exquisite in those fashionable patterns & colors of the traditional chinese woman clothing - 'cheung sam'. every change of her dress denotes another day, another time in the story. wong kar-wai is resourceful that way.the scenes may be of the same place, but it's of a different mood, advanced to the next stanza. up and down the stairs to the won-ton noodle stand. standing by the wall around the corner to the apartments as the rain pours. along the corridor, back and forth, to his writing corner.trivia: so she helps him with his writing of his martial arts novel. maggie would be able to help as she's been in kung fu/martial arts movies. "eastern three heroes" 1992 is a fun action movie with maggie cheung (thief catcher chat), michelle yeoh and anita mui as three super heroes fighting evils.if you appreciate tony leung's performance, don't miss "chungking express" 1994 (in the second segment - romance rhythm with a difference), and "happy together" 1997 (an intense, emotionally colorful painting of friendships, faith, and fate), both written and directed by wong kar-wai.being able to understand the cantonese and shanghainese dialects, and having visited the official site, i realized the epilogue was not quite completely translated. here's sharing my version of the chinese captions:it was kind of an unbearable encounter all along she has kept her head lowered giving him a chance to get closer he didn't have the courage to be closer she turned around, walked away.that time and place had come to past. all that belonged, no longer exist. _______those vanished years, seemingly separated by a glass gathering dust, can see, yet cannot grasp.all along he has longed for all that's past if he can break through that dust-gathered glass he will walk back into the times long vanished. ________wong kar-wai's "in the mood for love" brings to mind the simple poetry and wisdom of rumi, the sufi philosopher - the 'inner and outer,' the 'spirit and body' of life, love and living.[resend. revised. ruby_fff 2/22/01]

how do you describe perfection? in-the-mood-for-love! maggie cheung and tony leong practically dance on the screen and give stellar performances that stay with you hours after you've left the theatre. every scene in the film resonates with the powerful combination of superb cinematography and shot selection, top-notch acting, and the sensual soundtrack. nat king cole singing in french absolutely sets the tone for the whole movie. maggie and tony look marvelous, with maggie slinking about in some truly glorious cheongsams and tony always looking dapper. i've seen this movie several times already, and everytime i see it i find something new to rave about. love it!

sensitive, extremely quiet paced love story between a married journalist and his young and atractive neighbor, she too also married. they lived their love for a time but the obstacles and the fear of hurting their families and children invites to a separation. a reflexive look on delicate question like love, friendship, honor and loneliness, always present in human lives, whether you are an american or a chinese. i give this a 7 (seven)

one of, if not the most visually beautiful film i have ever seen in my life...there is so much to learn here in how to play with the camera, color, costumes and set up a shot. the work that went into the official film web sites in english and french also give you a good idea of the sheer beauty contained in the film.

having seen many of wong kar-wai's other movies (happy together, fallen angels, ashes of time), i knew what to expect coming in to the theatre; the cinematography would be lush, the use of space and perspective would be varied, the acting would be superb, and at least one of the characters would be consumed by an ineffable loneliness. these are, after all, precisely the techniques that make wong kar-wai's art what it is. what i was not expecting was the degree to which i was drawn into a film that some reviewers dismissed as "unfinished" and compelled by characters who "seemed consumed by ennui."i find it interesting how people can be so utterly unmoved by a film that so vividly displays emotions and settings many of us take for granted or work ardently to forget: the overwhelming sense of grief stemming from being betrayed; the guilt aroused by the thought of becoming no better than the betrayer; the mundane yet profoundly intimate moments of relationships, where the need to express oneself verbally is utterly superfluous. this is what wong kar-wai attempts to portray in the film and what he achieves so well.too many americans are consumed by the need to have every moment of a film filled with stock dialogue; witty banter, disaffected sarcasm and overwrought confessions seem to be the pinnacle of the "best" american film has to offer. wong kar-wai sees things very differently. instead of the character needing to keep the audience apprised of her every feeling, perception or belief, wong's characters make their feelings and understandings known clearly by facial gestures, body positioning, and, yes, silence.if viewers merely contemplate this film from the standpoint of character development and action, then they may be disappointed by what it has to offer. if they are willing to let themselves try and intuit what the characters are feeling, then they may feel quite differently about what wong has to offer them.

"in the mood for love" a teasing allegory of loneliness and longing. here is a film without sex, or even kissing -- and it is no doubt one of the sexiest and definetly the most thought-provoking and psychological romance i have ever seen.telling the story of two people who coincidentally, live in the same apartment, and are a door away from each other. the film, like and unlike "random hearts," is about how two people come together via the affair of their two lovers. only once they receive this news, they take the time to think about the consequences of an affair, and each other's feelings towards having just broken-up -- and whether or not the two people are willing enough to fall back in love.what's terrific about the film is the way director wong kar-wai, presents each character's way of dealing with loneliness. with maggie cheung's character, he'll show her, in a repeated montage: leaving work, going home, watching her neighbors gamble, head to the noodle shop, leave the noodle shop, and bump into her attractive age-equal, played by tony leung. this is a clever, if not subtle and knowing technique to present loneliness. for it is when you are alone, when you find yourself falling into a loop. this movie worked for me because i can identify with that feeling.

as with many of wong's films, a lot of people find them to be boring and confusing. well i like them and i like this film too. i went out and rented it on dvd and i watched it 3 times. it is a very subtle movie that provides an intoxicating experience. for those who did not enjoy it...... you just wasted 2 hours of your life.... too bad...muhahahahaha.

what an awesome film!!!!!!!! i came out of the theatre feeling stunned. the film that i had just seen was one of the best films i have seen in my life. i had my eyes glued to the screen. it's very symbolic, visually lush, beautifully shot, and gorgeously told. it's basically about two people who move into a flat and live next door to each other with there partners, who are assumed to be having an affair with each others partners. assuming this, our two heroes act out what they think their partners are getting upto. there is an obvious repression of feelings for each other, with the use of vouryistic camera work, body language, and symbollic stairways. it's a visual feast, and hard not to like. some of the story gets slightly confusing but that's nothing. the ending is one of the most beautiful (and anti-hollywood) endings i have ever seen in my life, and visually amazing. the films haunting score adds to the mood. i highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind, and respect. what a superb film.

for a long time i did not know weather i liked this film or not. this is surprising, because i usually do know, but because the film did not go anywhere, i was a bit confused.two people move into a somewhat communal household setting. finding their spouses constantly working or away on business trips, their attention, out of sheer loneliness, wanders to each other. after a platonic love affair, the male lead played by tony leung chiu discloses that he has a mistress on the side. su li-zehn, played by maggie cheung is hurt, even though their love affair has not been physically consummated. chiu leaves the country, only to come back years later, when everything has changed.for the cynic's part, the film is correct. by never actively or actually touching the part of love, but only approaching it, the film, admittedly says more than so many others have on the subject. it is also true, i think, that nothing good could have come if they did go on to have the affair. at least that's the feeling i get.if we are to believe it, however, when garica marquez writes that "...love is a state of grace; not the means to anything but the alpha and the omega, an end in itself," then this film falls miserably short of this, as do all others. or, if you are inclined to entirely incomplete minimalism, hits it right on the mark. what films in history have achieved, approached, or sustained this phrase, if for only a short while? my honest feeling in memory is that about two. when harry met sally suggests effectively this romantic perfection; and the getting is all in just getting there. it is interesting that in when harry met sally, this is done in the course of wooing, rather than in its attainment. can't anyone say anything good about love after it has been achieved by two individuals? nicholas spark's recent film the notebook comes closer to this perhaps than any other film; are we to believe that once love is achieved it flies of the radar only to exist in perfection in some other dimension, or, more true perhaps, becomes latent vehicle for other ends? in the mood for love is an honest film,with gorgeous and generous cinematography worthy in all respects of the best that almodovar has to offer, yet all it manages to say in the end is that "life is sometimes like this." now this is by no means a diffident thing to say, especially if said well, but the problem really comes at the end of the last act when kar wai wong tries to round out the film by relating, only for the second time, a broader historical theme that plays in the background of the relationship which has just taken place. this is a worthy effort, and the variation on the musical motif played throughout the film is rather brilliant, but the theme's relatively spare indictment plays too little to have much more than a superficial effect on the holistically inclined audience, leaving the viewer to split the difference, a mistake in any film. a director should know where he is going, and how to get there. but in all honesty, it is only one wrong turn. however, as anyone knows, all it takes is one notable imperfection to spoil the perfect barrel of honey.the effort, though, is definitely worth while; trying to let a historical theme broaden and round out the film and raise it beyond the micro-meaning of the couple, but without any real foreshadowing, it is the crucial mistake. in a word, and unfortunately, it is too little too late. it is also, i think, too much of a challenge for the non-asian viewer not familiar enough with china's history to appreciate completely this sweeping stroke.

as long as you can get past your puritanical instincts and realize that pornographers are people too, you'll realize the depth p.t. anderson gives to his characters. also, an incredible soundtrack. the songs are so tightly tied to their scenes, you won't be able to hear them without thinking about the movie again.philip seymour hoffman is worth the price of admission alone.

it is depressing that many people don't understand this movie. to get caught up in the peripheral elements is to miss the true meaning of this film. this film speaks to the minority of people who actually believe in love and truth. it points out that in todays society too often people say what sounds good at the moment with no intention of backing things up when things get rough. as someone else stated that is evident in the number of divorces. some people actually believe marriage is forever. forget about stereotypes or anything else, but rather focus on what is important following your heart and fighting for who you believe in. i liked the ending because it would have been easy to go with a sappy one but came instead with the reality that committent is great, and you should fight with everything you have, but sometimes that still isn't enough. too often people just give up and forget about the magic of love. late.

this is a truly great and beautiful movie. the underlying theme of this movie is the innocent child (heather graham as joline) struggling to make her naive wishes for how the world should be make sense while being incessantly beaten down by the real world. it's not an unhappy movie, though - exactly the opposite. it's a funny movie with a sad side, but just thinking about the movie makes me feel so happy. near the beginning of the movie, beautiful, vulnerable joline confronts a drug addict attempting to break into her friend's car. she reasons with him, convinces him to seek help, and gives him $30 as a start. at the end of the movie, he reappears to pay her back, explains that he is off drugs, doing well, and he thanks her. i can hear the cynics groaning. of *course* that would never really happen. this movie doesn't take place in the real world. it takes place in the world we wished we lived in. the sad part is realizing we don't live there. the happy part is knowing there are people wishing we did.

in an industry dominated by men and in lack of products with a female mark on it ; is it always nice to see a film shown from the woman's point of view. i would welcome more films from female writers and directors , and i think lots of other women with me.

joline (heather graham) married carl (luke wilson) and about five hundred and some days later, carl is very depressed and leaves her, expecting to `clean the fog' in their lives. joline faces her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life, and decides to look for carl in texas. she is very supported by her brother jay (casey affleck), who meets her in the border of mexico. there, joline meets the confused carl and realizes that she can not change his decision, while jay knows carmen (patricia velasquez) and starts dating her, and in the end `life goes on'. this movie is very unpredictable, having a very different story. i believe it is an independent production. in some parts, it is a little slow and boring, but there are certain dialogs that makes this movie worthwhile. i liked it, and my vote is seven.title (brazil): `rebeldes até o fim' (`rebels until the end')

i loved this film! it has a great heart and great bones. i stumbled onto it by chance and i had no recollection, not even an inkling, of this movie from promos or reviews or word of mouth.   i remember reading, many years ago, a journalist who commented on the value of watching movies without having them contaminated by the pre-judgement of reviews or the false shill of the promos.  and this seems to be the single most common source of the critics' negative reaction to the film:  it failed to meet expectations of it being a comedy, or a slice of life, or character driven.  i had no expectation about the film, and so it was comedic - but i only laughed once or twice - without being a comedy; it was about a person, but so eccentric that it wasn't slice of life; it was about a character, but the character was so intelligently optimistic and trusting of her instinct to life, that it wasn't the angst-driven sentimental melodrama so typical of american 'serious' film - as i wrote that i realized that writer/director lisa krueger managed to poke fun at this schlock american sentimentality in the husband!  and very cleverly too! and kreuger was able to keep the cloyingly sentimental ending from the screen, when the wayward, not prodigal, husband returned with his tail shrunk between his legs. bravo, ms. krueger, bravo!  (now i will be watching this film again, as it is getting better and better as i reflect on it.)   graham's performance as joline is brilliant. i loved how subtly but completely she was able to portray and convey intelligent awareness of her committable commitment to honouring her words and actions - she knew that in keeping her word with a band, or friends, or husband that she was setting herself up to ridicule and/or disappointment in a world that was unable to honour commitment as she was able to do. but even with that strength, she was fully connected to humanity, and embraced with a fully committed heart their frailty and failures. the character of joline was amazingly well acted, and i left the film surprised that i had no recollection of awards nominations for it. okay, not that surprised, as american awards tend to go to women in 'serious' roles, filled with angst and the proper amount of nudity, which this film did not have. what it has was far better, which was heart in this woman's discovery of herself with the assistance of new friends and a self-deprecating shaman.i admit to being a bit of a soft touch for eccentric characters who manage their peculiarities while remaining honest and true to themselves as they move through the minefield of what comprises 'proper' societal behaviour and 'acceptable' interpersonal discourse. so, if people must conform to normality in your world, then this film will not be to your liking.  and that was, it seems, one of the common threads in the critiques.and i am always a sucker for a good play on words when it raises questions of human behaviour and ethical/philosophical values. until this movie i hadn't made the emotional connection between being committed (to a cause or honesty or something) and being committed (to an insane asylum). at what point does one's commitment to a personal sense of truth and action in life become a one way ticket to insanity? this sounds like a simple question, or one that is easily dismissed as being rhetorical. but is it? and yet few of the critics - i think maybe two, commented on this aspect of the film either directly or indirectly.a lovely film. 8/10. 

joline (heather graham) sets out after her husband carl (luke wilson) who disappeared to clear his head about himself and their marriage. joline, who is committed to their marriage starts her journey to find carl, yet on the way discovers a lot about herself. on her trip she encounters a bountiful of interesting characters who unknowingly help her find her way.in my eyes this is a classical road movie, which moves just at the right pace (some viewers may find it too slow). throughout the movie it keeps its humorous note while joline responds to the craziness of the world around her with a warm, knowing, sometimes sad smile. all actresses and actors give wonderful performances and the musical score is immaculate. 9/10

some people drift through life, moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye; others latch on to a cause, another person or a principle and remain adamant, committed to whatever it is-- and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it. but we're all different, `made of different clay,' as one of the characters in this film puts it, which is what makes life so interesting. some people are just plain crazy, though-- and maybe that's the way you have to be to live among the masses. who knows? who knows what it takes to make things-- life-- work? writer/director lisa krueger takes a shot at it, using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed-- and how one `gets' committed-- and obsession, in `committed,' starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy, too. her name is joline, and this is her story.	admittedly, joline has always been a committed person; in work, relationships, in life in general. she's a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what. and when she marries carl (luke wilson), it's forever. the only problem is, someone forgot to tell carl-- and 597 days into the marriage, he's gone; off to `find' himself and figure it all out. when joline realizes he's not coming back, she refuses to give up on him, or their marriage. maybe it's because of that `clay' she's made of. regardless, she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him, which she does-- in el paso, texas, of all places. but once she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, giving him his `space' and not even letting him know she's there. she considers carl as being in a `spiritual coma,' and it's her job to keep a `spiritual vigil' over him until he comes to his senses. and while she watches and waits, her life is anything but dull, as she encounters a young woman named carmen (patricia velazquez), a waitress at one of the local eateries; carmen's `grampy,' (alfonso arau), who is something of a mystic; t-bo (mark ruffalo), a truck driver who has issues concerning carl; and neil (goran visnjic) an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her. for joline, it's a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about carl, but even more about herself.	there's a touch of humor, a touch of romance, and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot. and krueger presents it all extremely well, delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining. her characters are very real people, with all the wants, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story. we see it from joline's point-of-view, as krueger makes us privy to joline's thoughts and therefore her motivations, which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold. that, along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates, makes for a very effective piece of storytelling. there's an underlying seriousness to this subject matter, but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy-handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters. and the result is a well textured, affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life.	heather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation. she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable, adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person, and one that is real. and for this film to work, it was imperative that joline be viable and believable-- and graham succeeds on all fronts. her screen presence has never been more alluring, and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes, is enough to draw you in entirely. it's all a part of the character she creates; there's an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance, who she is inside and out. she's a likable, agreeable person, and because you've shared her innermost thoughts, you know who she is. it's a good job all the way around, beginning with the way the character was written, to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life.	as carmen, patricia velazquez is totally engaging, as well. her performance is very natural and straightforward, and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character. she has a charismatic presence, but is less than flamboyant, and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down-to-earth. she is refreshingly open and up-front; you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back, but is totally honest on all fronts, and that, too, is part of her appeal. and, as with joline, this character is well written, and velazquez brings her convincingly to life.	overall, there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including those of luke wilson, casey affleck (as joline's brother, jay), goran visnjic, alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as t-bo, who, with very little actual screen time, manages to create a memorable character.	the supporting cast includes kim dickens (jenny), clea du vall (mimi), summer phoenix (meg), art alexakis (new york car thief), dylan baker (carl's editor), and mary kay place (psychiatrist). a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture-- reflecting upon who we are, where we're going and what we really need-- `committed' is an enjoyable experience; a ride definitely worth taking. 8/10.

englar alheimsins are very good movie. she happen on a mental home in iceland. ingvar e. sigurdsson is in a leading role and is good. other good actors in this movie are baltasar kormákur and bjorn jorundur. i like this movie she is very good. i voice with this movie.

this film is based on a true story. the author of the novel bearing the same title, einar már guðmundsson, had a brother, who turned mentally ill. i found this film very moving, following the main character's path down into illness, to see how he tries to cope with life after diagnosis, and how he makes friends at the mental institution, it all is very convincing. there are quite a few splendidly funny incidents also in the manuscript. the title of it gives nothing away concerning the story. you must watch it to understand ... and listen to the music, which is twisting and turning your heart and soul upside down and back as the film moves on. a must-see for everyone.

this movie is great. best acting i have ever seen in my life. ingvar e sigurðsson is the best icelandic actor, and of course hilmir snær and bjorn jörundur. great music and sound. cold hard reality about a struggle of a man that has a lot of problems and the people in his life. black humor mixed with great acting and this european art movies style, it works, it comes together in a the best icelandic movie ever made. i say to you." see this film, you will not regret it". i gave it 9 stars. if you see one icelandic film in your life...see this one

this movie is stunningly free from storytelling. it's a pure experience where the music overshadow the visual impression. - words cannot of course enough express what should be expressed, but it is the requirement of the chattering classes that chatter is put forward, entered into production lines of mediocrity and therefore a necessity in order to express any sensible thought or opinion about something which should not need to be degraded by chatter. therefore these elaborate opinions are put forward to satisfy those empty minds which need to be filled by noise that you will not find however hard you try in this movie.

if this film doesn't at least be selected for an oscar nominee for best foreign film i'm going to stop waking at nights watching the event. fridrik thor fridriksson has proven that money isn't the key to making a good movie but originality. out of a cold country comes a warm but thought-provoking film of a mentally ill man and his struggle against an insane world. after an insight like this, you question whether or not the man is crazy or the world he lives in.

the movie angels of the universe is a pure masterpiece and it proves once again that you can make a brilliant movie on a low budget, e.g american beauty and blair witch project. the director fridrik thór fridriksson gives the novel englar alheimsins a new life on the white screen. the movie is a breakthrough in icelandic film making because it's the biggest and the greatest movie that has been done in iceland.the music in the film, played by sigurrós, is very symbolic for the film, it is absolutely brilliant. i recommend everybody who are able to think to go and see this film as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed. i would bet on this film to win the best foreign film award next year  all over the globe!

this film very succeed in the film festival in karlovy vary, czech rep. logically. it' s based on a very good book, excellent actors, good camera, the best director and icelandic. it was probably the most black comedy i've seen.i really do recommend it to you.

this film by friðrik þór, director of children of nature, is powerful. it has great music by sigurrós and good acting. it shows how sad insanity as a disease can be. there are many good jokes but the humor is dark. if that is not a problem then you should see this film. note though this is not a comedy but a drama.

having a close experience with one such patient is probably the best reason why i had my heart rushing throughout the entire film. intense, sensible, moral and revealing, and don't forget to check out the marvellous sound track. really good.

the movie is about paul(páll) a young man who sinks into the harsh world of insanity and his stay at the mental hospital "kleppur" and his friends. victor(viktor) who during his education in england started to think he was adolf hitler. peter(pétur) who took to much lsd and tried to fly of a roof top the fall left no broken bones or physical damage only insanity, he is obbsesed with china. oli beatle (óli bítill) oli has spent most time at the hospital although viktor is slightly older then him, he claims he wrote every single beatles song and send it to them by telepathythe novel is better then the movie and covers all of pauls life from birth to his death, there is a long time since i saw the movie but if i remember it right the movie doesn't cover pauls childhood."englar alheimsins" is funny,sad and powerful if you haven't seen it watch it now! and read the novel first it makes the movie better

this movie i've seen many times. i read the book , englar alheimsins which was written by einar már guðmundsson who received the scandinavian book awards for the work. the movie does not start on the same place as the book starts. it happens in reykjavík and the main character, páll is young and having a good life with his girlfriend. but as she breaks up the relationship with him, he starts to get some headaches which make him annoyed and angry. and soon he starts to have big mental problems and then the movie begins. soon he is puted in the icelandic mental hospital called "kleppur" and there you get to see some great characters like viktor who thinks he is hitler and óli who thinks that he writes all the " the beatles" songs and sends them to them with mind transporting. ingvar e sigurðusson who has the role of the main character páll does is so work so well that it leaves you breathless. also the music in this movie is mad by sigurrós and just for the music's cost you should see the movie. overall a great movie meant to be seen.

first at all: if you like watching movies i recommend you not to watch this one. why? afterwards you won't appreciate any other movie so easily anymore...actually i don't wanna give rise to any excessive expectations but it is almost frightening how perfect, intense and beautiful this work of einar gudmundsson is. when in most movies there is at least one aspect spoiling the whole thing, like good actors but horrible dialogs or a nice scenery but low budget cinematography  in angels of the universe" there is nothing of this ambivalence. really everything is just great, even (and not least) the soundtrack with the magnificent sigur rós.in this story about pall, a student that goes schizophrenic after being dumped by his girlfriend, especially the dialogs (and monologues) deserve some attention: together with (and sometimes in sharp contrast to) the plot they range from depressing and fatalistic to the whole opposite of comical and totally absurd. what is more, they are often (with quotes from hegel and shakespeare) of such a poetic beauty that the movie almost drifts into a surreal sphere and is only saved to the real world by its incredibly authentic actors.one of the other comments was already referring to another point: this movie is no trivial entertainment for relaxing in the evening. despite of several comical reliefs in between it is largely disturbing, partly cynical and bitter, and most of all sad. it is a modern poetry about a life of insanity with all its emptiness, rage and solitude.finally: when you've seen the movie  watch it again. there are some great visual metaphors and allusions in it that you realize only when you look twice and connect them with the moral of the story". and of course: read the book, it contains a lot more of the small funny stories in between and also makes you understand some things in the movie a bit better.

reading the other comments here at the imdb, i had very high expectations before seeing 'angels of the universe'. i wasn't disappointed, and giving the movie an 8, i would say that i can justify that grade.the movie has some incredible acting, especially by the main-person, pall. the supporting actors are also doing a very good job like the patients in the mental institution, the parents and the siblings of pall. the music is also worth mentioning, supporting the movie throughout, giving depth and feeling.although the movie is very scandinavian, it doesn't leave out some humour and has a sort of objective authorship about pall's life. still, if you want to see a cheesy comedy or something light-weight, this is not for you. it is a story about people with mental problems, about the way they are being dealt with in society - but most of all, a story about pall.i recommend this movie to all movie connoisseurs. it is one of the best movies that has ever come out of iceland, if not out of scandinavia.

it is the best film i have seen in the last 5 years. surely, it will be in the same row with such masterpieces as the platoon, apocalypse now, the doors, the dog's heart (russian film). really, the play of the boy and his parents is so good that you can't even say that they "play". no, they live as if it was happening to them. notice the smile on there faces when the main hero agrees to go for a walk with them. the hate and love in one piece. and the final scene!really, i'm still under impression of that film. it's very hard, even impossible to combine the humor and the tragedy, but if you succeed (and frederikson did) the impact would be twice strong.i compared it with "one flew over the cuckoo's nest". i like this film either (and the novel itself is good, too), but after frederikson's movie it seems simple. (the same difference i noticed after i watched the film "american history x" and "romper stomper" - the latter is deeper). i mean milos forman only showed the material point of view of the problem. you watch it, then you say yes, it's a good film, i like him, i don't like her, and that's it. but "angels" leave you a wide base to think. there are no bad and good boys in the film. cause each of them have the right to behave in the way they do. like the girlfriend of one of the patient. of course she's young and is pregnant and that is a problem for her that his husband is in the clinic, but the feelings and emotional experience of her exfriend are even stronger (the result is his suicide). why ask him what have he done? aren't you insane yourself to ask? why do not support him, help him, understand him? finally, it is even funny when those people talk to each other. they say genius things! there are a lot of things i would like to say about this film, but i'm not so good in english. but i'm sure, those of you, who have watched the movie, understand me.good luck!

it is 1969. phoebe(camilla belle) is an 11 year old girl growing up with an idealized vision of her 19 year old sister faith(cameron diaz). faith is the doer, the truth-seeker, the fixer of all the wrongs in the world. then one day, phoebe and her mother gail(blythe danner) receive word that faith is dead. faith has killed herself. both phoebe and gail are overwhelmed by this news and, although saddened, gail mourns. phoebe can't let it go. phoebe decides to go to europe and find out what happened.it is now 1977. phoebe(jordana brewster) is 18 and decides to go to europe over the objections of her mother to discover the truth. when alive, faith was inseparable from a man she called "wolf"(christopher eccleston). though wolf claimed not to know anything about faith's last days, phoebe convinces him to tell her everything. within days, wolf realizes that he hadn't let go of the past either and he joins phoebe on her pilgrimage to portugal.in the end, wolf is able to tell of faith's decent into drug abuse and his own guilt at not preventing the suicide. although angry, phoebe realizes in the end how human and fragile faith really was.i liked this movie. i'm old enough to remember the bank robberies of the red army and i was 10 in 1969. this story was familiar ground for me. i can still remember young men trying to decide if they should go to canada or not to avoid the draft.the story is simple, but probably occurred several times in real life during that period. camilla belle was enjoyable and fun to watch as she portrayed the young adoring sister excited by what was happening around her. jordana brewster slid easily into the role of the older phoebe. blythe danner was the ever supportive mother, a role she is all too familiar with on american tv, unfortunately. i would have liked to see her with stronger material to work with. cameron diaz played the immature anarchist perfectly. though at times, her performance of a 1960s activist seemed to come off a news reel. of all the characters, it was christopher eccleston's wolf, that made the most growth. when we are introduced to the character at the beginning of the movie, we can see he is a worldly man. he is a patient and kind man filled with anger at the world's injustices. in the end, he realizes the direction he and faith are headed is wrong and begins to "grow up" deciding he should fight against injustice in his own way. faith refuses to join him in this and it eventually leads to her death. eccleston's wolf is the most real of all the characters.i recommend this movie. it was enjoyable and thought provoking. "the invisible circus" is rated tv-ma, but there is very little cursing, sex or violence in it. the subject of the movie is the reason for the rating.

i caught this on late, late mexican cable and i have to rant about it. the title was translated as "secretos" (secrets). well there's a secret that has an important part in the movie but come on, ! we are not stupid. we know there's a novel behind this.anyways, the movie is pretty interesting and it's carried by it's solid ramatic performances. the always beautiful and stunning jordana brewster and christopher eccleston deliver great performances and have such great chemistry between them. cameron dìaz is also good although she has minimal on-screen time. blythe danner is perfect and his last appearance in the movie is touching, sad. great performances. jordana's character and her sister's ex-boyfriend travel to europe in order for her to deal with his demons and understand why her sister died. through flashbacks, we learn the sad truth and we can't help but feel sorry for the whole family. the ending is truly moving. so there's nudity but it's minimal. in fact, the sex scenes are artsy and do not intend to be steamy or sexy.to be honest, i kept watching it for joranda brewster's on screen charming and beauty. and i ended up liking the story and the dramatic presentations. give this movie a try if you like solid dramatic features. great movie. the last, last scene was very sad.. the two little sisters through flashbacks.

i've seen this film three times and each time i appreciate it more. i think jordana brewster should have received an emmy nomination for her real and natural performance. many of us who were phoebe's age at this time the story takes place will understand how real it is. life for most of us is neither softly glowing romantic or harshly cynical pessimism. it is a blurred balance, and this film captures this balance. it is well constructed, too, with so many fine details in its composition. like the film or not, judging from the extraordinarily high ratings it gets from the demographic of females under 18, we can know that this movie reveals some important truth about how young women see themselves in the world.

the plot of this film is not complicated. a very attractive young girl goes to europe in search of the reasons for her older sister's suicide ten years earlier. there she meets up with her sister's former boyfriend and together they travel to all the places her sister went, and gradually the reasons become clear.but what makes this film so special, and soar above the limited plot, are the beautiful portrayals of the characters. although the older sister's boyfriend is a drop-out hippie, he has noble ideals, moral standards and incredible strengths. and although the older sister, who we see in flashbacks, shares these ideals, she doesn't have a sense of limitation or balance, of how much is too much. and although the younger girl is fiercely loyal to her sister's memory, she gradually finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was only a normal girl, after all.the most special moment in the film is when the young girl and the sister's boyfriend finally stop fighting their attraction to each other. i can't recall ever seeing more beautiful, touching, romantic tenderness in lovemaking in a film!in all these ways this is a truly beautiful film, a film to be treasured, and to be seen again and again. 9 out of 10.

so it isn't an epic, but for people experiencing anything similar(sibling suicide) it might be an interesting way of therapy. animaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time wellspent. for some reason, it hasn't really caught on in the audience,something i do believe is a result of the main theme. why did shecommit suicide? clearly, this is hardly something that usmoviegoers will flock to, had it been an european production itprobably would have reached its audience in a much greaterextent. it is however, a movie that although the realism tainted by ashimmering romanticized glow, gives the viewer a whole heartedimpression.

i cannot for the life of me understand why the rating here for this movie is so low. this was one of the most beautiful films i have seen this year. it really struck a chord with me. i had been anticipating this film for several months and i thought to myself, there's no way it can possibly live up to the expectations i had for it...seeing as how i built it up in my head as much as i did. well needless to say, not only did it meet my expectations but it far surpassed them. jordana brewster and cameron diaz were excellent in every way. their acting superb by far. they were both in their element and completely natural for the roles. the locales were absolutely gorgeous. every shot filmed was perfectly captured and fit the mood and atmosphere beautifully. i found this film very touching and took it very close to heart. i would even contemplate saying this could be one of my all time favorites. at the very least, certainly i could see it again and again.i swear i couldn't find one fault in this film. it's hard to say that about any film. i would highly recommend this one. it's touching, it's meaningful, and it says a lot about human nature and family.10 out of 10. well done by all.

the sea inside (2004) **** javier bardem, belen rueda, lola duenas, mabel rivera, celso bugallo, joan dalmau, alberto jimenez, tamar novas, francesc garrido, jose maria pou, alberto amarilla, nicolas fernandez luna.(dir: alejandro amenabar)an inspiring tale of a living death; bardem is superbthe true life account of spanish quadriplegic ramon sampedro and his petition to fulfill his desire for euthanasia by the right to die may not be considered a likely source of inspiration but this film is just that.sampedro (played superbly by bardem) was a virile, energetic young man when he lost the function to his limbs after a tragic diving accident (recounted horrifically in flashback with a visceral jolt to the senses) and for nearly thirty years lay paralyzed in bed while his loving family cared to his every need. although his abilities to move were nil his mind was very much active and proved skillful as an inventor, poet, author and artist that kept his mind busy until he could no longer bear the thought of living longer in his stunted condition.enter beautiful yet also afflicted with a crippling disease attorney julia (the ethereal rueda who matches bardem beautifully as if they were indeed soul mates) is hired to see through sampedro's final wish to end his life and in turn becomes an aide de camp when he begins to open up to her like to no one ever before. not too long has time passed and julia begins to investigate her charge's past discovering many letters hidden away by his family. when julia confronts ramon with this he at first is reluctant to discuss any thing with her but eventually he agrees with her that this may help his case and the project becomes a book in the making  a memoir/biography by way of free-style poetry and prose. the film is a heartbreaking tale of the human spirit and how love eventually triumphs over heart ache in many forms including for ramon the unlikely love he shares with a complete stranger named rosa (duenas) a single mother who sees him on tv one day inspiring her to bicycle to his remote farmhouse in spain to get to know him and possibly change his mind about ending his life.filmmaker amenabar, who co-wrote with mateo gil the fascinating screenplay, allows some fantasy into the mix when ramon envisions himself magically leaving his bed and flying across the bucolic landscapes to the eventual sea where he suffered so many years ago the cruel twist of fate that has imprisoned him for three decades. the film is not a complete downer with a sly wit and occasionally humorous tone throughout that doesn't dilute the impact of the story's final act. kudos also to the remarkable make-up job by james and jo allen do a tremendous job in aging the vibrant bardem to an aging man to full effect that should get them an acadamy award nod. bardem and rueda deserve oscar nominations as two people with so much in common and despite rueda's julia being married to a loving, doting husband, that a pair of people so made for one another it is down right impossible they were never together to begin with. that's just one of the cruelties that rings true but it is not by definition of the film as its whole; it is a must-see and one of the year's best.

as i expected would happen, too many reviews of this film (from professionals and amateurs alike) have focused as much if not more on the film's ideology. that's because the sea inside (aka mar adentro) is a film about euthanasia. specifically, it's a true story about an infamous galician named ramón sampedro, who fought for many years for the right to assisted suicide, who was denied that right by the spanish constitutional court, and who--well, i don't want to ruin the ending of the film for you.the real life sampedro catalyzed a national debate on euthanasia in spain. now with producer/director/writer/composer/editor alejandro amenábar's (abre los ojos, 1997, and the others, 2001) "biopic", the sea inside, another rhetorical aid has been provided in the international debate on this hot button issue.but as i keep saying (to deaf ears?), your opinion, pro or con, on the film's ideology shouldn't affect your rating of the film. you're not supposed to be rating the philosophical or political messages that amenábar wants to make. you're supposed to be rating the film, as a film. maybe that's a bit too idealistic, as none of us can likely completely divorce our evaluations from our ideological biases, but idealistic or not, that's the goal.so forget about the philosophical and political issues for a moment. as a film, amenábar has turned in one of his most elegant and mature works to date. he does not focus on societal debates. he does not focus on sampedro's legal/political struggles. he focuses on sampedro as a man, living out his days confined to a bed in his brother's home.sampedro, played here in an amazing performance by javier bardem, was a quadriplegic. as the film begins, he has been a quadriplegic for 26 years. that condition was brought about, as amenábar shows us through marvelously shot flashbacks, by a diving accident--sampedro was distracted by a beautiful woman, miscalculated the water, dove in, snapped his neck, and almost drowned. as a quadriplegic he eventually began writing poetry, some of which was published in a book entitled cartas desde el infierno ("letters from hell"); in real life sampedro's book became a best seller in spain. perhaps taking sampedro's artistic work as a cue, amenábar has created an elegantly poetic film.most of the sea inside is set inside sampedro's bedroom. the focus in these scenes is bardem's complex and sublime performance. as a quadriplegic, bardem is limited to moving his head and talking. he has mastered subtle changes of expression and inflection to convey a deep character with a multifaceted, intellectual approach to life. bardem and amenábar have sampedro often waxing philosophical in understated speech, but there's always a combination of a wicked sense of humor, passion for the aesthetic--including music and women, and a sadness and even occasionally bitterness not far below the surface. different underlying emotions occasionally break through like waves on the skin of the ocean.the people sampedro interacts with most frequently facilitate this in complex ways. these others include his sister-in-law, manuela (mabel rivera), who has been his chief caretaker since sampedro's accident; his brother, josé (celso bugallo), who is one of the vocal objectors to sampedro's wish to die, and with whom there is an underlying unresolved issue (it seems like maybe josé was the one to save sampedro from drowning?); his nephew, javier (tamar novas), who is perhaps the most understanding towards him; a right-to-die advocate, gené (clara segura); a pro bono lawyer, julia (belén rueda), whom he wanted because she had a degenerative disease, cadasil (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), and would thus by more empathic, and who he falls in love with; and rosa (lola dueñas), a local woman who works at a cannery and moonlights as a dj, who heard about him from the media, who wants to convince him to desire to live, and who falls in love with him.the bulk of the film consists of these characters interacting with sampedro in his room. there are also a few other ancillary characters, including sampedro's father, who remains oddly distant, and a notorious and media-conscious priest, padre francisco (josé maría pou), who does his best to change sampedro's mind via philosophy/theology (in a scene often mistakenly characterized as "comic"--it has an attendant comic element, but the scene is primarily very serious).that most of the film takes place in sampedro's room ingeniously gives the couple significant changes in setting greater impact. sampedro's room has a nice, big window, which he says he is satisfied with as an observation point on the world. maybe even more importantly, he regularly imagines the window as a launching pad through which he flies across the hillsides to the ocean, which he always loved, and which has been the most influential force in his life--it provided his living when he was younger and took his mobility away. amenábar gives us a fantastical sequence of sampedro imagining one of his flights to the sea. it is beautifully shot, with low angles (presumably from a helicopter) of the hills rushing by, until we follow a stream to the wide-open ocean, which in this film represents freedom, the infinite, and natural forces.the other significant change of setting arrives with sampedro finally taking to a wheelchair (he otherwise refused them, saying they "mocked his immobility") to make an appearance in court to help plead his case. amenábar gives us a poignant, melancholy travelogue, shot subjectively, of sampedro viewing life and the world in action from the car window.whether you agree with legalizing euthanasia or not, it's difficult to deny that this is a well-acted, well-scripted and well-constructed film. you may not believe that it's a ten (and that's even more unlikely if you disagree with legalizing euthanasia), but it's still worth watching as a fine example of artistic, sophisticated film-making.

-facts (i): "mar adentro" relates the well-known (at least in spain) story of ramón sampedro, a galician quadriplegic who killed himself (helped by some friends) after 28 years prostrated by his condition. judges had denied several times his petitions of active euthanasia.-facts (ii): "mar adentro" becomes the movie of the year in spain. everyone talks about it: politicians, singers, ordinary people... everyone likes it, even the critics' opinions are unanimous. the film wins a lot of prizes (golden globe, oscar, goya...) and annoys catholic community and life-lovers quadriplegics. a star is born.-facts (iii): the intensity and the quality of the actors in "mar adentro" are just amazing, and this makes mi wonder how come we have to watch the same bad young actors in the most of spanish latest movies. i don't know if javier bardem is a great actor or a great imitator (there's quite a difference between one thing or the other); anyway, his job is just impressive, as well as lola dueñas', belén rueda's, or the job of all the guest starrings. this is (the actors selection) the strong point in amenábar's movie.-facts (iv): alejandro amenábar learned his lesson there at the cinema school, there's no doubt about it: he's got a privileged brain. he takes good control of each and every one of the technical aspects, he knows what the audiences want, he knows how to touch the right chord, even if that turns him into such a demagogue (just like spielberg is -one of amenábar's idols-).-facts (and v): if you criticize a movie such as "mar adentro" it will seem like you have any kind of trouble with the moral issue the story tells about. there's a trap in this kind of pictures: you have to differentiate between the movie itself and the moral concepts. if you don't like "schindler's list" that does not mean that you agree with hitler's philosophy (or do you?). so, for me, it is a good film and an extraordinary story (since it is a real story that makes it much more extraordinary). grandiloquent, self-kind, and everything but neutral (no matter what amenábar or bardem have said about it: those characters that are not in favor of euthanasia come to no good at all!!). 50 % hard / 50% way too sentimental.-epilogue: "mar adentro" wouldn't be by no mean in my ranking of the best 50's spanish movies of all time. nobody has special merits in the story but ramon sampedro himself. he is the movie. now, alejandro amenábar is gonna become the more international spanish director ever, maybe he'll go to live to hollywood; but some of us would like to watch him filming a simple story, without bit final twists, without living dead nor dying alive... "the others" is still his best movie.*my rate: 7/10

this movie tells about the real life story of ramon sampedro, who lived for 27 years lying in bed after having broken his neck, and fights a battle to get legal permission for someone that can assists with his death.javier bardem is one of best actors of his generation. consider this: he has to carry this movie with only his face! unbelievable that he didn't even got an oscar-nomination. now we can all see that the academy is a joke! the supporting cast was terrific! the optimistic rosa, his lawyer julia, the rest of the family...each and everyone has his/her own opinion about the fact that ramon wants to die.whether your for or against euthanasia, put your opinions aside, because this movie deserves to be seen by people all over the world! half way through the movie i started crying and it didn't stop until the credits rolled. this movie is so heartbreaking but also wonderful to watch and i can't wait to see it again. i give it a 9/10, and in my opinion it is by far the best film of the year so far.

what do you do if you're aishwarya rai, coming off of a blockbuster film like 'devdas', with some skeptical critics still relentlessly unsatisfied with your astounding performance or convinced by your strong screen presence and stellar acting skills, what do you do? go home, sit down and pout? no. if you're aishwarya rai, you sign yourself up for the next strong period piece that comes along and continue to prove yourself worthy of all the praise, kudos, great scripts and equally great roles. and that's just what she did with and in 'chokher bali - a passion play' where she stars and shines as binodini, a young widow who causes controversy way ahead of her time. directed by rituparno ghosh {who later goes on to direct her in the equally stellar 'raincoat'}, prasenjit chatterjee {devdas in bengali} costars.

i bought the dvd a long time ago and finally got around to watching it.i really enjoyed watching this film as you don't get the chance to see many of the more serious better quality bollywood films like this. very well done and but i would say you need to pay attention to what is going on as it is easy to get lost. when you start watching the movie, don't do anything else! i would actually advise people to read all the reviews here...including the ones with spoilers, before watching the movie. raima sen gave her first great performance that i have seen. aishwarya was easily at her best. all performances were strong, directing and cinematography...go watch it!

i concur with what mallicka.b has said. the movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. emotions aren't conveyed properly. i guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. in my view, tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of aishwarya rai. in some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. i also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes. i'm a bitter critic of aishwarya rai :) can't help it; sorry for that. 'raincoat' was a good movie by rituparno ghosh. and i saw choker bali after seeing raincoat; i was not at all impressed.

let start off by first saying that i have been a punk fan most of my life. i always kind of had a lack of respect for the la scene of the early 80's, which the decline of western civilization documents, with the exception of x and black flag, being more of new york and english punk guy. after i saw this movie that completely changed. the people shown may look like a bunch of idiotic, strung out kids who think they might accomplish something beyond street-cree through their lifestyles, but it is a great display of hedonism at it's best, coupled with some fun, loud rock n roll. one of the best scenes, and actually most insightful, is the interview with claude bessy of catholic discipline, or 'kick-boy' as he was known to slash magazine readers. originally from france, he rants about punk like a dirty old frenchman and clues in viewers to many aspects of the punk, or diy, attitude to music, politics, and life in general. darby crash of the germs comes off as a complete idiot most of the time, but the germs' performance of manimal is pretty decent, complete with a young pat smear. black flag's performance with chavo pederast on vocals (it was filmed a couple of years before henry rollins joined the band) is decent, and x and fear give the best performances in the movie. look out for the interviews with the young punk kids. you'll hear some of the funniest things you have ever heard in a documentary. highly recommended.

if i assume that you know what this film is about, i am also forced to assume that you've come to this review knowing that you will probably watch it regardless of what i say. if all this rings true - read on - you are likely to find some consonance with at least part of this review. if you're undecided, or not really entirely certain what happened in the late '70s and early '80s in the urban and suburban youth music culture, you should probably read one of the reviews which pretends to be objective instead.although i didn't grow up in california, the american punk scene was the first music scene i ever truly lived in. at the height of the hardcore i was immersed in from about 1979-1981 everybody had a band and the only common denominators between bands and indeed members of their audiences were:* the rejection of conformity* tolerance and enjoyment of difference* a desire to have fun - hard and fasthairstyles, politics, dislike of authority figures, and violent slam-dancing were not integral to what i experienced, though there were certainly cliques or factions who tended to be intolerant of those who did not dress, speak or act "punk" enough. and there was often a certain amount of unearned credit extended from some of these cliques to those who tried really hard to live down to the fascistic paradigm of anarchic, self mutilating, angry young cop-haters. although the interviews with audience punks in penelope spheeris' excellent cal-punk documentary "decline of western civilization" present a very narrow view of the subculture some of us enjoyed, the interviews with the bands, club owners, promoters and even the security people are much more representative of at least my own perspective and memories of 'the scene'. nevertheless, it is possible for those who approach this with prejudices about what punk is to experience this film without having their preconceptions challenged. unfortunate as this is, the blame for it rests solely with those who promote, believe in or feel comfortable with stereotypes - not the film-makers. don't blame the messenger. the music presented here is not going to be for everybody - nor even most. it's not the most crude stuff out there, but it's loud, obnoxious, fast, and less concerned with technique than with raw energy. for me, seeing early black flag with ron reyes singing, x, fear and the circle jerks was worth far more than the cost of this hard to obtain film. as much as i like the germs, seeing darby crash for the mess - and the nice guy - that he was left me a bit cold. nevertheless, the scenes of darby playing with his pet tarantula while "shut down" droned on and on in the background were precious. the x interview is also great. spheeris' straightforward documentary style is supplemented by wild pans and zooms during the musical segments. during the interviews, framing is used very nicely to provide context for whatever is being said. considering her experience and the budget, spheeris did as well as anybody could have with this film.recommended for those who appreciate what this film is actually about, and for those who have forgotten those few years of fun, honest, direction-less rebellion before amaerican punk was co-opted into yet another flow within the musical mainstream and the stereotypes became more important than the basic philosophy.

spheeris debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time. and as far as i know it's also the only one that focuses on the l.a. punk explosion of the early eighties. it's all there: not just great, great bands like black flag, fear, x, the germs, whose names may not mean much to you today, but whose influence on today's alternative rock music can not be over-estimated, but also the promoters, the media and first of all the audiences - the punks - all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh, shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy, the anger and the fury these youths put into their music. where is that today? the eighties may have sucked big time when it cames to mainstream music, but the underground was rocking. if you need a proof for that, watch fear's performance in decline. unmatched. great film! how come this is not available on vid, ld or dvd? p.s. the follow-up decline pt. ii is hilarious, too

crackerjack is a funny movie, everyone at the bowlo has seen it and all say the same. the wheel of cheese was a great part of the movie, also the loud speaker "dear mr so and so you have left you right indicator on". or when jack goes home and lays down on the couch and cracks a beer, "bowls is hard work" cracked me up. and when his roommate shows interest by joining the club and calling bingo number. jack buying all the raffle tickets to win the meat tray. bloody great movie if you are into lawn bowls as you can relate to it, if your not a lawn bowler forget it i think. the evans head bowlo would rate as the best club in aus, friendly people, great company.hi to evans head bowlo steve

crackerjack is another classic aussie film. as so many australian films like the castle, the dish and sunday too far away, it goes somewhere that hasn't been widely explored in film before, this time it is the game of lawn bowls and bowling clubs. crackerjack is a much slower paced sports movie than many you will find such as remember the titans or million dollar babybut the characters involved are athletes in their own right. this movie is a show case of a large area of australian culture and features a sport that is popular and on the rise of popularity in australia. mick molloy presents a classic, unforgettable character. it really is a must see.

coming from oz i probably shouldn't say it but i find a lot of the local movies lacking that cohesive flow with a weak storyline. this comedy lacks in nothing. great story, no overacting, no melodrama, just brilliant comedy as we know oz can do it. do yourself a favour and laugh till you drop.

considering the appalling track record of mick molloy since going out on his own, i had rather low expectations of crackerjack. even the promotional posters for the movie had me nervous. in fact, if it wasn't for the fact that i'd received free tickets to the preview, i would have resisted the pressure from the missus (who thinks mick's a hunk - there's a worry) to pay money for it.the first few minutes of the movie had me worried - it starts with one of micks tired "get angry at insignificant things" routines, but that was given a neat touch, which at least made it a little refreshing. the rest of the script was pretty good, and very light hearted - even the typical mick molloy (and judith lucy) humour was delivered well and whilst i never had to pick myself up from the aisles, it generated a lot more chuckles that i was expecting (and it was consistant).there's nothing new in the plot - pretty predictable, but it moved along quickly between one-liners and other jokes - i never felt it harboured on any element too long or too short; mick must have worked hard on polishing his script. there were a one or two "late show" in-jokes, and one or two jokes that only melbournians would get - but certainly there's plenty of generic stuff in there for a wider audience.something that i found disappointing was the relative unfunnyness of john clarke - he just didn't seem to work as the bad guy, but that doesn't detract from the movie too much.over all, i enjoyed this australain comedy, and was pleasantly entertained for the duration of the movie. i left the cinema with a decent sized grin - a pretty hard thing for an australian comedy to do in my books. 7.5/10

while not for everyone, crackerjack is a delight to watch, with tongue planted firmly in cheek. the likeable character of jack simpson, played by mick molloy, is scamming the local "bowlo" for free parking and making a couple of dollars on the side, selling the parking space to work colleagues. when the bowling club members need to raise some money to save their club, they call upon jack to join their bowling team and play competition bowls.filled with aussie charm, the laconic wit of mick molloy is showing through (he also co-wrote the script) reminding this viewer of his earlier work in radio. perfect aussie casting with bill hunter as jack's bowling mentor stan coombes, john clarke (of the games fame) as the ruthless businessman and rival bowls club owner bernie fowler, with samuel johnson as jack's flatmate dave, and judith lucy as the jaded journalist, nancy.initially, i figured only fans of molloy would like this flick but judging by the number of the blue rinse set exiting the cinema chuckling, this is a film for everyone.

a very comical but down to earth look into the behind the scene workings of an australian bowling club. the way they deal with various problems such as takeovers, memberships and general running of the club, not to mention the car parking dilemma was well scripted.

a fairly typical australian movie where the underdog saves the day inspite of himself. i guess there is no real reason to see this pic if you have seen "the castle" or "the dish". it still leaves you with a positive feeling at the end and it as good or better than most hollywood stuff.

i was reticent to see this flick before reading the external reviews and user comments posted here. why? firstly because mick malloy's humour can (in my humble opinion) be pretty crass and over the top, evidenced by his ill fated shemozzle of a television show some years back. and secondly because good aussie comedy films are sadly as rare as the tassie tiger. sensibly mick has restrained his natural comedic exuberance in this surprisingly watchable movie. who would have thought that a bowls club would provide the setting for one of the funniest australian films in years. the cast is excellent with familiar local old timers all putting in believable performances. interesting to see john clarke playing the villain in this piece. it's a one dimensional part but jc still adds a touch of class, as always. good to see judith lucy also getting a guernsey or should i saw bowls uniform on the big screen. she's a real talent, pity a number of her retorts were expletives. her own material is a lot wittier. interesting character though. bowls reporter on a local rag. how low on the journalist food chain can one get!!crackerjack may not be the funniest film i've seen this year but it's certainly an enjoyable diversion, well worth a look. lots of other people obviously agree with me as it's headed to be the biggest grossing australian film this year. good to see someone finally make a quirky, gentle comedy without trying to sledgehammer the laughs like so many australian 'comedies' before it. finally a bit of trivia. if you're wondering which aussie rules team mick supports check out the flag on his workstation. also look out for his old partner in crime, tony martin doing the announcing in the final bowls scene.  

crackerjack, starring mick malloy & judith lucy - both part of the cast in the early 90's saturday night comedy show "the late show", bill hunter, an australian movie icon and john clarke, who we still see regularly on australian tv along side brian dawe.crackerjack, losely is about a guy in his early 30's (jack simpson, played by mick malloy) who pays his yearly memebership at the local bowls club in order to get a few car park spaces for which he uses himself and rents out to others as cheap inner city parking.the club falls on hard times, and pulls all the resources and memebers together it can, jack gets a phone call telling him to turn up to next saturday's bowls match or lose his membership (and conseqently his car park space)i wont spoil the rest, but the film is funny, light hearted and contains everything a good aussie film should.if your not australian, then some of the jokes and humour will no doubt baffle you, if you are an aussie - do yourself a favor and sit yourself down to crackerjack.. its now available on dvd, i already have my copy!10/10.. awesome flick!

this is the first feature film from australian comedian mick molloy. mick wrote the film with his brother richard with help from john clarke, another comedian and actor. mick & john also have starring roles along with several other iconic australian actors - bill hunter, frank wilson et al. the basic premise of the movie is that slimy jack simpson (mick molloy) has become a member of a lawn bowls club for the sole purpose of getting a free car park near his work. the club is in dire financial straits and calls on jack to help. john clarke plays the clubs arch nemesis - he is trying to take the club over and turn it into a "poker machine slum" jack and the other club members band together to try and save the club with many funny twists and turns and jacks eventual redemption. this is quite a clever little movie. it is well above mick molloys usual gutter humor. it is pretty well written and well acted. the older aussie actors are brilliant (bill hunter, frank wilson monica maughan and ors) the film meanders along rather then going at break neck pace, but that adds to the charm of the movie. there is low level coarse language.

crackerjack is a simple but feelgood movie where the good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad and the central character is tempted by both sides.the combination of the central character being played by mick malloy and the central setting being the local lawn bowls clubs drew an unusually broad crowd ranging from large numbers of teenagers to large numbers of senior citizens - and all laughed at the comedy.as would be expected of a movie with mick malloy and judith lucy there was quite a bit of swearing, but it was not overdone and the audience i sat with certainly enjoyed it!mick malloy did a good job as the lazy bloke who joined the bowls club (three times) simply to get parking spaces (one for himself and two for leasing to others at a premium) but who has everything fall down on him when he is required to play or lose his membership.judith lucy does a fine job as his local journalist/love-interest and there are fabulous performances from bill hunter, frank wilson, monica maughan, lois ramsey and many others.john clarke's dour role as the bad guy is not one of his funniest but he gives a solid performance.the not so subtle swipes at pokies provide a bit of a serious note to this otherwise light comedy.i'm sure that those who enjoyed the castle and the dish would also enjoy this movie.

worth it for: if not for mick molloy's work, then for judith lucy. she brings her usual classy style of unbridled foul-mouthery to the role, and steals the show in parts.imho: i'm not much of an autograph hunter, but i have collected 3. the first is samuel l. jackson's, the other 2 are in this movie: tony martin and mick molloy. altho martin only makes a cameo appearance, molloy not only stars but co-wrote and co-produced this flick. i've been a fan of their for years now (apparently i was the only one laughing during the on-set urination in the first episode of the short lived the mick molloy show), so i went in to this with high expectations. i'm happy to say i wasn't disappointed. with mick doing a lot of the work on this thing there's plenty of his usual trademarks. phrases like "blow it out your arse" and "these bowls are s***house" are all over the place, aswell as plenty of winnie blues being sucked down. it's also the sort of stupid, original story you'd expect from someone like him. this is like one of those cliqued, american, sporting comedies where they make a baseball team out of prisoners or something. but rather than trying to make a dull american sport like baseball or gridiron interesting, this movie focuses on a sport usually left to grey army: lawn bowls. but the main difference between this and other sporting type comedies is that this is actually very, very funny. what's even better is that even tho the subject of this movie is a young lout joining an old folks game, it's never insulting to the elderly, and it never gets sickeningly soppy or anything. it's just good laughs at genuine 1972 prices. mick is great in the first real acting role i've ever seen him in, as is judith lucy and the rest of the cast, but then most of them have had a lot of practice... this is the best australian comedy i've seen in a long time. go see it and learn the joys of lawn bowls!it's a bit like: major league?score: 8 / 10

i was very impressed with the latest production from mick molloy. as a fan of his, i was used to a different kind of humour than displayed here. he wisely opted with a more subtle, broad style of comedy in crackerjack, rather than his usual low brow, in-your-face ramblings. it is, at times, inconsistent and un-even, but a decent script works past that, and makes for some entertaining viewing. directed by paul moloney (who has directed almost every australian tv series imaginable), crackerjack tells the story of jack simpson, a bloke that belongs to his local bowls club for the sole reason of parking. when the club hits financial trouble, he is forced to bowl competitively in an attempt to raise the funds to save the club from becoming a poker machine haven. a familiar, and successful formula, that is handled well. there is no denying that the film owes it's success to the great casting of molloy. he seemed to have a great rapport with samuel johnson, and excellent chemistry with judith lucy, and while the character is probably not a far stretch from his own personality, you can't help but wonder why he hadn't tried his arm at film earlier. to smooth out the in-experienced cast, the delightful frank wilson and bill hunter support, and often steal their scenes. they are two fine actors and the pair cruise through their roles with ease. had it not been for the huge success of 'my big fat greek wedding', crackerjack would have made it to number 1 at the australian box office, but when you consider what he film is about and who is involved, even making it to number 2 was an outstanding effort. all in all, a witty, feel-good movie. great cast, great crew, and a great soundtrack, combine to make one of the better australian films of 2002. 7/10.

sharky's machine is easily one of burt reynolds best efforts. it also stands as one of the best contemporary crime dramas. erotic and violent, the movie distinguishes itself by setting the story in atlanta, and delivering a chaotic detective case, to you(the viewer), on a silver platter. dedicated and determined, sharky must stop the murder of dominoe, a lovely lady of the night, who's clientel is anything but ordinary. before long, sharky's crimefighting machine uncovers a conspiracy of the highest order, which threatens to corrupt the inner body of atlanta. as a resident of metro atlanta, i recall the excitement in town during the movie's production. sharky's machine goes to great lengths to give an accurate portrayal of atlanta. twenty years removed and 2,000,000-more people later, the film stands the test of time. trust me, atlanta has not changed. one of the highlights of the picture is dar robinson's daring stunt(a classic, symbolic ending). it was even featured on that's incredible, abc's reality show of the period. it's just too bad that hollywood does not make enough films like this one. kick back, each your popcorn, and watch sterling silver cinema action.

sharky's machine is a crime drama set in early 80's atlanta. it stars burt reynolds as a renegade cop who is hellbent on stopping crime and corruption in his city. the story is about a dirty politician who is at the top of a crime ring that has been brining the city to it's knees. sharky's link to bringing down this syndicate is a high-priced hooker that he falls for during the course of the movie. the action sequences are well done for the early 80's and the soundtrack / score are pretty good. the acting is b-level but this is a pretty decent film to have in your dvd collection.overall 7/10peace buggieblade

burt reynolds stars as an undercover cop who is after a crime boss.. rachel ward as the high price call girl he falls for..burt does well in this role and i think he would've done well in more roles like this..rachel ward is beautiful and sexy in her part..good pacing and story but something is missing in the equation.. on a scale of one to ten..7

meester sharky, you look so ... normal. you would never get a table in this fancy cocktail restaurant/bistro. i, on the other 'and eat grapes and pate 'ere every day. you like my fur coat with all the fine trimming? my enormous golden rings of gold? or maybe you like these blonde, 'ow you say?, bombshells, who are all qualified in aerobics and naked petanques, who decorate my long, maroon velvety sofa like so many soft boiled larks on a plate of pan fried foie gras and figs. you like? you can't have! zey are all mine.you will never possess 'er as i possessed 'er. domino was the best, apart from maman. you do not understand the art of lovemaking. just look at your inferior moustache. it is almost funny to me, non, to think of that ludicrous protuberance on your silly face, as you snuffle around domino's love hillock like the piggy seeking the truffle in the forest, the forest heaving and swaying in the hot winds of desire! you lose again sharky.when i make love to the women zey know, sharky, zey know. zey learn, zey learn until zey become the teacher. not nano-maths, the arts of love. domino was the seedling which i watered. i watered her so very often. everywhere sharky. her scented petals, her proud stalk, everywhere. she will wither under your ridiculous hose, like the soufflé removed from the oven five minute too soon.i must go now sharky, you bore me so with your disgraceful behaviour. it is you who will be flushed down le pissoir like the smelly thing.bon chance!

without a doubt, the best burt reynolds film ever! even better than smokey and the bandit. this was probably the first real bloody cop thriller of the 1980s and delivered the perfect blend of humor, action, mystery and style that is missing in today's films.this one has it all: a psychotic henry silva jacked up on pcp, $1,000 a night call girls, ninja assassins and burt reynolds getting his fingers sliced off, one by one, with a butterfly knife. the film is based on the novel by william diehl who also wrote primal fear, another one of my all-time favorites. this movie is worth watching just to see henry silva get shot six times, crash through a window, and fall thirty stories from the top of an atlanta high-rise. this is probably the coolest stunt in hollywood history, performed by legendary stuntman dar robinson.robinson also played "moke" in the elmore leonard movie stick, also starring burt reynolds. stick features another great dar robinson stunt. robinson falls from a miami apartment building and unloads all six shots from a .44 magnum on his way down. very cool stuff.sharky's machine is my favorite police drama. i never understood why this film flopped the way it did. if burt did more films like this, he would've built a better reputation for himself. he proves to be a talented director with sharky, as well as a gifted actor. burt is supported by brian kieth, charles durning, bernie casey, richard libertini, rachel ward, and everyone's favorite bad guy henry silva. please remake this classic film! get affleck and samuel l. and some other hot actors and you've got a great movie just waiting to be filmed.i give it a 9 out of 10

i think this is one of burts top five movies, along with deliverance, smokey and the bandit, boogie nights and city heat. he also directed this one so he had a talent for that too like his buddy clint eastwood. i wish he made more films like this or even a sequel to sharkys machine than the likes of stroker ace or cannonball run ii. this is a tough, gritty cop thriller with reynolds at the top of his game. having the beautiful rachel ward in it of thorn birds fame helped too. henry silva is the bad guy and he always does a good job at that. the film also a great soundtrack too. i highly recommend this, wish it was on dvd in the uk, an audio commentary from reynolds would be great as well. ***7/10***

an intense, dark action drama with unusually rich support from casey, keith, et. al, many of whom get the best roles of their careers and run with it. the film is oddly shaped -- often the action slows down just to let the characters get caught up in odd but well-done seemingly improved dialogues -- during the stakeouts, almost all of the "machine" get caught up in perfectly delivered humorous monologues -- and reynolds the director deserves mucho credit for having reynolds the star step back and give them room. and unlike most action films, you really get to like the characters, which makes the 2nd half, when their various destinies good and bad unfold, unusually affecting. the combination of character development, brutal violence, a jazzy soundtrack (tarantino must be a fan -- watch this & then "jackie brown" and you'll see what i'm talking about)make this occasionally flawed film (the bad guys are a bit melodramatic) one of the better modern cop films, and in my mind superior to many of the overrated modern noirs such as "body heat" & such.

this is the best thing burt reynolds ever did . . . . nice combination of suspense and humor, with an excellent supporting cast, this is a very well written and credible urban drama with a great sound track as well . . . makes you wonder why reynolds doesn't direct more movies . . .

great just great! the west coast got "dirty" harry callahan, the east coast got sharky. burt reynolds plays sharky in "sharky's machine" and i enjoyed every minute of it. playing a maverick narcotics cop in atlanta, ga is just what everyone wants. instead of suspension, he's sent to vice squad. like in the dirty harry movies or any other cop movies, the captain is always going to be the jerk. when i was a kid, i was curious what that movie meant "sharky's machine". well i knew who played sharky, i wonder what his machine was. it was his group of fellow cops. after uncovering the murder, he goes all out to find the perp. when it turns out to be a big time mob boss, sharky doesn't play around. when he gets the other prostitute into safety, sharky fights back hard and good despite losing a finger to the thug. and i also like the part where the bad gets blown out of the building through a plate glass window. that was the bomb! randy crawford's "street life" really put the movie in the right mood, and the movie itself is really a great hit to me, always! rating 4 out of 5 stars.

this is burt reynolds'"citizen kane".tragically nothing else he was ever involved in came close to approaching "sharkey's machine".it seemed to me that he put everything he had into it.it is a movie that is in love with movies.the opening sequence where detective sharkey single-handedly rescues a bus-load of hostages is an immensely exciting piece of cinema. everything moves so quickly once it has started to go wrong that it appears to take on a life of its own,a brilliantly achieved effect. it looks cold,tense and dangerous on mr reynolds' streets. the precinct house looks dirty and tired,full of desperate people on both sides of the law,shouting,cursing out,trying to do deals or just stay alive.into this underworld descends the recently demoted sharkey - a reward for a bungled drugs bust(caused by a corrupt cop) - he and his team are part of the vice squad.information they pick up concerning a crooked politician leads them into the world of high-class call girls and ruthless drug barons. watching the apartment of one such call-girl(rachel ward)sharkey falls in love with her portrait on the wall(i know,i know)and when a woman's body is found with its face shot off in one of the rooms,he thinks its her.(well,i did say it was a movie that loved movies). the scene where she walks in on him works beautifully,even if you have seen the original. the film is full of good touches,i particularly like charles durning's war story,subtly acted and shot in sharp contrast to sharkey's abduction and torture which is suitably harsh and brutal. i must mention vittorio gassman and henry silva as two disparate but equally evil brothers with absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever. they are "full on" every time they're on screen and are no loss to society when their time comes,mr silva's end being extra special indeed. as has been mention,this is a clint eastwood movie that clint never made.the biggest compliment i can pay "sharkey's machine" is to point out that in my opinion clint eastwood couldn't have made a better job of it. the soundtrack is of an equally high standard,featuring sarah vaughan,joe williams,julie london,chet baker and other top class artists. randy crawford's "street life" plays behind the title sequence,and i can never hear it without ,in my mind's eye,seeing sharkey striding along the sidewalk. like other correspondents i have never understood why this film was a bit of a flop.i hope it is due for a critical revision,particularly at a time when so many cop movies and shows without a quarter of its energy , freshness and sheer joie de vivre are lauded from the rooftops. if you're ever tempted to think of burt reynolds as a burnt - out one - trick pony,put "sharkey's machine" in your video machine.i promise you won't be disappointed.

while he was great in boogie nights, i think that this was burt reynolds' best performance. he's also a great director and has made a tough, violent movie that doesn't hold back (a hooker's death by 12 gauge) and is an excellent detective story with some great actors (brian keith, bernie casey, etc.) and an outstanding jazz soundtrack. 10 out of 10

burt reynolds' riposte to clint eastwood encroaching on his redneck comedy turf with his orangutan comedies was to make his own dirty harry in chicago-style thriller, sharky's machine. originally intended for john boorman but in the end directed by the star himself, it's an out-and-out commercial package with reynolds a narc who gets busted down to the vice squad (literally - they're in the basement) who sets out to nail a mysterious crime lord who is backing earl holliman as the next governor. you can guess the rest, but while reynolds tends to lose sight of the story at times he has a good eye for individual scenes and almost gets a performance out of rachel ward as the high-class hooker he falls for. the romantic subplot is unusually well developed, there are a couple of good action scenes and some nice touches, such as having vittorio gassman's lookalike villain a mirror image of the hero or reynolds and a killer both staking out a witness from adjacent apartments in the same building. one of the star's better films from his glory days, it's no classic but it makes for a more than efficient saturday night special.

i'm a fan of b grade 80s films in which the hero is a bit of a bad guy, a strong male, who finds love - and this film delivers!towards the finish you do not know how sharky will not be killed (and doesn't he take a beating! realistically portrayed i believe). however he does and it's not via some overdone 'die hard' stunt. the 'past it' team he works with comes together, hence the title. his team are all characters - people on the sideline at work because they don't quite conform. these portrayals are funny and sympathetic - they have a real feeling to them. they're up against an iceman of an assassin, with a good team of his own. the result is a great film noir.

dirty harry goes to atlanta is what burt called this fantastic, first-rate detective thriller that borrows some of its plot from the venerable dana andrews movie "laura." not only does burt reynolds star in this superb saga but he also helmed it and he doesn't make a single mistake either staging the action or with his casting of characters. not a bad performance in the movie and reynolds does an outstanding job of directing it. henry silva is truly icy as a hit-man.detective tom sharky (burt reynolds) is on a narcotics case in underground atlanta when everything goes wrong. he winds up chasing a suspect and shooting it out with the gunman on a bus. during the melee, an innocent bystander dies. john woo's "the killer" replicates this scene. anyway, the atlanta police department busts burt down to vice and he takes orders from a new boss, frisco (charles durning of "oh, brother, where art thou?") in the basement. sharky winds up in a real cesspool of crime. sharky and his fellow detectives arch (bernie casey) and papa (brian keith) set up surveillance on a high-priced call girl dominoe (rachel ward of "after dark, my sweet")who has a luxurious apartment that she shares with another girl.dominoe is seeing a local politician hotchkins (earl holliman of "police woman") on the side who is campaigning for governor but the chief villain, victor (vittorio gassman of "the dirty game") wants him to end the affair. hotchkins is reluctant to accommodate victor, so victor has cocaine snorting billy score (henry silva of "wipeout")terminate dominoe. billy blasts a hole the size of a twelve inch pizza in the door of dominoe's apartment and kills her.sharky has done the unthinkable. during the surveillance, he has grown fond of dominoe to the point that he becomes hopelessly infatuated with her. sharky's mission in life now is to bust victor, but he learns that victor has an informant inside the atlanta police department. the plot really heats up when sharky discovers later that billy shot the wrong girl and that dominoe is still alive! sharky takes her into protective custody and things grow even more complicated. he assembles his "machine" of the title to deal with victor and his hoods.william fraker's widescreen lensing of the action is immaculate. unfortunately, this vastly underrated classic is available only as a full-frame film. fraker definitely contributes to the atmosphere of the picture, especially during the mutilation scene on the boat when the villain's cut off one of sharky's fingers. this is a rather gruesome scene.burt never made a movie that surpassed "sharky's machine."

this was one of those films i would always come across (be it on tv or cheap dvd), but never struck me to give it a shot as i thought i wasn't missing out on much. it was on one night and i thought oh well why not. a good decision too, as i would kick myself for taking so long to get around to it. for me it left me impressed, as it's up there with burt reynold's best features ('deliverance', 'white lightning' and 'boogie nights') and streams back to those 70s/80s gritty, hardboiled urban crime thrillers that weren't afraid to be forebodingly obscure and go out of their way to set-up characters, pack-it with realistically brutal force and effectively incorporate the local locations (atlanta being the case here) to the fold with grounded photography. in certain shades it kind of reminded me of 'dirty harry', but that's loosely. however it's saucily honed blues score with its simmering kicks, funky shifts and unhinged sounds, very much had me thinking of lalo schifrin's pulsating score he orchestrated for 'dirty harry'. the music soundtrack on the other hand is hit or miss.sgt. tom sharky was an atlantic narcotic agent before a slip-out during a bust saw him demoted to vice work. along with his new squad they come across a prostitution ring, which catches their interest due to fact it's owned by one hard-to-track and to convict crime lord. what they dig up involves a prominent government figure and a call-girl which can give them some important names, but they must get to her before she's made a target.burt reynold's acts, but also directs in an unyieldingly firm and muscular fashion which would suit his laconically hard-nosed performance and gerald di pego's thematically hard-bitten and taut screenplay (that was adapted from william diehl's novel). well he does show some sort of heart/insightful thoughts amongst that armor within the scenes involving the fetchingly able british actress rachel ward, be it the stake-out scenes when he's watching her from another building (and slowly becoming infatuated by her) to when they finally come together, but these latter interactions mid-way through do slow up the momentum but give it noir like strokes. the performances are fairly spot on with reynold's formulating a great rapport with exceptional actors charles durning, earl holliman, brian keith, richard libertini and bernie casey. the scathing profanity and witty dialogues between these guys were a blast. as for the corrupt villains, vittorio gassman builds imposing strength and power, but it's henry silva (who seems born for these roles) icily cunning and unstoppable turn that makes the show. where his appearance seems to outline things to come and help them fall into place. plus his adrenaline-filled and violent cat and mouse climax with sharky and his team is brilliantly done.the exciting action passages might be quick and dry, but remain lethally violent like an immensely teeth-grinding interrogation sequence. some handy, old fashion filming techniques add to the suspense. the intriguing material keeps it quite tactical being character derived, but when we think its smooth sailing it offers up a blunt surprise or two along with some intensely brunt confrontations.

burt reynold's direct's and star's in this great cop film, reynold's play's the sharkey of the title, who is a tough cop whilst working in undercover a drug bust goes wrong, and is demoted to vice, the machine of the title refer's to the motley crew reynold's's assemble's to bring down a crooked governor who is involved in high class prostitution cocaine and contract murder,the motley crew is played by brian keith, blackploitaion favorite bernie casey, richard libertini,(as alway's quirky as an ace sounds-man) charle's durning, as the chief, the beautiful english rose rachael ward play's dominoe a $1000 dollar's a night hooker whom reynold's's protect's and eventually fall's for, when staking out an apartment used by the governor.italian actor vittorio gassman, play's the high stake's pimp, who has a deadly gang of triad's at his disposal, and henry desilva, play's his psychotic brother hit man who is highly strung on prescription painkiller's and angel dust,the action packed finale see's the remaining member's of the 'machine' engaged in a deadly shootout with desilva, which culminate's in one the most spectacular stunt's ever put to celluloid,alas hollywood has ran out of idea's and is contemplating a remake of sharky's machine! why bother a 25th anniversary special edition dvd would be ideal, not a silly ass remake,

that's how burt reynolds describes this film, which happens to be his best ever. he plays tom sharky, a vice detective who's on the trail of an international mobster (vittorio gassman) and the man he's financing to be the next governor of georgia (earl holliman). in the novel by william diehl, the story is more complex because the guy's running for president. this is a very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two. the filming in downtown atlanta and the peachtree plaza hotel sets the mood just right for the story. reynolds doesn't do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films. he's very serious here, especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets demoted for a dope bust that goes wrong. at times though, the movie plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with burt trying to get close to the mobster's woman. only towards the end of the film does the violence get cranked up that leads to the bang bang climax. just like the great jazz score in dirty harry by lalo schifrin, sharky's machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including chet baker, julie london, flora purim & buddy de franco, the manhattan transfer, doc severinson, sarah vaughan and joe williams. al capps handles the score with magic. this movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever. check it out.score, 8 out of 10 stars

sharky's machine finds burt reynolds as a narcotics cop who after a failed buy and bust that wasn't his fault, but that got a few people killed in it, he finds himself demoted to the vice squad in atlanta.the prestige is hardly as good as the narcotics beat, but it does have its fringe benefits. one night after a roundup of working girls where one of their books falls into their hands, the guys ask for surveillance on rachel ward's place. she's an expensive item, servicing both notorious mobster vittorio gassman and law and order gubernatorial candidate earl holliman.their surveillance however records a murder and the rest of the film is sharky and his new colleagues from vice trying to solve this prestige case.though it's a burt reynolds film and those usually have some humor to them, the comedy is kept in check as the film turns as deadly serious as dirty harry. it was reported in fact that clint eastwood was offered this film.look for some good performances by fellow vice cops bernie casey and brian keith and by henry silva the coked up brother of gassman who does the dirty work of the organization and loves his job.it's not a bad film, a mixture of dirty harry and laura. why laura? you'll have to see sharky's machine for that answer.

i haven't seen every single movie that burt reynolds has ever made, but this one (which i've just finished watching, for the third time) may very well be his best! it suffers only from some slow stretches; burt perhaps tried to make it more "arty" than it should have been. on the other hand, he managed to avoid many of the usual cliches in the presentation of the "tough cop" role he plays (notice, for example, the scene in which he attempts to kiss rachel ward for the first time, or the fear he expresses just before the final showdown with the indestructible henry silva). in fact, silva and those two ninja assassins are three of the most memorable villains of cop thrillers of the 80s. the film also has some offbeat touches, a surprising amount of humor, a brutal and gripping fistfight and many well-directed shots. (***)

the jazz soundtrack makes this seem like a clint eastwood movie.in fact the whole thing strikes me as burt doing clint. the story is good and the movie is full of one liners that i carry with me to this day. (reynolds to bad guy: i'm gonna pull the chain on you pal, because you're f'n up my town. and you wanna know the worst part? you're from outta state!)highlights: the technics 1500b reel to reel is nice set dressing for audiophiles!charles durning coming unglued while listening to wiretap tapes of prostitutes having (sort of) phone sex. (you'd have to see it, trust me, it's hilarious.)brian keith plays against type as a tough guy. (and does it well!)bernie casie's preoccupation with zen.rachel ward. wow! (where'd she go?)doc severinsen and the tonight show band play their rears off as usual. (joe william's guests on vocals. manhattan transfer re-recorded "route 66".) the soundtrack lends class to the whole affair.need i say more? it might be reynold's best film ever. (yeah, he plays himself, as usual, but it works!)enjoy!

the above profile was written by me when i used the nick of oldwerewolf56 which is still my email address. i still believe andy devine's character of frisky is the best twilight zone's episodes ever and i watch this episode at least once a year as i consider frisby to be a fortunate man as he has many friends who love him dearly. in case many of you are too young to remember, i'm 61, andy devine hosted a children's entertainment show in the 50's i believe called andy's gang. on it he had three assistants: a cat named midnight who played the violin, a mouse named squeaky who played an a hand organ and a devilish toad named froggy who's could appear and disappear at will embarrassing many of andy's funny guest stars like billy gilbert.

one of the few comedic twilight zones that's actually really good. we have floyd the barber from andy griffith show,the stock in trade old geezer dude from many old westerns,and lovable old frisby. it also has that cool spacecraft interior that i believe was used in the sci fi classic forbidden planet.or else the day the earth stood sill.plus the new guys in town are driving an exotic renault(i think) sports car back in the days when european automobiles were known as "foreign jobs" in the u.s.. the whole idea of harmonica as weapon is a hoot.and the fact that frisby's buddies love him despite being the fact he's a total bs artist is a heartwarming moment.

i always loved that scratchy voiced guy in all those westerns. he was the sidekick (jingles) in the wild bill hickock show back in the fifties. in this he has the perfect vehicle for his wonderful bragging character. he is harmless and no one believes him, but he is non-flustered and goes on anyway. when you have a guy like this, there's no challenging because the details aren't there to quibble with. of course, in this episode, he is taken on board a space ship by a group of aliens who have no sense of humor and believe everything they hear. they don't have the word lie in their vocabularies. as it turns out, he is so insufferable that they can't handle him; and then, of course, there is the secret weapon. see this just to watch andy.

cliche romance drama movie with very simple plot but very good cinematography and script.the screenplay,directing and acting was also good.the flow of the movie is kind of manipulative in order to bring the audience to tears through the excellent love music and circumstance which works but later on after the movie,makes one feel raped in a way.jones makes her character very memorable and lovable though.a deeper story could have reaaly taken this movie to a higher level but still,the movie delivers for it's genre.only for hopeless romantics,big love story fans,big soap drama fans,50's cinemascope cinematography fans and fans of the lead actors.....

this movie is the best one forever upon the warm feelings of this real love story during the korean war by the story of hy sun the eurasian doctor and mark elliot an american corespondent at the shadow of different habits between east and west upon his quotation in the love scene between two lovers when he invited her to dance (the relationship between east and west must be close) in spite of chinese habits and customs that destiny made their great role by appointing between them to replace the pains for both (elliot suffered from failure marriage ) and (hy sun suffered from the harmful shoot of her husband by chinese communists at the time of mao ze dung in 1949).she could not stop the decision of destiny in spite of her practical profile because love has a magnetic spirit for everyone seek for happiness , soul and brilliant memory as the final quotation by the voice of elliot after his death and the sadness receive for hy sun for this hard situations when she went to the hill the source of this love under the tree to say goodbye for his body and live with his soul among their souvenirs.

on a second viewing, this is still a wonderful romance that is, in my opinion, much better than the film it came paired with on my 2-dvd set, the leo mccarey weepie classic "an affair to remember". yet it seems to have fallen out of favour slightly (only a 6.6 rating here on imdb, and dismissed by many critics as "gooey slush"). how sad, because this is an intelligent romantic drama with very good work by the two leads, jennifer jones and william holden. if anything the film should be well-remembered for the gorgeous colour cinematography and the unforgettable musical score. i don't much like valentine's day but it gave me an excuse to watch this movie again, and i'm glad of it. while i still think holden's character death is too heavily foreshadowed, taking suspense out of the final scenes, this film is very moving and i really enjoy it.

after many, many years i saw again this beautiful love story, thinking about how would i, half a century after, react to a film which made so many girls cry and sigh at that time, when i was just an male adolescent trying to understand women's behaviors, in a small city in brazil.this time, however, what caught my attention in the film was something very different, namely the insistence with which the physician dr. han suyin (jennifer jones) makes clear to the journalist mark elliott (william holden) her special ethically condition as an eurasian. in fact, she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship, repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a "occidental way", provided that, by doing so, she is not betraying her chinese side. its seems to the spectator that suyin is eagerly making efforts to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture, for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempts to control them.therefore, suyin's attitudes always leave poor elliott  a determined, brave and extremely practical man  anxious and perplexed, without knowing how much importance to give to her words. for him, whose love for her is plain and simple, the situation is totally clear: if we love each other, let us make a couple and begin immediately a life together. "not so fast", is what she seems, verbally and non-verbally, to answer him all the time.in fact, suyin's chinese portion would never allow her such a level of pragmatism. and, as she goes on and on reinforcing this much aimed equilibrium between those two worlds inside herself, she also frequently signals to him that also a very peculiar trait of chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind, namely the constant "raids" on the real world by invisible beings from an spiritual or non-physical world. for suyin is always alerting elliott about how dangerous is life, not because of any objective and concrete threat (as would be the perpetuation of the english colonialism or the eminence of a japanese invasion), but due to the threats of plenty of cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical beings over the poor, fearful and vulnerable human beings.in fact, it looks like a whole bunch of chinese deities are permanently on the watch to make people's life totally miserable. because of that, mothers must dress their precious male babies in girls clothes, so that they are not taken away by jealous gods; everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away, in order to avoid their covering the sight of the moon; peasants are advised that they should shout loudly "the rice is bad! the rice is bad!" to protect their crops from being stolen by deities; and, in a funeral, it is recommended that the dead's family be isolated from the other people by curtains, so that the gods don't take advantage of their sorrow and fragility.in other words, suyin introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence, as if a rather disturbing pantheon of malign and sadistic gods are always on the verge of negatively interfering with the most banal acts in anyone's daily life.as the story takes place in hong kong in 1949, it should be clear that china really was, at that time, almost a semi-feudal society, while the country from which elliott had come from was not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that, launched by the usa after the first oil shock in 1973, took charge of the whole world. therefore, at least in one aspect, both sides of suyin's eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be today.a lot of history came into being since those old days. as to china, the main fact is that, after several phases of a communist regime, the country finally reached, in the last two decades, the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly described as state capitalism. and, what happened to that old spirituality that so much enthralled suyin in hong kong, in 1949, and with which she used to impress so much an impassioned elliott, under that tree on the hill behind the hospital? it is gone, completely gone! in brief, if that story took place today, elliott would not find it necessary to go to china to propose to suyin in the presence of the third uncle and her entire family. in fact, both men would now be incomparably closer to one another, in their huge pragmatism, talking business as usual!

the cure is one of the few movies i rated 10 out of 10. i mean, everything is flawless for me in this motion picture. i saw it almost a year ago, and yet i remember many of the scenes, especially the final touching scene that comes with the credits.the two boy actors clearly gave everything they could and this greatly contributes the excellent storyline, making the film perfect.the message is clear - friendship, and it's displayed throughout the whole thing.i have nothing more to say here. simplicity is one of the things i love so much about this film. and of course, it's fun and moving at the same time, suiting people of any age.10/10, nicely done!

"the cure" is a very touching and poignant drama. the film focuses on two neighborhood boys who become good friends. one of the boys has aids. the boys become good friends despite erik's apprehensiveness at first. the film shows the boys journey to discover "the cure", which is in ohio according to "the national examiner", and how it affects their relationship. the acting is wonderful (i have never seen annabella sciorra do better), and the movie is just plain touching. i couldn't stop crying with the shoe scene. this is a good tearjerker. keep the kleenex nearby. 8/10

this was truly a heart warming movie. it is filled with so many messages. loyalty, friendship, sickness, death, and the paranoia society has concerning anything they don't understand. i have shed a few tears during certain movies, but this movie kept the tears flowing.

this movie was a modern day scarface.it had me on my toes.this movie is one of those rare epic films that makes you want a sequel.i especially liked damian chapa his performance deserved an academy award,which he deserved for his performance in blood in blood out.the only thing i didn't like was the behind the scenes because it didn't show the intensity that the movie had,and i would have like to have seen less narrated scenes.but the movie was great and it is in my top ten movies of all time.plus the acting was great there wasn't a bad scene in the movie,i loved it ,jennifer tilly was perfect as well as all of the cast.i can't see how anyone wouldn't like this movie it was a great.definitely a must see.

this bravo special is one of the most purely entertaining things i've ever seen on tv. unlike me first & the gimme gimmes (the worlds foremost punk-supergroup/cover-band), the dan band really must be seen to be appreciated.on paper, the dan band is just a one-joke act- guy sings girly songs and inserts gratuitous profanity into the lyrics. if you listen to their "dan band live" cd, that's all you'll get, and it'll get old quick. (i only bought it because it had some songs that weren't on the tv special.) but what's made dan finnerty a hollywood cult hero is his amazing stage presence. this guy owns his audience for every second he's onstage. and the backup singers are a large part of the visual punchline as well. as for the actual band- they stay out of sight for the most part, but are certainly much more energetic and enthusiastic than your typical lounge-act backing band. hopefully, a dvd version will be released soon- there were almost certainly some songs cut and although the heavy censoring adds a bit of unintentional humor, it also removes the intentional humor.if there is any sense in the world, the vegas casino owners will soon be fighting over who can build dan his own showroom faster."re-------member my name...fame!"

okay, when it comes to plots, this film is far from believable and also a bit silly. yet despite its many deficiencies, the film manages to work--provided you turn off your brain and just let yourself enjoy the zaniness of it all. if you can't, then you probably won't like this film very much at all.in one of the oddest plots of the 1930s, robert montgomery plays a guy living near the arctic circle at a wireless station. how exactly he came to such a remote outpost is uncertain but into this very, very lonely and isolated existence come a steady string of guests--even though it had been years since he'd seen anyone but eskimos.first, reginald owen and myrna loy arrive when their plane crashes. they are supposedly on their way to montreal--how they got that far off course is beyond belief! reginald is a stuffy and dull fellow who is really worried about montgomery, since robert hasn't seen a woman in a very long time and owen seems in constant dread that montgomery is out to steal loy for himself. as for montgomery, that's exactly what his plans are! for the longest time, you never really understand why loy is engaged to owen--since he is about as appealing as soggy bread.soon, loy and montgomery fall in love but this is all for naught when, out of the blue again, montgomery's old fiancée arrives to announce she's there to marry him!! considering that for over two years she never wrote and refused to follow him, montgomery naturally assumed the relationship was over--but the chipper and annoying fiancée's sudden arrival is enough to destroy the plans loy and montgomery were making.how all this is resolved is something you can just see for yourself. as for the film, that the plot is very silly and contrived--i can't defend this. but, it also is pretty funny and charming and i see this film as a kooky comedy that is just a step or two below contemporary films like bringing up baby. silly, slight but also very charming. it's worth seeing despite not being especially believable.

the turner classic movie channel has spent the month of january doing the films of one of my favorite actors, robert montgomery. his films are mostly rarely watched these days, except for those that were atypical for most of his career - meaning that the roles that frequently reappear on television are they were expendable, the lady in the lake, june bride, night must fall, the saxon charm, ride the pink horse, rage in heaven, the earl of chicago (in short the films he fought to get the roles in because they were not the usual comic fluff he usually appeared in). it's ironic that nowadays when one thinks of montgomery's career it is the films that were mostly made after 1937 that are pushed - the ones that broke the original image that mgm and louis b. mayer pushed. the pity of this is that montgomery was a gifted comedian, and saved many films from being routine.petticoat fever is one such film. made in 1936 with picadilly jim and trouble for two it was a banner year of good performances by montgomery, and helped lead to his being able to convince the powers that be at mgm to allow him to play "danny" in night must fall the next year.petticoat fever is set in labrador, and montgomery is a weather station operator there named dascom dinsmore. he has been living there for five years, and has not been in the company of a woman (except for inuit women) for most of that time. he has a girlfriend of sorts named clara (winifred shotter) who he sort of proposed to, but it's been two years since he has heard from her, so that he believes she has given up on him.dinsmore's world is rocked when sir james felton and irene campton (reginald owen and myrna loy) show up. they were flying to toronto for a business meeting that felton was to address. felton is engaged to campton, but dinsmore finds her enchanting...and gradually she finds him equally attractive. certainly the pompous, self-important, and hopelessly inept felton is no competition (it is a measure of owen's acting that he keeps the character entertaining even if one finds it hard to believe such a boob is a canadian captain of industry).there is something surreal about this film - probably due to the original play. while the "labrador" scenery is quite phony looking it does serve it's purpose for the comedy (witness th polar bear sequence). but the height of the surrealism is the dinner dinsmore serves his guests, a dinner of "pemmican steaks", which owen eats with real gusto. owen (a minor noble as a baronet) is dressed in normal clothing - a winter suit for the climate). but montgomery is dressed in his suit of evening dress (as though attending a ball at the embassy). loy, seeing him dress up, likewise puts on a gown. they are being served by dinsmore's servant - assistant, the inuit kimo (otto yamaoka), who is wearing a suit of evening dress too - it turns out that it is owen's! owen, who earlier insisted that dinsmore change into clothing more suitable to his station, is the only person who is improperly dressed for this dinner!! montgomery was mgm's most elegant actor in a tuxedo or evening dress (franchot tone was the his closest rival). it is a toss-up in movie if montgomery or fred astaire was the more elegant figure in such suits. hard to decide.the course of love does not move smoothly in comedy or drama. clara shows up (we are tipped off too early about this at the start of the film when we see her on an icebound ship). will dinsmore break with clara? will irene break with felton? the film is funny, and loy and montgomery make a nice couple. they had appeared together in one other film, and both were in separate scenes in a second, before this movie. but this would be their last film together.one last interesting point - at the start of the film when the credits are shown, you see illustrations of men and women in comic situations. they are based on the art work of john held jr., the great cartoonist/illustrator of the 1920s and 1930s - who was the recorder of the flapper and "jazz age". it's an unusual choice - as it has absolutely nothing to do with the film's plot or labrador.

this is a hard movie to come by in the us, but if you can find it -- and you're interested in the life and music of percy aldridge grainger, you're in for a treat. it's quite historically accurate. richard roxborough's grainger looks astoundingly like grainger at this period in time. emily woof's karen holten is quite a bit prettier than the real karen, but that was an inaccuracy i was happy to discover (!). i think what really struck me though, was how well roxborough captured grainger's outrageous personality. barbara hershey's rose was also a treasure. if she looks considerably younger than rose did at that period, it is more than made up for in how well she captured rose's obsession with percy. it's an easy film to recommend. (i should note that when she saw "passion" my wife had no particular affinity for (or knowledge of) grainger and his music, but she was totally captivated by the film.

this isn't far away from the trash that bollywood normally makes but there's just something really good about it.the title song is one of bollywoods best and is haunting throughout. this is one of the films (along with baazigar - a must see bollywood film) that made shah rukh khan and it's for this you have to check it out.other reviews give away the story - it is a fairly basic idea - sharukh definitely stands out and one of his final expressions right at the end made me give this film an extra star.its fairly cheesy but definitely worth watching if you are new to bollywood or not! 8/10

darr, although a copy of some hollywood flick, is one of the best films i have seen. it is not only beautifully portrayed but also has great songs and beautiful scenery. shahrukh is his usual self. his expressions and voice matches his character. i was pleasantly surprised by sunny deol's portrayal in the film. he is a bit romantic and lovable in the film, unlike his other characters in his other films.at times you feel like justice hasn't been done to his character. sunny was intended to be portrayed as the good guy in the film but ends up looking like the villain at the end. juhi chawla is beautiful and bubbly. she is her usual self. in short, a great love story with passion.

darr was a super hit film, which was loved by many peoples. it tells the story of shahrukh khans innocent obsession for juhi, who loves sunny deol. honestly it was a entertaining movie, but if you look carefully its not too realistic. shahrukh khan keeps phoning juhi and tells her that he loves her too bits. he gives an announcement in college that he loves her, and gives her some nice surprises like beautiful photos of her. unfortunately, instead of being flattered that a guy loves her too bits, she gets very very scared. i personally know 100s of people that get pranked by someone, and these people enjoy it, cos they play a long. yash chopra gives us a good film that does entertain, widely because of shah rukh khan's character. sunny deol is suppose to be the main actor, but darr belongs to shah rukh khan delivering a superb performance. shah rukh khan is literally the villain of the movie, but i would of been happy if he got the girl, because he loves her so dearly. sunny deol gives a decent performance, but he beats up all those guys on his own, and survives a brutal knife attack. juhi chawla is cute as ever in a fairly good performance. some good songs including tu mere samne being the best.

darr is an brilliant movie..it is 1 of my favourite films..srk has done a mind blowing job in the movie....this role couldn't have been played by anyone else because this type of role only suits srk...srk plays a mental villain in the film..srk's performance in this movie is the best performance ever in boll wood...srk deserves an honour and an encouraging appeal for his fantastic performance...juhi also delivers an excellent performance..sunny deol looked strong and physically fit in the film..

darr (1993) was an incredible movie. in my opinion, it is one of bollywood's finest. the movie itself triggers feelings of sympathy, fear, confusion, happiness, and sadness. shahrukh's role was unbelievable, in fact he gave obsession a new face. juhi chawla's innocent and girlie character contrasted greatly with shahrukh's fiery and passionate character. sunny deol's role made the "good guy" role seem like the "bad guy" one. the fact that shahrukh, not sunny, captivated the audience's attention proves that everyone has that helpless inner drive to pursue something that's not really in their hands. even though the movie is several years old, it surpasses any recent one. the song "tu mere samne" was full of passion and meaning. his personality fit the role perfectly. he should seriously consider re-starring in a similar film.

this movie is just brilliant, srk's acting is just amazing, the end is so incredibly sad, i cry every time i see this film, it's the kind you never get sick of, and can see again and again, an absolutely amazingly brilliant movie.

watch this movie just to see shahrukh khan say "i love you,k-k-kiran..." it's both heartbreaking and frightening at the same time when he says this, from the beginning to the end. this movie made him famous, and i totally recommend it :d it's highly entertaining, the music's wicked and you will laugh right along with shahrukh here...you'll genuinely feel scared for the hero and heroine and oddly enough you will identify with at least one of the characters. you will feel sad and happy and relieved and afraid at the same time. go see this classic bollywood movie with your good buddies and some lovely food and have a day in. and after you see the movie, have the songs and scenery playing in your mind...forever.

this movie is such a good movie shah ruck khan does a great job as the crazy mad villain who is totally obsessed withthe girl the story is fantastic the acting by allcharacters like the girl and shah ruck and sunny are all fabulous and i really love the first song especially how it comes back at the end oh and its so emotional if your a true shah ruck khan fan you have gotta watch this movie because its the best shah ruck khan movie ever he plays an excellent role and i wish he done more crazy man roles but u have to watch this what so ever this is a really good movie this is a really good movie you have to watch it it is truly amazing you have to watch it it is fabulous i can go on and on about this movie because it is a fun funny scary cool and totally fantastic movie in the world

this was bollywood's answer to fatal attraction and this is a classic film in its own right. juhi chawla was good and so was sunny deol but it was shah rukh khan who shot to fame as the stalker. since then he has become a favourite of the chopra's (dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge, mohhabatein, dil to pagal hai, veer zaara and chak de india). shah rukh at first appears to be a villain but then towards the end you start to sympathize with him. the scripting was superb and the songs were chartbusters. my favourites are too mere samne and jaadu teri nazar.after the dismal failure of the underrated lamhe yash chopra fought back with darr. the dialogues were memorable, the k..k..kiran dialogue is often repeated. since darr yash chopra has slipped bit. dil to pagal hai was bad but he redeemed himself slightly with veer zaara, which was far far better. this was yash chopra's last masterpiece.

i have seen many of shahrukh's movies and this is a very good role for him. he has such versatility, but he mainly stays in positive roles. as rahul, he is very dark and disturbing, yet i found myself sympathizing with him much of the movie. if for nothing else, watch this movie for shahrukh. he plays a very complex and real character very convincingly. the story is very typical and has been done before, but the character development is very strong and entertaining. the opening is a little confusing, but by the end, it doesn't matter. the songs i found very likable and give insight to what characters are thinking. very clever. i think this movie was very good and recommend it to all shahrukh khan fans. it is a must see!

shahrukh khan and yash chopra films have never disappointed. dilwale dulhania le jayenge is a romantic classic. dil to pagal hai was fresh and perfect to watch. mohabbatein remains as one of my favorite movies ever. and veer-zaara was magical. darr, though not the best, is a romantic thriller that is different from the aforementioned movies, but definitely worth a watch. and srk, who blew me away with an excellent performance in baazigar, repeats a villain act. and this time he gets an experienced juhi chawla and sunny deol to support him.before i comment on the acting, it is not just the acting, but the wonderful script that makes it worth a watch. it is the writing that compliments the great acting. the story is gripping, but the characterization is what stands out. the comedy track goes along well. but the movie has the tendency of shifting at romance too much. the viewer is bound to lose interest and you will make a couple of yawns. but the movie is still good.shahrukh khan is brilliant in his author backed role. shahrukh khan once again is sympathetic and cruel. you are bound to cry at the end. juhi chawla is decent. her screams are bound to become annoying after a while. but in facial expression she is excellent. but her ending scene she is brilliant (though she was overshadowed by srk). she has an author backed role that makes her very likable. sunny deol is adequate. his character was very likable, but too perfect. and it gets boring after a while. he does a good job though. anupam kher is really funny, but his role felt a little out of place. tanvi azmi supports well. the songs are enjoyable and come at the right time. jadoo teri nazar (magic at your sight) is my favorite song, and presentation is very 90's film like. tu mere saamne (you are in front of me) and likha hai (written here) are nice love songs. darwaza band kar lo (close the door) is a decent love song also. the instrumental song is danced to perfection as well as the naughty wedding song solah button. the movie may not be perfect, but it is well worth your time especially if your favorite actor is in it.

pertty kiran comes back to home after completing her college. she has got a nice charisma which always drawn men to her. sunil malhotra a dare devil navy employee is one such guy. he loves her deeply and even engaged to marry her. rahul is another person who is insane and he also loves kirrrran.sunil is very close to her family and is adored by everyone in his home. kiran has never met rahul, but then rahul would kill anyone who comes between him and kiran. so when rahul comes to know that kiran is in love with sunil, what will he do ? will he kill him or he himself will be punished for his devil acts.

the movie is a very good movie.one of the best from yash raj films.the direction is incredible.the screenplay is brilliant.the story is excellent.it tells about rahul who is obssed of kiran his college friend.he is a full blown psycho doing things like talking to his mother on a phone(anyway she died 15 years back) etc.kiran is engaged to sunil.rahul does everything so he can get her.he even trys to kill sunil but he survives it.he even goes to the place where they are going to their honeymoon.the movie is every nes delight.shahrukh is superb,juhi is fairly good,sunny is average,anupham is okay and so is tanvi,dalip did good.the movie belongs to srk.the dialogues are brilliant(shahrukh ones and a lot if not the overacting and comedy)."jaadu teri nazar" and "tu mere samne" are absolutely melodious tracks.

i've never seen a bollywood film before but i caught the first ten minutes of this, laughed myself silly and hit the r button on sky+. i'm glad i did!! i hope i don't insult anybody (because basically, the bf and i loved it!) but we couldn't take it half as seriously as the actors did - especially the obsessed one (who, i understand, is a huge bollywood star because we've seen him on the cover of lots of dvds since and i even saw a doll of him today in hamleys!! the bf keeps on about this bloke - i am beginning to think he's obsessed! he keeps saying that it's strange for the traditionally good looking one to be the anti-hero of a film! but then we do like films that aren't your stock predictable hollywood fare).it was completely over the top but really good fun. if all bollywood films are like this then we're watching more. i have had that bloomin' song in my head all week and i can't speak a word of hindi! ps any recommendations would be appreciated!

darr is a great movie! shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is juhi chawla. little does juhi know in the film that shahrukh has a major crush on her and is constantly stalking her. i have to admit, some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy... like the threatening phone calls. never in my life will i forget the line, "i love you k..k..k..kiran!"it's just too bad that shahrukh and juhi weren't exactly "together" in the film. but juhi and sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie. though shahrukh's role was pretty psychotic, i still think he did a great job of playing it and can't possibly imagine anyone else doing that role. no wonder he got an award for darr in 94'!juhi... what can i say??? she looks especially amazing in this film! it's not that she doesn't always look amazing in her other films, but darr did give the public a wonderful image of her!as for the music... it was excellent! especially "jaadu teri nazar," one of my all time favorite songs. i also thought "tu mere samne" was quite nice also.a must see for everyone! overall darr deserves a 9/10!

shah rukh khan plays an obbsessed lover who would go to any lengths to get his lady. juhi chawla does a wonderful job of making the best of her character and sunny deol plays the hero and action man. this film is very good and i'd reecommend it to anyone.

the story of an obsessed lover (shahrukh khan) and the lengths he goes to get his true love (juhi chawla) who's already married to her husband (sunny deol). the film is considered one of shahrukh khan's best performances and won him acclaim from critics and audiences alike. fear that your love may not be reciprocated, fear that you may lose the one you love, fear that your beloved could have a change of heart. in short, fear is the villain in every love story.but in 'darr' fear is the ultimate expression of passion, of obsession and of sacrifice. 'darr' is rahul's (shahrukh khan) story whose love and obsession for kiran (juhi chawla) frees him from all fears of life & death. 'darr' is sunil's (sunny deol) story, whose enduring love and passion for kiran gives him the courage to face the fear of death.and finally 'darr' is kiran's story who is caught between one man's love and another man's obsession. she fears one & fears for the other. one stands for love, the other for life. in this battle between love & life, the supreme victor is love, because love always wins, in life & death. simply "darr" is one of the best indian films ever made.

i generally love srk as a villain (how can you not?) and i believe that srk and juhi are a perfect match on screen as they both are actually more nice than pretty.this movie is great to watch, although it has some major flaws: 1) the good guy (sunny) - not only he's so much less attractive than shahrukh(what in my opinion is soooooo important in bollyfilms) but his role lacks character - it would be much better if there was a conflict between two strong personalities, instead we have a conflict between a personality and an average soldier 2) kiran's and sunil's reactions for rahul's actions are unbelievably silly and naive even for a bollywood production but all this is not that important in comparison with the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere, great songs (really truly great)and (let's say it again) shahrukh as a villain, i just love him when he's so pagala must-see (along with anjaam, baazigar and duplicate)

so many times, bollywood has tried to remake hollywood hits, only to produce total duds. mercifully, yash chopra's interpretation of "sleeping with the enemy" is an extremely stylish and well-made films.shah rukh khan is obsessed with juhi chawla (who's looking her very best in here!). when he realizes that juhi has a fiance in sunny deol, he stops at nothing to make sure she becomes his.every frame of this film is a delight to watch. whether it's shah rukh chanting his trademark "i love you, k...k...k...kiran!" or the feel-good mushy scenes between sunny and juhi (who make a perfect match), you won't feel like leaving your eat in boredom.each and every song on the soundtrack is ear pleasing, especially jaadu teri nazar and tu mere samne. like i said, juhi looks like a goddess in this film. darr may not be srk's best film (that honor goes to baazigar), but it definitely figures as one of his most flawless performances! sunny is ok. he's done similar roles before, but he's good.overall, darr is g...g...g...great! ;)

certainly not a great show, but better than most other sitcoms out there at the moment. it reminds of shows like married with children and roseanne as they go to places not traditionally dealt with in sitcoms. it's sometimes funny even if you ignore the laugh tracks, but not rip-roaring hilarious.some of the characters are pretty funny (the gay friend) and some of the other drop-ins. this is also one of the few shows where the characters soliloquy (sorry for the butchered spelling) actually is effective and funny.is this an all in the family or seinfeld type show? absolutely not. however, it is certainly better than a show like 'til deat (probably the worst tv show of any type out at the moment).oh and the mom is not too bad looking and the hilary character is a little hottie.

i haven't seen this funny of a show on fox in a long time, and the wait was worth it. the kids in the show have something that i can relate to on every episode, and even my dad will sit down and watch it. it is a show not for all ages that doesn't dumb down for kids. it is like still standing but to the next level. the stuff that everyone says is stuff that everyone says and actions that everyone does. it says stuff that we all think, but in a well rounded way of presentation. the first time i saw the show i could not believe that it was on fox, and that it was allowed to stay on the air after a few episodes, from hilary's boyfriend choices to kenny's boyfriend choices, it is well worth the watch.

i have realized that many people have commented on the nature of this show being racist and homophobic, but i don't feel that is what this show is about.the show is about parents who weren't ready for kids and are now not ready for teenagers. this show helps to bring humor to a very hard topic that is sometimes over looked: parenthood.yes we have all had shows that had families in it, for example: family matters, step by step, family ties, full house....but it always would have the same old recipe to it's episodes. "steph" cuts from school and gets caught by her father. they have a heart to heart conversation and music is played and it's over with a two week grounding that after an "aww, dad..." gets a smile and the show is over. where is the comedy in such a situation? where is the realism? with the war at home, you get real situations from a real father type figure. most parents that watch this show hear some of the lines the parents put out and they either laugh (cause they know they've said it!) or they nod their heads (cause they know they've thought it and never had the guts to say it!) the war at home has situations that bring out great comedy as a father thinking his son is gay. doesn't sound funny, most think it makes the father homophobic, but the comedy comes in the bumbling father trying to talk to his son to open up. what parent knows the right thing to say, especially in a situation as this? i greatly recommend this show to anyone that i know has a sense of humor, and especially to anyone who is a young parent or was young when they had kids. you relate to a show like this when you are either.

i really like this series. its funny and unique style of off the wall, sometimes controversial comedy, is a fresh take on the genre. whilst it is a sitcom, it stands out due to the what could be awkward subjects.every aspect has a comedy turn, and the show really is very good. my favourite part of the program is the rather odd comments of the father, dave. his rants break the program up, and allow a really good flow. not perfect, because sometimes the comedy isn't laugh out loud funny, and the actors sometimes seem to be waiting for an audience response, but otherwise this program is good.i strongly recommend this program, and am very sad that it has been cancelled. please make another series, and finish it properly

this was one of the few shows that my wife and i agreed on watching. i was upset to hear that it was canceled, especially because i didn't realize the ratings were so poor. as far as i knew it was doing very well with a lot of viewers. almost all my friends and most of the people i spoke to watched the show. now we are stuck watching either crappy shows or dvd's. how bad was the show doing? does anyone know the real results of the shows viewings? i know that when it went to thursdays, it was more difficult for me to catch. thank g*d for dvr's! anyways, this was a real surprise to know that there will be no more "the war at home". if any other networks see this, please pick up the show!!!! please!

the war at home is a splendid television series and i don't understand because she has been annulled. please fairies something to continue with this very beautiful television series, with excellent and marvelous actors, good recitation and good situations, please we want the third series and even so many new episodes. i pray you!!!! i would like if possible somehow to make to reach this and mail the interested forehand, since i can tell you that here in italy this series is very liked, as in other countries of europe chest of drawers for example spain. in effects as i have written above what strikes of this television series it is the good recitation of the actors and also the honest one with which numerous matters of true importance are treated. i think both one of the best american television series arrive on the italian screens in these last years.i pray you!!!!

i'm not from usa i'm from central europe and i think the show is amazingly good. it can be easily compared with married with..children. my title says that it isn't show for conservative public. i mean i'm not so liberal but it may be slight difference between european conservatism and us cons. anyway, show is starting to be very popular in our area and it's very bad that it contains only two seasons. last episode opens many continuous and funny moments. anyway i and many peoples would be glad if that would continue playing. the last thing i'm thrilled about this is some moral education very nice packed into humorous scenes. i mean i have seen many comedies that has over two and even more minutes of very sad in tragic scenes that absolutely don't fit into comedy. war doesn't contain something like that and is made for laughing. it's like the simpsons and married whose also don't have any sad or even unfunny moments. i'm apologizing for my awful knowledge of english but i still hope that you will understand what i meant.

i have been away from istanbul for the last 10 years. during that time i constantly lived in london. when i have seen the movie i realised how much i am istanbuler. i am not just from turkey i am a part of turkey. one of my part is istanbul, the sound of the istanbul, the people of the istanbul.probably faith akin thought that he has done great musical documentary but i must say it is more than that. it is about putting nice blend of vastly different musics, cultures, approaches, politics, ethnics into a delicious pot...as we all know turkey to be precise istanbul is always comes and goes between being eastern or western city. as one of the band member said istanbul is a bi-cultural city. but much more a eastern city because we always tried to be a western city. it shows we've never been one.this movie will catch from very first second. music is excellent, people are fascinating. especially aynur and sezen aksu. singers, band members! it is nice to see you all at a small cinema in wood green.

a european musician and composer sets out to capture the musical diversity of istanbul. a lover of experimenting with sound, alexander hacke (of the german avantgarde band einstürzende neubauten) roams the streets of istanbul with his mobile recording studio and "magic mike" to assemble an inspired portrait of turkish music. his voyage leads to the discovery of a broad spectrum ranging from modern electronic, rock and hip-hop to classical "arabesque". as he wanders through this seductive world, alex collects impressions and tracks by artists such as neo-psychedelic band baba zula, fusion djs orient expressions, rock groups duman and replikas, maverick rocker erkin koray, ceza (turkey's answer to public enemy), breakdance performers istanbul style breakers, digital dervish mercan dede, renowned clarinetist selim sesler, canadian folk singer brenna maccrimmon, street performers siyasiyabend, kurdish singer aynur, the "elvis of arabesque" orhan gencebay, and legendary divas müzeyyen senar and sezen aksu.

'crossing the bridge: the sound of istanbul' is one of the best music documentaries that i have seen lately and is more than a film about music. it is also a musical love declaration about a fabulous city, one of the greatest city in europe and the world, one of the most important cities for europe history and for islam, the city that may bridge in the future europe and the middle east or may signify once again, as is already happened in history the precipice between two worlds.then there is the music. the interesting approach that the film takes with regard to music is that it starts from modern music, and we hear a lot of (good) rock and rap in the first third of the film. an then, like a backwards move in time the soundtrack takes us to the roots, to turkish traditional music, to commercial romances, and to the exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of turkish music. in such a complex and conflict ridden country as turkey is the film does not avoid some of the political aspects, like censorship introduced by the military rule in the 80s or the relevance of the songs of the minorities especially the kurdish one. one of the best musical moments is actually provided by a kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a cathedral-shaped hamam (turkish bath).one gets to love the city and its music by the end of the viewing and hearing of this film. i have never been to istanbul but after having seen this film i am sure that i want to visit this place soon.

this is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so i won't repeat the same compliments. but, faith akin, being an turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary european, falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall. but come on man you are turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond "beyoglu-old town" it's a missed opportunity for akinfor that reason. performances by muzeyyen senar and orhan gencebay are peek of the movie and ceza (a very talented and bad ass turkish rapper) makes some trash talk about american gangsta rappers which i totally agree. i will recommend this movie to my american friends.

turkish-german director faith akın ("head-on" & "the edge of heaven") follows german musician and "head-on" soundtrack composer alexander hacke of einstürzende neubauten to istanbul for this documentary which delves into the modern music scene of the city from arabesque to indie rock and was screened out of competition at the 2005 cannes film festival.alexander hacke makes for an amiable guide as he travels around istanbul with a mobile recording studio and a microphone in hand where he runs into and records the likes of classic rocker erkin koray, rapper ceza, kurdish singer aynur doğan, arabesque singer orhan gencebay and pop star sezen aksu as well as rock bands baba zula, duman and replikas.the director has pulled together a diverse collection of popular performers and ground-breaking acts from what was at the time a highly competitive short-list to give an eclectic account of modern turkish music as seen from the streets of its cultural capital which will enchant and entertain even if at times it seems a little rushed and unfocused."music can reveal to you everything about a place."

turkish culture is complete with lots of different cultures. different cultures have different styles of music. istanbul is like the mixture of turkey. it has mostly the same language but different dialects. this documentary shows us these different kinds of music with different dialects and different instruments. you can watch reportings with singers and groups, their performances , their daily life and learn their thoughts of music. the movie includes not only the music of istanbul but the life in istanbul , how people communicate and what they eat and drink. the surprising part is although i live in istanbul i learned lots of things from this movie.

istanbul is a big , crowded city between europe and asia.too many types of people living together there for hundred years.in this documentary movie you can see how music can give description about the culture of the owner race.you would be able to hear too many types of music including rock , hip-hop , arabesque , alternative and more. some of the musicians are famous in turkey , some of them are famous also in europe. the rest are just street musicians. their music tell viewers , different faces of a city. impressive !

this movie is one of the most memorable films i have seen. i went reluctantly with a turkish friend who recommended it. i am not a very enthusiastic proponent of music documentaries, but when aynur dogan, a kurdish woman banned for years from singing in turkey, sings her piece, the theater was in awe. i would give my all to hear a cd recording of this haunting, gorgeous song. and she is just one of many artist interviewed and recorded, speaking of their experiences of performing in istanbul. even now, a month later, i remember the footage of aynur singing in an acoustic auditorium, and i try to remember the music as it echoed in the cinema. well done to faith akin, the director of this film, and his great idea to capture the many splendid sounds of such a cosmopolitan city. it would certainly encourage me to visit istanbul.

i am listening to istanbul, intent, my eyes closed: at first there is a gentle breeze and the leaves on the trees softly sway; out there, far away, the bells of water-carriers unceasingly ring; i am listening to istanbul, intent, my eyes closed.i am listening to istanbul, intent, my eyes closed; then suddenly birds fly by, flocks of birds, high up, with a hue and cry, while the nets are drawn in the fishing grounds and a woman's feet begin to dabble in the water. i am iistening to istanbul, intent, my eyes closed.i am listening to istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. the grand bazaar's serene and cool, an uproar at the hub of the market, mosque yards are full of pigeons. while hammers bang and clang at the docks spring winds bear the smell of sweat; i am listening to istanbul, intent, my eyes closed.i am listening to istanbul, intent, my eyes closed; still giddy from the revelries of the past, a seaside mansion with dingy boathouses is fast asleep. amid the din and drone of southern winds, reposed, i am listening to istanbul, intent, my eyes closed.i am listening to istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. a pretty girl walks by on the sidewalk: four-letter words, whistles and songs, rude remarks; something falls out of her hand it is a rose, i guess. i am listening to istanbul, intent, my eyes closed.i am listening to istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. a bird flutters round your skirt; on your brow, is there sweat? or not? i know. are your lips wet? or not? i know. a silver moon rises beyond the pine trees: i can sense it all in your heart's throbbing. i am listening to istanbul, intent, my eyes closed.for youfor you, my fellow humans, everything is for you, nights are for you, days are for you; daylight is for you, moonlight is for you; leaves in the moonlight; wonder and wisdom in the leaves, myriad greens in daylight, yellow is for you, and pink. the feel of the skin on the palm, its warmth, its softness, the comfort of lying down; for you are all the greetings and the masts winnowing in the harbor; names of the days, names of the months, fresh paint on rowboats is for you mailman's feet, potter's hands sweat on foreheads, bullets fired on battlefronts; graves are for you and tombstones, jails and handcuffs and death sentences are for you everything is for you.sea nostalgiavessels sail along my dreams, over the roofs, ships in a feast of color, and poor me, yearning for the sea year in year out, i gaze and weep. i recall my first sight of the world through a mussel shell i pried open: the greenest water and the bluest sky and the rippliest of lump-fish... my blood still flows salty where the oysters slit my skin. what a mad speed plunge was ours into the high seas on the whitest foam! foam bears no malice, like lips whose adultery with men is no disgrace.vessels sail along our dreams over the roofs, ships in a feast of color, and poor me, yearning for the sea year in year out.-- orhan velii could not have said anything better than what orhal veli kanik said about istanbul. about this movie, all i have is praise. a very nice and balanced introduction to a city and its music that connected asia, europe and africa at one point of time.

ich will danke herr hacke für den filme. mein deutsch ist nicht gut. enschuldigen sie.first of all, i didn't know how diverse the sound of istanbul, inspite i live in turkey.faith akin and alexander hacke have made a different approach for turkish music.narrating, performing, seeing istanbul and istanbul music from a foreigner aspect had given the real meaning of the music itself.in this movie i had found out how different our(turkish) culture is, how interesting our performers are, and how much respect they deserve. unfortunately no one have been able to serve this kind of documentary before.

german-born turkish director faith akin captures in his film the endless variety of the different styles in music and songs in istanbul, a city that is a bridge between east and west, a city that is uniquely located on both sides of the bosporus, in europe and in asia. kurdish dirges represented by aynur, who performs her own brand of kurdish gospel music, passionate and melodic. we are introduced to romany instrumentals, to orhan gencebay, who has been called the elvis of arabesque music - sounds of music are heard everywhere in the city as faith akin takes us into underground clubs, to the street performers, and to recording sessions. german bassist alexander hacke who comes to istanbul to play and to learn about turkish music quotes confucius, "to understand the place, you have to listen to the music it plays". akin's fine documentary does just that - gives us 90 minutes of music that helps to cross the bridges. for me, watching the movie was especially interesting because i recently visited istanbul as a part of my vacation and spent four days there. the city fascinated me by its images, colors, crowds, vibrancy and visual beauty. now, i can add the sounds of music to the ever-changing portrait of istanbul.

by watching this film you will not only explore the "turkish music" but will also explore the city of istanbul with wonderful pictures and scenes from all over the important regions of the city.there are lots of delightful conversations with all sorts of musicians and their thoughts about music,culture.there is also discussions about the mixture of east and west like istanbul has,how they make their music, how do they see themselves comparing to other country's musicians.it consists the music of ceza,duman,baba zula,aynur,müzeyyan senar,orhan gencebay..the turkish queen of music sezen aksu...an important work of art!

faith akin has made me realize once more the deepness of my passion for this city called istanbul. being addressed as a city of cultural mosaics, faith akin has contributed to that addressing through the mosaics of music performed in the film. what's more, the climax of the film,in my opinion, is the scene where muzeyyen senar (a turkish music diva) sings at age 86 as well as she had done in her younger years and rolls the raki glass in the air without pouring out one drop, which is a traditional act in raki culture. she is just marvellous. sezen aksu (a turkish pop singer) with her mystical and meaningful looks at the end of her song which gives the film its turkish title makes the scene no less than a climax. last but not least, the wonderful scenery of istanbul can make you feel nostalgic if you are away. beware!

if you're a fan of turkish and middle eastern music, you're in great luck. this film is a documentary of current music in istanbul, spanning the traditional to the modern. it's very good. you could not do better if you went to istanbul yourself. we get interviews with orhan gencebay, concert clips of modern musical icons, a road show with a romani (gypsy) audience, turkish hip hop (surprisingly very very good), and much much more. some of the best female vocalists i've ever heard. a kurdish woman singing in a hamam (steam bath) who will rip your heart out. lots of social and political background. if this is your thing, you'll have a grand time. i could barely sit still in the theatre.cd soundtrack now available on amazon. pricey.

like many other commentators here, i went in expecting a taste of music that would satisfy my curiosity - and got more than i asked for. i heard and saw a powerful, exquisite, sometimes haunting, sometimes touching, lyrical, sentimental (in the truest way) and absolutely stunning blend of music and musicians. reminded me a lot of some forms of indian music (east indian) but at the same time was very very different.starting from the the first track by baba zula to the kurdish singer aynur (what a voice) to siyasiyabend to the jam session (or 'jugalbandhi ' as we call it in india) in the small turkish bar ft. selim seslar (big fan now :) ), i enjoyed every minute and wished it wouldn't end.one of the best music commentaries i have seen and heard in a long time. i am craving for a cd of the sound-track and hope i can find it online somewhere soon and also for old and latest albums from baba zula.a day later, the music is still etched in my brain and i don't want it to go away. turkey and specifically istanbul now seem such beautiful and exciting places - and i am going to start saving today to go take it in.faith akin - this is a gem.

akin's prize-winning 2004 movie head-on/gegen die wand depicted the appealingly chaotic world of a self-destructive but dynamic turkish-german rocker named cahit (birol ünel). this documentary is an offshoot of head-on and explores the range of music one might find in istanbul today if one were as energetic and curious as german avant-rock musician alexander hacke of the group einstuerzende neubauten (who arranged the sound track and performed some of the music for head-on) and had the assistance of a film crew and turkish speakers provided by director akin. you get everything from rap to the most traditional turkish classical song, with rock, kurdish music, and turkish pop in between. it's as chaotic and open-ended a world as cahit's, one where east is east and west is west but the twainsomehowdo meet.like istanbul itself, which sits on the edge between europe and asia and brings the two worlds together while remaining sui generis, this is a mélange that includes turkish pop, turkish traditional songs, kurdish laments, roma jazz musicians and group of street buskers (siyasiyabend), lively and offbeat shots of istanbul street life, and some talk on camera about synthesis and some personal and musical history by singers and musicians. working out of the grand hotel de londres in istanbul's beyoglu quarter where cahit stayed at the end of head-on while looking for his beloved, hacke roams around the city with crew and equipment interviewing people and recording their music.he begins with some loud rock by the "neo-psychedelic" band baba zula  these are musicians he bonded with while putting together head-on's score and he stands in here for the absent bassist -- and by turkish (including brave female) rappers  thus causing some oldsters to walk out of the theater early on and miss the predominantly tuneful and easy-to-listen-to sounds that makes up the bulk of the film. (head-on's narrative excesses were tempered periodically by musical interludes performed by a traditional turkish orchestra sitting outdoors on the other side of the bosphorus.) hacke gives us the opportunity to meet and hear performances by some of the best known living turkish singers, including müzeyyen senar, a lady in her late eighties whose aging, elegant musicians remind one of the way the great egyptian songstress umm kulsoum used to perform. hacke gets songwriter-movie star orhan gencebay to do a striking solo on the long-necked oud he's written all his songs on, and persuades the now elusive great sezen aksu.to do a special performance of one of her most famous songs, "memory of istanbul." this is a coup, and so is the lament by a beautiful kurdish songstress aynar recorded in a bath whose acoustics are spectacular, if only they could have turned down the heat  singer and musician's faces stream with sweat. there is also a young canadian woman, brenna maccrimmon, fluent in turkish, who sings turkish traditional folksongs with expression and fervor. the sound mix is of high quality throughout. one would like to see a sequel; many great exemplars of turkish popular and classical music have necessarily been left out.film released summer 2005 and shown at festivals in 2005 and 2006. opened at the angelika film center in new york city in june 9, 2006.

it is a very great film (documentary) about istanbul and their people and it's music of every kind. editing and the success of the director is very impressive. i've been interested with faith akin since i saw the "gegen die wand" ("head-on") ("duvara kars&#305;") and i admired his work very much but this one has been the most touching one for me so i'm here writing this. it is not just about turks or something like that, it is a very good biography of a city and how music stay alive in it we can say. there are views of many people and so very variant ideas about even life and love. i liked it very much and i thing anyone and everyone should see it, not only but especially the ones anyhow related with turkey...

this is such an exciting documentary, it was by far one of the most fun films i've ever seen. i highly recommend it to anyone. it's such a fun look at different musical styles, exciting people at the crossroads between modern and traditional that is istanbul, and great cinematography that captures beautiful scenes in istanbul and thrace. watching the film made me want to book a flight for istanbul right away.great footage of ceza, a turkish rapper. also his sister, ayben rapping - she is awesome.priceless performances by amazing turkish musicians orhan gencebay, sezen aksu, muzeyyen senar.the gorgeous voice of aynur, singing in kurdish.and amazing clarinet and signing of a romany gypsy group from thrace.last but not least, istanbul bands mixing turkish music and rock, as well as trance music -- baba zula, orient expressions, duman, and others...

this film offers you a fascinating trip through one of the most exiting cities of today - istanbul - and its musicians. do not expect a compilation of turkish folklore or anything like that. alexander hacke, a german musician and member of the cult band "einstürzende neubauten" travels to istanbul to get to know the music scene. his sparse voice overs of what he experiences are a guiding line through the film. but mainly german-turkish director faith akin lets various artists from istanbul do the talking - and of course their music. you meet a variety of personalities, big stars and street musicians, young and old, people playing many different musical styles. but this movie does not only introduce you to the sound of istanbul. it also draws a compelling picture of istanbul today and how turkey has forged ahead in the last decade. the film characterises its protagonists with subtle humour, but never without respect. all of them share a passion for music and the belief in its power. akin again shows his talent to portray diversity lightheartedly when he brings you close to completely different musical scenes. after his award winning feature film "gegen die wand" (head on) faith akin proves with "crossing the bridge" that he is equally able to touch, entertain and guide his audience in a documentary. if you have never been in istanbul, you will want to go there after having seen the film.

watching the preview of armored i thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good film. thankfully, the movie was entertaining, suspenseful, and realistic. there never is the perfect crime, and armored showed why. the movie show perfectly when people get into stressful situation they behave like animals. the last hour of the film is very entertaining. matt dillon is still a very good actor. hard to believe dillon is 50 years of age. i would buy this movie. i give armored eight out of ten. not a christmas movie. did i write ten lines yet? nope! anyways, there is not to many action films. armored has a lot of excitement in it, which gives the movie goer a choice over another comedy.

i came across this movie while channel surfing one day; and decided to give it a chance. to my surprise i enjoyed this darkhorse movie. i felt some genuine chemistry between challen cates and malcolm-jamal warner. it was such a lighthearted and warm movie that when it was over i felt upbeat. sure, this movie was predictable from the very beginning, but i give it high marks for the way that it made me feel when it was over. i must admit that i have never seen challen cates before, but i feel that she can definitely act. when you combine her good acting with her cute face and attractive figure. she has the makings of at least becoming a well-known star.

a tender movie that represents how our daily life is a catalyst that causes us to change our thoughts, behaviors and emotions into people we're not. this story is a love story where true emotions arise. i credit malcolm jamal warner (win) and challen cates for outstanding performances . a movie definitely worth seeing, a holiday roadtrip that turns into an emotional turn-a-round. i suggest seeing it.

well unlike most people.... i went into this movie expecting it to not be that good and it turned out to be an awesome film. pretty cool plot i love the idea of it but what really made this movie was the actors. they all did an incredible job and it was pretty cool to see fishburn and dillon work together. it's a movie where you go in thinking right away you will be able to predict whats going to happen but it doesen't quite turn out how you predicted. i don't want to give away anything about the story so i wont... but i suggest giving this one a chance. if you saw the movie money train and enjoyed that you would love this movie. maybe everything lawrence fishburn touches is gold?

"a fare to remember" is a totally derivative, almost ridiculous movie, but has a warmth about it that makes it a very effective and upbeat holiday movie. it stars a pretty newcomer, challen kates, as a high-powered ad executive who, right before her wedding, has to rush from l.a. to seattle to keep a client who has rejected every other presentation. she has transportation difficulties from the beginning and seemingly no money. this is the first dumb thing - were there no atms anywhere? she must make a fortune. at any rate, she meets a cab driver (warner) who looks like a homeless man, and he drives her to her presentation and when she emerges with a huge box of beef jerky (the client's product), he's there to take her to the airport. all flights are canceled, so in order to get to l.a. for her wedding, she hires him to take her there.along the way, they bond and learn from each other. it's a very sweet movie though there is absolutely nothing new in it - it combines "six days and seven nights" and a few other films. but the chemistry between the stars is good, they're likable, and the acting is good. look for jerry springer as the head of the beef jerky company and a cameo by karl malden.this is a nice film to take in over the holiday season. it's on lifetime.

most christmas movies have a "redemption" theme but most are a variation on a very similar plot. this movie is wacky and has an unusual plot. you may need to hang in there for the first half where events may seem hard to believe for a movie (but not as unbelievable as real life - scott adams, the creator of dilbert, says he's never made up anything in any of his cartoons - they're all based on real life stories told to him by his fans). the second half starts to fit the plot together. i enjoyed it. btw, one reviewer noted that the idea of someone not having cash available is not credible in these days of atms, but it's perfectly credible if you've lost your wallet - who carries atm cards anywhere else while on a business trip?

this movie was a suprise for me while i was surfing from channel to channel... i don't know why but it filled in me with warmth and happiness. this is what a high budget movie can not do mostly. i liked it, this is "a must see" one...

challen cates does a wonderful job depicting a conflicted bride, torn between the challenges that await her professionally, the memories of the freedom she thought she would have when in college (inspired by a famous author) and the safety of her pending marriage to a man she really doesn't love. this movie is definitely worth seeing--- as predictable as it may be, the acting is inspiring and real chemistry exists between challen cates and malcolm jamaal warner.

now i like victor herbert. and i like mary martin and allan jones. but it would have been nice to see a real biography of victor herbert. walter connolly as herbert does have a decent resemblance to him in his latter yearsjones and martin sing beautifully though. the herbert music is just there to adorn the plot line concerning these two musical performers. jones's john ramsay is a frail character, very similar to gaylord ravenal in showboat who jones also played.as for mary martin, it's a mystery why she never had a good hollywood career. she did films with bing crosby and dick powell as well as this one. she performed well, but movie audiences didn't take to her. the best musical moment in the film is jones and martin in a duet of thine alone. the recordings i have of the song are individual and it was written as a duet. there's also a pleasant scene with jones and martin riding bicycles swapping herbert songs as they ride.the real victor herbert with his womanizing and his irish patriot background and his musical training in germany where he developed a love for all things german would have been a fascinating study. he was also a cello virtuoso before he turned full time to composing. i have to take strong exception to the reviewer who said cuddles sakall would have been a good victor herbert. sakall as irish, hello.nice movie, but the real vic would have been so much better.

i cannot argue with other comments that the story line focuses more on the romance between the mary martin and allan jones characters, much in the manner of "showboat", than on the life of victor herbert. but in the 1930's, would that have been a box office draw? instead of the life of vh, perhaps it should have been the music of vh. there is an abundance of this.for me, the thrill of the movie came near the end of the movie when susanna foster sings "land of romance". it has been over a decade since i caught this movie for a second time at a local 'old movies' theater. at first the audience was stunned; then it burst into spontaneous applause. i remember the shivers running up and down my spine. my trivia memory recalled the information provided to an inquiring public by a local journalist when the movie first came out back in the late 1930's. 'that note hit by miss foster was a far f above high c.'she may not have had four octaves a la yma sumac but the then teen-ager certainly had a range!

this movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. the dialog is crisp, the pace is fast. not only is this a clever comedy, this is an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes in the television news business.there are so many funny lines...a couple of my favorites:ernie merriman: (sarcastically) it must be nice to always believe you know better, to always think you're the smartest person in the room. jane: (seriously) no, it's not, it's awful!!aaron: he must be good looking jane: how do you know that? aaron: no one invites a bad looking idiot to their room!the performances of holly hunter, albert brooks, and william hurt were absolutely brilliant! even years later, i remember this movie well. often forgotten is the wonderfully funny joan cusack! i love the scene where the newsroom personnel are racing to beat a deadline. there are so many funny scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite. i highly recommend this film.

for me this wonderful rollercoaster of a film bears repeated pleasurable viewings. its about the tangled lives of three very different people. holly hunter is the obsessive workaholic producer. albert brookes plays the unprepossessing but brilliant journalist. william hurt is the affable but dumb new kid on the block, news anchor.the classical love triangle emerges with the stunningly witty and self deprecating brookes in love with hunter but she of course is attracted to hurt.this film works on many levels. at the very least it is a brilliant comedy with the one liners flying so thick and fast that each viewing bears a new harvest of ones that you may have missed last time. its also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romance.but perhaps most importantly the film examines the modern obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over intellect as a valued human attribute. this is personified by the meteoric career success of the hurt character in contrast to brookes relative decline.despite being fifteen years old the film has some startingly relevant messages about modern news values and the continuing decline in journalistic standards.this film is a classic in every sense and it is difficult to understand why it has been so neglected

this was a really nice surprise. i was up late last night and couldn't fall asleep. not really thinking twice, i turned on my tv and hbo was on, and this film was just beginning. luckily i saw the whole thing, and i am very happy i did. because this film was very good. the actors were well-cast, and they did a surprisingly good job. kris kristofferson delivered a solid performance, there was a lot of substance behind his lines. this film made me realize he's a good actor. brian keith was great as his father, as was trey wilson playing the colonel (this was trey wilson's final role before his untimely death. too bad, he was a quality actor and seemed like a nice guy). jobeth williams also did a nice job as kristofferson's american wife. as far as the direction, i had no idea franklin j. schaffner was the director until i read the review in leonard maltin's movie guide(this was the last film he ever made). now i understand why this movie was so good. schaffner also directed patton, a truly great movie(i haven't seen his other great film, papillon). while i was watching "welcome home", i said to myself, "this director really knows what he's doing," not knowing that schaffner had directed it. there's one really beautiful scene in a thai orphan refuge, enough to bring tears to my eyes. not only was this sensitively directed, but it was also directed in a very economical and taut way. there is nothing wasted in schaffner's effort. the script was one reason this film is so good. the writer doesn't weigh the actors down with too many lines. it was written very simply but very effectively. it just shows you that a lot can be said with few words. this film also made me proud to be an american, at the same time that it showed you how beautiful all people are.

hi i have been looking 4 the soundtrack or a song from the film, does anyone know who sung the title song? i think it was called welcome home or coming home.it is played throughout the film and for the end credits please can anyone help either the artist and/or title of song thanks mike this is for all you movie buffs lets see if you know your stuffhi i have been looking 4 the soundtrack or a song from the film, does anyone know who sung the title song? i think it was called welcome home or coming home.it is played throughout the film and for the end credits please can anyone help either the artist and/or title of song thanks mike this is for all you movie buffs lets see if you know your stuff

this film is good,but not schaffner`s best. my favourite is papillon and patton,but this is a sad and very nice film. kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference. i am going to miss schaffner and this is his last film.a good film by a great director! 7,5/10

flashes of lightning; a sprawling cemetery; the name of adam 'batman' west: all pop up on screen before the opening credits are even over, and yet, despite these rather naff elements, one dark night isn't as cheesy as it might first seem.meg tilly (jennifer's sister) plays pretty student julie, who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiation into exclusive high school clique the sisters. what julie doesn't realise is that the other 'sisters' plan to freak her out with some ghoulish pranksor that the most recent body to be interred in the mausoleum is that of 'psychic vampire' raymar, who feeds off the life force of scared young women.admittedly, this isn't the most original of set-ups, but thankfully there are enough inventive touches to help set this film apart from the competition, my favourites being the macabre sight of everyday objects embedded in the walls of raymar's apartment, and the creepy manner in which mouldy corpses float through the cold marble corridors of the mausoleum during the excellent finale. hal trussell's impressive steadicam cinematography and tom burman's wonderfully macabre special effects also add immensely to the chilling atmosphere.

i have great memories of this movie...i was only 12 when it was released and it scared the bejesus out of me. i really miss my bejesus...zombies, graveyards, mausoleums, how can you go wrong? it's like phantasm's retarded cousin.this movie was released 1 year before the pg-13 rating was instituted.i submit that one dark night is the goriest pg movie (not scariest, mind you) that has ever been released.can anyone come up with a gorier pick?(fyi: i don't consider poltergeist to be gorier...scarier, yes. but not gorier...)

i can't describe the feeling when i got this crappy vhs rental cassette in my hands about 20 years ago. somehow i got my father to rent it for me and i watched it twice with my little brother. yes, we got nightmares. this film was originally rated as pg in the us, in many other countries, including finland, it was restricted under 18 or 16. the film was aimed to teenagers, but this must be the goriest pg-rated film ever. there's no bad language or nudity in it what so ever. originally made in 1981, stayed on the shelves for a couple of years before release.this is an a-class b-movie, a true, well made 80's horror flick. a bunch of college girls decide to spent a night in a mausoleum, not knowing that a supernatural evil awaits... you can almost smell the rotting flesh and feel the atmosphere of this movie. it's campy, utterly stupid, but they just can't make these movies anymore. there is definitely a certain feel to this 80's horror genre. this one is still effectively spooky and entertaining after all these years.the effects are just oozing quality by ellis burman jr and thomas r. burman. the make-up effects play a big part in this flick, otherwise it would've been just a boring teen slasher.it's now available on dvd at last and it's a special edition dvd including some extras too. commentary track is interesting.(in fact, this version isn't so special after all. below average transfer on dvd, some glitches and scratches here and there) at first it was going to be released by the blue underground but unfortunately it was canceled, so shriek show released it without restoring the print. too bad!)great date-movie!recommended!!!note! i only gave 8 out of 10 because of the "nostalgic values", otherwise 6 out of 10

you have got to see this movie... i saw it, as a 13 year old, at the theater, on my very first date... fast forward over 20 years and i'm now gay (thanks a lot one dark night!! lol!). this movie creeped the hell out of me as a kid (mausoleums still do!), but as an adult, the thrill of this movie isn't in the storyline, but rather the hysterical laughs it holds... highlights are listening to the names the teenagers call each other, from "nerdlebrain" (my personal favorite) to "turkey". also, keep your eyes peeled for the scene where carol (the blond, head sister) attempts to hang her phone up on a soda can (can't believe they didn't reshoot that!)... other highlights include adam west's overly dramatic outbursts and the gooey corpses. if you're a fan of true horror, i'd suggest this film just because, to me, it's almost a parody on horror. there is def. a creepy factor and the plot is a good one, but don't watch it if you want to be scared out of your wits (unless you're like 10 years old or something).

i was kinda surprised by the pg rating on the back of the dvd case. i certainly wouldn't want my kids watching this one. i think this would scare the crap out of a 10 year old.plot: a girl trying to fit in to the clique is hazed and tormented by the 'in crowd.' they talk her into spending the night in this creepy mausoleum (that reminded me of phantasm...) and they proceed to torment her in the night. little do they know, a recently deceased clairvoyant is coming back to life and raising the dead around them! it sounds awfully cheesy, but given the age and the budget, which was no doubt pretty small, this film is fun on many levels.watch for an early eg daily as one of the in crowd brats. i enjoyed it and it scared my girlfriend.7 out of 10, kids.

victor sjöström was quite the master in this film, having starred in it, directed it and even wrote the screenplay! that's pretty amazing. while today few have any idea who sjöström was, he might be familiar to ingmar bergman fans as the star one of bergman's most acclaimed films, wild strawberries.as far as this film goes, it's a very mixed bag. on one hand, you have to respect it because for 1921, it's a very good film. the idea of the grim reaper sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is pretty imaginative. plus, the special effect of the phantom carriage is pretty convincing and technically speaking this is a well-crafted film. on the other hand, it's an amazingly dated and preachy film--more like something you'd expect to be shown in sunday school instead of in an honest to goodness theater. plus, some of the story elements just don't make sense. instead of coming off as dedicated or good, the dying salvation army worker seems like a sap--a very sad and confusing sap. why is she "in love" with this man? am i missing something?so, my recommendation is that if you are insanely in love with silents (like me), then by all means watch it. but, if you aren't a silent fan, this film might do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so overly melodramatic and dated.

körkarlen (1921), a classic film with cult status amongst the silent movies, directed by victor sjöstrøm, who also plays the male main role, is based on a story by swedish novelist selma lagerlöf. the film tells the story of brutal drinker david holm, who beats up his wife, neglects his children, seduces his brother to drinking and is blind for the love of nurse edit (astrid holm). david sits toward the end of the year together with his boozing buddies in the city-park and tells the story of the phantom chariot (körkarlen): who dies in the new year's eve night as the last one before dawn, has to serve one year long as driver of death and release the dying souls from their bodies. but david gets into a fight with his buddies, suffers a hemorrhage and sinks dead on the soil. meanwhile, the phantom carriage is approaching. the driver is nobody else than david's late friend georges who seduced him into alcohol and died one year before. since david refuses to get on the carriage, georges forces him. together, they drive to the stations where people live who suffered from david. they visit the nurse edit whose love to david he was unable to recognize and whom he infected with tuberculosis so that she is dying now. but her unconditioned love to david will save his soul. fulfilled with her spirit, they get to david's wife and children. david is able to prevent his wife from killing herself and her children, because she does not see a way out of the misery in which david has thrown her. they also visit david's brother, who has committed a murder after having been seduced into drinking by david. david asks georges to go back into his body, because he finally sees that his way was wrong. since it was georges who had seduced him once into drinking, david's wish is granted, he gets a second chance, and georges has to be one more year the driver of the phantom carriage in order to pay for his own sins. this movie belongs probably to the strongest and most impressive films ever made. deplorably, it is still not available on international dvd.

not as well known as the english, american, german and french cinema, though cinema from sweden from the '20's was also quite good, interesting and revolutionary.this is a movie that is made great by its story. the story is told in 'a christmas carol' kind of way, in which the death himself confronts the deceased with his past, present and what could have been. it's of course a story that concentrates on morals and it does this very well. the message comes across as very powerful and effective. this is of course also definitely due to the effective directing from the father of swedish cinema; victor sjöström.the story is based on the novel by other swedish author selma lagerlöf. the story is adapted by victor sjöström himself, who perhaps should had taken out a few more elements, to let the story and movie flow better. it perhaps takes a bit too long before the movie starts to take form and the story gets clear but when the movie does take form and pace it becomes a really wonderful one.the movie does not only have a great story, it also is a good looking one. the movie uses some early and effective effects and uses some different color filters to create the right mood and to indicate what it past, present and 'future'.sjöström did not only wrote and directed this movie, he also plays the main character. of course the acting in the movie is over-the-top at times, by todays standards but not as bad as in for instance early german movies was the case. and after all, this movie is more about its story and morals than it is about the acting, so it really doesn't matter much, or distracts.a really great and effective underrated silent-movie classic from sweden.9/10

on a dark, gloomy new year's eve night, an ill nurse, her life slowly ebbing away, demands that david holm be presented to her at once. we don't yet know who david holm is, or why this nurse wishes to see him, but her only dying wish is to speak with him just one more time. on the other side of the town, nestled comfortably amongst the gravestones of the local cemetery, holm (victor sjöström, who also directed) and two of his drunken associates merrily await the coming of the new year. "here we can tell just when to drink the new year in," exclaims holm, casting a finger towards the large clock tower that looms through the darkness. little does he know, however, that he will not be alive to greet it.to pass the time, holm cheerfully recites a ghost story. he'd once had a friend name george, "a merry fellow" who was "smarter than the rest of us." on one new year's eve several years ago, george has broken up a potentially disastrous brawl, fearing that the final man to draw his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive the phantom chariot for the next year, doing death's bidding and collecting the souls of the deceased. "and, gentlemen, george died last new year's eve!" concludes holm happily, not bothering to contain his mocking skepticism of the man's beliefs.as fate has it, of course, an unexpected violent encounter results in holm's death, just on the stroke of midnight. as the man's transparent spirit rises gingerly from his earthly body, he witnesses, to his horror, the distant approach of a phantom carriage. the driver, a frail cloaked figure - a sickle clasped tightly in his hand - steps down from the carriage and approaches. we are astonished to discover that the driver is none other than a decrepit george, preparing to pass on his ghastly duty to this year's successor.considering the era in which 'körkarlen' is made, the special effects in this film are absolutely superb. cinematographer julius jaenzon used double-exposure photography to create the eerie, ghostly silhouette of the carriage and its damned driver. even today, the end result is highly effective. a particularly impressive scene involves the phantom chariot travelling to the ocean floor to retrieve the soul of a drowned man. another scene, eerily reminiscent of jack torrance (jack nicholson) in stanley kubrick's 'the shining,' involves holm breaking down the kitchen door with an axe in order to reach his fleeing wife and children.genuinely ominous and unsettling in its execution, victor sjöström's 'körkarlen' is a fine work of cinema, successfully portraying holm's steady alcoholic decline, his inevitable day of judgment, and a final hopeful possibility of redemption.

in the new year's eve, the tuberculous sister of the salvation army edit (astrid holm) asks her mother and her colleague maria (lisa lundholm) to call david holm (victor sjöström) to visit her in her deathbed. meanwhile, the alcoholic david is telling to two other drunkards in the cemetery the legend of the phantom coach and his coachman: in accordance with the legend, the last sinner to die in the turn of the new year becomes the soul collector, gathering souls in his coach. when david denies to visit edit, his friends have an argument with him, they fight and david dies. when the coachman arrives, he recognizes his friend georges (tore svennberg), who died in the end of the last year. george revisits parts of david's obnoxious life and in flashbacks, he shows how mean and selfish david was."körkarlen" is an impressive and stylish silent movie, with magnificent special effects (for a 1921 movie). the characters are very well developed; however, the story is dated and there is a weird and unexplained situation, when sister edit tells that she loves david holm. why should a enlightened woman love such a despicable man that wasted his life corrupting other people? despite being religiously dated in the present days, it gives a beautiful message of faith and redemption in the end. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "a carroça fantasma" ("the phantom coach")

sjöströms masterpiece and a movie that captures the swedish soul . it also served as a great inspiration for bergman; the similarites between körkarlen and smultronstället (with sjöström in the leading role as isak borg) from 1957 is not a coincidence. don't miss it for the world!

this, unfortunately, is a little-known film.....i say "unfortunately", because it ranks up there with the "classics" of the american silent screen!it's about a legend of a "phantom chariot" that travells all over the world, picking up the souls of those who have died. the legend says tha the last person to die on new year's eve is condemned to drive the chariot for the next whole year.it brings to mind the sequence of the "ghost of future yet to come" in dicken's famous "christmas carol".the double-exposure effects of the ghosts (esp. when they interact with the "live" people) are excellent! if you love silent films, you must see this; it will "blow you away"!norm vogelnorm's old movie heaven http://www.nvogel.com/film/film.html

victor sjostrom's silent film masterpiece the phantom carriage has recently been released on dvd with a new soundtrack recorded by ktl. the duo, comprising american guitarist stephen o'malley and austrian laptop artist peter rehberg, has conjured an extraordinary collection of sounds to accompany and accentuate the original film footage from 1921. an ominous banging sound introduces each act and a medley of drones, guitar chords and feedback ebbs and flows as the grim drama unfolds.as impressive as the new soundtrack is, the film remains the real star with its timeless rendering of a dark and dystopian fairy tale. according to this tale the last person to die before the stroke of midnight on new year's eve is condemned to spend a year behind the reins of the eponymous phantom carriage, collecting the souls of the dead. this is the fate of the anti-hero of the film, david holm, who is moved to painful scrutiny of his life following his untimely death and subsequent encounter with the driver of the carriage.this film is often referred to as a horror film and although this is a fitting label, the real horror here resides not in the supernatural elements but rather in the depiction of human suffering at the hands of others. sjostrom gives a remarkable performance as the drunken, spiteful and menacing holm in life, and the wretched, frightened holm looking back from the land of the dead and shrinking from his past deeds.striking imagery abounds throughout the phantom carriage and more than compensates for the inevitably limited dialogue. the ill-omened onset of midnight is powerfully illustrated through the image of a clock-face hovering alone in the darkening night sky like a second moon. equally impressively, the dead are depicted through pioneering semi-transparent imagery and the scenes of the phantom carriage riding over land and sea remain chilling to watch.sjostrom's film deserves its place as one of the most esteemed silent films of all time and the new soundtrack by ktl is a superb accentuation of its themes. this is a must-see.

victor sjöström's "körkarlen" plunges the viewer into life's lower depths for much of its running time, with grim scenes of alcoholic degradation, family violence and suicidal despair, but the most memorable passages involve the mythic image of death itself. here death is embodied as a ghostly horse-drawn carriage, driven by a wretched sinner who was the last person to die on the previous new year's eve. for one year the wretch must collect the souls of the newly departed, and after twelve months of this horrible servitude the driver's own soul is finally released when the last person to die on december 31st becomes the new driver.the scenes involving this carriage (the film was known as "the phantom carriage" or "the phantom chariot" in english-speaking countries) are eerie and mesmerizing, utilizing double-exposure cinematography that was quite sophisticated for its time and still effective when seen today. most strikingly, the carriage travels to the floor of the ocean to collect the soul of a person who drowned. as fascinating as these scenes are, however, the bulk of the film is concerned with the downward spiral of david holm, played by the director himself in an understated portrayal of a man who has given up on the possibility of living a decent life. in flashbacks we see holm enjoying a pleasant day at the beach with his wife, children and brother, and he appears to be a perfectly ordinary guy. abruptly, without segue or explanation, we then see holm as an alcoholic wreck, in trouble with the law and alienated from his family. ordinarily this leap from before to after might feel like a story-telling deficiency, but in this case the filmmakers trust us to fill in the familiar, sordid details on our own. it's suggested that holm has been led astray by his convivial friend georges, the drinking companion who first relates the tale of the phantom carriage, but whatever the cause of his downfall holm appears to be a lost cause, a mean-spirited drunk who takes perverse pleasure in inflicting pain on his family and in refusing to reform.while david holm is our central figure the story's true catalyst is a young salvation army nurse who takes a sympathetic interest in his case and doggedly believes in him despite his hateful behavior. when the nurse herself is dying-- indirectly due to her ministrations on holm's behalf --she demands to see him, and thus inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that will result in his recovery.at times this film resembles dickens' tale of scrooge in its use of ghostly visitors who inspire a deeply flawed man to take stock of his life, suffer over his misbehavior, and reform. i was also reminded of sjöström's 1917 drama "terje vigen," in which a man returns from jail to find his house empty and his family gone (a sequence echoed here). the director also reiterates a standard theme of scandinavian folklore, found earlier in his "berg-ejvind och hans hustru" (a.k.a. "the outlaw and his wife," 1918) that no man can outrun his fate. this time, however, it could be argued that david holm actually succeeds in evading his seemingly inevitable fate, for he's given an unexpected second chance to make amends.viewers expecting a plunge into the supernatural will appreciate the sequences featuring the phantom carriage of the title, but may not be prepared for this film's painful examination of a troubled man's alcoholic downfall. but those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate "körkarlen" in its entirety. it stands with the best serious cinema of its era and is certainly one of sjöström's most accomplished works.

much said without words.this is an excellent movie. it was made in color-not color as in today's films, but a special mono-color use (with shadings) that portrayed meaning, mood, sense and time. it should be seen in color, as it becomes an entirely different film. the story, by nobel prize-winner selma lagerlöf, is effectively presented. one never has a clear sense of real, memory or phantom. changes going on in swedish society at the time are subtly layered. most highly recommend. try to rent it or find it on-line. i saw it in a swedish film class and i want to add it to my film library.

this film is a masterpiece to put it simply. especially the double exposure made by the cameraman julius jaenzon. it is skillfully made even with the standards we are used to today seventy eight years later. viktor sjöström, the director, also plays the main character, david holm. on the night of new years eve he is killed in a fight, and the legend says that the first one who dies on the new year, will have to work as a soul-collector in the form of a transparent ghost. there is a new soul-collector to be appointed every year.the scene in which the alcoholic, david holm, rises up from his dead body (like the soul is leaving his earthly body) in the churchyard (where the fight took place) is a real award for a filmloving eye. also when the present soul-collector arrives with his horse and carriage is a beautiful but also a scary scene. david holm recognizes this soul-collector as a drinkingfriend from earlier life. it is now his turn to take over. just like scrooge in dickens story "a christmas tale", david is shown what his life and doings has led to for the people around him.the film is about the danger of abusing drugs, in this case alcohol. it is based upon a book by nobel prize winner selma lagerlöf. viktor sjöström filmed a few more of her books, but this is the one with the best outcome, maybe because this book is the most filmic of them.

one of the best silent dramas i've seen. as dark and shadowy as anything the german expressionists produced, but featuring performances that were quite understated and naturalistic for the day. no camera mugging and no unintentional laughs due to wild-eyed arm-waving histrionics. sjostrom gave a convincing performance as the drunken, mean-spirited and frightening david holm.set mostly at night in a dingy swedish slum, the film had a very claustrophobic set-bound feel to it, aided by the low key lighting and extensive use of irising.there was a deep, and typically scandinavian, sense of despair and hopelessness to the narrative: the film begins in a rather grim present, and then we're told david holm's story in a series of flashbacks (and flashbacks within flashbacks--a pretty complex story structure for 1921), where his character is offered numerous chances at redemption, but he doesn't take them, and we know he won't take them, because we've seen him die drunk and wretched and mean as ever in the present. the penultimate scene is as dark as any i have seen in all of cinema.the writing and directing is tight and intelligent, even by today's standards. in several instances, sjostrom skillfully sets the audience up to suspect one thing, and then pulls out a surprise. the ending might not be such a surprise to some viewers, but i didn't see it coming.this movie deserves a full restoration and dvd release. or even a crappy budget release. it just needs to be out there so people can see and appreciate it.9.5/10, which rounds up to 10/10

okay , so this wasnt what i was expecting. i rented this film just to see how it would be since i want to see the first one anyway. but , this film had b-movie all over it. but when i watched it i realized that it was very funny. for the first 30 minutes it was just how the snowman was kiiling people and one man losing his sanity. but , those first few minutes had some funny one liners in it. when he throws up the first of his little minions i knew this would be very very funny. they all act like the gremlins in the ninteen eighty four hit gremlins that it made it look like it was spoofing it and made me forget it was a b-movie. so if you like to laugh rent this one.

some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure. i loved this flick but i don't feel guilty about it. you can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie. but jack frost 2 won't go over well with some people. right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it. well, if you get the privilege to watch this movie, after watching it remember that jack frost 2: revenge of the mutant killer snowman is a pleasure, not a guilty pleasure. now, because i can't fill up ten lines heres some great scenes: **spoilers** the three women on the beach had great deaths. the first one had jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them. he kept missing so he dropped an anvil on her. the next woman fell on a bed of icicles. the last one was stabbed in the eyes with tongs.the other great one was where two surfers stoners are hanging out near a frozen pole. one of them gets their tongue stuck on it (of course). jack frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying "cowa-tongue-a dude!". well, you have to see it for yourself.and of course, the snowball children kicked ass.**end spoilers**infinity stars

jack frost 2, is probably the most cheesiest movie i have ever seen in my life. the complete title of the film, is jack frost 2: revenge of the mutant killer snowman. horror movie fans that have a taste for campy story lines, will be delighted to watch this. this film was straight to video, and for good reasons. here's why: the acting, was so atrocious, and so terrible, that it could cause one to cry. the main character had no personality, and the actor's bad acting made it all worse. the screenplay was, was also atrocious. each character always says a cheesy line, and add the cheesy lines to the bad choreography, then you have something bad. second, the story line isn't really all that impressive, but since this movie was straight to video, it is forgiven. the director, and writer could have turned the idea of a killer snowman, into something cool, but they didn't. they story has lots of plot holes in it. in the beginning, a cup of coffee gets knocked into the fish tank, with the melted jack frost. scientists try to restore his life, but they couldn't. once the cup of coffee fell into the tank, jack frost was completely restored. now he is immune to anti-freeze. in jack frost part 1, the main character's dna got mixed up with the anti-freeze that was used to kill jack frost. since the main character is allergic to bananas, jack frost is too. hence, here's my point. they say that sam's dna combined with jack frost's. but, one of the scientists had some saliva on the cup, so when it fell into the tank, the scientists dna would have been combined with jack frosts. another thing, the special effects weren't very good either. here's the good points: jack frost 2 has lots of blood, that looks pretty realistic. even though this movie is flawed to hell, it is still entertaining. overall, jack frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie. the first one was better though. 7 out of 10.

*spoilers*i don't care what anyone says, this movie is friggin' hilarious. this is the sequel to jack frost, a movie about a killer snowman. the snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber, but the truck crashes with a truck carrying dna manipulation chemicals that make human dna bond with dirt, or in this case, snow. the first movie was just boring, and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him.or so they thought.this movie takes place about a year after the second. some scientists resurrect jack frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals. no explanation is ever given for why they do this, they just do. meanwhile, the sherrif who arrested frost in the first is going to the bahamas. unfortunately, the snowman comes with him.this movie has it all. it has talking carrots that can stand up, ice cubes that explode when you stick them in your mouth, and killer snowballs. yes, killer snowballs. they even say "dada!" like babies. i'll have to give the makers of this credit. the snowballs are some of the cutest little things ever dreamed up. i wish that i could get one as a pet. frost finally freezes the island, as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence major weather patterns.then there's the actors. there's manners, the fbi agent from the first movie, except here he's wearing an eyepatch. yarr mateys, shiver me timbers, i be an fbi agent! yarrr! and then there's the stereotypical british adventurer and the stereotypical black jamaican with dreadlocks. and finally, captain fun. the fruitiest man on the face of the planet, bar none.this movie isn't scary, but is is hilarious. i laughed my butt off the whole way through, and i recommend this for anyone who likes a good "bad" movie.*** out ****

the problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in. people come looking for a b-grade horror film, or a "so bad it's good" movie. jack frost 2 is neither of these.it is, to put it simply, a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one. to view it as anything other than a screwball comedy (easily funnier than all three absolutely meritless "scary movies" combined) is to misinterpret the movie on a basic level. it would be like watching shawshank redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions.the premise is simple; the characters from the first movie, haunted by memories of jack frost, take a vacation to a tropical island. a new, improved jack comes after them, now with essentially the powers of hydro-man from spider-man; essentially, he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly, divide himself, multiply himself, and, worst of all, he's managed to grow an immunity to his only former weakness...antifreeze.what's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first jack frost (a simply horrible movie) can't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel. just as alien was a horror film and aliens was all about action, jack frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and jack frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre.most of the entertainment comes the live action actors, who serve admirably. particularly funny among them are ray tooney (playing a caricature of a retired british colonel from the early 1900s), christopher allport (offering an insane, hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film), and david allen brooks (taking the once serious role of manners to new, totally bizarre heights).the lack of "memorable quotes" disturbs me.as a horror movie, jack frost 2: revenge of the mutant killer snowman, rates a zero. but you have to understand, it's not a horror movie.

this movie has everything typical horror movies lack. although some things are far fetched we are dealing with quality snow man engineers. the only preview i can reveal is that i cant wait for jackzilla. dare i say oscar winner. this is a perfect date movie. i advise all men for a nice romantic surprise see this movie with that special person.

where to begin, i like the scary snow-monster named jack frost. the whole concept works well for me, we thought he'd be back and he was. changing the local to a tropical resort works. seeing old friends and meeting new characters. scott macdonald does a great job as jack frost, you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain, you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance. yup, jack frost 2 is a welcomed sequel that is better then the first. i do have one complaint, the little jacks or the jacklings as i call them. they looked like hand puppets. i think they could have done a better job with the jacklings, the mouth could have opened wider, but the cgi was good and as a whole the whole movie is worth watching over and over again. if you liked jack frost, then you will like this sequel. no questions or debate, 9 big stars.

this is better then the first. the movie opens up with sheriff sam .then, sam and anne pack there bags up and head to the tropicana while jack tags along.people are shot, get glass through necks, get squished by anvils, get stabbed with icicles, eyes gouged out, head explosions, drownings, hangings, lobsters shoved into faces, slit throats, freezing to death, killed by snowballs, arms are ripped off, melted by anti-freeze, icicles down necks, hit in face with pots and pans, fingers getting' bitten off, icicles through mouths, bitten on the neck, exploding people, toasted snowballs, and shoved in blenders.the snowballs are hilarious, they put it into a blender and turn it on, then it says 'that was fun' they put in in a waffle thing and it gets burnt. this is just a great movie. then they start thinking of other ways to kill it, and the snowball replies, 'that's not nice'it was worth then ten bucks spent to buy this.10 out of 10 stars.

seriously, i don´t really get why people here are bashing it. i mean,the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd. the good news is, the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of army of darkness. especially in the second half of the film, when the little killer snowballs attack, i laughed my ass off. for example, the put one of the little creeps into a blender (a la gremlins 1) and mix it. after that, it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a high pitched voice "that was fun!".bottom line - incredible movie, rent it.

worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is unbeliaveble but you have to see it really!!!! p.s watch the carrot

okay, i'll say it. this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt. this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film. but the thing that most people don't get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy. i mean, did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece? just look at the "scary" hologram on the jacket of the movie and you'll find your answer. instead, like the original jack frost (which i thought was just as funny), this movie turned out to be a side-splitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue, bad one liners and horrible special effects. and it's all made to deliver laughter to us viewers. it certainly worked for me.for example: anne tiler (to her troubled husband): what makes you frown so heavily darling?if that chunk of dialogue doesn't make you laugh, then you have serious issues. who in their right mind would utter those words in real life? of course, no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous! just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations, and hopefully you'll see what's so damn funny about jack frost 2.

i suppose this movie is not your typical spanish thriller as it is based in a real story that took place abroad. the movie is based in the real story of french man jean-claude romand, and the real case is much more gory and scary than the film. in the real story of mr. romand the family didn't escape, after years of lies he decided to end it all by killing his wife, two children, parents and dog, and although he tried to kill himself, it seems he didn't try very hard as he survived. i watched the movie with people next to me talking about how it could never happen in real life that all these lies went undetected, i was laughing as i had read the book about mr. romand, and knew it did happen. i like josé coronado in this movie, he offered us a good performance, as the rest of the crew.

i just watched this movie at the santo domingo international film festival. while watching the movie i had the feeling that i have seen a movie with a similar story before...a movie with ray liotta but i can't remember much of it. of course, this one is a lot more dramatic, especially at the end.this is the story: emilio's life becomes a lie that he can not longer sustain. after 20 years lying about his entire life to his wife, son and all the people he knows, the truth is chasing him and there is nowhere to go.watching emilio make up lies is exiting and funny but after a while you get tired of the same thing...the affair with a young girl was supposed to ad something but it doesn't. despite that the movie is still funny, exiting and involving. either it makes you want to help emilio with his lies or help everybody else catch him. i liked the analogies, photography and the good performances.7.5 out of 10.

it kept me on the edge of my seat. true, the story has a few plot holes, but the sheer tension of it, the way the director just keeps challenging the premise is simply fascinating.josé coronado and adriana ozores are two of spain's best actors (see la vida mancha and héctor) and here they appear as a happy upper-middle class couple. beneath it all, the truth is that all of coronado's life is a lie. he's not an economist, never went to college or does not work in spain's central bank reserve, as everybody else believes. we get a few insights as to how he kept up appearances or manage to do it, and while not very plausible it is still somehow believable.the inner-workings of the scam are shown intermittently, but it is credible because coronado is a source of self-assurance and assertiveness. he not only believes in the scam, he also believes in the film premise, and therefore he carries it.sure, it tests belief that a wife would not know the inner workings of a marriage's finances for almost 10 years, but again, since he's supposedly a brilliant economist.it has been said, in a nationalistic tone, that the movie is not "distinctively spanish", as if that were a litmus test for good film. true, no castanets or odd cabbies in this one, just a taut thriller. you'll want to know how this story ends once you start watching.

of course, how could he. he obviously co-opted several aspects from that excellent movie, which was also based on the sensational french case of the self-described "doctor in the world health organization" who murdered his family and himself when finally unmasked as a fraud. emilio refers to his son as "monster," he sings to the radio in his car, he hangs out on park benches, and he specializes in investment schemes to defraud his family and friends -- all of this and more directly lifted from "time out," which came out the year before "nobody's life." it's too bad because this movie is pretty good on its own, with good acting and writing. whereas vincent from "time out" is a much more subtle character who seems to have a sense of ethics even though at times it gets twisted into knots, the protagonist here seems devoid of any character at all save for his winning looks and charm. seriously, the part where he used x-rays that show his mother-in-law's cancer to bilk more money from his father, then utilizes a subtle twist on the same scam to avoid eviction from his fancy home for failing to pay the lease on time -- it's almost too much. the guy has no shame whatsoever, in fact, he's more like the lead in "stepfather" than some poor schmuck who gets fired and is so humiliated that he can't face the disappointment of his family and friends and feels forced to invent a shiny new life for himself, as vincent did in "time out." thus, one could feel the tension mounting in "nobody's life" and the violent conclusion coming. one thing "nobody's life" has that "time out" definitely lacked was a love interest apart from the protagonist's trusting wife. it's not hard to understand how the sexy babysitter was able to fascinate and ensnare emile to the degree that he ignored the danger of her natural curiosity and allowed it to lay bare his less than carefully constructed con. given the reservations mentioned, this is a pretty good movie that we found entertaining. if you long for something touching on similar elements that goes a might deeper and is more intellectually and spiritually satisfying, i strongly suggest "time out."

emilio is a successful business man, a perfect father and a good husband. or that is what everybody think. the perfect storyline he has carefully built all along these years will start closing around him all of a sudden. will he be able to keep up with his own lies?this is a very well laid out drama, with great acting and steady direction. even though the plot is pushed up to the limit to increase the tension, the movie explores some of our worst fears... do we really know the people we deal with? can we be so sure?the story develops at an increasingly faster pace as it reaches the point where emilio is not in control of his lies anymore. a good deal of spanish movies have interesting stories but are far from technical proficiency. the perfect rhythm and well shot scenes make the actors so credible, we get inside emilio, and hate him, and suffer for him, as his situation gets more and more desperate. there is no need for any spanish folklore, nor is this an attempt to create a hollywood style flick. this is real spain, 2002, and regardless the obvious unlikeliness of emilio's life existing in reality, there are good chances somebody we know is not quite like the person he claims to be. not just a great commercial product, it will let you wondering where lies can get us to. can we keep up?well done.

this film is like "the breakfast club" meets "mad city." it's got one plot twist after another with justin walker, corey feldman, and james remar delivering really great performances. however, this movie is not for everyone. if you don't like movies that "go all the way" with regards to violence, then don't watch the last twenty minutes. my wife had to leave the room. of course, i couldn't take my eyes off the screen. this is a really gritty, realistic teen drama. i can't believe it came from b-movie king roger corman. this film is a must-see for those who are not faint of heart. highly recommended.

i recently rented this video after seeing "final ascent" by the same writer. i wasn't prepared for how intense this film would get. i found it engaging from start to finish, and was rooting for the teenagers to get away with their attempted crime. the ending was definitely disturbing with some of its implied violence, but well-done. i highly recommend this picture.

this film was so well-paced that i don't think i actually blinked while watching. one intense situation after another kept me glued to the set. however, i would have liked to have seen corey feldman a lot more in this picture. he just steals every scene that he is in. this could be my favorite grown up corey performance. the ending was clever and unlike other films which back away from severing body parts of likeable supporting characters, this film goes for it! i liked that it was not graphic blood and gore but left more to the viewer's imagination. bravo. i literally had to wipe sweat from my forehead during this particular torture scene with a paper cutter. ultimately, the film works because of its likeable lead character and the awesome presence of my all-time favorite bad guy, james remar(48 hours, remember?) i strongly recommend this film for anyone looking to break a sweat.

the efficacy of this picture was best proven on the intended target audience, namely teens. my 14-year-old son became so engrossed in this film that i rate it considerably higher than its imitator "mad city." it sparked debate in our household on issues such as peer pressure and loyalty vs. doing the right thing. for that alone, i rate this film a 10! parents should watch it with their teens and discuss it afterwards.i very much liked the smart dialogue and consistent acting. i thought that james remar was adequate in his role, but the teenage cast really carried this picture. other imdb users have praised corey feldman's performance, which truly is inspired. all in all, i give this picture my highest recommendation. go get this one!

i love this film. tense with great characters. the kid from "sandlot" is excellent as is corey feldman. when the kids storm the bank, it is pure adrenaline. inside of the bank, it becomes a bit like a "lord of the flies" situation where they turn on each other. justin walker from "clueless" is wonderful. i saw this on "showtime" while channel surfing. it was a pleasant surprise. james remar is also quite good here as the small town sheriff. taylor nichols who i love from "barcelona" does a nice job too as a federal agent. i recommend this film for any fan of bank robbery movies with a lot of good characters. i was shocked to discover that roger corman was a producer on this, since the film is not a b movie.

this movie about a group of small town teens that decide to rob the local bank is excellent. brian (justin walker) wants to get out of his small town, much like jimmy stewart in "it's a wonderful life." however, unlike george bailey, brian is going to rob a bank to finance his dream of attending art school, even if his father is not supportive. the offer to brian is to act like a customer and distract the guard. it's a tempting offer that if offered to many, i question what they would do. anyways, brian does it. when the sheriff (james remar) and his force surround the bank, things go from bad to worse. it's a standoff with even the feds moving in to kill the kids if they have a clean shot. the sheriff must prevent this and try to end the standoff in a peaceful way. unfortunately, tensions rise, and the teens inside turn on each other. some are out of control. the paper cutter scene is gruesome and hard to watch. very intense!

this picture doesn't have any big explosions or expensive chase sequences. however, it does have really wonderful performances and an exceptional script that puts this at the top of my "indie-must-see list." taylor nichols and james remar are terrific together. the young cast surprised me with really consistent acting. usually, indie pictures have some weak link, but there are no weak links here. impressive. go get this one.

my wife and i loved this film. smart dialogue, great characters, clever plot construction. the pacing in this film is non-stop. couldn't even get to the kitchen for some munchies. we have never seen corey feldman this funny. taylor nichols plays a good fed...my wife loves him on that "married man" hbo show. the ensemble cast were all strong. the twist at the end had us cheering. that is why we give this film a "standing o."

this "tftd" episode from season one titled ironically "answer me" is a pretty well done and memorable episode, and it takes a shocking twist at the end. you have jean marsh as an over the hill and washed up actress from l.a. who's moved to new york city for an audition and she's living in an apartment provided by an old friend. oddly every night she's kept awake by a ringing phone from the next door apartment, yet oddly enough the dwelling where the ringing phone continues to ring is unoccupied as the guests have been dead for many years. finally she has to give in only she should have followed along and not answered the phone with no one home, as it's bad to get wrapped up in a phone with a life of it's own! overall good episode a strange one though about a supernatural phone still it's suspenseful and it twists well at the end.

i can understand why others reacted rather unpleasantly towards the climax yielding a twist that really is hard to take seriously. i think, though, that the build-up to it works rather well. the music, quite menacing and spine-tingling, really provides a spooky aura matching the unforgiving sound of a constant ringing telephone that is driving struggling english actress, joan matlin(jean marsh)bonkers. she's borrowing a pal's nice apartment while attempting to jump-start her career in new york city(..the city buildings outside the window look about as realistic as david letterman's)and is unceremoniously welcome by a noisy telephone which rings quite a bit, followed by loud slams against the wall. searching for answers regarding the one responsible for such disregard towards her sanity, joan discovers that no one rents that room, and that a former tenant had in fact strangled herself. without help from the manager, joan will decide to find out for herself who is causing her such anguish. joan discovers the room empty and the phone with a particular female voice which will haunt her.the episode, i think, is a tour-de-force for jean marsh who is a one woman show. she's the only actress visible and we follow her through the crisis which slowly erodes her, the phone and the banging from that other room causing her much distress which grows into fear. instead of leaving, joan remains, so shaken by the noise and to the breaking point where she just wishes for the phone(..or whoever is ringing)to stop. the episode provides a possible answer as to who is plaguing joan and why. a character named beth comes into the story rather late as joan struggles to find out whose female voice it was across the other line who knew her name on that dreaded phone she discovers in the room across from hers. the fate of beth might just tell the viewer why joan is being traumatized. i think this episode is an exercise in spooks instead of credibility;some didn't particularly like it, but i certainly did. i will admit that the phone, as a physical menace "crawling" towards joan is hard to take seriously, not to mention it's attack on her, but i thought the intense opening twenty minutes before this were suitably chilling enough to make up for it.

i know that chill wills usually played lovable old sorts in westerns. but his role in this segment is something i've remembered for a long time. wills could be a first rate villain. yes, burgess meredith's fall was correct! that look in hepplewhite's eye! it expressed porcine greed, ignorance, and the threat of violence all at once. quite a performance, i think.the segment itself was a good one, too. question: couldn't the little black bag cure alcoholism? i guess it did, sort of, with fall. but the doctor would have been wise to apply the cure, if he had it, as quickly as possible to hepplewhite.there is one moment that was annoying but also necessary. and it is something that appears to recur in these night gallery segments. it's serling's constant need to sermonize. for that's what we got, one more time, with dr. fall. i don't know what was more frustrating, losing the black bag and all its miracles or not being to stop fall from preaching about the bag's benefit for humanity, all while rubbing hepplewhite's greedy face in the mud, and, therefore, all but begging for hepplewhite to strike out at him. but as i say, it was necessary. at least it was for me. otherwise, we wouldn't have been able to see wills' performance discussed above. all done without moving a muscle or speaking a word.

this is a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold and snowy night. if you like a few laughs with your horror then this is the movie for you. the makings of a real cult classic. it has everything you would want to see in a horror movie. a beautiful girl, a hero, the buffoon, a monster truck and of course a family of mutant satanic killers. this one is full of blood,guts and gore. i strongly recommend watching this one in the wee early morning hours, and be careful of who sees you being entertained by the sounds of monster trucks, bad {but funny } one liners and our hero eating eye ball stew. not as good as the evil dead but a close second. just remember warning..... do not eat before viewing this film...

one of the best film i ever saw.the performance of louis jouvet is fantastic. he really 'fill' his part, and this is wonderful. he's such a good actor that you can't think of anyone else to take his part. and both suzy delair and bernard blier are good as standard french people, trying to defend themselves in the struggle born with a murder...the story is breathtaking and well built. you can feel the ambiance of paris for that period (which is about 1930-40), between two wars... the clubs, the old little buildings, the neighbors.all those things contribute to make a great movie.

first, the obviousas a cop drama crossed with a funny melodrama, quay  is disconcerting ,straightly independent and a menace to banality. jouvet's aplomb is put to good use in a tough cop performance immediately noticeable by its vigor and exuberant force; his antoine is not so much a man of intellect, but a man of vast life experience and earthly instinct. quay  is not subversive in the sense that today's (and already yesterday's ) philistines enjoy using the word. it is clouzot's most playful hour. he tended to adapt steeman's books in a satiric note. (it's said that clouzot was a big reader of detective novels.) as a director, clouzot's firm hand is successful. it is not a mystery or a thriller,but a satirical look at a parisian couple and at the police's proceedings. those accustomed with clouzot's masterpiece les diaboliques might find slightly disconcerting the multiplicity of things, styles, elements in quay .here clouzot speaks about many things, about a couple, and a hidden love story (simone renant's for blier),about the entertainment's world and about old spinsters, about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise, etc.. there is a note of exuberancenot only in jouvet's performance, but also in the film's conception. quay is a realistic crime drama made as a satire. it offers an outstanding performance by jouvet as a tough police inspector. antoine is an old cop with an adventurous past (he fought in africa ,but did not climb the ranks' stair because of his independent behaviors); he lives with his son, a schoolboy; at work, antoine is tough and merciless, an able inspector, bitter, intelligent and harsh. it is a role of great gusto, very picturesque. jouvet composed his character of several defining traitshis clothes, his expression, his funny accent, his brutality, and that mocking air .antoine is not made to look more clever than plausible; when he interrogates blier, antoine makes mistakes ,and his talent is presented like the talent we meet in real lifemixed with errors and lacunae and defects. antoine's talent is one that comes also from experience, from daily observationit's not the almost supernatural _divinatory genius of almost all the famous detectives.quay  is multifacetedit is a realistic crime drama, and also a satire and a melodrama. one can consider it among the first _filmic forays into the legendary toughness of the french police. long ago eastwood's and wayne's harsh cops, there was antoine. the title is interesting, suggesting that this is a movie about the police, not about a case or a mystery. as craftsmanship, clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in france (in the way that welles was). quay  is very true to clouzot's naturea sardonic comic, sharp observations, much psychology, sharp, unsparing irony. the man was firstclass when he filmed somethinghe knew what to shoot, what to choosesee the introductory scenes of this film, with jenny lamour's great stage success. each scene is memorably, _exemplarily shot. clouzot's technical, stylistic aptitudes were amazing. his style is inventive, satirical, sharp, extremely limpid, ingenious. jouvet's style was exuberant, powerful, vehement. (some disliked it precisely for these features. as he had been a great stage actor, his movie style was deemed as too theatrical, etc..) his antoine is a fine example of what was meant by composing a role, by a composition. jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomymuch like a menacing bird of preysomewhat like van cleefyet much subtler, nobler and more intelligent and distinguished. jouvet had this predatory, ferocious air, and it is useful here, as he performs an old tough cop. one of quay 's sides is that it is a jouvet recital. he is immediately recognizable, identifiable by the quality of his play (i see that many, watching this flick, do not know it is a jouvet moviewhich is an astounding quality in itself). fresnay and jouvet are the two french actors that i admire the most; the first one was revealed to me by a renoir drama (the famous one), while jouvet by a carné comedy. i was charmed to see that clouzot gave leading roles to both of them.to end, a word about steeman; he wrote the novel used by clouzot (who had previously adapted another steeman novel, as a fresnay comedy). steeman was an old school mystery writer, in the wallace vein. he became quickly outdated with the new hardboiled fashions. when i was 11 i have read one of his thrillers, and liked it much.

this film is so lovingly made you want to be part of it forever. the flics are straight but not without malice, the goods are transparent and evildoers are hardly there. even the "cabaret" are so naive they'll make you daydream with nostalgia in comparison to anything available on tv. blier is fine, if a bit one sided. louis jouvet is perfect, you just can't have a better copper. he has the best line: "my dad cleaned other people's dirt, and i do the same". susy delair is unbearable, but i guess in part it's the songs, wardrobe and hairdo. simone renant, on the contrary, makes a great femme fatale, if a bit silent. i didn't realize she may be a lesbian as imdb user dbdumonteil and others rightly suggest.

clouzot followed le corbeau, where no one knew who was penning the poison thus everyone was suspected, with another masterpiece, quai des orfevres four years later in which we know from the outset (or think we do) whodunnit. top-billed louis jouvet doesn't appear for forty minutes by which time clouzot has established a rich milieu of music hall, music publishers, etc and a fine cast of colourful characters; angela lansbury lookalike (lansbury appeared in woman of paris that same year) suzy delair scores as the chanteuse whose desire to improve her lot inspires the jealousy of her husband/accompanist bernard blier who follows her to the home of an elderly letch only to find he is already dead. from here things go seriously wrong, his car is stolen before he leaves the premises so his pre-arranged alibi is out the window whilst meanwhile, unknown to him, his wife confesses to the murder to the photographer neighbour, a closet lesbian in love with her, who volunteers to return to the crime scene and retrieve delair's scarf and as long as she's there,thoughtfully wipes her prints of the murder weapon, a champagne bottle. at this point investigator jouvet gets involved and from then on it's a case of keeping the plates spinning in the air. clouzot's output was relatively small but virtually all of it was, as spencer tracey said in another context, 'cherce', with le salaire de peur and les diaboliques still to come. in short this is a must for french cinema buffs.

is it a murder mystery? is it a police procedural? is it a back-stage look at seedy french music halls? quai des orfevres is all of these, but more than anything else it's an amusing comedy of infidelity, jealousy and love, set in post-wwii paris. it may be surprising that henri- georges clouzot, the director of such grim films as le corbeau or such suspenseful nail- biters as diabolique and the wages of fear, is the director of this one. clouzot, however, was a shrewd film-maker. "in a murder mystery," he tells us, 'there's an element of playfulness. it's never totally realistic. in this i share hitchcock's view, which says, 'a murder mystery is a slice of cake with raisins and candied fruit, and if you deny yourself this, you might as well film a documentary.'" quai des orfevres is a wonderful film, and it's no documentary. jenny martineau (suzy delair) is an ambitious singer at music halls and supper clubs. she's a flirt, she's sees nothing too wrong with using a bit of sex as well as talent to get a contract. her stage name is jenny latour. and she really loves her husband, maurice martineau (bernard blier). martineau is something of a sad sack. he's her accompanist and arranger. he's a bit balding, a bit chubby and jealous to a fault. then we have their neighbor, the photographer dora monnier (simone renant). she's blond, gorgeous (think of rita hayworth) and capable. she and martineau have been friends since they were children together. dora, however, is definitely not thinking just of friendship when she looks at jenny. then comes along georges brignon (charles dullin), a wizened, rich and dirty old man, who often has dora take "art" photographs of his young female proteges whom he poses himself. he offers a contract for a film to jenny, and suggests a dinner at his home to discuss the details. jenny is more than willing. maurice is furious and forbids it. jenny shouts right back at him, "you're jealous of the rich! well, i want my share of their dough. i'm all for royalty!" "you're dad was a laborer," maurice shouts back. "so what? under louis xv, i'd have been madame de pompadour! i'd have heated up their tights!" and after brignon is found dead with a smashed champagne bottle next to his bleeding skull, there's dora to try to make things safe for jenny. but wait. inspector antoine gets the case. antoine (louis jouvet) is a tall, tired, middle-aged bachelor with sore feet. he has seen it all. he served in "the colonies" with the foreign legion and returned with an adopted baby and malaria. the child is now about eight-years old and antoine dotes on him. one of the first things antoine discovers is not only did someone brain brignon with a bottle, someone shot him in the heart. who did it? before long jenny, maurice and dora all are making up alibis, lying and, at one or another point, confessing. how will antoine discover the murderer? will we have a chance to see some great music hall songs sung by jenny latour? everything becomes clear, but only with time and detective antoine's persistence. we are left with many kinds of love leading to all kinds of motives, from hair-trigger jealousy to longing glances...and all played with a nice mixture of gallic amusement. clouzot takes us to a paris of seedy but not threatening neighborhoods, to downtrodden music publishers where tunes are played on the piano for buyers, to restaurants with discrete private dining rooms. most of all, he takes us to the music hall where jenny latour often performs. we can see jenny as she sings, with couples in the seats and single men wearing their coats and hats in standing room. and everyone smokes. the first third of the film, in fact, takes place largely in this milieu. with jenny singing about "her petite tra-la-la, her sweet tra-la-la," we follow her from trying out the song at the publishers to a rehearsal to a saucy performance with jenny in a feathered hat, a corset, gartered stockings and not much else. delair, blier and renant all do wonderful jobs, but it louis jouvet who holds everything together. he was a marvelous actor who disliked making films. the stage was his world, and he took on films only if he happened to like the director and to make money to finance his stage work. jouvet was tall with a long face and broad cheekbones. he was not conventionally handsome but he had what it takes to dominate a scene. for a look at how skillfully he could play comedy, watch him in drole de drame. he's a fascinating actor. at one point he says, "i've taken a liking to you, miss dora monnier." "me?" she asks. "yes. because you and i are two of a kind. when it comes to women, we'll never have a chance." jouvet brings all kinds of nuances to that line, from rueful regret to a gentle amusement.

h.g. cluozot had difficulties working in france after he had made "le corbeau" in 1943 which was produced by the german company and later judged by french as a piece of anti-french propaganda. louis jouvet, an admirer of clouzot's work, invited him to direct a thriller "quai des orfevres" where he played an ambiguous police inspector investigating a murder that happened in paris music hall. without each other knowledge, the seductive cabaret singer jenny lamoure (suzy delair) and her jealous piano-accompanist husband maurice who is madly in love with her (bertrand blier, father of director bertrand blier) trying to cover up (without each other's knowledge) what they believe to be their involvement in the murder? enters tenacious policeman (louis jouvet) who is determined to discover the truth. jouvet practically stole the movie with wonderfully cynic and sentimental in the same time performance. "his character, his eagle-like profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable." "quai des orfevres", witty and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses was a great comeback of h.g. cluozot, the fine director, "french hitchcock".

the extraordinarily adorable suzy delair plays a statuesque performer obsessed with succeeding in the theater. her husband and accompanist, played by bernard blier, is a composed but jealous man. when he finds out in a less than preferable way that his flashy wife has planned a rendezvous with a lecherous old businessman with the intention of advancing her career, he loses all control and threatens the businessman with murder. now, at that point, i must stop describing the film to you because it skates on such thin ice with its twists, revelations, ambiguities and suspense that to imply any of it would endanger it. i am not sure how good or bad that is for this french police procedural emanating from the song- and-dance community, though it is certainly interesting that what we do know throughout is who did not do it. we just don't know who did.the story depends upon the procedure of following clues, where ideal alibis fail and where cautiously created fabrications and deceptions disintegrate. interestingly, this is a suspense film in which suspense is generated in spite of the knowledge one would traditionally think too much too soon.quay of the goldsmiths is the least dark of henri-georges clouzot's films. it's nowhere near as sinister as the shocking les diaboliques, as tragic as the riveting wages of fear or as eery as le corbeau. maybe it is due to the vibrance of the dance halls and theater settings of 1940s france, which all work as the milieu of this crime thriller.clouzot both understands and approves of his characters, even the more rotten ones, where he has more of a vindictive streak with his other films. where he may have had understanding for the scheming women in les diabolique or the truck drivers who sink to the level of risking horrible death in order to oust themselves from miserable life in the wages of fear, there isn't necessarily support or agreement on the part of the filmmaker, for these are characters who plainly made the direct decisions that determine their fate. all the characters in this more settling film have scenes and moments that endear us to them, even the harsh, cold detective played by louis jouvet, who worries about his young adoptive son amid all the trouble and despair that happens in his life at any time with the drop of a hat.there is humor and unabashed sexiness, the latter mostly on the part of delair, that neutralize the pressure to a degree. clouzot was quietly practicing his craft, patient till he made his unrelenting later films, in which he would permit his audiences no pardon from the tension.

a nice, humorous mix of music hall (in the first third mostly) and police procedural mystery as the various suspects' stories start to collapse. the final exposure of the murder may come as a surprise if you don't watch closely. a gritty look at paris of the time. you can ignore the final scene (the hollywood ending). louis jouvet is best as the police inspector who seems to be just passing through, but is really on top of things.

the director loves the actress and it shows. the actress inhabits the character, whom we love at first sight and sound. the character loves her jealous unprepossessing husband and he loves her. his childhood friend secretly loves his wife and the fact that his friend is a beautiful woman makes the love tragic and ironic. his wife is jealous of his childhood friend and thinks her attentions are out of secret love for her husband.then there is a murder and the investigating police lieutenant, who loves only his bi-racial son, and resents being taken from his company by the above characters, who have had some unpleasant contact with the deceased and are all lying to one degree or another, unravels the mystery with some of the most precise and authentic procedural detail ever captured on film.and then there are the atmospherics of a post-war paris, where coal is in short supply, music is filled with erotic longing and wistful memory, and innocence has long ago been washed away by the rain.all of this in a milieu of magicians whose tricks don't always work, dogs who walk on their hind feet and express music criticism, hungry news reporters and exhausted cops.and then there are many of the finest actors of their generation who have been through some very bad years directed by, to come full circle, a man who is in love with his lead actress and who, with full justification, was a respected friend of picasso.i've seen this film often and i love all of them and it.

first of all,there is a detective story:"légitime défense" by belgian stanislas andré steeman whose "l'assassin habite au 21" clouzot had already transferred to the screen in 1942,with pierre fresnay and the same actress suzy delair.steeman complained about clouzot's adaptation for both movies.the movie from 1942 was excellent,but the "detective story" side had been kept,so why complaining?as for "quai des orfèvres",clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career.after having directed "le corbeau" and been blacklisted,he had a lot more to say than a simple whodunit.steeman complained essentially about the poor detective ending,which i will not reveal of course,but clouzot focused on the social vignettes,on his characters's psychology,and he did not give a damn about the puzzle à la agatha christie.by doing so,he becomes the genuine predecessor of claude chabrol who has always been closer to him than to alfred hitchcock whom he admires much though. suzy delair has great screen presence,and you will love the song she really sings(she was a singer too)"avec son tralala".bernard blier gives ,as ever,a sparing of gestures and words performance,and he really pulls it off .two characters are particularly interesting and disturbing:the first one,dora,the photographer:she takes pictures of female models ,and clouzot,by subtle touches,reveals us she's a lesbian.of course,the word is never uttered(how could it be in 1947?) the police chief (fabulous louis jouvet) tells her:"you and me,we are not lucky with women."the portrait of this cop is very detailed:we learn a lot of things about him,not necessary connected with the delair/blier plot:he's a widower ,with a son he adores and who runs into school difficulties,particularly in geometry.so we get to know all the characters in depth.one of the most important manifesto of post-war french cinema.

this is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend it. the acting and writing are terrific and there are lots of great twists and turns in the plot. as a french "noir" film, its language is certainly a lot earthier than its american counterparts, but to me this just added to the realism. additionally, i liked how non-glamorous everyone was--particularly the husband and the lieutenant. about the only negative, and the reason the film gets a 9 and not a 10, is because there was a glaring plot hole. like another famous french film, drôle de drame, the confusion between the cops and the accused could easily have been settled in the beginning, but the characters made rather stupid decisions. for this, you just need to suspend disbelief and keep watching--the payoff is well worth the wait.this is simply one of the finest french films i have seen. period.

"quai des orfevres", directed by the brilliant henri-georges clouzot, is a film to treasure because it is one of the best exponents of french film making of the postwar years. m. clouzot, adapting the steeman's novel, "longtime defence", shows his genius in the way he sets the story and in the way he interconnects all the characters in this deeply satisfying movie that, as dbdumonteil has pointed out in this forum, it demonstrates how influential cluzot was and how much the next generation of french movie makers are indebted to the master, especially claude chabrol.the crisp black and white cinematography by armand thirard has been magnificently transferred to the criterion dvd we recently watched. working with clouzot, thirard makes the most of the dark tones and the shadows in most of the key scenes. the music by francis lopez, a man who created light music and operettas in france, works well in the context of the film, since the action takes place in the world of the music halls and night clubs.louis jouvet, who is seen as a police detective, is perfect in the part. this was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was a pillar of the french theater. jouvet clearly understood well the mechanics for the creation of his police inspector who is wiser and can look deeply into the souls of his suspects and ultimately steals the show from the others. in an unfair comment by someone in this page, jouvet's inspector is compared with peter falk's columbo, the television detective. frankly, and no disrespect to mr. falk intended, it's like comparing a great champagne to a good house wine.bernard blier is perfect as the jealous husband. blier had the kind of face that one could associate with the man consumed with the passion his wife jenny lamour has awakened in him. martineau is vulnerable and doesn't act rationally; he is an easy suspect because he has done everything wrong as he finds in the middle of a crime he didn't commit, but all the evidence points to the contrary.the other great character in the film is dora, the photographer. it's clear by the way she interacts with jenny where her real interest lies. simone renant is tragically appealing as this troubled woman and makes an enormous contribution to the film. suzy delair, playing jenny, is appealing as the singer who suddenly leaps from obscurity to celebrity and attracts the kind of men like brignon, the old lecher.the film is one of the best clouzot directed during his distinguished career and one that will live forever because the way he brought all the elements together.

quai des orfevres takes too long getting going, with clouzot so enamored of his back-stage milieu that he is almost in danger of forgetting the story. however, once it does, it's clouzot at his best. bertrand blier (father of bertrand blier and co-star of his buffet froid) is the worldworn pianist who married beneath himself and who plans to kill the seedy studio mogul with designs on his wife only to find that someone has beaten him to it. not only that, but his carefully planned but clumsily executed alibi falls to pieces, not least when a thief steals his car at the murder scenethe film really kicks into life with the arrival of luis jouvet's police inspector, a rather wonderful creation half alistair sim in green for danger and half world-weary maigret with better dialog. in a neat running gag, his investigation is constantly conducted at the top of his voice against chaos and noise, whether it be the noisy typewriters of the police station or a loud rehearsal. the police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation, a wealth of chaotic and telling small details that makes steve bocchco's once revolutionary 80's us cop shows look like antiquated museum pieces by comparison. if suzy delair is a rather unconvincing femme fatale, the supporting cast more than compensate, with the beautiful simone renant a standout as the lesbian photographer in love with her from afar and constantly mistaken for blier's lover by delair and other interested parties (only jouvet, similarly unlucky with women, understands and genuinely sympathises). with great black and white photography by armand thirard, this is a terrific little thriller with a nice twist ending and a lovely scene with a cab driver reluctantly identifying renant in a police station. (trivia note: pierre larquey, who played the playfully philosophical dr vorzet in le corbeau, turns up in smaller roles as a cab-driver in both quai and les espions.)the criterion dvd is quite superb - great picture quality plus an illuminating extract from a french tv show featuring interviews with clouzot, blier and renant.

and i love it!!! wonder showzen will pick up a cult audience and once it's canceled, the dvd sales will go though the roof. this is a very funny show in it's own ways. it's a parody of children's shows, namely sesame street. our puppet characters consist of chauncy, a yellow furry monster with a hat, whose our host. clarence is a blue lizard like thing that does his own segments where he goes out on the streets. him is a weird dog like thing that refers to himself in the third person. wordsworth is the smart one whose brain always shows. then there's the newscaster and the pink puppet. it's a very funny show, not really as nasty as you'd expect, but more the situations. they take 7 year olds out on the street, tell them what to say, and have them make mean jokes that they don't understand. my favorite segments are clarence's videos, especially when somebody doesn't want to be filmed. i prefer tv funhouse, which was a similar show, but this is still a very funny show that i hope lasts for years to come.my rating: *** 1/4 out of ****. 30 mins. tv ma.

i love this show. my girlfriend was gonna get an abortion until we both watched wonder showzen one night. luckily, she killed herself before the baby was born. though technically i think it was considered a murder-suicide.my first thoughts upon seeing wonder showzen? now i know what god watches when he jerks off all the time.wonder showzen is to television what a toaster in the bathtub is to my self-esteem.you know how george w. bush makes speaking gaffes all the time? tyler wouldn't. tyler's good. tyler cuts his nails. he's tyler. he's good. tyyyllerrr...

the cinematography is the film's shining feature. park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera. every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen. every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own. i hope there's a blu-ray release of this film because it will look fantastic. it's rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology park used for his vision. sang-hyeon has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless, has incredible strength, and is vulnerable to sunlight. he doesn't, however, have fangs and also has a reflection in the mirror.although i've never seen the film, i couldn't help but feel like this was chan-wook park's version of twilight. the entire middle portion of the film is devoted to sang-hyeon's and tae-joo's love for one another. it felt like the adult version of twilight, really. there's a lot of blood, nudity, sex, and even a few obscenities thrown in for good measure. maybe it's the chan-wook park fanboy in me, but i honestly feel like i can guarantee that this is the better film of the two. the psychological aspect that i love about park's previous films is in thirst, as well. that's a major factor for me as any film that causes me to think or is unusual in any way winds up becoming a fan favorite. the soundtracks to park's films always seem to fit its respective film like a glove. thirst is no exception. while the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time around, it fit the overall atmosphere of the film rather effortlessly.the middle portion of the film did seem to drag on longer than everything else in the film. it's weird though as the scenes during that time are crucial to the storyline of the film and it's hard to imagine thirst being the same film if any of those scenes were cut. nevertheless, it is my one nitpick of the film.chan-wook park bites into the vampire mythology with thirst and puts his own dark, psychological twist on it. park's films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following: great writing, beautiful cinematography, a solid cast, some sort of psychological twist that'll mess with your head, and a memorable ending. thirst delivers on all fronts and will hopefully get more of the attention it deserved during its theatrical run on dvd (and eventually blu-ray, hopefully).

i wasn't expecting much because of the harsh reviews, and proceeded to enjoy the movie a great deal as a result. softer colors and less stunning compositions of the shots than some of his previous films, in my opinion, allowed the narrative to take the focus. though the religious conflict in a vampire flick was commonplace, i felt like many of the other things were not. for example:how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her.the very strong and well acted love scenes.the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separating them even more.their strong differences of what it means to be 'vampire' created by their prior life experiences.the lack of scores of other vampires appearing or being created through the movie.i've heard and read several things about 'tricks used in other films'. of course. however, i feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and i feel that he does this well. i don't need a director to use new tricks. i prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately, which i feel is the case with this film. i recommend it.

an on screen caption informs us that it is 'the caribbean sea, may 1891'. a small lifeboat drifts aimlessly at sea containing six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship, and the ship's doctor a lt. claude de ross (claudio cassinelli). it's night, a strange current takes the boat towards a strange, unnamed and uncharted island. the boat hits some rocks and is torn apart. one of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fish-man creature. the next morning morning claude wakes up to find himself washed upon a beach. he finds a pool of white bubbling water and one of the prisoners dead beside it. claude warns another surviving prisoner jose (franco iavarone) not to drink the water as it will kill him. they both eventually meet up with the other surviving prisoners, peter (roberto posse), francois (francesco mazzeri) and skip (giuseppe castellano). francois wanders off on his own to try and catch an animal for food, he finds and kills a large water bird. but in turn he is killed himself by one of the fish-men. claude, jose, peter and skip continue to explore the island as they put francois's death down to an animal attack of some sort. soon after skip is killed when he is impaled on a spike at the bottom of a pit. now only claude, jose and peter are left. they stumble across a cemetery with lots of empty graves and signs of recent black magic rituals. claude spots a snake on a nearby rock, suddenly a shot is heard and the snakes head explodes. a woman on horseback named amanda marvin (barbara bach) is revealed to be claudes saviour. she tells them to leave the island immediately as it is owned by a edmund rackham (richard johnson) and he doesn't like visitors. claude, jose and peter decide to carry on regardless, eventually finding rackham's large house in which they are invited to stay. that night peter goes after amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp, peter quickly becomes food for the fish-men. and a voodoo priestess called shakira (beryl cunningham), who lives with rackham, performs a black magic ritual involving slitting the throat of a chicken at the cemetery. the next day claude and jose decide they should leave the island as they feel very uneasy about rackham and think he is lying to them. jose rides off on horseback and is lost. claude is saved from one of the fish-men by amanda and is again told to leave. claude wants to confront rackham again. rackham reveals that he has a scientist, and amanda's father, named professor ernest marvin (joseph cotten) who he needs to be kept alive. rackham says that the longer ernest stays alive the chances of his own survival will dramatically increase. rackham tells claude his plan. rackham has found the lost city of atlantis at a depth of over 2,000 feet. he is using the fish-men as a means of getting at the lost treasures of atlantis, and needs amanda and her father to control them. he claims the fish-men are descendants of the original inhabitants of atlantis. rackham offers claude a share of the treasure if he will help him keep ernest alive. later claude remembers the name ernest marvin as a scientist who was condemned for experiments transplanting animal organs into human beings. finding ernest's secret laboratory he discovers rackham had lied to him and the fish-men aren't descendants, their actually genetically altered people turned into amphibious creatures by ernest's grotesque experiments! rackham has finally had enough of claude and decides to put an end to his meddling by sticking him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water, as the islands volcano starts to erupt and send lava flying everywhere. rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures and amanda, will claude escape almost certain death to save amanda and get off the island before the erupting volcano tears it apart? directed by sergio martino i really liked this film that mixes various genres. the script by sergio donati is fast paced, interesting and entertaining. the plot is revealed bit by bit, which kept me interested in watching it all the way through. i must say at this point that i've seen the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted for it's us release by roger corman. barbara bach makes for an extremely attractive leading lady, but i hated the way she was introduced by shooting a snakes head off, i thought it was more than a little distasteful. richard johnson makes a great villain and claudio cassinelli a likable hero. the fish-men themselves look a little fake when the camera lingers on them too long but their cool looking and i've seen worse. some of the miniature effects look a little poor too, but overall again i've again seen a lot worse. there's no real gore, violence or nudity in it, but that didn't really bother me actually. the photography by giancarlo ferrando and the production design by massimo antonello geleng combine to create a very nice looking film. period costumes, props and sets like rackham's house and ernest's lab with it's old scientific equipment. the lush green jungle settings also add to the visual splendour on show. i really liked this film and i was entertained throughout it's running time. i'm not sure who i'd recommend it too as it mixes various genres, i guess someone who maybe fancies something a little bit different and generally well made. if you can find a copy give it a go, i'm glad i did.

this movie is based on the novel island of dr. moreau by h.g. wells. it's a fairly good one too, it's at least better than the version by john frankenheimer.

1891: stalwart, morally upright military doctor lieutenant claude de ross (solid claudio cassinelli) and several other shipwreck survivors wash ashore on a remote tropical island that's governed with an iron fist by the ruthless and sadistic edmund rackham (superbly played to the deliciously slimy hilt by richard johnson), who lives on the island with the feisty amanda martin (a winningly spunky performance by the ravishing barbara bach) and her unhinged rogue biologist father professor ernest martin (a marvelously dotty portrayal by joseph cotten). moreover, de ross discovers that professor martin has control over a dangerous race of fishman beasts who are being exploited as slave labor by rackham. director/co-writer sergio martino relates the lively and absorbing story at a constant snappy pace, offers a flavorsome evocation of the lush and remote tropical setting, does an expert job of creating and maintaining a creepy and mysterious atmosphere in the spooky opening third, further spices things up with a nice line in dry humor, and stages the exhilarating action-loaded climax with considerable rip-roaring aplomb. while the central premise is obviously inspired by "the island of dr. moreau," the story nonetheless is given a great deal of freshness and intrigue because of martino's artful melding of such diverse elements as voodoo, the lost underwater city of atlantis, a rousing mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption, buried treasure, unscrupulous genetic experiments, and even some exciting rough'tumble fisticuffs between de ross and rackham during the thrilling conclusion into an altogether dynamic, imaginative, and often immensely entertaining whole. the sound acting by the sturdy cast qualifies as another substantial plus: cassinelli makes for a likable hero, johnson essays his juicy villain part with supremely lip-smacking aplomb, bach rates as a quite fetching damsel in distress, plus there are neat supporting contributions by beryl cunningham as sinister voodoo priestess shakira, franco iavarone as the superstitious jose, and roberto posse as surly troublemaker peter. giancarlo fernando's sumptuous widescreen cinematography delivers a wealth of striking visuals while luciano michelini's throbbing tribal score hits the funky spot. the amphibious humanoid fishman creatures are pretty gnarly-looking, too. an extremely fun flick.

watching this odd little adventure movie, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us such high quality giallo classics as the strange vice of mrs wardh and the case of the scorpion's tail, but it has to be said that despite it's low quality production values, island of the fish men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than it's getting. like many italian films from the seventies, this is one is a rip off of a successful american film, the one in question this time being the critically panned island of dr moreau. sergio martino's film takes ideas such as mutation, greed and adventure and moulds it into one slightly compelling film, which makes up for what it's lacks in coherency and logic with a load of mostly intriguing ideas. the central plot follows a boat which crashes on a small island. it quickly becomes apparent that not everything about this place is normal, and it soon transpires that half of the population has been turned into "fish men" - a cross between a man and a fish, which exist for purely selfish reasons...the truth about this movie is that it's a lot more fun if you ignore the trashy production values. the central monsters look completely ridiculous, and much of the movie takes place on sets that look like they cost someone a few pennies - but the movie is well shot in spite of this, with the underwater photography being a particular highlight and the pacing of the movie is well done in that the film never becomes boring. the way that the plot comes together isn't exactly genius, but it takes in a lot of ideas and i've seen films made on plots with much less thought put into them than this one. the biggest location standout in the film is definitely the lost city of atlantis. to be honest, i'm not a massive fan of adventure movies, and therefore don't see this lost city get mentioned much - but it is always nice to see it in a movie. the central island location is good in that it provides an apt setting for the story and also provides the movie with the right amount of mystery, as martino makes good use of the voodoo theme. overall, this isn't exactly a classic and there are certainly a lot worse trashy adventure movies out there than this one.

lt. claude (claudio cassinelli) and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by edmond rackham (richard johnson). following a few random prisoner deaths, rackham takes in claude and his two remaining prisoners. luckily for everyone, barbara bach just happens to be on the island too! unluckily, there are some crazy fishmen who like to kill people.this italian produced exploiter seems to have it all - a touch of creature from the black lagoon mixed with dr. moreau with a dash of white zombie voodoo and atlantis stuff. despite some wonky looking fishmen costumes, the film does benefit from some beautiful location photography and a nice twist about halfway through. all of the actors are good and joseph cotton even pops up as a old biologist. director sergio martino handles himself well enough as there is action ever 10 minutes or so. that can't be said for his belated follow-up the fishmen and their queen (1995), easily one of the wackiest and most off-base sequels since highlander ii.

sure, most people will designate "island of the fishmen" as silly and trashy hokum, but can you honestly name one other movie that brings forward this many exhilarating themes? this italian gem stands for pure entertainment and features stuff like voodoo, volcanic eruptions, mutant fish-creatures, the mysterious continent of atlantis, treasure-hunting, a remote island filled with death traps and utterly mad scientists! all this and much more in one simple movie? yes, please! close-minded opponents of italian horror cinema can easily tag this film as a cheap exploitation version of "the island of dr. moreau", but the truth is that this is so much more! "island of the fishmen" delivers thrills and adventure from start to finish with surprisingly convincing special effects and astonishingly stylish camera-work. the story promisingly opens with a small group of prisoners, survivors of a shipwreck, washing ashore a tropical island. they encounter the sadistic edmond rackham who rules over a native tribeand a legion of genetically created amphibian monsters that live in the island's swamps. there are so many twists and additional sub-plots in the story that it's almost impossible to write a summary but, trust me, this gem is worth checking out. sergio martino once again proves that he's an ingenious filmmaker who has the talent to be commercial-minded and creative at the same time. he makes great use of the beautiful island location and also the interior sets look very impressive. the staggering underwater footage and imaginative scenery really lift this film high above the normal standards of late 70's exploitation. i don't quite understand why roger corman reworked the original so much and released it on the american market under a different title ("screamers"), because there are very few elements open for improvement. the cast members are all sergio martino regulars (with the exception of the great joseph cotton is a neat supportive rule) and give away great performances. in case you can get your hands on the recently restored german version, you're treated to fifteen uncut minutes of extra action. see it!

this is a very odd movie for harold lloyd--at least in regard to the sweet character he played in movies throughout the 1920s and 30s. instead of a nice guy, he and snib pollard are con men--out to rob everyone blind. in a particularly successful con, chester pretends to have lost a "very valuable ring" and a bit later, harold finds it as a stooge is also looking for the ring. the ring, of course, is a cheap one dropped and then found by harold, but the greed of the stooge is so great, he "convinces" harold to say nothing and sell him the "valuable" ring and then they run away to enjoy their luck(?). again and again they find patsies until they meet up with a woman who herself is a con woman (working with a guy doing fake séances). she arranges a nifty con and takes all the money they stole--and has a cop standing by to make sure they give her the money.as luck would have it, the two con men stumble into the lady's shady business when no one is home. soon, the lady returns and messes with their minds--releasing a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for their wicked ways.all around, this is a completely odd and contrived film, but it is also exceedingly funny, as the jokes work very well and lloyd and pollard make an excellent team. plus, while creepy and strange, i liked seeing pollard dressed like a lady.

i just watched this, an early harold lloyd short film that featured his "glasses" character on kino video's dvd of "the harold lloyd collection". he's actually a con man with snub pollard as his partner who gets discovered by bebe daniels who herself performs fake séances. what she discovers is that lloyd and pollard bilk many customers by dropping fake rings that are "lost". i'll stop there and just say this was quite funny especially when harold and snub enter the place bebe works and encounter some creepy contraptions and put on costumes like snub trying one of bebe's outfits. not too much slapstick but what there is of was also quite funny. so on that note, i recommend are crooks dishonest?

was struck at how even the acting was throughout. william haines had an acting range that is wonderful for silent film. not over the edge. there are moments where the camera work is most excellent, and combined with the story, like when he is waiting to see the superintendent, very well done. thoroughly enjoyed the flick.

a brash, self-centered army cadet arrives at west point with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the corps.in a role obviously tailor-made for him, william haines shines in this highly enjoyable tale of honor & friendship. a grade-a scene stealer, haines during the first half of the film is up to his usual silly billy behavior, which under normal circumstances should have gotten him confined to the guardhouse. the last half, however, becomes very serious, leading up to haines' moral redemption and giving him a fine opportunity to exhibit his acting talents. if west point does not quite reach the caliber of haines' previous tell it to the marines (1926), this is doubtless due to the absence here of a costar of the charisma & quality of lon chaney for haines to interact with. however, this tribute to the army is very effective entertainment and should be appreciated on its own merit.joan crawford appears as haines' love interest, playing the virginal daughter of the local innkeeper. joan is pert & pretty and especially shines in her first scenes, when she meets haines on a hudson river ferry and is subjected to his usual immature antics. haines & crawford made five silent feature films together and were tremendous friends for life. he was the much bigger celebrity at this period and gave her many hints for getting ahead in hollywood. a superstar herself by the early 1930's, she reciprocated after his ouster from mgm in 1932 by encouraging his career change to interior decoration.little william bakewell is effectively cast as a plebe who idolizes haines; their relationship is actually given more of a sentimental treatment than that of haines & crawford.the film was made with the full cooperation of the war department. extensive location filming at the academy helps tremendously with the production's ambiance, which was given splendid production values by mgm.west point has been recently restored and given a rousing new score by david davidson.

haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks west point will really amount to something now that he has arrived. haines displays his easy, goofy comic persona as he takes on west point and joan crawford, the local beauty. great fun for the first half. and amazingly touching after haines's character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets. the new, humility-filled haines get s alast-minute reprieve to play in the bill football game against navy and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. great, rousing entertainment by mgm in this haines formula film, shows billy at his best. william bakewell also scores as the skinny follower. the handsome-but-goony character would be played by clark gable, cary grant, gary cooper and others in later decades, another take on the beautiful-but-daffy dames played by carole lombard and marion davies. west point is a winner!

i found west point to be an agreeable film, although i doubt that i would watch it again. the performances were convincing, with william haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has his come-uppance by film's end. it's hard to believe that stardom beckoned joan crawford less than a year after this film was made, as she looks rather awkward at times. i would apply the comment made by another concerning ramon novarro's "huddle" (1932) to this film as well. there is a great film waiting to be made here, but there is something lacking. the backdrop and integration of the corps was well utilized, but i was less involved than i thought that i would be. perhaps haines' character went too far, or got away with too much. his "repentance" did not seem genuine enough; and what kind of message did it send for him to run every play in the last minutes of the army-navy game? where's "the corps" in that? might as well have taken out the other ten men and let him do it all himself. also, i doubt very much that william bakewell's weak, puny character would ever have a real-life counterpart at west point.all this aside, the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring. it is a fine look into the daily practices of an honorable institution. thank goodness that tradition still means something at west point too, unlike the vapid "traditions" of ivy league schools, only half-heartedly engaged in these days.as to the score: it was appropriately martial. but, there was a distinct over-use of snare drums. using them for knocks on the door, scene transitions, et alu as well as in well over half the scenes got to be rather tedious. it rather lessened the viewing experience. i was ready to say "i get the point already." with that, enjoy the film, but don't expect too much emotional involvement.

william haines sparks this tale of a brash cadet who thinks west point will really be something now that he has arrived. terrific goony comic performance by haines was his trademark--one that made him a top box office star from 1928-1932 and one of mgm's biggest stars. joan crawford and william bakewell are fine too. and although this storyline may seem trite now, this was a huge hit, putting haines and crawford in a college football (a national craze during the 20s) story. after haines blows off his big mouth one time too often and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets, he turns in a wonderful performance as he swallows his pride and gets into the big game against navy. even with a broken arm, he wins the game for army and regains his place at west point. it's easy to see from this film and show people (with the always underrated marion davies) why billy haines was a huge star of the time. he needs and deserves to be remembered!

it is a shame that this series hasn't been remastered and produced on video by warner or some other professional movie house.copies of most episodes are available, but are usually of poor quality, being copies of copies of copies.as i understand it, 92 episodes were produced during its run, but only 15 are noted here.some of the series writers, such as richard matheson, went on to become noted authors.excellent series, well written, well staged and well produced.michael weldon,udon thani, thailand

of the korean movies i've seen, only three had really stuck with me. the first is the excellent horror a tale of two sisters. the second and third - and now fourth too - have all been park chan wook's movies, namely oldboy, sympathy for lady vengeance), and now thirst. park kinda reminds me of quentin tarantino with his irreverence towards convention. all his movies are shocking, but not in a gratuitous sense. it's more like he shows us what we don't expect to see - typically situations that go radically against society's morals, like incest or a libidinous, blood-sucking, yet devout priest. he's also quite artistically-inclined with regards to cinematography, and his movies are among the more gorgeous that i've seen.thirst is all that - being about said priest and the repressed, conscience-less woman he falls for - and more. it's horror, drama, and even comedy, as park disarms his audience with many inappropriate yet humorous situations. as such, this might be his best work for me yet, since his other two movies that i've seen were lacking the humor element that would've made them more palatable for repeat viewings.

...the last time i laughed this much. it's a testament to the talent of rowan atkinson that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality - without hardly ever speaking a word. the whole success of the program rests on atkinson's shoulders, but he carries it with ease. despite the fact that the show only ran for one season, anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the rubber-faced social 'tard, so great is the talent and effort put into the performance. at times exasperating, at times lovable, mr bean is an innocent, unlucky chap who also happens to be evil incarnate. the brilliance of this character cannot be put into words, you have to see for yourself.the show gets almost too depressing at times, like in the infamous new year's eve sketch, or when bean celebrates his birthday by going alone to a restaurant, offering himself a congratulatory card signed by himself, and being served a stake he doesn't quite fancy. still, there are times when you can't help but feel impressed by the inventive methods by which bean gets himself out of trouble, like when he disposes of said stake in numerous clever-ish ways, or when he changes into swimming trunks without taking his trousers off first! whatever your reaction to bean and his unorthodox lifestyle, you're bound to throw fits of laughter while watching. finally, i'd like to point out that although "bean" is classified as a program for children, it is just as enjoyable for any grown-up with a sense of humour. because the more "adult" jokes will go over the heads of the little ones and the intelligent slapstick (yes, there is such a thing) is funny no matter what age you are, "bean" is the truest definition of a family show. this is justly a classic and it always brightens up my day.

"mr. bean", starring the legendary rowan atkinson, was a huge hit during its run in the 1990s, and i probably first saw it when i was around ten, shortly after it ended, so i was seeing reruns. i certainly wasn't much of a fan at the time, and didn't see too many episodes. i didn't really get into the show until my late teens, just a few years ago, which was when i finally watched every episode. unlike before, it made me laugh many times, and since then, that has always been the case during repeat viewings of episodes! mr. bean is a mysterious, self-centred, antisocial, extremely naive buffoon whose best friend is his teddy! he is pretty much isolated from society, and life is not easy for him, as he constantly struggles with very simple things! this is because he lacks some fairly basic knowledge, and has the mind of a child. he finds himself in various kinds of trouble wherever he goes, and comes up with very bizarre ways to try and solve the problems he faces! not only does he often cause trouble for himself, but sometimes for other people as well, which he often doesn't tend to realize! in other words, mr. bean is a walking disaster! the humour in this show is very visual, and there is very little dialogue. the gags are almost always sight gags, which is mostly what the show is about. while there may be an occasional lacklustre gag, i would say the vast majority of them are funny, often hilarious, (there are so many highlights)! while "mr. bean" is certainly not the most sophisticated comedy ever made, it's still great for many of those who like visual humour, and due to the very limited dialogue, you don't even have to speak fluent english to enjoy the show, which is why it has received such a world-wide reputation! the show ran for a few years, but the episodes were made very gradually, so only fourteen were made in total. nonetheless, it is a classic series, and deserves its wide appeal!

mr bean was great fun, i loved it, every episode was really funny, rowan atkinson was perfect for this role, he's a funny looking bloke and his facial expressions were hilarious!!! the series was so successful that they even made a mr bean movie in 1997, which was also pretty funny by the way!! it's funny seeing all the adventures and situations he gets himself into, this series was a classic for sure, and i still watch an episode from time to time.mr bean is well worth a 10/10 in my book, fans of offbeat comedy must check this out.

star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning mr bean (rowan atkinson) is in this world, but not of this world. his mind simply doesn't seem to comprehend things the way an average person would and his life is one long disaster because of this, getting himself into constant mishaps and far out, zany situations, which he is left to sort out on his own as he doesn't seem to mix with anyone and he rarely speaks. but he never gives up and, despite the simplest of tasks being a constant struggle for him, applying his own zany methods of solving the problem always pays off for him in the end.to look at the sorry state of modern british humour, with all it's focus of sex and general vulgarity, you'd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like mr bean was made at one time. there's nothing unsuitable going on here, just good, clean u rated humour of the type tommy cooper and the like made in the 50s. and i find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my early 20s as i did when i was a young boy in the early 90s.although i can look at it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than than meets the eye. there must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to keep going wrong for him. as others have noted, it looks like he may have a type of autism. in fact i'm so convinced about it that i really think were a professional psychologist to analyse him, i think mr bean could be the first famous, fictional character to be diagnosed with something like asperger's syndrome.if you'd like to see some truly hilarious british humour at it's very best before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity, then this would come highly recommended. shows like little britain do work because it's well realised but it's really just as vulgar as the rest. shows like this show we were more restrained and civilised once, and hopefully we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon. *****

hearkening back to those "good old days" of 1971, we can vividly recall when we were treated with a whole season of charles chaplin at the cinema. that's what the promotional guy called it when we saw him on somebody's old talk show. (we can't recall just whose it was; either merv griffin or woody woodbury, one or the other!) the guest talked about sir charles' career and how his films had been out of circulation ever since the 1952 exclusion of the former "little tramp' from los estados unidos on the grounds of his being an "undesirable alien". (no schultz, he's not from another planet!) charlie had been deemed to be a 'subversive' due to his interest and open inquiry into various political and economic systems. everything from the anarchist movement from the '20s (and before), the technocracy craze to socialism in its various forms were fair game for discussion at chaplin's hollywood parties; which of course meant the inclusion of the soviet style, which we commonly call communism.compounding mr. chaplin's predicament was both confounded by one little detail. he had never become an american citizen.anyhow, enough of this background already! suffice it to say that he had become 'persona non gratis' in the united states of america. .it was high time to get the old films out of the mothballs and back out to the movie houses. it'd sure be a great gesture by us easily forgiving and quickly forgetting americanos.it would be a fine gesture to the great film making artist; besides, the academy of motion pictures arts & sciences was planning to honor chaplin with a special tribute at the 1972 oscar show. this would surely be a tearful yet joyous packaging of pathos a plenty for having america invite charlie back and have him come and receive a special academy lifetime achievement award in front of a world-wide television audience numbering in the millions. besides, that would be a natural for promoting the chaplin season at the theatre! (remember, the little tramp was as astute as a bu$ine$$ man as he was as a film maker!) the program consisted of showings of modern times, city lights, the great dictator, monseur verdoux, a king in new york and finally the chaplin revue. we remember being very excited in the anticipation of the multi date film fest.in our fair city of chicago, it was booked for the carnegie theatre on rush street. the festivities lead off with modern times and all of the others would be shown one at a time, each staying for whatever period was necessary in order to satisfy the public's desire to view each picture. as we recall, the very last on the schedule was the chaplin revue.in retrospect, we look back and wish that they had begun the run with revue; as there were undoubtedly legions of moviegoers (much like ourselves) who knew very little about his accomplishments in motion pictures, except for those keystone, essanay and mutual silent shorts that were being shown as regular feature on so, so many kiddy shows all over the country. oh well, once again, no one consulted me!concentrating on today's honored guest film, the chaplin revue, we found that it was actually three separate pictures; carefully bound together by the use of narration by chaplin (himself), some lively themes and incidental music (once again written by chaplin) and some happy talk and serious narration (ditto, by chaplin.) he opens up the proceedings by making use of some home movie-type of film depicting the construction of the chaplin studio in hollywood, as well as some film taken of some rehearsal time, showing director chaplin demonstrating just what he wants to a group of actors.this segment was well done and well received by the audience. both the building humor and the rehearsal were amplified by making them seem accelerated. (the rehearsal naturally, the building by use of speeding up the camera's photographic process. the old trick makes it appear that the buildings were almost building themselves.this amalgam of shorts incorporated three of chaplin's short comedies from his stint with first national pictures.; roughly that being 1917 to 1923. the choice was well thought out and gave us a wide variety of subject matter and mood.first up was shoulder arms (charles chaplin productions/first national pictures, 1918). as the title suggests, it is a tale of world war i. released in october of 1918 with about a month to go before the armistice day of november 11, it was a comedy of comical army gags and a romance between private chaplin and a french girl (miss edna purviance). the levity is fast, physical and in the grand old tradition of ridiculing the enemy, the german army.displaying an excellent example of the old adage about children and dogs bringing folks together, the next film a dog's life (chaplin productions/first national, 1918) traces the parallel lives of chaplin's tramp and a newly adopted stray, scraps. the movie story involves families, two of them. one homo sapiens, one canine and both supplying us with some big surprises.as the finale, we have the pilgrim (chaplin/first national, 1923) was a good choice to have as the finale. it was bright, light and tight. it was an excursion into the area of the western spoof, comedies of such type having been done since by every comedian and team. the "pilgrim" in the story is not of your standard thanksgiving variety; but rather a "dude" or "tenderfoot", who has ventured out west. the tramp is not only that guy; but his character is an escaped convict who is mistakenly thought to be the new clergyman of a western town's church!our rating (that is schultz and me) is ****. (that's four derbies)poodle schnitz!!

most of chaplin's most famous films are his full-length features. and, i assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of him from his pre-feature days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts. this is really a shame, as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century.if someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of chaplin's better shorts because chaplin himself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film. this is great for several reasons. first, in chaplin's earliest films from 1914-1915, his character of the little tramp is still in its earliest incarnations or is absent altogether. plus, even when he is there, he was often mean-spirited and self-centered--something very alien from the little tramp we have grown to love. second, because the shorts that were chosen were in great condition, if you watch this film you won't need to worry about watching scratchy film with gaps and lousy musical accompaniment that doesn't fit the action (a common problem).so, for a great look at chaplin's shorts at their finest, give this film a chance. it's sure to provide you some excellent laughs.

the three shorts included on this compilation issued in 1959 are timeless chaplin classics, nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either. chaplin's score for these films and the framework added as bridging sections between the shorts are also well done. the problem with this compilation is a minor one, yet annoying. the shorts have been stretch-printed to fit the 24 frame p.s. speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at 20 frames p.s. this results is jerky motion that doesn't look very attractive, and yet this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time, it's just not excusable that the current dvd version is unrestored, the films look dirty as they did in 1959 and are still stretch printed. there are separate restored versions of these classics available, even on dvd, and it would not be a problem to restore the image, but alas this has not been done.a minor quibble has taken up a lot of space in my article, but i say again a minor quibble, it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating. the shorts are still worth '10'.

in the late 1940s there was a short film series entitled "flicker flashbacks" in which excerpts from silent dramas featuring the likes of mary pickford and blanche sweet were played for laughs. scratchy clips from antiquated old movies were rearranged, projected too fast, and given an overlay of jangly music and lame quips. the attitude expressed through this brutal treatment pretty much summed up mid-century hollywood's view of its early days: silent cinema was considered hokey, florid, a little embarrassing, and only good for a chuckle. during the 1950s this attitude gradually began to change for a number of reasons. james agee's famous 1949 essay on the silent clowns for life magazine was a factor, but television played a major role in reacquainting viewers with silent movies. admittedly, the tv networks sometimes handled the material as crudely as the "flicker flashbacks" people, but higher-toned series such as "silents, please" treated the films with respect. another milestone was robert youngson's compilation feature the golden age of comedy, which proved to be something of a surprise hit when it was released to theaters late in 1957.i don't know if charles chaplin was aware of youngson's film or its success at the box office, but it was around this time that he decided to launch a theatrical re-release of three of his best short comedies, a dog's life, shoulder arms (both made in 1918), and the pilgrim (made in 1922 and released the following year). these three movies happened to work well as a trio since they contrast nicely in plot, theme, and setting. in addition, all three feature familiar faces from chaplin's stock company, some of whom play multiple roles in each short. at the time of the re-release the films hadn't been publicly screened in over thirty years, so perhaps chaplin was concerned about maintaining his reputation with a new generation of movie-goers, especially since his best work was seldom shown on television in the new medium's early days.unfortunately, chaplin apparently concluded that the films moved too quickly at the old silent projection speed, so the decision was made to "stretch-print" them, which meant that every other frame was printed twice. maybe he wanted to avoid the 'flicker flashbacks' look, but this wasn't the best way to go about it. aesthetically speaking, the results were awful and practically destroyed the movies' flow of action, but nonetheless that's how the chaplin revue was released to theaters in 1959, and that's the version that was transferred to video and made commercially available by playhouse video in the 1980s. i purchased a vhs copy of the movie at the time and was terribly disappointed with the jerky, stop-and-start rhythm of the films.it's a particular pleasure to find that david shepard's restoration of chaplin's compilation (originally produced for the laser-disc format) is a vast improvement over the playhouse video version. for the most part, the projection speed has been corrected. the "stretch-printing" is gone at any rate, though the action seems to drag a bit at times. for example: in a dog's life during edna & charlie's awkward dance in the green lantern cafe, edna's bare arms appear visibly blurred; at another point, during the trench scene in shoulder arms when charlie is relieved from sentry duty, the action appears oddly slowed-down for a few moments, but this may be the result of a maneuver by the film restorers to cover a bit of decomposition. over all, picture quality is fantastic considering the age of the movies themselves.other bonuses: the revue begins with rare behind-the-scenes footage taken at the chaplin studio. this includes shots of an obviously staged, jokey rehearsal session where chaplin throttles diminutive actor loyal underwood, as well as scenes of charlie at his dressing table putting on his makeup and trimming the famous mustache. these scenes are accompanied by chaplin's narration, delivered at a rapid clip. chaplin also composed a new musical score for the compilation, and in my opinion his themes for the revue rank with his best compositions, especially the pieces used during the café sequence in a dog's life. the only exception is the song written for the pilgrim, a pseudo-singin' cowboy number called "bound for texas" sung 'fifties-style by matt monro (sounding rather like gene autry), which is distractingly anachronistic and out of place. otherwise, throughout the rest of the revue, the music is perfectly suited to the action and the atmosphere.it feels as though the image release of the chaplin revue is, in a sense, its long-postponed debut, presenting these classic comedies the way they were meant to be seen all along. in this form, the revue ranks with chaplin's most durable and enjoyable works.

this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it.who cares about the plot or the acting.this is an italian horror movie people so you know you can't expect much from the acting or the plot.everybody knows fulci took footage from other movies and added it to this one.since i never seen any of the movies that he took footage from it didn't matter to me.the italian godfather of gore out done himself with this movie.this is one of the goriest italian movies you will ever see.no gore hound should be without this movie in their horror movie collection.buy this movie no matter what it is a horehounds dream come true.

i honestly have to say that a cat in the brain is one of the most fun and unintentionally hilarious films i've ever seen. this film is packed with stupid dialog, ridiculous scenes, and a self-involving plot, starring legendary horror director lucio fulci himself.the threadbare story-line is about an aging director (fulci, who is also named lucio fulci in the film...)who is starting to go nuts and hallucinate because of all the vicious things he's put down in film over the past many years. he goes to a shrink who hypnotizes fulci, and tells him that he will believe himself to be a killer, but that the shrink will actually be the one doing the killing. the rest of the film is made up of shots from the "film" that fulci is directing during all this action, scenes of the shrink killing people all-the-while grinning like a f!cking moron, and some of fulci's hallucination sequences. oh, and a few tits thrown in for good measure as well...a cat in the brain is completely over-top-and ridiculous in every sense. the gore is classic fulci - nasty and strong with some really decent scenes. the chainsaw sectioning of a female corpse is pretty cool, as is the chainsaw beheading of a small boy. lots of stabbings, gougings and other cool kill-scenes make this one a pretty non-stop bloodbath. the ridiculous dialog (lick it!!!!lick it!!!), as well as some of the insanely goofy scenes (the nazi orgy, the opera singing slap-fest and the running down of an innocent hippy come easily to mind...) make this one fun as hell. not nearly as dark as some of fulci's other films - cat is more of a self-indulgent horror/comedy that if it wasn't meant to be funny, is actually kind of sad. i say to grab a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle in to this one. i watched cat with a few friends and we laughed the entire time. this is the feel-good movie of the summer...recommended 8/10

this is an interesting movie. i think it's very humorous, although the humor is very black. fulci is good and funny acting himself, it's a really funny and truly crazy "self-portrait" of an artist ("i make horror films. if i would make love films, no-one would buy tickets..."). and it's really sexy movie also: almost all the time there is some "action" or tension going on; and many sexy girls/women... maybe it goes to the core of why anyone starts to do movies/art in the first place... it's a real psychedelic trip, maybe best seen a little drunk or some similar state of mind. there is some really nasty gore scenes also, of course, because it's lucio fulci. as a matter of fact some of those scenes are quite disgusting. anyway it's one of the three best and most complete fulci films i've seen (the others are house by the cemetery & zombi.haven't seen the beyond). actually, the script is overally, to my opinion, quite ingenious. you could see this movie as a portrait of an extreme neurotic, or a person who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder (fashionable words): the character has a compulsive need to confess "crimes" or bad thoughts; especially crimes he hasn't even done. and he questions himself all the time: what if i have done it? what if i want to do it? have i done it? do i want to do it? he overreacts and exaggerates his thoughts. i'm sure fulci has been interested of psychology, and maybe even read something of the area; in his "house by the cemetery"-movie for example there is a character named freudstein. this is maybe the most concentrated and straightly personal movie fulci did. i also like the simplicity of the photography/pictures in this film. only thing that disturbs me a little bit is the sadism, especially towards women; i don't quite understand why? is it entertainment? is it art? is it horror? anyways and overall, this is really interesting and well made movie, definitely recommended classic film at least for fans or anyone interested of this genre. for the others it may be too much.

lucio fulci was one of the most prolific italian directors by the time of his death in 1996, yet his career had long since descended into a downward spiral of increasingly futile genre entries that could barely stand in the shadow of his earlier work. for much of the '70s into the mid-'80s, he cranked out such stylistically distinctive horrors as "city of the living dead," "the beyond," and the brutal giallo "the new york ripper," fondly remembered by fans like myself. and while "cat in the brain" falls in with the era of fulci's decline as a filmmaker, it is a shocking, darkly hilarious headtrip that, while a clearly inferior work (the framing, effects, and acting are below par), proves an interesting, open-ended meditation on pop psychology and film's ability to desensitize. make no mistake: "cat in the brain" is a total gorefest, and as disjointed as fulci's previous films, but it deserves credit for trying to be something more. in a deliciously tongue-in-cheek touch, fulci plays himself: a director in the midst of filming yet another violent horror flick who comes down with perverse/murderous hallucinations; after visiting a shrink who puts him under hypnosis, his dreams and reality begin to intersect, to the point where the viewer cannot discern the two. the recent dvd from grindhouse releasing mentions "cat" as an heir apparent to the likes of "eraserhead," and it does carry a similarly disquieting, awkwardly funny quality associated with the best surrealist art.

fulci... does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made? answer: yes! cat in the brain, also known as nightmare concert is fulci's last masterpiece. yes it is, no matter what some people will say about it. there are few facts why this movie is one of the best fulci's movies.fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one. lead roll in this movie is no other then fulci himself, who plays... well horror-splatter-gore director, who thinks he is slowly going insane. it's filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here. being fulci flick, you need to know it's gory. how much? well pretty much. i always loved gore in the movies and i never get enough of it, but cat in the brain actually stopped my thirst for gore, and believe me, it's a hard to archive. even the braindead didn't stop it. citb is all about gore. almost every scene revolves about fulci, who after being hypnotized by *khmmm* evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees. some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey, and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor, which starts to spit some ooze from it's wounds. forget the beyond or zombie 2, this is the goriest fulci movie! now i like how fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie. he is such a brilliant director. some funny moments and lines happens from time to time, like one where fulci says "making gore movies is kind of a sickness" ending is very good considering that fulci (and most of the italian horror masters) is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes. if you are fun of the fulci, make sure you check it out. if you have a weak stomach, avoid this and repeat "its only a movie" ps. some of the gore scenes within this movie: chainsaw dismemberment (full), tongue torn out, eyeballs torn out, maggot infested corpses, zombies, decapitations, face being putted in boiling water, stabs in the shower (to head), throat slit, many parts of the body and organs being toast aside, hammer smashed face...

in the late eighties and early nineties the decline and death of independent video companies like vestron and media effectively shut off italian horror films for much of it's american audience. coincidently(?) italian genre films also declined in quality and profitability.occasionally movies like primal rage, "sequels" like beyond the door iii, troll 2, and a few dario argento films limped out onto video but most remained unreleased (until dvd) in the us for nearly a decade or longer. movies from these lost years became very sought after and talked about among horror fans.of these films, cat in the brain is probably one of the most hyped of all due to the legions of lucio fulci fans and the fact that it was not only directed by but also starred their idol, fulci himself.though not quite fulci's best, it's still better than most of his later efforts. his rabid fan-base will probably love it. italian horror and giallo aficionados might also enjoy it, depending on their tastes but i'm not sure about anyone else. people who only watch hollywood stuff might not want to take the word of the many glowing reviews here.one thing i personally found fascinating were the scenes featuring probably benito mussolini's only lasting contribution to italy, cinecitta studios. the name is instantly recognizable to any fan of italian movies. until i saw it here, i could only imagine what it looked like.

the one who says that lucio fulci is not one of the most important names in the history of splatter is probably mad.the italian director is a legend among hardcore-horror fans,and his work exceeds the barriers of the genre(who can forgot his western,crime or fantasy flicks).this is probably his goriest film,and unfortunately one the last.a horror director(fulci as himself) starts hallucinating about gruesome murders.he goes to a psychiatrist,who makes him believe he is the criminal.in this time,the doctor begins a long chain of serial crimes.with such a plot,the movie should have been filled with something.and there are roting corpses,crashed or melted heads,stabbings,decapitations,chainsaw dismemberment and many others.kind of boring sometimes,the film is saved by the excessive violence that will definitely please the gore addicts.

i couldn't help but relish the entire premise of cat in the brain because it dutifully explains a director's steadily going mad, seeing people murdered from past movies he has made. even mundane activities such as cooking a meal in the microwave or running a faucet of water yield some horrific butchery from a film in the past. director fulci playing himself, is directing ghosts of sodom(?)and can not seem to deprive his mental well being from constant murder. he seeks help from a psychiatrist who, instead, uses fulci's work as a method to execute a series of innocent people, hypnotizing the director into thinking that perhaps he's responsible.this is obviously a film playfully poking fun at fulci's image, while exploring the themes of how such a profession, which produces so much death and destruction, rarely untamed, could mold and shape a legacy. the film features pretty much a wrap-around story surrounding non-stop graphic violence with every possible way to kill a woman expressed in grisly detail. this has a shower murder hitchcock never could direct, or probably want to. the film's savagery compliments the mental state of fulci's fulci(..i know)during the running time. reality and cinematic fiction have fused and fulci can find no escape. the ending(..explaining the old cliché:"it's only a movie")couldn't work any better than it does here. fulci's boat says perversion(..excellent touch)and he sails off..i can only wish this was his final film because that's a perfect close if there ever was one. david l thompson is the deranged psychiatrist planning to kill his adulterous wife. jeoffrey kennedy is a cop fulci fears had a family murdered by the fiend.the ultra-violence in the film features plenty of unique ways to take a head off such as the door to a chest, a scythe, a chainsaw, and hatchet. the most brutal violence derives from nasty chainsaw activity as a dead body is hacked to pieces(..how a gardener's chainsaw work on a log fits beautifully in one nightmarish hallucination sequence)..the most shocking use of a chainsaw is when a little boy gets decapitated! the opening scene with the puppet cat tearing away, feasting on fulci's brain, is a howler. the scenes which are spliced within the film, featuring a horrified fulci looking on, are obvious, but i couldn't help but enjoy this anyway.

un gatto nel cervello, or nightmare concert as it's more commonly know amongst english speaking audiences, starts as horror film director lucio fulci (played by the man himself lucio fulci) goes to lunch after filming a very gory & violent scene, however he orders steak & has a horrible vision relating to cannibalism. the grotesque visions, hallucinations & dreams continue & begin to affect his mental state, fulci decides to seek help & contacts professor egon schwarz (dvid l. thompson) for psychiatric help. schwarz claims that fulci cannot separate fantasy from reality & agrees to help him, however schwarz has a more sinister ulterior motive as a serial killer starts to brutally kill prostitutes & fulci thinks he might be responsible....this italian production was co-written & directed by lucio fulci who also stars in the film as a horror film director named lucio fulci which doesn't really feel like a lot of effort went into it, anyway un gatto nel cervello is gory if nothing else & for that alone i rather liked it. the script by fulci, john fitzsimmons, giovanni simonelli & antonio tentori is nothing more than a threadbare excuse to edit together lots of gory footage from other italian films. it serves it's purpose well enough i suppose & to see fulci on screen has a certain fascination if your a fan of his or are familiar with his films, the ending is very rushed almost as if they ran out of money as it just has a policeman telling fulci they killed the killer & that's it. another thing about that ending when the two cops put the white sheet over the dead killer in the field & then they walk away leaving it there without any other police presence, i mean would the police in italy just leave a dead body in the middle of a field on it's own? it moves along at a good pace & if you like your gore then you have to see this although if you don't like gore then you'll hate it with a passion, it all depends on your disposition so the choice folks is yours.director fulci was never the most artistically adept filmmaker & it shows here as his footage is bland, flat & looks like it was shot for tv, the footage from the other films (7 in total) doesn't match the stuff fulci shot & it is obvious that this has been pieced together from different films. if your looking for gore you've hit the jackpot, people are dismembered with chainsaws, put through meat grinders, faces are melted, there are a few decapitations, there are some slit throats, someones body is gorily crushed under a car, a tongue is ripped out, someone has their throat crushed as a wheelchair runs over it, there are loads of stabbings, someone has their guts removed with a hook, there's a rotten corpse complete with maggots, someone hand is cut off, someone has their head bashed in & their eye falls out, a gory death by piano wire as it slices through someones throat, there are loads of severed limbs, gallons of blood splashed around & a scene of some cats eating brains & there's more as well. having said that some of the special effects are a bit fake & look cheesy.with a supposed budget of around $100,000 it shows, this is pretty cheap looking, it has no visual style or artistic merit but then again why would you want those when you can see a nazi orgy sequence & wall-to-wall gore? the acting in this is terrible including fulci.un gatto nel cervello is a top film if your a gore-hound like me, however if your looking for something with a little bit more substance or indeed any substance then this ones not for you. this is the sort of film which divides people straight down the middle, you'll either love what it does or hate it.

"cat in the brain" is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels more like an overview, describing director lucio fulci's most notorious years of film-making. the movie could also be seen as a dark comedy of sorts, effectively spoofing the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life. fulci goes further than that, he casts himself as the star, the central figure of the film thus showing the audience who is the man behind all the cinematic gore. "cat in the brain" is not about presenting a clear story and following it. instead it pokes fun at some of the clichés that have been surrounding the horror genre for years.lucio fulci plays himself as a horror director struggling to keep his humanity intact. years of violent film making have finally began to reach him. it starts slowly, steaks and meat in general begin to disgust him, his colleagues assure fulci that all he needs is some rest. but that doesn't help and soon the grotesque ideas for his movies begin to overwhelm his daily thoughts. in an attempt to find a cure for his dangerously maddening mental state lucio starts going to the local psychiatrist. unfortunately that does more wrong than good and fulci is thrown into an even bigger mess, as the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath, who mimics the murders from fulci's films in real life.the film retains all the trademarks of italian splatter cinema, good or bad they are all here. so any comments about the acting or the technical aspects and budget constrains are quite irrelevant as to the quality of the film. it is a visual experience, no doubts about it. fulci throws in an incredible amount of violence easily surpassing pretty much everything he's made. amputated by chainsaw limbs, cannibalism, child murder, decapitation, these are just some of the many grotesque acts witnessed in "cat in the brain". some of them are obviously recycled from a few the director's less profile movies but they don't stand out of the context, and actually feel quite at home here. as i noted before the movie exists much better as a satire of the genre rather than a serious piece. the way some of the violence is presented does help establish that idea. such sequences shortly after climax are rejected by the reality in the film, as they are revealed to be actually scenes inside a movie that fulci's character is directing. this sort of "film in film" presentation lessens somewhat the impact of the gore. but in no way does it make it an easy to watch film. oh no this is far beyond and above the levels of gore found in mainstream horror, and gorehounds will in no doubt be satisfied with that fact.lucio fulci was a very polarized figure. people either hate his work or love it. "cat in the brain" won't convince any of fulci's detractors in the opposite but it is nevertheless an interesting part of his filmography. one that fans should really check out.

fulci is one of my all time favorite italian splatter directors. he is also a very good story teller mixing horror, the supernatural, and psychedelic themes altogether very well. this film was truly his last great story before he directed such disappointments as "voices from beyond". the story is simple as fulci plays himself, a horror director. after years of filming splatter and gore films it seems that fulci starts to suffer a breakdown in which he starts hallucinating about people being slaughtered. he decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes matters worse when he convinces fulci that he is killing people.fulci used gore scenes from several pictures around the same time. these films i don't believe he directed but certainly produced. some of those films are "massacre" directed by andrea bianchi (burial ground), "touch of death" directed by fulci, "the murders secret" and i can't remember the rest of the films.nightmare concert is a very underrated film, even by fulci fans. but i loved this movie and have watched it many times already. it is sad that fulci didn't get a chance to direct anything worth while after this but nonetheless this is a great film and i do recommend it to any fulci fan, whether you like it or not. 9/10 stars

"un gatto nel cervello"/"cat in the brain" is one of the goriest horror movies ever made.there is a lot of blood and gore,including chainsaw butchery,bloody stabbings and numerous decapitations.the film is also interesting as "self parody" of fulci,but the gore and violence is the key element in it.some of the gore fx were taken from own fulci's movies "quando alice ruppe lo specchio" and "i fantasmi di sodoma"(both 1988),plus gore fx taken from fulci-supervised "the snake house" aka "bloody psycho" by leandro lucchetti,"massacre" by andrea bianchi,"non avere paura della zia marta" by mario bianchi,"non si sevizia i bambini" by giovanni simonelli and "luna di sangue" aka "fuga dalla morte" by enzo milioni(all 1989).the scene where brett halsey beats the woman's face to pulp is from "quando alice ruppe lo specchio",a film fulci had made for italian tv in 1988.the chainsawing of the female corpse at the beginning is taken from the same film,as is the head in the microwave and the guy that gets driven over and over again.highly recommended,especially if you like extreme cinema!

lucio fulci's cat in the brain is an inventive and somewhat egotistical tale of a director's decent into madness. the director in question is fulci himself, who stars in the film. fulci has become known to horror fans everywhere as 'the godfather of gore', and for good reason, as he has provided us with some of the nastiest and most gruesome films ever to grace the silver screen; from the eyeball violence in films like 'zombi 2', to a man been hacked to death with chains in 'the beyond', all the way to the full on gore fest known as 'the new york ripper'; if you want gore (and let's face it, who doesn't), fulci is your man. however, all this catering for gorehounds like you and i has taken its toll on fulci's mental state, and he's quickly delving into madness, brought about by what he films. fulci's problems don't end at his mental state either, as his psychiatrist that he has gone to see about his problem has took it upon himself to take up murder as a hobby, using fulci's films as blueprints for the murders!i've got to say, the acting in this film is absolutely atrocious. there is one scene in particular that involves a hooker, and it's only fit to be laughed at, for both it's acting and it's stupidity. fulci takes the lead role of the film (obviously). he's not an actor, and it shows, but his performance is actually the best in the film. it's even safe to say that one the whole, the acting is bad for an italian horror film. of course, nobody goes into an italian horror expecting good acting, so it's somewhat forgivable, but i do think that fulci could have hired some better ones. bad dubbing doesn't exactly help either. however, something that does help is the fact that the terrible acting is counterbalanced by lots of gore, and it's extreme to say the least! people get their heads cut off, a woman is slain in the shower (and unlike psycho, here we really see it), people are hacked up, fed to pigs and there's lots and lots of cinema's finest melee weapon - the chainsaw on display, which delighted me no end. the amount of gore is massively over the top a lot of the time, which gives the film something of a 'spoof' feel, but cat in the brain is obviously a tongue in cheek film anyway.it would be hard to make a film about yourself and not come across as being a bit of a big head, and fulci does indeed come across as a bit of a big head in this movie. his name is mentioned often, and he's on screen nearly all the time; it's not too much unlike 'new nightmare' in the ego stakes, but it's obvious he had a good time making this, and i for one had fun watching it, so we can forgive him a little egotism. the film's ending lets it down - i saw it coming a mile off, but then didn't seriously think that the movie would take that route, but i was wrong; it did, unfortunately. the ending left me cold, and the film is a better watch if you turn it off just before the final two minutes. however, despite it's ending and terrible acting, cat in the brain is a lot of fun and will please fulci enthusiasts no end, and it is therefore recommended.

well, this is new...famous italian horror director lucio fulci shoots a film about a famous italian horror director called...lucio fulci. after years and years of witnessing gruesome horror sequences, it becomes hard for lucio to separate reality from fiction and he often hallucinates about committing violent murders. he quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom. even the dedicated psychiatrist can't seem to keep fulci on the right track... now, when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value, cat in the brain certainly is one of fulci's most pleasant films. the gore is overpowering and copious, to say the least. the amount of filthy massacres is impossible to describe, especially when you manage to get your hands on the fully uncut version (referred to with the aka:"nightmare concert"). decapitations all around, victims ' intestines are spread on all sides of the screen and the chainsaws are working overtime! the film also becomes unintentionally funny quite soon (since it's so exaggerated) and a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when there's beer in the fridge. of course, from a more professional viewpoint, this production can't exactly be called a masterpiece! there's not the least bit of tension or atmosphere to detect and the characters are completely empty-headed. in order to make more room for the gore, characters are just being introduced for 5 seconds and subsequently die a horrible death. especially compared with fulci's highlights - like "the beyond" or "don't torture a duckling" - this film looks like a quickly warmed up snack. the best way to interpret "cat in the brain" is like a personal statement made by fulci and a direct attack towards censorship. perhaps after seeing so many of his films  especially the latter ones  being cut by censorship committees and bashed by pseudo-artistic critics, he wanted to avenge himself by delivering a gory mess that simply can't be cut! if you take out all the explicit violence and the truly sick make-up effects, you only got about 10 minutes of footage left! especially because the insane killings re-occur later in the film as fulci hallucinates about them again. you can almost hear our director think stuff like: "let's see how you're going to censor this now!" even the entire development of the murder investigation happens in the background. are the victims missed by any of their friends or relatives? are there any police officers looking for clues that'll lead them to the killer? you don't know and lucio doesn't bother to inform you about that, because that would lead to sequences that don't require cutting. oh, and it's pretty damn pretentious as well! the name "mr. fulci" or even "lucio" is mentioned every 3 minutes (34 times throughout the entire movie, to be exact) and our director clearly enjoys being in the spotlights for a change. hey, i certainly don't blame him...after over 30 years of delivering amusing movies; he deserved to have a little extra fun. you're a god, mr. fulci!

i don't know what it is exactly, but the film is happily sitting on my shelf, with no thought of ever leaving me...fulci has crafted one of the most ridiculous, bizzare, cheez-infested and well unique movies i've ever seen. not sure what else to say about it, but i love this movie!!! the steak tartar scene is absolutely uproarious, and the whole nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely hilarious...i'm not sure what fulci was trying to do, but has anyone heard that, based on this film, fulci accused wes craven of ripping him off with "scream"? "cat in the brain" is a must for bad movie lovers everywhere...yes i'll definitely say it's not a "good" film, but i guarantee certain scenes will stick in your mind forever! this is an exercise in craziness, people...i guess if i were a "serious" critic i'd give it a 3, but on sheer enjoyability (again i can't really explain my affections) i'd give it a 7....really whacked out flick...

this film, with only two characters, takes you closer to these two people, the interrogator and the prisoner, than most films take you to any character, however well-crafted.the sheer confusion, terror and pain which madeleine stowe's character undergoes is deeply disturbing, as is alan rickman's sadistic yet charming interrogator.this film is all too possible, and builds to a shocking climax, the effect of the film as a whole leaving you sitting in silence at the end. it'll haunt you for a long time.

simply beautiful. one of the best mind-- umm... screws--- in existence. both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract. moscow could learn a few things from the torture techniques in this film. they could also do worse than hiring alan rickman. five out of five stars, and at present (1-20-2000) #2 on my top 100 films of all time list.

this movie had me stuck in this endless loop of thinking about it for days afterward...granted i am not the movie snob that some folks around here appear to be, but i thought this was amazingly well-acted, and a powerful creation, if lacking a little subtlety in exectution. i happen to admire movies that can effectively recreate the sensation of watching a stage play, it creates an inharmonious eeriness that works well with this flick. i am also a great fan of alan rickman, so that might be my bias. personally i found the lack of spatial landmarks a good thing -- this could in fact be anywhere, and probably is. i say go easy on what was a powerful experience for me, and likely for anyone involved in any sort of political activity.

closet land is not at happy movie. neither is it connected to any kind of social realism. this is perhaps its strength. the distance from specific time and nations strengthens the message, makes it more powerful and rips away the burden of nationalism and propaganda you often sense in movies made to criticize nations in opposit of ones own (i am of course primarily speaking of the usa propaganda in some commercial film).bit closet land is so much more than a message. it is a film of pure, surrealistic beauty, filled with the same clean, clinical form you find in work such as 1984 and it's equals.i am of old a big fan of alan rickman, the man with the golden sarcasm (and, i might add, the uncomparable sex-appeal ;-)). the outplay between him and madeleine stowe is brilliant. everytime i see him, he seems to play a character even nastier than the last one...but, enough sweettalk. the film lacks in action. i dont want any crashing cars, but i want something to happen, except pure talk. after an hour i got really tired of the interrogationroom, the predictable actions and more than anything i wanted a more complex view of it all, the world, the former lives of the characters and all the rest of the framework that was missing. for some people a nice touch. for me something less positive.anyway, closet land is a movie worth it's time if you are ready to make a trip into the abyss of the human nature.and of course for us who really loves the always evil alan rickman.

closet land is an amazing, terrifying piece of cinema. it features only two actors in a single set, but never loses your attention. the set design is imaginative and troubling, the staging of scenes maintains your attention, while adding to your own sense of confusion and terror. the acting is outstanding, with alan rickman and madeleine stowe having the duty of carrying every scene.i first saw this film in 1991, soon after it came out on video. it didn't play in theaters where i lived; not surprising, given its political content. it should be seen, though. it features a brilliant staging of the torture and interrogation techniques used by repressive societies to instill fear and obedience in its citizens. the country is never named, which makes it all the more striking. it could be anywhere; east, west, 3rd world, 1st world. it illustrates what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone; when government becomes the ruler of the citizens, rather than the servant.madeleine stowe is a children's author who has been dragged from her bed in the night and subjected to terror and torture. she finds herself in a room with alan rickman, a seemingly pleasant functionary. at first it seems a horrible mistake and she is free to go; but, fear causes her to remain and the terror escalates. she is increasingly subjected to physical and mental torture. the interrogator uses sensory deprivation, temporal manipulation, confusion, auditory manipulation, role play, and twisted logic to break down the author. she is humiliated and browbeaten, forced to endure strenuous bodily positions, deprived of food and water.through it all, she refuses to give in; to do what the interrogator asks. she is told that it will all end if she just signs a confession. a simple little act. she refuses. through it all, she employs defense mechanisms that have developed since childhood. it is slowly revealed that she was the victim of childhood sexual abuse. to survive, she developed fantasy worlds and characters that would take her away from the abuse. these mechanisms allow her to transcend her torture and turn the tables on her interrogator. she starts attacking his own beliefs and profession, forcing him to examine his own life and motives. in the end, she is free, because she maintains the freedom of thought. the interrogator is the one trapped by the state.this movie was made during the height of the cold war, apartheid, and at a time when the crimes of many governments throughout the world made daily news. it is even more timely in a world where "enemy combatants" are held and interrogated in secret prisons, denied legal rights or counsel; where "ethnic cleansing" lays waste to whole societies, and humanitarian aid is denied. it demonstrates that the individual can stand up to the state or other oppressor by refusing to give in to fear and terror.

i caught this movie late one night and never knew what hit me. this was one of the most disturbing movies i have ever seen, yet had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. alan rickman is an excellent "bad guy" but this character beats all others. i've never been so affected by a movie! it's been 6 years and i still can't forget "closet land."

i was amazed at the quality of this film, particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director - all 140(?) lbs of him! truly, a boy directing a movie about a boy. i look forward to seeing more luke eberl films.i did think this one was a bit too long. there was too much time spent showing connor being unsuccessful (and unwilling) to make a move on owen. caleb didn't try hard enough. owen, being so young, could have easily become closer to caleb and later decided it wasn't his preference. and owen would still have learned the "valuable lesson" about corruption and politics. instead, he didn't give himself a fair chance to learn about his sexuality. and what about poor caleb? owen could have been a good influence.though the film intends to show owen as a hero who overcomes perverted corruption, i felt sad for owen. he was offered the opportunity to have some boy-boy fun with caleb, who was extraordinarily beautiful. owen didn't have to go along with the political perversion as offered. but he could have tried to have some fun with caleb, and still walked away when he wanted. it was clear that owen was in charge - no one forced him to do anything he didn't want to do. but he could have had more fun, and with a very hot boyfriend, at that.i hope luke makes more movies where appealing young characters have more fun.

over the many years, there are some films that just slip by & hardly anyone views. choose conner is one of those films.this small gem played at some festivals & had a short 2 week run in a small theatre in west hollywood making all of about $ 5500.it is now on dvd i do hope many more will now see this,.it is a strange drama of a shrewd youngish politician, who influences a very bright 15 year old lad.this politico also has a handsome nephew (about 17 years old) who befriends the 15 year old lad.the above paragraph is slightly vague as to what occurs, so is the film, & that is what i appreciated, we do not get all the facts,much is left to our own thinking. you will hear dialog that makes this logical..steven weber (wings) is our politician,his role is slightly vague,this is another point for the audience to ponderalex d.linz is our 15 year old, he was about 17 when they made this movie, but easily can pass for younger. he has been in films & tv since he was a young child, he is a very good actor & is quite convincing.escher holloway is the older teen, this role is his first major part & he too is excellent.now i am saving the best for last, the writer/director,luke eberl is not yet 23 years old. for a first effort a big thumbs up. i do hope he as well as our 2 lads have a long career.ratings: *** (out of 4) 86 points(out of 100) imdb 8 (out of 10)

this is a very modest, very lovely movie with a great score by hoagy carmichael and frank loesser with a standout number, we're the couple in the castle, that is totally evocative of the period and harks back to penthouse serenade just as the opening premise (hoppity's coming) may well have inspired fred saidy and yip harburg's opening (woody's coming) in finian's rainbow six years later. i totally agree with those posters who have noted that were the name disney appended to this it would by now have achieved 'classic' status rather than have fallen into neglect. it's wonderfully inventive, never more so than when objects barely noticed in the 'real' world assume a much greater significance - both pro and con - in the insect world. actually it is a classic, albeit a minor one.

while disney have been the animation studio for the past 70 years, there have always been rivals to their supremacy. when this review was written in 2009, for example, companies like dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) warner brothers and ardman, were bringing out animated movies that could be said to challenge the disney dominance. back in the beginning, in that late '30s and early '40s heyday when disney was serving cinematic banquets like snow white, dumbo and fantasia, the competition was provided by brothers dave and max fleischer. despite releasing two very commendable films, they never quite cornered the market  many attribute their downfall to the commercial failure of mr bug goes to town, released the same week as the attack on pearl harbour (which gave the american public something more significant to think about than going to the cinema to watch a cartoon!) that this film has faded into relative obscurity is a travesty.in a patch of overgrown garden in the city a bunch of bugs are in dire danger. humans use the land as a shortcut, discarding litter and cigars, and other hazards, right on top of the bugs' homes as they go. honey-shop owner mr bumble (voiced by jack mercer) fears that the future is bleak, and wonders how he will ever be able to raise his daughter honey (voiced by pauline loth) in more secure surroundings. a highly unscrupulous creature, bagley c. beetle (voiced by tedd pierce), offers to provide her a safer place to live if she will accept his hand in marriage, but honey is much more interested in her childhood sweetheart, the perennially cheerful and optimistic hoppity (voiced by stan freed). hoppity believes that everything is about to be resolved for the better, but is left looking foolish when bagley beetle and his pair of comical sidekicks manipulate the crisis to their own devious end. only at the very end, as their patch becomes the foundation for a huge new skyscraper, do the bugs switch loyalty back to hoppity as they look to him to lead them a new, safe home away from the destructive influence of humans.what really works in this film is the delightful characterisation  all the bugs are cleverly developed and designed for maximum audience appeal. the bumbling villains swat the fly and smack the mosquito (hilarious names, if you stop to think about it) are particularly memorable. equally admirable is the storytelling drive  even the youngest of children can enjoy this story, while at the same time it skillfully conveys a message for older audiences about the way human carelessness can impact upon the survival of wildlife. time has inevitably dated some aspects of the film, and when viewing it the audience needs to accept (and forgive) these occasional signs of general age and wear. but on the whole mr bug goes to town is an accomplished, funny and very slickly presented animation with a worthy message to boot.

wow. i saw this movie and "up" on the same day within an hour of each other at different theaters. i saw "mr bug" first, and was then totally disappointed in "up"'s follow-up. what a beautiful and touching film! movies of the 1930s and 40s to us nowadays can be irking with their melodramatic acting and dialog, but as animation the same melodrama and groaning humor can be wonderful. and the soft "organic" lines of 30s drawing and the music just puts you in a nice comfortable mood and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters: ladybugs, grasshoppers, bees, snails, stinkbugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, crickets, and more each with all their own cute little (but not overbearing) idiosyncrasies. the interaction with the human world, from nemesis (cigar smokers, high-heel wearers, innocent kick-the-can playing kids) to the kind-hearted, and to the unknown destroyers, is realistic and fascinating. you care for the bugs, and dick and mary. the protagonist hoppity is not some perfect superman who comes to "set things right" but a starry-eyed optimist who leads everyone down the garden path (literally!), and every time you think it's going to end happily in 1930s style, along comes another roadblock...! i was on the edge of my seat much more than with "up." i walked out of the movie theater grinning and chuckling: something that hasn't happened in a long long long long time!

you got to see it to believe it. shot in hollywood on the strip in the middle of the sleazy, anything goes 70s, this cheaply made flick must of really packed the inner city theatres back in the day. then again, i bet it had a one week run. actually, its pretty hilarious. the acting is dreadful, the direction non existent, but the hair, clothes, rotten pre disco music and the general out and out sleaziness of the story are mind boggling. sleazy, its very sleazy. highly recomended (if you can find it)

(possible ?? spoilers included, but nothing critical given away.)i just watched this classic low budget movie on video, and was knocked out by the level of energy present on screen. all the actors do themselves proud, especially john daniels, must see another of his films. not only does this movie boast great performances, but manages stylish sequences, like when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see shards of glass falling into a swimming pool which erupts from the impact of the fallen man, i love the way slow-motion photography was used in 70's cinema, dreamy and hypnotic. cool and witty black dudes spout great one liners while slimy seedy lumps of white trash come to unpleasant ends. i love it, my rating 10 / 10. if this ever comes out on dvd, count me in for a purchase.

i started to watch this show by accident, but i love it. the fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television, especially for kids shows. my five-year-old nephew (as most children do) would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of handicap but after he watched pelswick it just seemed to be a normal occurrence to him. every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say "like pelswick" and go on with what ever he was originally doing. and yes the animation is a little crude, but if you can stand to watch through the first season of the simpsons then this isn't that bad. the "genie" is actually an angel who is there to help pelswick learn lessons in life. he can not walk some else said he could walk some of the time, i've seen every episode and he never to my recollection walked, he is a paraplegic he has no feeling below his armpits (he mentions it in an episode). as for the humor if you can get a copy of the "ntalented" episode, which lampoons boy-bands, you will instantly love this show.

eve is an eye opener, because of the great sceneries and the tech-no music in the backgrounds, we hear. this movie shows a good aspect on the human body being god's creation and to considerate about it, viewers can earn better respect on the legendary story of adam and eve (either if it's true or just a fairy tale, depending on what we believe) from watching this movie. actress/model inger ebeltoft's impersonation of eve is so good, there's no good word to describe her performance, and i can't imagine having another actress being eve. this movie to me, comes in really handy for the type of therapy of stress relief. we'd never fell so relax then before from watching this movie. this movie is a masterpiece, god supposedly wanted this movie to be made in the first place!mr. razbin!

the story of a little girl who was driven once by fear and now by pain, she becomes woman and a vengeful crime fighter. her power is to manifest strong anime characters onto herself. this movie fuses animation with live action as she wields her animated sword through all that stands before her. she struggles to deal with life, her demons, and her fears.young emily watched her parents fight and argue. she watched her dad leave her motherless. emily soon discovered she had the power to do something about it. emily grew through life traveling as a loner and at night she had the power to make a difference in the world.this movie is a great blend of animation and real action. there are many themes and metaphors that run deep through the movie. this movie is broke up as a 12 part series.

drawn by pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema i have ever seen. here are my reviews of the episodes released so far: episode one was even better than i expected and from everything i had heard about it, i expected quite a lot. i am very impressed with the actors already. the father was creepy and played perfectly. the little girl is so expressive, she uses her eyes to convey such emotion. the animation was superb. the cinematography was amazing, each camera angle capturing the feeling of the scene perfectly. the editing was done so well, each scene blending seamlessly into the next. the music captured the emotions quite well and drew you into the story. i just can't say enough about how wonderful this episode was. it definitely whets my appetite for more! episode 2 was even better than the first one! everything i said about the first episode carries through, only you get to see even more of the character development. i can not wait to finally see episode 3, or the rest of the series for that matter. what is developing is an intriguing, character driven storyline with all the trappings of a big hollywood production, but without the pretension. so much is said, with so few words. this series is something like you've never seen and perched to become a real success.this episode was freaking awesome! no other words describe it! wow! everything that i've said about the previous episodes holds true for this one, and yet it was even better! i don't know how you manage to take something amazing and make it even better! the further character development proves that this is a completely character driven piece. the cinematography excels as it always has and draws you into emily's pain, fear, hate and emotional roller-coaster. i can't wait to see episode 4... or the rest of the series for that matter. you have truly outdone yourself!as much as i have loved the other episodes, episode 4 is the best yet. i love the character progression. i feel like we are really coming to know emily, her pain, and her internal struggle. the other themes i've stated in past reviews are continued. great cinematography, the writing is superb, the actors are right on with their portrayals and have made the characters their own, and the animation is simply amazing! another great job from the dbp crew!

this young filmmaker has a talent for capturing his audience quickly with unusual camera work and sparse but intense scripts. the concept here of combining animation with live footage is remarkably well-executed and the soundtrack is very good.the decision to release the movie in twelve parts online puts the onus on the director to make each episode fascinating enough for the viewer to invest in buying each upcoming episode. i only wish all motion pictures had this kind of commitment to keeping their audiences entertained throughout their stories.highly recommended.

rock star is a well-told hollywood-style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how ripper became rob halford's replacement for judas priest. mark wahlberg poured on his likable boy-ish charm and performed with believable admirably, something he has been known to do since the release of boogie nights.stephen herek, no stranger to musically-themed movies, takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species, the hair-metal rock god. wahlberg's "izzy" acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true. his likable character quickly wins over the heart of the viewer, who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the metal "goat horn" hand-sign several times over.the only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast, namely the other members of the band, were not fleshed out, or even introduced, properly. more interaction with these life-long rock musicians would have amplified and solidified izzy's new surroundings. naturally, rock star is filled with great music. rabin's score, the steel dragon's original work and plenty of 80's-style metal hits makes this soundtrack a must-have! let's all hope that films like rock star not only give a credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation but also spark a very-needed revival.

rock star / (2001) *** (out of four)by blake french:	"rock star" is the story of a nobody who becomes propelled into fame, only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it. we have seen all this before (in better movies), but this human story does capture the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge. it garners a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere. the script, by "crazy/beautiful" director john stockwell, portrays the hard-core universe with memorable images-it doesn't explain what it is about, it shows us.	"rock star," originally titled "metal god," stars mark wahlberg as chris "izzy" cole, a pittsburgh office supplies salesperson who dreams of becoming bobby beers, the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group, steel dragon. although chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called blood pollution, instead of writing his own songs, he insists on performing only those by steel dragon, and only in the exact way they perform them. his group becomes irritated with chris' obsessions and gives him the boot.	this devastates chris, as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend, emily (jennifer aniston from tv's "friends"). he then receives a phone call. it's the steel dragon band. they have seen chris' tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer. in an instant, chris rockets into the dizzying world of sudden stardom-from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. unfortunately, it's not as rewarding as he expected.	a true story inspired the "rock star" concept. an ohio supply salesman, tim "ripper" owens, really did replace rob halford, the lead singer in judas priest, after initially singing for a tribute band. the rest of the film is probably fiction, although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands. the film details the various ordeals of being a rock star. it explores the aspects of touring, personality differences, the danger of drug abuse and violence, struggling relationships, sexual freedom, dishonesty, and the extreme measures of the producers all to please the fans and keep popularity high. i have seen all of mark wahlberg's movies, and this is the first that has earned my affection. wahlberg, a former singer/model, has made movies like "fear," "boogie nights" "three kings," and most recently tim burton's lacking remake "planet of the apes." i am starting to admire the young actor more and more. although he has not performed in many successful films, he has taken many chances, and done a variety of roles. "rock star" is his best film to date. i can't think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed chris cole's struggles and aspirations. wahlberg truly makes "rock star" rock. jennifer aniston lights up the screen as well. she creates a chemistry-rich relationship with chris that induces audience participation. it's tragic of what happens to their relationship. we care about these characters a great deal. during the film concert scenes, director stephen herek (who also directed "holy man" and the live action version of "101 dalmatians") creates a gripping atmosphere. he captures the scenes with an intense urgency, and a raw, unmistakable energy. the musical numbers provide the film with the best, most involving scenes. unfortunately herek cannot sustain the energy and zest throughout. at the three-quarters mark, he looses the spark as the movie becomes dull and unpleasant. i understand where the story needs to go in order to portray the negative side of fame, but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it. in "almost famous," a much better film about rock and roll, there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most sorrowful scenes. here, it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion.the message comes a bit too late and suddenly in the story. the film turns into a morality tale that wants to provide us with a sappy destination. the filmmakers might as well stop everything, appear on screen and say: "now audience, the moral of the story is" we understand the theme, but it's too instantaneous. the personal discovery for chris' must be gradual.fortunately, all of this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the film, hardly enough to completely destroy an entire eighty-five minutes of a reasonably good feature. "rock star" is not a great movie-see "almost famous" if you want a remarkable film about rock and roll-but for marky mark, it's a turning point in his career. 

surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. but the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clichés in the final act. i enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball "almost famous". it has a nice, bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish might've made it more memorable. **1/2 from ****

i'm an action movie fan but until today i've never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in italy, so i went to see "the long kiss goodnight" on pay-tv hoping for nothing special.but, what a surprise! this movie is great! the only problem i found is the presence of some holes in the plot, but the rest is the most entertaining, intriguing and funny action movie ever made.the transformation of samantha/charly from ordinary wife-teacher to cool-blooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea. the action scenes and the stunts are the best i've ever seen. samuel l. jackson adds some of the best lines i have ever heard and his chemistry with geena davis is good.and what about geena? she is wonderful, she plays the best action heroine ever seen and does strong, convincing acting and fantastic stunts.so i think this movie had weak performances at box office and bad critics because most reviewers and some kind of public have a hard time with strong female lead roles.9/10.

this is one of the best action films i have seen. geena's portrayal of the tough as nails, 'charly'/gentle mother 'sam', was superb and samuel l jackson just keeps you laughing all the way through, with his classic one liners. sure, there were a few holes in the actual story, but this fast-paced flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end.i felt geena was a perfect choice for the role of sam/charly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as the mother in the recent movie 'stuart little'. both samuel and geena were well supported by david morse, brian cox, sweet little yvonne zima and newcomers, sexy craig bierko, and melina kanakaredes. this film accentuates the growing trend of strong female character and the diversion away from traditional male/female stereotypes as we see sam/charly (davis) and mitch (jackson) hurtling from one disaster to the next.while i and many others loved this movie, it is fair to say that there will always be people that don't and that's fine - each, to their own. i highly recommend this film to action fans, for its hilarious scenes and fast-paced action.

terrific movie: if you did not watch yet, you must watch. geena davis and samuel l. jackson are amazing in this movie.great actors + good story + incredible action scenes > "the long kiss goodnight" i give it a 10, a+, 4 stars.

spoilers in this reviewthe long kiss goodnight is yet another prime example of a common affliction of many modern films; it starts off on a very interesting concept - a trained assassin whose memory was erased regains consciousness of herself - and the initial setup is engaging but then it seems the writers don't know very well where to go next and the whole thing trails off down increasingly confusing and/or inane paths, leaving the disappointing taste of something that was ok but promised to be a lot better. the baddies are remarkably unremarkable, and even jackson's comic sidekick turn seems more like something from his pre-pulp fiction days; it looks like harlin, as in cutthroat island, made every effort so that no-one would upstage his then wife. her character is by far the best of the film and this fact only makes you feel even more frustrated that they weren't able to do something better with it.however, there is still something about this film which for me sets it apart from the run-of-the-mill hollywood actioner and places it above average, if only just. it is something very subtle i can't quite put my finger on; it's a disturbing, cold, dark, even sickly edge, a nightmarish and unreal feel, a decadent air, a mean streak, which keeps cropping up in various ways. it's in the dark reddish photography and almost permanent night the characters dwell in, it's in samantha's dreams in front of the mirror, it's in her vicious eyes and smile whenever she's about to kill a man or when she announces how she will enjoy watching her nemesis die with her daughter listening, it's in mitch's comeback at the wheel of a car while he is spurting so much blood from his mouth he can hardly speak... i don't know, it's an atmosphere, something i can't define but which gives me the creeps (a bit) and which makes this film still oddly intriguing for me.

almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. geena davis is a schoolteacher housewife who suffers from amnesia. she'e even on the pta! but then an auto accident awakens the woman she used to be, and it's hot! samuel l. jackson is hilarious as the low rent private eye who tries to help davis find her past, only to find out he's in way over his head. davis has some hilarious lines too, and the interaction between her and jackson works surprisingly well.look for brian cox, the original hannibal lechter, and david moorse finally managing to shed his st. elsewhere tv image. the film is directed by davis' husband, who almost seems to have built the whole film around her, but it works.i pull out this dvd and rewatch it often. i still love the makeup scene. is geena hot or what?

i was happy to find out that at least now this movie is beginning to get the appreciation it deserves (just view those votes). not top-class action like "die hard" or "lethal weapon", but still something like a solid 7 out of 10: fine script, good actors with working chemistry, and a director who knows what he wants (sadly, this was director harlin's last good film. "deep blue sea" managed to reach 'an ok rollercoaster-ride'- status, but "cutthroat island, and especially, "driven" are well-deserved flops!) personally i think the turn-off at the box-office might have been the "woman as an action star"-theme. well, give her a chance, because davis does deliver a performance above par. and, after all, this film doesn't concentrate so much on the "feminine"-side, but instead on good ol' action, buddyism (jackson as a sidekick is given a lot of room in here, plus his share of action- and about a thousand killer wisecracks!) and on the plot (from shane black, the writer of "lethal weapon" and "the last boy scout". the latter of which as a movie is on very many levels much like this one...the theme, the clever plot, also as good and as underrated!) overall: if one hasn't seen this one yet, don't forget to rent it for the next quiet saturday night!

i love this film...! i've seen it 1000 x on dvd and i cant say enough about it. it has it all, comedy, awesome action and incredible stunts/fx. samuel jackson steals the show here big time. i dont think there isnt a moment that he's in that he isnt funny! "everyone knows that when you make an assumption, you make an ass out of you and umption"!! the f/x are great! the bridge/truck explosion is incredible, although the sound isnt all that great!when samuel drives out of the truck, the sound is off a little i think and what he says is priceless!!! for those of you who own it on dvd, put the audio in french!!! it's halarious!!! even emotional moments are great when the bad guy discovers that sam's/charlie's daughter is his, is great... this is a great film that no action fan can do without... i also reccomend cutthroat island... aside from all the negative publicity, it kicks!!!!

amazing, amazing, amazing. what more can be said? jacobi is the best hamlet ever to grace the stage and captures every inch of the character. every nuance and element of hamlet is depicted and depicted well. some people have complained about his age, but you honestly cannot tell when watching the film. if anything, he looks drastically younger than 40. i only wish a more worthy ophelia could have been found. her acting is passable but she just doesn't look the part. the only real exceptional performances come from jacobi and stewart, who is a great claudius. the rest of the cast is good, but jacobi is what truly elevates this teleplay.

i have watched every version of this play that i can think of, including several on the stage, and sir derek jacobi is absolutely the best hamlet i have ever seen! he has the most wonderful voice for stage acting, and his expressive face will take you on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this play. the way in which he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness. he (as hamlet)can in an instant be loving, soft and gentle and in another instant be raging against the hell that is his life. you believe that he is in pain, you believe that he is angry, you believe that he is not a little mad. you believe he is hamlet.of course, some of the thanks obviously goes to shakespeare, :) but without an excellent actor to get the words from the page to the stage, it doesn't really matter how well written a play is.if you like shakespeare, you absolutely must see this version. if you don't like shakespeare, you absolutely must see this version. you will come away with a new appreciation for shakespeare if you do. the nuanced performance that sir derek gives will leave you breathless.

1. i've seen branaghs hamlet: branagh is too old, speaks frequently with a high pitched voice (unwillingly funny!) - not a convincing hamlet, and his directors qualities - poor ! (see also much ado about nothing from branagh - the funny parts of the dialogues have mostly been cut out not speaking of the directors mistakes in the dialogue cuts!) 2. i've seen hamlet 2000: i think the scenario is an interesting idea - but such lousy actors - all of them 3. orson welles hamlet is ok - but this bbc hamlet is the best! derec jacobi is convincing - seems a bit of a lunatic - very suitable! and patric stewart - wonderful, and claire bloom is a very attractive queen. you believe those actors what they are saying - i think this is the best compliment.

i have seen this play many times, from olivier to branagh, and this remains the one version that always stands out in my memory. many actors have captured aspects of this character, but for me, it is always derek jacobi's performance they are compared to and all others just come up a bit short.

part of the bbc filming of all of shakespeare's classic plays, this version of hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of shakespeare's most over-rated plays and hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character. i feel no sympathy for him, and i didn't after watching this.even when you have great actors like the great derek jacobi in the role of the dane, and patrick stewart as claudius and jonathan hyde as rosencrantz, it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline. and when a good actor like jacobi injects passion into it, he renders the entire role incomprehensible. i just could not connect his physicalisation of the character to what he was saying, and this killed it for me. that said, he does get the "to be, or not to be" speech right, as his actions with a dagger make clear the character's suicidal intentions at that point in the play.the supporting roles, to me better written and consequently better played, are enjoyable, notably lalla ward's loopy ophelia and stewart's well-detailed interpretation of claudius.at four and a half hours, it is very long and best watched in bite-sized chunks. check it out if you're interested but be prepared for a long watch.

i was never in the past interested in this play although love shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studied some at school. something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off. i never bothered to try to see hamlet until fairly recently deciding i should at least try to watch it and i borrowed the olivier version from the library. well, i struggled with it. olivier seemed far too old, not only in his looks but in his acting of the part. the play had been enormously cut to fit a more conventional movie length and i think must have missed out too much as i found it difficult to concentrate on it, soon became bored and annoyed by it. i still think olivier's henry v is the best version i've seen of that rousing play - tho' admit i haven't rewatched the beeb version yet and can't recall how it was when first shown.i heard of the branagh full length version of hamlet. although i enjoyed his much ado, i think the beeb version is far better and i wasn't entirely impressed by his henry v. but i was off branagh a bit after seeing his disappointing effort at a musical of love's labour's lost which is a play i like and was so well made by the beeb. finally acquiring the complete beeb shakespeare on dvd recently, i soon rewatched one of my most favourite shakespeare plays, richard ii, and was simply enthralled by jacobi in the part so was immediately persuaded to watch his hamlet next. what a revelation this play now is for me! yes, it is splendid, but i feel it needs an actor you can emphathise with to play hamlet and this for me is jacobi. amazing. intriguing to note that although he is older than i understand the character hamlet was, it doesn't show whilst in olivier it did. now i note he's also in the branagh version and had much to do with training branagh, so i shall have to watch that to see what jocobi does with claudius! i'm interested to discover jacobi has trained branagh as yes, you can certainly see the influence.and now i'm going to watch it all over again....

though this is a good, enjoyable cartoon, they did much better ones later on, like carrotblanca. this is almost like the first star trek feature, which would have been welcomed with open arms and glee no matter what, just for existing. this is really a patchwork of old bits with some nice touches, but nothing special. reminds me a bit of the hunting trilogy in spots and the ending is priceless. available and certainly well worth watching just for the novelty and the good bits. recommended.

black scorpion is roger cormen's batman. which is cool and there is a lot of cool stuff in this movie. like the breathtaker being a cross between doctor doom and darth vader, that's kind of cool. the mind control gas in the inhalers was worthy of the mad hatter. the cormen b-movie style is all over this puppy which is not always a good thing. there are plenty of stunts and hot babes to make any action fan happy. this movie, the good out weighs the bad. but if you aren't one for comic book movies, then i would advise not watching black scorpion, however if you like comic book like movies and don't care if it was ever a comic before. then check out black scorpion, as for me i give it 8 stars.

i'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (i'm not counting super bug budget, no storyline batman's either)a couple of my favorites are the phantom and a budget movie called the demolitionist. the black scorpion can be added to that collection.if you've seen the demolitionist then get this movie. it's basically a copy of that heroine. (it even stars the same guy in both movies)if you haven't, then let me explain...a cop's father is murdered and she seeks vengeance. she laces up the black outfit (a sexy catwomanish, skimpy outfit that looks absolutely great on joan severance) and goes out to kick some booty.it's a fun, action packed movie, mind you, you may not wish the kids to see it...without screening it first to see if you approve of the pretty graphic sex scene severance has in it. which in my opinion, was a bonus (alright, give it an extra star <grin>)

black scorpion is a fun flick about a groovy female super heroine who wears leather tights and drives a car that can morph into her snazzy armored scorpion mobile. she battles the evil breathtaker and all of this is an excellent recipe for a good time imho. i loved the bit about her having to say "yo" to get the car's computer to take orders! breathtaker is so evil he wants to give the entire city asthma! it's all so over the top and that's the beauty of it! the scene where black scorpion "attacks" her partner steals the show. you'll know it when you see it. this dvd also has a fun interview with joan severance. she's a doll. black scorpion is a fun dvd. loved it!

this movie will not be considered for an academy award, but if you enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and just wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety mins it is not a disappointment. you'll enjoy a send up of darth vader for the villain (the breather), a female batman for the heroine (but much cuter with much less costume), and a running joke that involves cigarettes and the police captain that's very funny. not by any means a great cinematic achievement. but if you enjoy campy fun it was worth a viewing. god help me, i liked it.

this movie was better than i expected. i don't think it deserved an r rating, though. i've seen pg-13 films with worse language and violence. i found this movie entertaining and i enjoyed it. if you're a person who dissects everything, you might find a lot wrong with it, but if you take it for its face value, i think you'll find it entertaining.

even if you're not a "theatre person," i highly recommend that you see this. based off of a play of the same name by christopher bond (which, in turn, had been based off of an old london legend), sondheim did a wonderful job bringing it to the musical theatre stage. the score is just amazing-- by far sondheim's best, and probably one of the best scores written for a musical ever. the show was cast extremely well, my only complaint being of betsy joscelyn's portrayal of johanna. it;s good, mind you, and she's a very versatile actress, but she just doesn't sing "greenfinch and linnet bird" too well. but other than that, it's all phenomenal-- angela lansbury *made* the role of mrs. lovette, and she just does it so well. george hearn was a good replacement for len cariou in the title role, and ken jennings gives a great performance as tobias. the ending will give you chills. top marks for a wonderful show.

i have only praise for this film. from start to finish it captured the brilliance of stephen sondheim's musical. i am not a big fan of musicals most of them are very overdone. this one however changed my mind. i am an actor myself and have actully played sweeney and i know how hard this role is. george hearn gave a stunning, masterful and rounded performance worthy of the highest awards that we can give him (he won an emmy and that's something.) everything he does he turns to gold. he is so good it will blow your mind why he's not in films winning oscars. lansbury is also very good and very funny. sara woods is creepy and wonderful as the beggar woman. all in all a great video. pick it up if you can.

first of all, i have watched this show since i was a little toddler, and i have always loved it. sure, maybe i didn't understand it when i was that young, but i still enjoyed it! and now that i have been able to understand it for several years, i love it even more. the score of this musical is the most wonderfully detailed score i have ever heard! every note is perfect, i don't even need to hear the singing to enjoy it!moving on to this particular production- this is magnificent! of course no one could play mrs. lovett besides angela lansbury, and she does it perfectly. and she should, she has been playing this part for several years. george hearn is absolutely brilliant. the best sweeney todd i have ever heard. he has a wonderful voice, yet he can throw his voice so well! his "epiphany" is incredible, as you can tell by the audience's reaction to it. the judge, toby, antony, and pirelli are also so wonderful in their roles. everyone is perfect! well, i still have to fast forward through johanna's green finch and linnet bird. she just doesn't sing that song well at all.this show can be appreciated at all ages, but it is not always accepted. i am not your typical middle-aged theater lover, i am only 15 years old, yet sweeney todd has given me a greater appreciation for music than i have gotten from any other musical.

dark and bleak sets, thrilling music that cuts through your spin like aknife (or razor) a perfect cast lead by broadway greats hearn and lansbury. this is exciting theatre flawlessly transferred to the small screen. sondheim is the most talented songwriter of our age and todd is his masterpiece, from the brechtian opening ballad to the darkly humorous act i finale- "a little priest" where lovett and todd fantasize about the victims that will wind up in their meat pies , this play never ceases to thrill,excite and satisfy. betsy joslyn also excels as johanna, even she, as the plays ingenue seems slightly mad.edmund lyndeck turns in a bravado performance as the corrupt judge who lusts after joslyn and is the subject of todd's vendetta. lansbury and hearn command the show as only two great actor/stars can do. other musical highlights include todd's "johanna" lovett's "worst pies in london" and the act ii opening 'god thats good", and that is a title to describe this production !

there is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the admissions process at school. the parental absence at all important junctures in lauren ambrose's school search provide admissions interviews only and draws the interviews with them at below transcript quality review that in 30 minutes sabotages four years of high school grading. the incident of anger in her mother obviously block a mothers display of possible physical abuse of her or her disabled sister at one time or another; thus masking her mother's truer involvement in family losses. the daughter, lauren, really has done something big - trying to make her mother fulfilled and then that plan itself, somewhat heroic in light of the age she is - still giving when everyone around her taking, somersaults on her. a heart not yet connected to her head - something that age has never had a genuine answer to even to this day. her replacement of a significant other, not necessarily requiring a father image, however, a trusted authority nonetheless being imagined if not real. a pure cup without a handler .......(see the movie). everyone needs a friend to see through understanding of a proportional world - she made hers up on what she knew of life at the time. she has all the mental capacity for higher learning though having no friends present for her time makes the ending a developmental tragedy in progress ... given a bird in a cage... not a puppy... that would a least get her walking two times a day. ideas out of the roof she is under would be the developing on her sidewalk life. sad is the looming psychiatric ending... how could she be committed at a time when she has proved an important responsibility? (believe it or not taking of a dog is a better witness than taking care of a bird at this time of her life) the symbolic cage of her in a cage is too much mental and self fulfilling of some of her writings within the story. the neighbor college freshman is developed just fine, he is as developed as the training education will allow for the mental maturity that dwarfs her eternal purpose compared to his fateful conditioning. i myself, eventually just went to the mensa magazine and got a $20.00 degree saying i was an (hon)ddiv. it offered all the education that buying the truth would and independence to skip fecal content. "run the world" or do not get your own home was the college offer. who was freeing anyone for superior time for the learning? the only sin is not having your pleasure right. what fight figged on that? she has been denied an act for life commensurate to her love for life. what is college, a reward for failing high school? do you graduate with your class or without it - what is the exchange? a lifetime of correcting youth with only questions? could lead occur w/o a question? the loss followed as much for good as bad. when was she given a mind for sexual intimacy or growth for her good self to be fulfilled? why didn't good people treat her with good things? if good people do not do good things for good people, what is good for? she is young, pretty and walked on long before personal development is given a winning game. her act taken in life with a closed door. perhaps the title would be better as "christmas doors" not "admissions".

i saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in pablo co. i had just quit my biomedical engineering job at a hospital. i consider the script to be a exaggeration of the real type of stuff that goes on in hospitals. the idiots that put it down on production value don't get the point and probably have never been hospitalized. and never worked in one for sure. billy jack (same era) was very poorly produced but had a significant social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message.i have ever since been looking for this movie this is the first site i have found where it get mentioned.

it has been since 1972 that i saw this movie and i still remember it as one of my favorite all time movies. i would buy a copy if it were on dvd and it is too bad it isn't. you would think that anything starring peter sellers would be brought back. much better than "being there" and as good as the pink panther series. uschi digard had a small part for such a well endowed performer. she is bonus in this movie. i think the medical field may not appreciate this film as it really makes fun of the profession and it also makes one appreciate that sellers was never available to treat them as his bed side manner sucked as well did his analysis of urine samples.

i remember seeing this film in my late teens or early twenties on tv - probably hbo. i watched it with my parents, a brother and a few friends. since that was about 30 years ago, i don't remember a lot of the story. i do remember that the entire group of us watching agreed that this was the funniest movie we had ever seen. when it was over, our bellies hurt from so much laughing. my dad worked at a hospital, so that made it all the better.every time i see the party in the tv listings, i look to see if this one is there, too. to my dismay, it never is. although i loved the party, i feel this one is funnier. peter sellers was great as a crooked hospital administrator. why it's never been released on video is a mystery to me. it's a classic, but it appears that nobody under 35 or 40 has been allowed to see it. i'd buy it in a second if they ever release it to dvd.

though often considered peter sellers' worst film, it is in fact an excellent send-up of medical corporate corruption and abuses of power. often misunderstood, the film is actually a departure from the type of film sellers was best known for; satirical farce. this film had excellent performances by jo ann pflug and pat morita (of happy days and the karate kid movies), but was marked by its ribaldary, irreverence, and total madcap demolition of the medical industry of the day. it was ahead of its time (1972) in taking the outrageous path that the monty python crew would take into the cinema some time later. as such, it was unacceptable to the traditional peter sellers fan, who found the more pointed barbs in this humor to be something to which they were unaccustomed. presently, peter sellers movies are in demand by fans, but this effort, where does it hurt?, has by its nature become almost impossible to find.

i really liked this one. (spoilers??) it had a really good plot, the main female in this movie is really kewl.despite the fact that she's the only one left alive and her lover dead, it seemed to be much like ninja scroll. another kick ass movie. ;)watch it in japanese with subtitles. i don't know where the idiots who learned to speak english are, but for some reason all dubs get an f in translation techniques. the subtitles are more correct.9/10quality: 7/10 entertainment: 10/10 replayable: 9/10

after reading more than my fair share of reviews for a vast number of different movies i have noticed a certain trend, people judge to harshly on what the expected to see. i figure if you go into a movie open-minded not expecting anything certain than you will have better feelings towards it then if you try and watch but have pre-created standards you want it to reach.since i try not to be hypocritical i watched this movie with a very clean slate and open-mind, and was very much pleased. since it is not a mainstream title or award winning for that matter i did not know quite what to expect, but in all truth i enjoyed it a good deal more than ninja scroll. lovely animation, deep story, and the always joyful ninja hack-n-slashing combined extremely well to one of my personal favorite animes ever made.i am not promising that you will enjoy it, but just give it a chance and you may come out with a pleasant surprise.- "before speaking, be sure of what you will say will be more beautiful than the silence" - chinese proverb

after having spent a lot of my youth watching such movies, i found this one very easy to follow in both the unedited and cut versions, (although the story has much more to hold it together in the unedited version. unlike ninja scroll this movie hit a much more serious note and i think that's where it hit me. the animation while grainy is very original, and i just love the way artists in that year stressed shadows to show different emotions. i think the story is perfect. the beginning of the movie really hits hard and as the movie progresses you get the feeling that you're going along in this adventure with the characters. as they meet, become allies and find out the their greatest strengths, a lot of heart was put into this.

two hard-luck but crafty ladies decide to act like havana widows by sailing to cuba to meet & blackmail rich gentlemen...this was the sort of ephemeral comic frippery which the studios produced quite effortlessly during the 1930's. well made & highly enjoyable, depression audiences couldn't seem to get enough of these popular, funny photo dramas.joan blondell & glenda farrell are perfectly cast as the frantic, fast-talking females who will go to great lengths to make a little dishonest dough. although joan gets both top billing and the romantic scenes, both gals are as talented & watchable as they are gorgeous.handsome lyle talbot plays joan's persistent suitor, but he's given relatively little to do. chubby, cherubic guy kibbee appears as the girls' intended target. whether awakening to find himself in the wrong bed or being chased across the roof of a cuban hacienda in his long johns, he is equally hilarious. behind him comes a rank of character actors - allen jenkins, frank mchugh, ruth donnelly, hobart cavanaugh, maude eburne, dewey robinson - all equally adept at pleasing the toughest crowd.movie mavens will recognize an uncredited james murray as the suspicious bank teller with the forged check. this very talented actor was pulled out of complete obscurity to star in king vidor's the crowd (1928), one of the silent era's most prestigious films. hopes were high for a great career, but his celebrity faded quickly with sound pictures. after a long string of tiny roles & bit parts, broke & destitute, his life ended in the waters of a new york river in 1936. he was only 35 years old.while never stars of the first rank, joan blondell (1906-1979) & glenda farrell (1904-1971) enlivened scores of films at warner bros. throughout the 1930's, especially the eight in which they appeared together. whether playing gold diggers or working girls, reporters or secretaries, these blonde & brassy ladies were very nearly always a match for whatever leading man was lucky enough to share equal billing alongside them. with a wisecrack or a glance, their characters showed they were ready to take on the world - and any man in it. never as wickedly brazen as paramount's mae west, you always had the feeling that, tough as they were, blondell & farrell used their toughness to defend vulnerable hearts ready to break over the right guy. while many performances from seven decades ago can look campy or contrived today, these two lovely ladies are still spirited & sassy.

i just finished watching this (last weekend) and found it absolutely hillarious, some of the scenes i just couldn't stop laughing at! dennis is soooo amazingly thick sometimes, and just says the stoopidest things...but at the same time he's just being cool to impress his girlfriend (who gets arrested anyway!) the beach scenery is very tranquil...until along comes robbie coltrane...! not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a saturday night when you haven't got much else to do (like i did). you might need to hunt around for it though - i was lucky, as my local video store stocks it.

the funniest movie from britain i have ever seen, "the supergrass" is a tale of sex, drugs, cream teas, and murder by the seaside. dennis carter (adrian edmonson), average moron, is out to impress his so-called girlfriend, andrea (dawn french), because she thinks he is too law-abiding. so, to get her to come along with him on a romantic getaway, he comes up with a scheme that perhaps will impress her and entice her to spend some time with him. trouble is, dennis' lie is that he's somehow gotten involved in an international drugs ring, and while telling her, a couple of policemen overhear his boasting and nick him. and so begins this witty movie, full of slick comedy and crude jokes. dennis is banged up in the local nick, and, much to the arresting officers' delight, there seems to be no way out (andrea's earlier attempts to explain it was all a lie were dismissed by a hilarious melody of "stand by your man" by the two officers'). then comes along commander robertson (ronald allen), chief intelligence, scotland yard. he makes a deal with dennis, that if he helps him catch the drug smugglers, then he will be set free and allowed whatever he pleases. dennis agrees, and is teamed up with harvey duncan (peter richardson), and lesley reynolds (jennifer saunders). the rest is an unforgettable rib-tickling experience, with robbie coltrane as sergeant troy adding humourous colour to the film. his walk along the dry-dock against "frankie goes to hollywood's two tribes" is superb, and probably the best scene in motion picture history. the two officers' who nick dennis are wonderfully played by michael elphick and patrick durkin, and alexei sayle as the motorcycle cop is a laugh! if you want something good to watch on a saturday night, then i suggest you rent this. you won't forget it!

if you loved the 1993 (erotic, sci-fiction)cyborg film "nemesis", then you'll love this one. i loved it the minute the elvis pompadoured hero pulls out a samurai sword during a shoot-out. like "nemesis" its takes place in a post apocalyptic slum of the future. both are police thrillers where the well armed hero must take on well armed rebels, to solve a conspiracy by the powers that be against the unwashed masses. but thats where the similarities ends. the ambiguous mayor in dead or alive tries to keep the masses sedate on the drugs he sells them. the rebels aided by mercenaries and a cyborg, try to brake his suffocating hold on his subjects. after several failed attempts to brake the rebels back, he sends his top cop to assassinate the rebels. this movie follows the track of most action adventure but isn't afraid to color outside the line.

it's said that this film is or was banned in the us since it was released. since there is no information on imdb i must rely on my other sources and believe it. if this is really true, the movie is even more hurtful and frightening and is it is anyway.the movie is a so-called mockumentary, although i think the topic is too serious call it like that. it creates a scenario where america is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are arrested immediately without proof. after an obligatory tribunal they have to decide if they go to prison for some years or choose the punishment park. in that, they have to walk through the desert for three days to reach an american flag, posted 50 miles ahead, while they're are followed by police and army troops.the movie itself pretends to be a documentary about these incidents and follows both the tribunals and the hunting through the desert, filmed by european film crews. all the facts are explained, the interviewers ask questions and film everything. people stare directly into the camera, shouting at it. it seems very, very real. talking about realism here is nonsense. this movie is not about how to make a realistic film, it is about how such a film would look like, if it was real. and it certainly would look like this. if it would be filmed anyway. in an 'utopian' state like this, there surely wouldn't be a european film crew allowed to film those things.there are many things that frighten us. the defendants are people from all social classes. political leaders, musicians, authors, philosophists, unemployed, etc. they seem to be hopeless, rebellious or scared. they are no heroes. they talk a lot in the tribunal, knowing it doesn't lead to anything, saying nevertheless all they said in speeches and books and songs before. one says he's not afraid to die. is this true? well, he doesn't have to run through the desert hunted by cops. the defendants have no chance, or at least, their only chance, the decision between prison and punishment park, is no chance really. the way they decide in the end and the way film ends, makes it clear that this kind of heroism is suicide.these tribunals remind us a lot of tribunals in the third reich. the officials use the same kind of idealistic speeching, ignoring all the arguments from the defendants, starting to scream at them and then telling them they should be quiet. they warn the defendants of "watching their language" and insult them much more. they ask them questions, the defendants can not answer, but it's never intendend they should. these scenes are a statement about what we call justice.the scenes in the desert are on a different level. when we see the prisoners for the first time, we realize that they realize, they haven't got a chance. seeing the desert and the mountains, feeling the sun and the thirst, they don't have a clue how they should stand this free days. the film crew follows them and talks to them while they try to escape this madness. they argue, should they play the game, or escape, or revolt? it all leads to the same and no one is surprised. some will question if such parks would exist in reality in such a state? why not? it empties the prisons and allows the government to punish the revolutionaries as they want to. it is not a gas chamber, but the nazis killed jews before concentration camps were built. the comparison is fair, since they is no real difference.the movie is scary and depressing. the problems that are talked about sound to familiar to ignore. these is not science-fiction. talking about poverty, unemployment and crime is not utopic. the film shows us that government and democracy as it is presented to us, is not only useless, but dangerous. it also shows us that revolution is not definitely the solution. the defendants seem to be confused because they don't really know how to fight this. they do things, but for nothing. even is this delivers no solution to us, it still is a statement.to me, the most frightening thing is the fact of the banning of this movie. here we have a film that accuses the loss of freedom, moral and peace. it accuses the government, a fictional goverment nevertheless, to be dangerous and inhuman. and such a film is banned. think about it when you see the american flag the next time.

to think this film was made the year i was born. to think people are still having their constitutional rights taken away, now in the name of "homeland security". to think this movie was intentionally banned from the american public. punishment park addresses the political divide in the united states better than any movie i've ever seen. had it been more widely seen, would it have changed anything? a movie like this is so polarizing, it has the potential to cause riots. it shakes you up and forces you to take sides. it makes you face the issue: are you for the people's right of dissent in a time of war, or for the constitution being compromised in the name of "national security"? the protagonists are forced by the government to race to the american flag in a game that undermines the very ideals the flag stands for. the acting is totally convincing. so much so, i can't see any acting going on here at all. if this is a scripted documentary, it's more convincing than any reality show on television today. punishment park is possibly the most important film ever made. it really makes you think.

this is probably the best movie from director hector babenco. it shows a brazilian reality unknown by foreigners, which is the same reality that haunts all of the latin american countries, poverty and a survival instinct. the most affected in this reality is the children usually left orphans, or abandoned by their poor parents have to make it in a "dog eat dog" society many times falling into the gap of delinquency, prostitution and crime. very well acted and with a "no frills" approach, this movie will get to you, great story plot, a must have movie on anybody's collection. the starring role went to fernando ramos da silva, a young boy who fell into the crime wave, killed some years later during a robbery. i would suggest people to watch the movie "who killed pixote?" so you can have a more in depth idea of the lives of these characters. some other characters from the movie had a similar fate, some died and others are in jail. none the less this movie will last for a long time in your memory

i'm originally from brazil... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that boy. they told his life story and he never got one "centavo" (brazilian cent) of that movie. fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through that life style in brazil. sad... but that is the world we live in. it's about making money not saving lives. question is: where is fernando today? most probably... dead. we tend to want to live in this "disney filled fantasy bubbled life". when someone comes up to the plate to help... along comes the higher power and says: "what do i get from this? where's my cut?" - i wish people's conscience would speak up!

film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults. overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the means the children go to to try to achieve living. only living. staying alive in a cruel world. a nightmare world, we are afraid to watch it because we are seeing truth and are afraid to see it. to see a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we have not got when it is so trivial compared to someone else. they, the children of the movie, are desensitized. they are more than desensitized by what is around them. they see sex as an act, like they are watching a tv program. when the one boy is with the hooker, pixote is sitting on the bed watching with a blank stare, no feeling. he wants to be a little boy and have a family but the hooker has no compassion either and pushes him away. a "human" film, with "human" relations and moral judgement in a ugly, scared, cruel world. reminds us that life is not fair, but you can still have a human connection.

for me, this is another one of those films that i got to see off of the los angeles based "z" channel when it was in service. and it was another one of those movies that i saw when i was young...and learned that there was a world out there...one i did not want to accept.moving to los angeles and getting to watch international cinema became quite the guilty pleasure hobby of mine and to date, no premiere channel programming has matched the "z" channel in its showing of international films. the three international films that stuck in my young head were "spetters", "beau pere" and of course this one, "pixote".this was the most shocking and saddest movie i ever witnessed in my life. this was also one of the first movies that made me understand that there is a difference in cinema: to entertain, and to inform. let me be honest..growing up in a small town on the east coast, i had no idea anything like this -- to this extent -- existed. all i knew from south america was brochures of fabulous brazillian vacations and that columbia had a lot of drug trafficking.then comes a film like pixote. sad. disturbing. unflinching. scary. you're watching: children. those that need shelter, love, understanding and all these get are a way to survive day after day through drugs, sex, robbing, stealing, sleeping on the streets and in sadistic group homes etc. their survival is hard to watch with other street children, prostitutes, etc., and you begin to wonder how can things like this be allowed to happen in this world.pixote is not a film for entertainment, it is a film of information. it shows shocking and disturbing images - but it shows life for these daily street children.

this was really a "nightmare" of a film; i saw it about nine years ago on cable tv and haven't forgotten it since. pixote is a 10-year old boy who lives in the streets of sao paulo (brazil) and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends lilica, dito and chico; they steal, pimp, sell drugs and murder in order to survive each day...in the first half of the film pixote is caught by the police and sent to a sadistic foster home where he witnesses every kind of abuse from the older inmates and guards to the rest of the kids; one night, lilica's boyfriend is killed after a beating, so pixote and his friends decide to escape during a riot. the rest of the film shows pixote's descent into a criminal life; he doesn't show any feelings or remorse after killing someone, maybe because he knows that good feelings are of no use in the world in which he lives...but there is, however, a gentle scene in the middle of the film; pixote and his friends are at the beach, missing (and wishing) one of his friends from the reformatory was there. i thought it was a poetic and melancholy scene in the middle of all these horrible events...the boys are obviously longing not only for their friend, but for a better life. director hector babenco's "pixote" is a brave and depressing film that doesn't shy away from showing the harshest reality many people -including myself- tend to ignore or misunderstand. this film will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person.

i've been studying brazilian cinema since 2004, when i stumbled onto "cidade de deus / city of god". let me tell you something, this movie is probably as good or better than "city of god".the acting, cinematography and music supervision make this movie a unique experience. i have not been to brazil yet, but this movie presents the harsh reality that is beset before the citizens of são paulo.i recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema. this movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit despondent after watching it.something you want to watch, but nothing you want to go to sleep on.

when it was released, in the beginning of the 80's, pixote brings to brazilian society the problems of young delinquents, and the impact of this in brazilian society. i can't watch the movie at that time, cause i was too young, but now i got a chance and watched it a few days ago. it's a very brutal movie, but everything is absolutely true, and sad. pixote is the name of a 12 year-old boy who lives in the streets, and survive with misdemeanors; he stays for a while in a house of detention, and when he left it he continues to plan robs with other buns and a prostitute, played by marilia pera. the boy is still a marijuana addicted and smell glue with another teenagers, to forget his sad reality. the quality of the images it's not the best, but the movie is totally realistic about brazilian problems, and must be viewed and admired.

"pixote" is the one of most powerful, shocking, and moving motion picture to come from brazil. it's about the lives of street kids on the streets of sao paulo and rio de janeiro, and it centers around a ten-year-old boy. the camera follows them around in an almost documentary style;from the juvenile detention center (where most of the staff is as corrupt as the police) and back to the streets, and it never turns away from the horrors of the city. prostitution, drug use/dealing, corruption, and murder are all witnessed by these youths; yet it's something they're painfully used to. director hector babenco used real street kids as the actors, adding to the films brutal reality. although not for everyone, a film i highly recommend. an emotionally devastating movie.

the film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about brazilain street kids whose families live in poverty and must steal and kill to survive. in fact the main character (pixote) was played by an actual street kid only 11 years old. what follows was one of the most brutal, depressing and horrifying film i've even seen. i saw it about 17 years ago (on a double bill with "black orpheus") and have never forgotten it. i don't think i ever want to see it again--it was just too much. spoiler ahead!!!! the scene which will not leave me is when pixote meets a prostitute who has to abort her own fetus. you don't see her do it...but you get a quick glance at what she got out. it's almost 20 years later and just recalling that scene upsets me. spoiler end!!!!!the movie gets more brutal as it goes along and ends the only way it can. what's all the more harrowing is stories like this really did happen in brazil in 1981...and are still happening today.a harrowing brutal film...but it should be seen if you can handle it. i'm surprised this got an r rating--i've seen x rated film that are less graphic. a 10.

this is a difficult movie to watch, and would have been even more difficult had i known then that the actor playing the protagonist was in fact killed in his home by police at age 19. pixote (peewee) is a street kid in sao paulo who is caught in a roundup triggered by a murder in which he had no involvement. he is committed to a juvenile prison where he witnesses brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens try very hard to believe doesn't exist. when finally he escapes, he and three comrades survive by the only means they know, which is crime. what makes the film so heart-rending is that both pixote and the actor portraying him clearly do not wish to be the characters life circumstances have made them. pixote tries to trust and to love and to bond, but there simply is no room in his world for the gentle side of human nature. one is left at the end wanting desperately to do something for the pixotes of the world, but what? building more children's's prisons with higher walls surely is not the answer...

this is no walk in the park. i saw this when it came out, and haven't had the guts to watch it again. you will never see a more horrifyingly devastating or depressing movie. i felt like i'd been severely beaten. what kind of world are we living in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage? this is our world, what we have created, what we have allowed to happen. and i would hesitate to say that i-me-we are not responsible for this. babenco made this film to wake us up, to shake us to our very core, and he succeeded. how can we be cruel, or self-indulgent, or neglectful of our children, when we see the graphic results of such behavior? he is pointing a finger of accusation at us all for doing this to the lowliest and least powerful of our society. and if you aren't doing something each day to prevent it, then you are part of the problem. i am not a religious fanatic, but this movie made me think about the state of my soul.

"pixote: a lei do mais fraco" deals with what is perhaps the greatest of all brazilian themes: poverty. and along with poverty the other unnatural feelings and actions it brings; prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder.brazil is the country of paradoxes, and its social problems are present everywhere. the difference between the rich and the poor; the beautiful and the ugly; happiness and the most profound human decay."pixote" is one of the films that dare to touch and open these so painful wounds, and does it without the slightest glimmer of hope, in an honest portrayal of a country that, like pixote himself, is already lost.

the violent death of fernando ramos da silva only eight years after the completion of this film, only adds to the poignancy of dierector babenco's powerful message. the film is split into two halves - the first in a reformatory where a group of youngsters are abused and violated by the violent law enforcers and guardians. the second backdrop is the city where they are confined instead by their own actions and morality, which includes mugging, pimping and killing different characters who enter their lives.the differing gender and sexual roles in the film allow for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people. particularly interesting is teh character of lalica, a transvestite who is mother and lover to some of the children. her reaction to the arrival of sueli, a prostitute is both poignant and tragic. there is no happy ending to this story and i reccomend to watch it with caution as there are some very uncomfortable scenes to watch especially in teh opening twenty minutes. but whilst watching it, it is important to remember that this is not just a fictional tale. the actors are not trained professionals but instead boys selected from the streetsof sao paulo. they actually lived this life that is portrayed so vividly on screen and in da silva's case, died at the hands of the police who are depicted so brutally. a documentary? a piece of fiction. it borders on both but it certainly makes for heart wrenching material and is a film that actually leaves you breathless and thinking long after having watched it.10/10

in his descriptions of caa, platinum card lunches in hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in provincetown he never took, and free trips to nicaragua, financed by columbia pictures.it sounds narcissistic, but spalding gray (possibly because of his unusual personality) ropes the audience in, laughs at himself (perhaps because he did not take the hollywood thing oh-so-seriously) and gets us to care.this monologue is not just about "the killing fields", or "swimming to cambodia"; it is more a pastiche of events, as he sees them. some of the lines are classic, as when gray meets with the esteemed talent agents at caa. the conference table is ..."full of them, tanned, healthy, fresh from drinking blue-green algae from an oregon lake...there are no drugs now in hollywood".this was before the tragedy occurred. many of us will miss his off-balance humor. 9/10.

three of the things you can say about spalding gray are: he certainly marched to the beat of his own "drummer;" he was never at a loss for words; and he obviously felt that those watching and listening to him would be interested in every aspect of his life, experiences and thoughts - no matter how trivial at times.most of us are not quite as far "off the wall" as he was. most of us aren't as interested in sharing the most minute parts of ourselves with others - even one-on-one or in small groups, let alone on stage.but that doesn't make it any less-interesting to watch and listen to this erudite, unusual man. and after seeing one of his performances, on reflection, we can find many of his articulate musings were perhaps more relevant to our own lives and thoughts than we may have first thought.granted, he was a "new york/avant-garde" type of personality, and undeniably a bit "strange." (there are those who would maintain describing someone as "new york" and strange" was being unnecessarily redundant.)i give him a "10" for the talent he presents in this genre which is his specialty.

gray can make the english language jump through hoops like none other. he recounts a number of events, tied together by his writing of a manuscript (the "monster" of the title), some sad, some uproariously funny, all in his characteristic, sarcastic manner. if you liked "swimming to cambodia" you will love this one. i actually thought this was a bit more interesting and better told than "swimming to cambodia". a real masterpiece.

this is marvelous movie, about a soul of ale. this is a journey to ale's heart. i found it fascinating. the director did a great job. he makes the scenes talk. especially on the silent scenes. the window of ale is a great one. an the scenes when he lies in bed are one of the best directed scenes i have seen. apart from directing. it has been a quite time i did not watch a movie about a soul. as a philosopher i can say that, this film proves that the age does not matter about your soul. so as ale's soul. as living in turkey i do not care about the other side of ny. this is a universal scene you can see everywhere in the world. as to my opinion more universal than every other thing. do not miss this film. otherwise you will miss a great thing about a soul. if you have one. baris.sentuna

i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels; from production to plot and character development.this definitely fall under the "realism" genre, since there is nothing going on here that makes use of creative imagination, twists, or manipulating audience in how a viewer shall feel, think and asses.the actors are great, especially the "little" ones. the chemistry between the brother and the sister is mind blowing, maybe not even as common as should be in real life. it is a movie excellent to literally watch while visualizing it. one knows when a movie is good when one just does not want it to end, but eventually everything does...

the majesty of ramin bahrani's second feature is that, like the work of a poet, he portrays the very soul of humanity and lets it flourish on the screen. beyond the scope of most other indie films out there, chop shop is wise, exuding the very best of the great cinema of the ages; we can look back at the works of bresson and pasolini and compare bahrani's work to theirs, and yet chop shop is fresh and urgent to modern society. we can see the workings of a master here  a certain sense of beauty, style, and content all merge together in a film that reminds us what it means to be alive. instead of focusing on the side of nyc we so often see, we live and breathe with our young hero, alejandro, in the destitute willits point  a fascinating quasi-sub-world of our culture  and yet it's a very, very real place. trying to stay afloat, alejandro has to support himself and his older sister. watch this film and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that bahrani leads us toward  all with profound and concise realism.

this is one of those movies when you are watching it you wonder whether it is documentary or fiction. after the movie, ramin bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the movie has a script.bahrani's camera is silent, he is not judgmental, he almost erases director from the movie by purpose, background is not organized to make the picture pretty, however don't get me wrong; there is a lot of preparation for this movie. starting on personal level, being the part of environment, being to be ignored when you film.main character is a 'real' actor in every sense.i would like to thank all crew for this movie, showing us another country within nyc. i strongly suggest it if you like stories of others.bora kizilirmak

some critics have compared chop shop with the theatrical releases of city of god and pixote. i've seen both of those as well as chop shop and like in many instances, i don't feel the comparison is warranted. city of god and pixote surely had a much higher budget. chop shop is a low budget independent film about survival and hope, disappointment, and continuing with life. one of the scenes is allegedly filmed during the us open and either the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time and the us open footage was added. i say that because i live in the area where this movie was filmed and security is insane while the tennis matches are in progress. it's also noteworthy that the actors actual names were their character's names in the movie. back to the movie. it's an enjoyable story about survival. however, it ended up getting a 7 because... at times the actors acted extremely well. at other times, they appeared to be just reciting their lines. if the actors were less competent (as they were in the low budget "the big dis" for example) i would have been more forgiving. but in several scenes each and every one of these actors gave exemplary performances. at other times, they appeared bored. the director might be at fault here. i also had problems with the ending. this is one of those movies that "just ends". maybe there will be a part 2? definitely worth getting on dvd. i wont bother summing up the story because that info is already available on imdb.

can't say this wasn't made well. at a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes. and there isn't the slightest indication he didn't get exactly what he wanted. but this is an oddly non-hispanic film in the same way west side story was many years ago. both the leads, a brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts. the setting, a sort of underground car repair district in queens, is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself. but there's something unsatisfying about the key issue in the film, namely, what the sister feels she has to do to get by. i can understand the brother's reaction, but it just seems a little too easily come by to me. the movie seems to suggest that people like these don't need our help, that they'll find a way to survive without the usual support systems. i wouldn't encourage anyone to believe that. there would be far more resistance to the choices made here than depicted. other than that as an entertainment it works well. as an accurate depiction of a culture, not so well, i think.

being a big fan of stanley kubrick's clockwork orange there was of course "no question about it" that i had to see this one. however i put it off far too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like "extremely boring" or "nothing happened" "a complete waste of time". but when i saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith i was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001: a space odyssey. there was no doubt in my mind that i was going to rent that movie the same evening. it turned out to be the greatest visual experience of my life. of course, watching a very good painting or picture can be wonderful, but watching a movie constructed with the same kind of virtuosity in every frame adds a whole new dimension to it. my god... i like my friends a lot but it's a pity that i can't share with them the very thing that makes my heart jump up with excitement and makes my spirit fly like a bird in the sky. that thing, my friends, is beauty. as this film goes to show, beauty is terribly underrated in our technologically advanced, intellectually shallow, consumer driven fast-food western societies. that doesn't mean however that i reject these fast-paced societies or that i look down on them (and neither does kubrick) but only that they can be so much more if only people would stop for a moment and take a little time to absorb the sheer beauty of the world we live in. and what better opportunity is there to do this then by slowing down to the elegant pace of this film and to let yourself be taken to that place between waking and dreaming. when we go to this place it is possible to get a so called "natural high". it is something that our spirit can do whenever we meet pure and boundless beauty. and never in my life has this "natural high" or "spiritual orgasm" as it is called by some or "samaddhi" by others been more intense. yes it's more intense than a regular orgasm... several times more intense actually. many religions have claimed that this particular feeling proves that they are right. are they right? for me a straight answer to such a question would only detract from the impenetrable mesmerizing mystery of the universe. in my opinion the film tries to convey the same mystery through the depiction of the black monolith and by stating the following about it: "except for a single very powerful radio emission aimed at jupiter the four-million year old black monolith has remained completely inert. its origin and purpose are still a total mystery." the trance that bowman experiences is the same thing i experience when watching those gorgeous visuals. i can imagine that mystery can be frustrating for those who need straight fast-food answers to big ontological questions. but instead of giving us comfort we are constantly irritated by the awareness of the simplifications that are contained in these answers. the doubt and discomfort that is subsequently caused will make us point to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of all this trouble, while in fact we only have our easy answers to blame. but this film shows us that when fast ontological statements give rise to nothing but doubt, we can always rely on phenomena to make some sense out of the world. from the moment you realize that beauty is something that can only really be presented to us as a phenomenon and never as a "thing in itself" the mysterious black monolith is no longer disturbing, frightening or irritating but instead becomes fascinating, enchanting and maybe even comforting. we don't need an answer to what's really out there to be in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives. when we are able to let mystery be what it is, to embrace it even... we can finally bring our souls to rest. i am pretty sure though that a film that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never really be surpassed. especially now that the greatest director who ever lived is no longer with us.

not only unique for its time but one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. made without cgi on a very lean budget in today's adjusted figures. stanley kubrick made this film without the high shooting ratio he normally has. stanley kubrick is without doubt the greatest director in history thus far.this film was cut from five hours to two hours and twenty minutes and the art direction was superb.stanley kubrick and the great aurthur c. clarke collaborated to write this time less classic.aliens a special message on earth at the dawn of human kind and one on the moon which modern man finds .finally humans accompanied by the most advanced computer ever made set of to jupiter the find the next monumental message which turns out to be a gateway.any one who studied film and/or wishes to be a part of the film industry or just enjoy great films must experience this film .if you don't like it then you belong to bollywood or your a true aussie.

a film, first and foremost, should be good storytelling. it should be entertaining - and entertaining doesn't necessarily mean "laughs", and it doesn't necessarily mean "light". it basically means you're not bored while watching it. as brilliant as 2001 may be, it is a difficult film to watch, especially for the current (video-game-playing/ipod fumbling) generation. its slow pace and the sometimes intolerable amount of time it takes for an actor to perform a single action (e.g. the attempt to rescue the crew member floating in space) will stretch your patience. on the other hand, the cinematography is brilliant, the film cleverly directed, the ending thought-provoking and the score...the score is chilling, especially as the crew in the transporter approaches the artifact on the moon. boy, i had goose bumps, big time. this doesn't happen often when i watch films, and is a testament to kubrick's directing skills. it is considered a classic, and many people consider it the best science-fiction film of all time. that alone is a good reason to watch it if you haven't done so yet. however, just because everybody else thinks it's a brilliant film doesn't mean you have to force yourself to like it. you either will (like it) or you won't. perhaps the slow pace isn't such a bad thing, after all. directing your attention to something rather static and slow-paced for 2 1/2 hours might teach you a lesson. it will certainly be a different experience to all these fast-moving, fast-paced images we are subjected to these days (whether commercials, music videos or video games). i myself think it's a "memorable" film. but not one i'm eager to watch again anytime soon (unless i'm in a particular mood for slow-paced films). hence, 7 stars out of 10 from me.

there is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will. and it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. at the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system.i saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. i went because i like science-fiction and wanted to see a "space" movie. remember this film was made before the first moon landing.there we sat, waiting for it to begin. but, surprise! there was no cartoon, no coming attractions. the theater owner at the cooper theatre for some reason chose to play "the star-spangled banner" with the lights still up so we all stood, never did that at a movie before or since and then sat down again as it ended. then the theatre went completely dark and the strange overture began with the blank screen barely visible.the overture ended and my seat began to vibrate as the blue screen with the mgm lion appeared, along with the first deep bass notes, and then my senses were overwhelmed, hearing "also sprach zarathustra" for the first time in my life. the ride had just begun.(i highly recommend you watch this opening, this film, in a dark room with your subwoofer turned up as high as possible to get the effect i felt in that theatre.) of course, it took quite awhile before we got to outer space and the movie that followed was anything but a science-fiction movie. intermission came (a good thing, highly under-rated and unused these days) and we all looked at each other in wonder, caught our breath, and then the ride resumed, wilder than before.i saw it 7 more times within the next year, always in a real full size theater, like all theaters were before multiplexes. i might have been "high" once but i didn't go to see it again and again because i was "tripping". i went because i knew i was seeing a work of art. it was so damn beautiful; the sound that you could feel in your bones followed by terrifying silence; the sights unimagined and unimaginable; the affection for hal turning to terror. and of, course, wtf was kubrick really trying to get across to me? years and years and many more viewings later, i understand it as well, i think, as i ever will. read someone else's comments if you're looking for someone to explain it to you or search around the web, you'll find "explanations", that's not my purpose in writing these comments.what i hope to do is encourage you to watch it patiently, enjoy it's beauty the way you would enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know of (e.g, gayne ballet suite or the blue danube); savor it like you would a wonderful meal, sip it like a fine wine; look and listen for the clues and the hidden symbols that are there. and then draw your own conclusions. stanley kubrick wanted to share some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where you. a human, came from and where you're headed.if that's too much work for your brain, and you can't see and hear and ponder the beauty and mystery of kubrick's film, then, pardon my bluntness, but your life is about as meaningful as that of a tapir or a pre-monolith ape. if you want mindless escape, this isn't for you.but if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries, and sensuality and can have an open mind this film will add something to your life.

"2001: a space odyssey" is set in 2001 and the main character is hal. a computer. that's right, a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own. this was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke. if this was in 3064, a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this. there is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion. it provokes two reactions and one is called: sleep. it starts with nothing, but a pitch black shot for well over two minutes. then, the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is "the dawn of man" sequence. so, if it's in chronological order, the blackness prior to this, is the birth of the world? during "the dawn of man" sequence out of no where, a huge monolith comes from out of the ground, from the sky, we'll never know where it comes from, but for one reason or another it's there. the monkeys go apesh!t once they find this monolith that only man could have made, but that's the catch man hasn't evolved yet. so, who made it and where did it come from? what is its purpose? the monkeys find a tool. the monkeys use bones to fight an opposing group of monkeys. the monkeys with the weapons are now the dominating group because they have used their mind to gain an advantage. the more advanced monkeys, and more importantly smarter and more innovative monkeys, are the dominate group as they have taken over the watering hole.we quickly jump into space, millions of years later, where we see a bunch of spaceships floating around to classical music. we can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe and for a film made in 1968 the visual effects are stunning, but outdated. the score is legendary. the cinematography is spectacular. the editing is atrocious. there are countless shots of boxy looking space ships floating in outer space for, what feels like, an infinite amount of time. once we board the ship there isn't much to talk about. for the next hour kubrick shows various shots of life in outer space. kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut, which is very boring, and we completely get the message. the spaceships interior and exterior are bulky and outdated looking. remember what the first cell phone looked like? me neither, but that's what the future looks like in 2001. all the characters have clothes and hairdos that resemble 1968. the chairs are decorated in bright red colors and oddly shaped because we all know, in the future, we're going to be sitting in weird looking chairs. the computer screens are hideous looking and this is obviously prior to hdtv because the clarity is atrocious. all the tv sets look like they're from 1968, so it's not all that futuristic. like all films set more than 20 years in advance, they look terrible and unconvincing. just because this is kubrick, we shouldn't say, "well, that's how you would think it looks." no, i wouldn't. just, like i wouldn't think a computer would be talking to me in the year 2047. it's not going to happen and if someone made a film right now, set 30 years in time and had a talking, self thinking computer, i would laugh at the stupidity of it. just like i did with "2001". hal is the liveliest person, shoot i just called him a person. hal is a computer, but he has more life than any of the muted characters in the film and he actually thinks he's alive. hal is the only thing that's lively and he sees the humans as his maintenance men taking care of him while he does all the work. hal "reads" the lips, of one of the very few conversations between dave and frank, and he "sees" that they are planning to turn him off. this is where the only dramatic part of the film enters- an ensuing battle between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to get into the bigger spaceship. oh, the drama. once hal thinks he has the upper hand, dave makes his way back into the spaceship, proving mans ingenuity. dave proceeds to terminate hal. hal, pleads for his life as he slowly fades away, which, like everything else, seems to take forever.the final act is just as tedious as the first two. once again, the monolith that the apes found appears at the end. it comes out of nowhere, again. then, an infant is born in a placenta-like shield overlooking the earth from space. what is kubrick saying? is it about transformation? dave to an infant? is man evolving again? is kubrick saying this is the end of man and the start of whatever that alien looking thing is? maybe i'm going crazy trying figure out what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more i think about the more the beginning and the ending make sense. there are so many questions left unanswered, especially for the purpose of the monolith. if you can make it through the film it should spark some thought. in the end the film struggles with getting to where it wants go. the first act and the third acts are strong, but the second act meanders around, hovering in one place for what seems like eternity. there is some intriguing stuff in the film that will provoke some thought if you give it a chance. once the start of the film makes sense the ending works much better, even if you still don't what kubrick is trying to say, which i don't.

2001: a space odyssey is it a sermon? an account of the history of mankind? an exploration of man's futile attempts to advance technology only to have technology destroy him? is it about the fragile balance of time and space? a lesson in evolution? or is it just a spectacular effects show; a film kubrick made only to show us the limitless possibilities of the motion picture and present to us the truth that images are exceedingly more powerful than words? 2001: a space odyssey is all of these things. one of the most interpretable films ever created, it's almost more fun to dissect and discuss the ambiguous plot design and events of the film, than it is to actually watch. but it's left open to discussion intentionally; if kubrick had explained the meaning to his wondrous 1968 classic (ranked #22 on afi's list of the greatest 100 films ever made, my personal 21st favorite filmcurrently--, and nominated for 4 academy awards: director, original screenplay, art direction, and visual effects which it won for) it would have lost half its fascination, all of its complexity, and a good portion of its cinematic worth. we would only be left with the technical ingenuity; which in itself is worth praising.because every shot is worth taking the time to look. and there is plenty of time. 2001 is very elegiac, and also coolly distant; detached. the emotional remoteness and slow pace pay perfect tribute however to the unique visual experience; 2001 begins with mankind's ape ancestors, who upgrade from scavengers of the planet to hunters and toolmakers after discovering a giant monolith in the midst of their desert home, then (in one of motion picture history's most inspired jump-cut edits) as a bone is tossed into the air and becomes a satellite, jumping forward a couple thousand years into space, where astronauts have discovered a similar object on the moon, and next the film following a crew of space traveler's mission as they follow the monolith's signal through space, accompanied by their untrustworthy computer hal, who attempts to sabotage the shuttle and kill the crew, before finally the lone survivor is launched through space and time (in a flurry of drug-induced colors that probably gave hippies an epileptic shock back in the day) to grow old, die, and be reborn a "star-child". whew.this pacing and emotional blankness, is also in sharp contrast with the film's most ironic scene; the destruction of hal. as the crew's final explorer shuts the machine down, bathed in the holy aura of red light kubrick has always used as a repeat motif, hal singing a lovely tune, it is a strangely emotional experience. and it's all genius.other notable aspects of kubrick's masterpiece is the memorable voice of hal (a calm, somehow sinister, douglas rain), the minimal use of dialogue (kubrick was wisely trusting of his images to propel the film; giving only banal, unhelpful lines to his actors. the most famous being "open the pod bay doors hal"), satellites dancing around in orbit to unorthodox music, and that first, awe-inspiring shot of earth; slowly revealing the glare of the sun in front of it, played to the sound of blasting, triumphant horns.2001 shall always remain a mystery, and will forever be a testament to the cinema's strongest point: visuals are more powerful than writing. it's all from one of film history's most legendary and best directors, whose unique vision, was always his own. 10/10 "open the pod bay doors hal"-2001: a space odyssey

spoilers ahead.2001: a space odyssey is without a doubt the most challenging and successful film by the late stanley kubrick. this is not a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused. instead it provides you with a banquet of food for thought, images that linger in the mind's eye long after the movie itself is over. it is a film that you could meditate on. the film intentionally offers us more questions then it can answer, it is made to puzzle and mystify, but leaves the viewer nevertheless with a sense of awe and reverence (that is allowing that he has engaged himself in the process of viewing it, enjoyment of this film requires some effort on the viewers part) the questions that it does pose are large and ominous, concerning the genesis and destiny of the human race, it's ultimate place in the cosmic design and the existence or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself. the first of the films four quartets gives us a distinct view of the species past. we see our distant ancestors, half-ape half human, in a state of near starvation. the climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian beasts are near starvation. an extra-terestial object, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by it's presence to tool-making and violence. they are transformed overnight into carnevores, and when two tribes encounter each other near a water source, the tribe that has developed tool making capacity, as well as beligerence, soundly destroys the neighboring tribe. the new chief of the winning tribe, empowered by the first vestiges of technology triumphantly throws the bone that he used as a weapon in the air. we see the bone transformed into a floating satellite, which contains nuclear weapons. we soon learn that the world is torn apart by nuclear paranoia. the characteristics inspired by the monument's appearance that once helped us to survive now threaten our very existence. once again humanity is in crisis, once again the unearthly presence represented by the black monolith will step in to aid humanity in the next step in it's development. on an exploration of the moon a monolith identical to the earlier one we have seen is discovered. the governments of the world, normally mortal enemies, have come together in secret to discuss the implications. a mission is arranged. the monument has been engaged in some kind of radio communication with jupiter. a few men will travel to the destination of the transmission. most of them will, for most of the time, be kept in a state of suspended animation. the pilot of the spacecraft will be hal a super computer who has been programmed to imitate all of the traits of human beings. the film has many outstanding sequences. as usual for kubrick the use of classical music is outstanding. most memorable are "blue danube" and "also spake zarathustra" (particularly appropriate given the film's theme of transcending ordinary consciousness.) the cinematography is particularly excellent as well, after a single viewing the film's final 30 minutes will haunt you for the rest of your life. the character of hal is the most important from the view of the film's central thesis. in imitating all the characteristics of human beings he comes to have their negative traits as well. the paranoia he develops which almost leads to the mission' s ruin is an exact mirror of the paranoia that has allowed the political situation back on earth to reach a point of desperate crisis. the film suggests that these are the traits that we must leave behind if we are to proceed to the next phase in our evolution. the architecture of the film is also meaningful. the designs of many of the spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motif of the movie. the ending of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed. this movie takes a view of life similar to that presented in the poetry of william butler yeats and james joyce's novel finnegan's wake. it posits a pattern to history and human evolution that is cyclic, yet progressive, repeating the same events at large intervals, yet with the human race as developing according to the will of a being with a larger purpose in mind. though we never learn what this purpose is, the film assures us that the human race is not meant for failure, it's destiny is grand beyond it's capacity to imagine. it continues to amaze me that in spite of this film many people continue to regard kubrick as a misanthrope. this is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adhering to any specific creed, but because of it's invocation of wonder at the vast panorama of existence and it's involvement with the deepest and most vital questions of purpose and truth.  in the hands of any other director, this would all be perhaps a little too much. hollywood's view of life is too puny, usually to encompass the grandeur and intensity of a vision such as this one. but kubrick was a visionary, he directs with utter confidence, not only that he can handle material of this kind, but that he is the only one to do it. the process of making this film used all of his creative resources. the writing partnership with arthur c clarke is the most fruitful in cinematic history. kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the movie's astounding climax. the resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time, so he brought them into existence. 2001 is a absolutely unique movie experience. those who miss out on it do so at the detriment of their own intellectual and imaginative capacities.

this movie is not just good, its amazing. besides providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and a lot more, it was an, until then, completely unseen world to the public. this is the first sci-fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words. i am only 16 years old, and therefore i was raised into a world of modern effects and 3d animations in the movies. but nonetheless i was really, and i mean completely, blown away by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. the visual effects was just one of the merits of this movie, the camera was in true kubrick style amazing and enchanting. it feels like you are consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). the effects, the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me of my guards even though i had seen the rating before i bought it. but this movie has more to it than this. the meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you wish yourself, even though i think there are some clear points concerning humanity (also true kubrick style). how humanity on top of its evolution is just maintenance on board, and therefore not needed by the computer, one of humanities tools. how we in space appear like babies, learning to walk once more, losing control of our tools in zero-gravity, breathing through equipment as fish out of water. on the peak of evolution, we set out into the never-ending adventure as simple primates. many might think that the length and slow pace of this movie is, boring? ridicules? or just a waste of time. but before you can jump to those conclusions, think about why kubrick spends time with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes. this is to illustrate the beauty of it. beauty, beauty is in many cases not granted the rightful respect by viewers. kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we do not succumb to it and relax, we can not enjoy this film as it was intended. this is not an ordinary movie, we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies, this requires time, thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch. all of this together, makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving pictures. 10/10 let me know if you agree with me.

i'm always surprised, given that the famous title track of 2001 is called "also sprach zarathustra", that nobody (nobody i've read, anyway) has noted the parallels between the movie and nietzsche's famous work, "also sprach zarathustra". the idea of man's rebirth into a star child; an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of n.'s "zarathustra"; there is a prominent passage called "on how a camel becomes a lion, and a lion becomes a child", in which n. describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child, transcending both the ascetic, altruistic side of man (the camel; always asking to bear more weight) and the rapacious, brutish, will-to-power side of man (the lion). the fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence. and also, zarathustra said that "man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman." the structure of the movie fits that description: a brief history of man as beast, until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason, then a long sequence about man (the rope, as it were), and then a brief glimpse of the overman. the inscrutability of how these transformations occurred, and the suggestion that an external force caused them, is also nietzschean; in "zarathustra", he makes it pretty clear that he doesn't have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider (zarathustra) to show us how to "go under". bowman's psychedelic sequence at the near-end could be seen as kubrick's best 1960's-style attempt at depicting the mystical "going under".i know these parallels are pretty broad, and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that i have not personally seen it. but i just wanted to mention them, if for no other reason than to try to dispel the myth that nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher. few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy, and it is in my opinion, explicitly and unmistakeably nietzschean. the case could certainly be made that 2001 is above all a dramatization of "zarathustra" updated for the modern age. feel free to disregard the outright snobbishness of my tying everything to nietzsche.

like a circle around the human condition, 2001 starts at the beginning, skips the middle, and proceeds to the ending, right back where we started. noting the weakness of words compared to image(s), kubrick wisely dispenses with dialogue, preferring the power and essence of the scenery, and allowing the intelligence of the audience to do the deciphering. or not, depending on the audience.a monolith in cinematic history, 2001 is a high water mark of direction, execution, and achievement. if one considers the ambition of the film (a film about everything), and the measure of success the film achieved to that end, a very sound argument for this being the greatest of all films can be made.

"200l: a space odyssey" is a supremely intriguing space-travel journey with a profound look at mankind's future... it is one of the very few great films of our times... it gives us something to think, talk and argue... it wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity... it inspires us to dig for insights...as a science fiction fantasy, it is one of the most original films ever made... kubrick's camera dances to the "blue danube" with planets floating exuberantly through the light years... it's an experience in the poetry of motion, a rich statement to the power of cinema...but "2001" reveals that it's not really a science fiction film after all... it's, instead, a philosophical enigma, a magnificent meditation on man's place in the grand scheme of things, and a quest to understand ourselves by knowing all else..."2001" is a unique film about man's evolution told in almost subliminal terms... the people in this classic science-fiction epic hardly matter... kubrick relates a chronology in images of thingsthe mountains, the desert, the technology, the space capsule, the computer named hal (who is more interesting than the humans), and the time warp... the final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius...as a terror story, too, it is a towering achievement (not on the same scream-inducing level as hitchcock's "psycho"), but in an innocent and far more haunting way...the film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man... in kubrick's fantasy, the golden age of man was a neglected instant between a man-ape's exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear-powered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the earth... man has indeed evolved!as a spectacle "2001" assaults the mind, eye and ear, with stimulating images and suggestions... we are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment... the film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments: the first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually, without a single line of dialog; the zero-gravity toilet with its great list of instructions; the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down; the frightening moment when we realize that hal is reading the astronauts lips; the magical alignments of sun, moon, and earth; the "starchild" returning home to charm the orb..."2001" is filled with poetic imagery: the view of the sun rising over the earth; the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion; the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet..."2001" is also a work of great visual acuity... it allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man... its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery... they insist upon an answer where there can only be a question... every viewer had a different explanation of the mysterious end of kubrick's film but for those who can accept mysticism, the climax is deeply moving...

mankind's self awakening is the theme of "2001: a space odyssey", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. we "see" our primordial past, and we "infer" a cosmic future. the powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.from this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. it's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species. not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the film's slowness and minimal story. for perceptive viewers, the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe.in this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. circles and arcs represent nature. right angles represent conscious intelligence. some people think the sleek, black monolith is a von neumann probe. maybe. without doubt, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. mystery is more profound than explanation."2001 ... " is unique among films in content and scope. the cinematography is out-of-this-world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime. i rarely use the word "masterpiece" to describe a movie. but stanley kubrick's "2001: a space odyssey" is art in the highest sense, like leonardo da vinci's "mona lisa", or vincent van gogh's "the starry night".

this movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. it is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression. perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way. the story itself is quite simple at a first glance. as the title implies, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. this motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time, and beyond, but also had rich philosophic meaning. the film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions. it is not just an odyssey of a person; it is an odyssey of our species. the film is great by itself, yet, in my case, the impression from it will always be mingled with that from the book. i've read it at the age of 10, really not thinking about problems like 'what is the relationship between evolution of humankind and development of human morality'. but the impression was great enough to make me fall for entire genre of science fiction.the day i learned '2001' got only special effects oscar and was not even nominated for the best picture was the day when 'academy award' completely became two words meaning nothing to me.

i write this review just after hearing of stanley kubrick's death. it's a great loss, and i write about 2001: a space odyssey, because i feel it is the consummate kubrick film, the one he will be most remembered for. it is a picture like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. it was probably america's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of george lucas and countless other writers and directors.aside from its visual greatness, the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. kubrick and arthur c. clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have never really found out what was going through their minds. of course, the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001's ending is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child's flight back to earth. it is meaningless to many, but discerning filmgoers will understand.although 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of dr. strangelove or clockwork orange, or contain strong, eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like paths of glory or spartacus, i still feel he would've liked to be remembered most for this. if anything, hal will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous, and artificial. it was a half-decade in the making at a time when hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the new wave of french and italian cinema. kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms, his own time, and for everyone else to marvel at. he will be missed.

i spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001. not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way i observe the universe. it changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. and after reading the novel (by arthur c. clarke) i found myself once again inspired (a writer as i am) by the level of imagination.the space odyssey is not something one can just "go and see". one has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood. in fact i don't think it can be understood at all, at least not all of it at once. it is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of it's genre and still after 32 years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring 'also spracht zarathustra' by richard strauss and 'blue danube' by johann strauss.take all the time you want, but eventually you are going to have to see this film. if it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me, it can certainly do it for you as well.or maybe i'm just plain crazy...

a review i have put off for far too long....bluntly, 2001 is one of the best science-fiction films made to date, if not the very best. stanley kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. and although it is misunderstood by many, and respectively underrated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and i'll have to agree. back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has since. it was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it is no wonder as to why. the film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! take note cgi people. through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. this aspect alone almost single-handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. i can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space, like it is in reality. not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood, and it works flawlessly.aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film. the music played, all classical, compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler.the story, while seemingly simple, is profound. sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. what are they? where did they come from? what do they do? these are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. while most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions. it's not left entirely up to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. experience it for more clarification. the end result is quite chilling, no matter your personal solution.while it is a long film, and sometimes slows down, it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man. it's not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film, faster paced feature. those with short attention spans need not apply.last but not least, is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist, hal 9000, the computer. never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. which reminds me, for a film with such profound ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. another sign of kubrick's genius.all in all, one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made. a personal favorite. everyone must see this film at least once.very highly recommended.

instead of writing a paragraph, i'll give four good reasons why 2001 is the greatest cinema experience of all time: 1) it is a visual odyssey that could only be told on the big screen. the special effects that won kubrick his only oscar are the most stunning effects before that age of jurassic park and t2. they allow kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate) depiction of space travel to date. the silence that fills the space scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with hal). the fact that kubrick shot the moon scenes before the apollo landing is a gutsy yet fulfilling move. many have said that upon its original release, it was a favorite "trip" movie. i can think of no other movie that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry phantom menace fans!) 2) kubrick's directing style is terrific. as in all his films, kubrick likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his characters and plots. his camera is not as mobile as other greats, such as scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. faces are the key element of a kubrick film. like classic movies, such as m and touch of evil, kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the audience a psychological view-point. even he uses extreme close-ups of hal's glowing red "eye" to show the coldness and determination of the computerizd villain. i could go on, but in summation kubrick is at the hieght of his style. 3) hal 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. i whole-heartedly agree with the late gene siskle's opinion of hal 9000. most of this film takes place in space. through the use of silence and the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. dave and his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to escape. combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of hal 9000 and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. i still, although having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a particular scene. 4) the controversial ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. instead of trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of 2001's meaning in general is, i'd like to discuss the fact that the ending serves to leave the movie open-ended. kubrick has stated that he inteded to make 2001 open for discussion. he left its meaning in the hands of the viewer. by respecting the audience's intelligence, kubrick allowed his movie to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful discussion on man's past, present, and future. the beauty of 2001 is that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an entertaining journey through space. no other movie, save the great citizen kane, leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. it is truly meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the mind. instead of waiting in long lines for the phantom menace, rent a widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.

for all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film ("like, why does he show spaceships docking for, like, 15 minutes?"), here's a word you might want to think about:beauty. beauty is an under-rated concept. sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. but when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? there is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. this is depressing hogwash. there is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot. a director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so.  '2001' requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films. it requires you to relax. it requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. don't get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they're not the be-all and end-all of everything. there are different kinds of film, and to enjoy '2001' you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, pure beauty, unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films.

sometimes reading the user comments on imdb fills me with despair for the species. for anybody to dismiss 2001: a space odyssey as "boring" they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making. finally i understand why most hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.thankfully, those that cannot appreciate kubrick's accomplishment are still a minority. most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic. this is the film that put the science in "science fiction", and its depiction of space travel and mankind's future remains unsurpassed to this day. it was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up.2001 is primarily a technical film. the reason it is slow, and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes). the film's greatest strength is in the details. remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey. to create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - i still can't work out how some of the shots were done. the film's only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind's technological (and social) development. it is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not kubrick's.besides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going. yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that's the nature of the future. kubrick and clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it's up to the audience to continue. there's no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel. i know that's what most audiences seem to want these days, but kubrick isn't going to let us off so lightly.i'm glad to see that this film is in the imdb top 100 films, and only wish that it were even higher. stanley kubrick is one of the very finest film-makers the world has known, and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 10/10.

wow,this is in my opinion the best sitcom since friends. if you have had a crap day just sit yourself down with a beer (if you are old enough that is.if not a root beer will have to do.) and watch a couple of episodes,it's the perfect recipe for happiness.the thing i like most is that everybody in the show is very funny and they all have fantastic comedy timing. after a while you become attached to the characters and really care about them. i think the secret to the shows success is that they have an enviable life. doug is fat but still happy with it,he loves his wife his job and his friends. the father in law is the fly in the ointment but hey nothings perfect.

i have just started watching this show. its airing in ireland at the moment on the irish television station rte1 at 12.30pm in the afternoon (as of 26th july 2006).this program literally makes me laugh out aloud and i cannot boast that on most sitcom's (apart from uk's 'the office' with ricky gervais in it).todays episode of tkoq (26 july 2006)was the one where carrie starts a new job and invites her friends home and goes off to make some coffee and doug wants carrie to have no 'outside' friends so he lifts up his top and shows off his 'belly hair!' and licks plates when he goes out to dinner! but another funny episode was the other week when the old fella (carries dad) won on the bingo and that episode creased me up with laughter especially when they went out and got a replacement fridge and carries father stood there looking at it and thought it was new.so i don't know how much longer this has got to run on irish tv or at which stage (year recorded) we are at but i hope it don't end soon because i am really enjoying it.to sum up there is some great writing, some great characters and comedy acting (namely by carrie, doug and carries father) some great punchlines and delivered well - a bit saucy and near the mark sometimes (send the kids out the room!) but i think this us sitcom is a winner and very funny.

"the king of queens," in my opinion, is a pure cbs hit! despite the fact that i've never seen every episode, i still enjoy it very much. for that reason, it's hard for me to say which episode is my favorite. even so, i must say that cbs really knows how to make a good sitcom. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well-designed, and the writing is always very strong. in conclusion, if this show lives on in syndication after it goes off cbs, i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good.

if you put seinfeld aside, this is the best comedy ever, no doubt! just great!"the king of queens" just finished its eighth season of domestic bliss. set in the working-class suburb of queens, new york, the show follows doug heffernan (kevin james), an amiable delivery man, and his wife, spitfire legal secretary carrie heffernan (leah remini), as they explore the everyday challenges of love, life, family and marriage. doug and carrie deal with day-to-day domestic realities that reflect our times and enable us to laugh at ourselves. their love for each other ultimately carries them through each dilemma they face, whether it's doug's fixation with food or carrie's obsession with expensive clothing. doug and carrie also have to deal with the third, high-maintenance member of the heffernan household ­ carrie's twice-widowed father, arthur spooner (jerry stiller), who lives in their basement. his constant presence and often bizarre behavior add to their daily adventures. doug and carrie have stumbled upon an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and keep arthur happy ­ his regular excursions with gullible dog walker holly (nicole sullivan). doug's friends deacon palmer (victor williams), spence olchin (patton oswalt) and cousin danny heffernan (gary valentine) round out the cast with their "guy" humor and diverse perspectives.in a manner that evokes "the honeymooners," the king of queens finds inspiration in life's everyday situations. last season alone saw doug "loaning" carrie to a wifeless deacon for help with thanksgiving dinner; the heffernans suffering through the annoyance and financial strain of mold damage to their house; and doug and carrie striving to copy a couple whose photos ­ of a more adventurous life than doug and carrie's ­ they accidentally took home. we also watched arthur grow jealous of a new dog that holly added to her route, and doug finding out that his overprotective parents replaced his childhood dog rocky three times behind his back. throughout, the series showcases james' incredible physical comedy, remini's hard-edged wit, and stiller's unique comic presence.you can't... you shoulden't miss it!

i cant believe how many excellent actors can be on one show. it's the realism and fine acting that makes it look real. this has got to be the best comedy ever created to this day and i love seinfeld and everyone loves ramond. it is just fabulous and it seems everyone in my family agrees. thats no isolated opinion of mine. the whole world seems to talk about different incidents and they try to reenact them. my hat off to the crew. some shows have an actor that makes the whole show. this plot comedy has a slew (8) of them . that's what makes it so amazing. some people pray for health , wealth or fame. i pray that the show never ends. sicerely john. lkhubble2@talkamerica.net

this is,in short,the tv comedy series with the best cast ever;and the most likable also.each one of them is a firsthand comedy actor.i know only one tv series which was better (i.e., "moonlighting")that one had willis as a leadyet it had willis only,while the king of queens has a pocketful of actors that are as fine as one can enjoy--kevin james, leah remini, jerry stiller, patton oswalt, nicole sullivan, victor williams, gary valentine,and even all the rest of them .i spontaneously and continually and promptly liked it.advancing age didn't spoil the fun,anyway.in a few words,the series is intelligent and original,miraculously spared of the current tv stupidity and garbage. it is politically incorrect and doesn't court the minorities in the usual disgusting way.the comic is very palatable and savory.i read, mostly approvingly, a few imdb writers, and sometimes they write about their favorite showsyet, though these writers are several, i did not encountered, at any of them, the slightest mention of my favorite tv shows (--but it's true that the critics one likes are not those with whom he finds himself in complete approvalbut those who at least offer a common basis for disapproval)which are, mainly, wild wild west, moonlighting, queens, fantomas, the '80s twilight zone, bradbury's tv show and sandokan. most of them i have seen when i was 1314 yrs; about a few of them i have written, and execrably.

albert finney and tom courtenay are brilliant as sir and his dresser. of course the play is brilliant to begin with and nothing can compare with the immediacy and collegiality of theatre, and i think you listen better in theatre; but on the screen we become more intimate, we're 'up-close' more than we are in the theatre, we witness subtle changes in expression, we "see" better as well as listen. both the play and the movie are wondrous: moving, intelligent, illuminating--of the backstage story of the company, of historical context, of the two main characters, and of the parallel characters in "lear" itself. if you cannot get to see it in a theatre (i don't imagine it's produced much these days) then, please, do yourself a favor, and get the video.

i was half-dozing as i watched a late night selection of short films--but sat bolt upright from the first frames of "i shout love" and could not take my eyes away for its full, brief, perfect length. with incredibly assured pacing and performances, this film maintains its funny/sad/insightful tone throughout. the credits at the end went by so quickly and in such small type, i had to go online to find out the person responsible for this master work. what a pleasing surprise to see the name of sarah polley, a major actress who is too seldom seen.kristen thomsen (tessa) and matthew ferguson (bobby) turn in rich, touching performances as a couple in the throes of breaking up. as they work through a reprise of tessa's favorite moments from their time together, both actors reveal dimensions of their characters and their relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talents--and to the director/writer's skills. the film creates a moving narrative with laugh-out-loud moments and caught-breath sorrow."i shout love" is unquestionably one of the greatest and most memorable short films i ever expect to see. it has wit, heart and stunning originality. it matters.

so real and surreal, all in one. i remember feeling like tessa. heck, i remember being tessa. this was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending. i especially liked the protesters tangent. it is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it. if you get the chance to see this, take it. it is well worth the 30 minutes.

this is a very moving film that takes a new twist on somewhere we've all been: a relationship as it's about to end. kristen thomson's performance as tessa, desperately trying to hold onto her connection with bobby for just one more day, is extremely convincing and moving and takes you right into the story. who hasn't been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully, "just one more night!" when he does give her one more night, the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious every truly close relationship can be, and how each one - whether permanent or not - should be treated with respect, rather than simply thrown away.

in moments of desperation were willing to do whatever it takes to win. i loved how the maple leaves futility was used as a metaphorical basis for bobby and tessa. the acting was accurate by far superior from the hogwash intake given by the film industry.great editing! at the end of the short i felt it was a bit incomplete but so is life and this is were life and art waltz into cinematic masterpiece.excuse me while i rinse off the cheese whiz, but i guess it's acceptable at certain times.two scenes which i must point out are: the bath tub and the couch scene.the couch scene for tessa was a defining moment and 360 of the human condition. throughout the short i viewed her as a brute, but now we see her true reality. her mind spoke before her heart. need i say more about the bath tub scene.

a fantastic cinema experience. i really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out. there is nothing to add, except that is a terrible shame that sir albert finney still isn't accepted by the ampas (american academy). after roles in such films as tom jones, murder on the orient express, under the volcano (to name only few - for these he was nominated for the oscar), the dresser is arguably his highlight, yet...i know, oscars are just popularity contest, but if americans like british actors and actresses ("and the oscar goes to" jeremy irons, daniel day-lewis, anthony hopkins, emma thompson, glenda jackson etc. - and they all deserved the award!), why they always left sir finney with empty hands?on the other hand, they gave it to john wayne and marisa tomei (in cousin vinny). i don't know, should i laugh or cry.if you have seen the two leads in the dresser, you won't forget what is the art of acting. watch this film and enjoy! i recommend it to everyone who loves art.i give 9/10 for this excellent film (1 point missing for non-cinematic material, after all it is "just" a theater)note: my criteria is much stronger than this on imdb (10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that should/could last forever).

at the beginning of this film, which i found myself watching on ifc in the wee hours of the morning, i was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort. the feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that i didn't know if i wanted to continue watching...although it didn't really seem to me that i had much of a choice, so compelling was the situation.gradually, though, that feeling of discomfort waned (although it never really disappeared entirely), and i felt drawn into tessa & bobby's predicaments, and really just hoping against hope that they might get back together.really just a moving, powerful story fit snugly into a tiny package. i had no idea that sarah polley had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia, so now i love it even more.i definitely recommend it. ...if your lucky enough to catch it on the independent film channel sometime, or wily enough to figure out some other way to view it.

excellent and moving story of the end of a uniquely intimate affair. then again, the point of the film, to paraphrase another comment, is that every relationship can be unique and intimate. a truly quality short film which caught me at my busiest, yet had the power to pull me down onto the sofa and watch, fixed and quiet, for the duration. bobby and tessa are powerfully moving characters and anyone who has suffered the end of a love affair will find this film to be a cathartic exercise. beyond that, the 'film within a film' idea plays out very well with this cast and is quite riveting, though in a somewhat melancholic way.

comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years, with mike myers' 'austin powers' and rowan atkinson's 'johnny english', and more recently steve carell in the big-screen version of the hit '60's show 'get smart!'.back in 1974, it was david jason who was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying an attaché case full of documents marked 'classified'.'the top secret life of edgar briggs' was his first starring role in a sitcom, after years of being a supporting actor in such shows as 'six dates with barker', the 'doctor' series, and 'hark at barker'.humphrey barclay had found him working in a pier theatre in bournemouth and was sufficiently impressed to include him alongside michael palin, terry jones and eric idle in the children's comedy show 'do not adjust your set!'.'t.t.s.l.o.e.b' cast jason as 'edgar briggs', a well-meaning but incompetent agent for the secret intelligence service. whereas john steed wore a bowler hat, briggs had a trilby. whereas napoleon solo carried a radio pen, briggs owned a pipe. objects fell to bits in his hands. he read confidential documents in bed while his wife ( barbara angell ) perused woman's own ( on one occasion it would be the other way round ). when he tracked a pair of russian agents to a heliport, he accidentally switched on the airport's tannoy system, and broadcast his plans to capture them! when he hid on a train so as to photograph a meeting between an s.i.s. man and his enemy-contact, it moved off with him aboard and took him straight to brighton! when he tried to organise the defection of a female russian scientist, he took a 'short cut' to elude his pursuers, only to wind up hopelessly lost in a car park. yet, like 'inspector clouseau', he always seemed to come out on top at the end, much to the dismay of his colleagues.as previously mentioned, he was married. his wife jennifer was understanding about the sort of work he did. though they had a row once which resulted in her yelling at him from the window of their high-rise flat: "secret service this, secret service that! you never stop thinking about the secret service!". he shouted back: "think of the neighbours! they're not supposed to know i'm in the secret service!".briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included 'coronation street' villain mark eden ( he was the psychotic alan bradley ) as 'spencer', michael stainton as 'buxton', and 'doctor at sea''s elisabeth counsell as the lovely 'cathy strong'. they answered to 'the commander', played by the late noel coleman. the commander was kidnapped in one episode, leaving briggs temporarily in charge of the s.i.s. - which naturally horrified everyone.this hilarious show was by richard laing and bernard mckenna, who had written for the 'doctor' series. rather than spoof bond, it was more of a send-up of the serious spy shows such as 'callan' ( though it had a bond-style theme tune ). furtive meetings in underground car parks, code-breaking, stolen missile plans, that kind of thing. jason brought a lot of energy to the role, doing a lot of his own stunts, such as briggs falling off a ladder whilst decorating his flat, and tumbling down a hill in a wastepaper bin, and were reminiscent of those to be found in the 'pink panther' films.'briggs' had all the ingredients to be a smash-hit. unfortunately, it was not networked. in the london area, it was put out on sundays at 7.25 p.m. where it was trounced in the ratings by the b.b.c.'s soapy drama 'the brothers'. it was then moved to fridays at 7 p.m. because i.t.v. wanted to showcase its latest american import - the t.v. version of 'planet of the apes'. briggs never found an audience. a similar fate befell jason's next major show: 1976's 'lucky feller'. it was not until 1977 and 'a sharp intake of breath' that he found his first successful solo vehicle.you can see the title sequence ( along with two brief excerpts in german! ) for this series on youtube. unfortunately, that is all you can see. jason will not permit his early starring shows either to be repeated or released on d.v.d. a great shame. for the moment, however, edgar briggs' life will have to remain top secret.coda: i have seen a number of episodes recently and i'm pleased to say it stands up incredibly well.

what more can you ask for? a great screenplay based on one of the finest plays of the latter half of the 20th century, two fine emotional performances by courtney and finney, a realistic vision of war time london, a great supporting cast. this film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster through humour, sadness, loss and fulfillment. if you are in the theatre it is even more effective. this is a true 10 on the rating scale !

this is a classic war movie. one of the best, a stark image fest of flashing lights, harrowing dark backgrounds and helicopter blades morphing into ceiling fans. a star-studded spectacle of immense power.martin sheen is a mercenary sent up river to assassinate the general gone astray, a sadistic dictator played beyond belief by the great marlon brando. also along for the ride are, robert duvall as an over the top di with a penchant for "napalm in the morning" or at least the smell of it. dennis hopper is an edgy photojournalist with a view slanted views about the war and about his leader. also in this amazing film you'll see up and coming stars such as laurence fishburne, r. lee ermey, sam bottoms, albert hall and keep an eye out for harrison ford too...behind the lens is francis ford coppolla delivering a film with maybe more intensity and drama than the acclaimed godfather films, he highlights war in it's most basic form, which for the most part is something you can't see, you can only feel it, as the boat carries on up river the feeling of the war tightening in is quite unbearable. the feeling of this is a rather claustrophobic feeling and really makes for unusual moods from the viewers. honestly no films has ever made me feel like that.criticism is hard to find. the biggest qualm from some is that brando earned tons of money for a ten minute role, but in all fairness this is unjustified. it was money well earned, a role that physically restricted him, being at the time an unwell man, and a role that he really made his own. i can't picture anyone better for the role. and if you get the apocalypse now redux version, there's some extra bits of the great man, and i think the redux does make the film miles better.final impressions are that if you are lucky to get the redux version then you will be blessed with a completely satisfying film with a cool 49 minutes extra footage. if not, then still you won't be disappointed, this film is up there with the best, and deserves some great recognition, and a firm place as one of the top 50 films ever made...

this is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world. the social criticism of our shallow, commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the "war is hell" cliché, underscored by a mythical journey upriver to cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rogue colonel, who's left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. when i saw apocalypse now in 1980, i thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece. in particular, i found the final segment of the journey with brando, which encapsulates conrad's heart of darkness, to be rather boring. i finally got around to seeing apocalypse now redux and the flaws have been taken care of. redux makes the movie an outright masterpiece, certainly among the top 100 films ever made. brando's performance now seems full and complete, perhaps rather less mysterious, but much more profound. martin sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting ensembles ever assembled. it's great to spot a young harrison ford, scott glenn, etc. in early screen performances that suggest what fine actors they will eventually be recognized as. the work of robert duvall, fred forrest, lawrence fishburne and sam bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional footage. if you've never seen this film, skip the original and head straight for redux. i wish we could get a gangs of new york redux from scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece.

with all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on "romeo and juliet"? paul and michelle are models of good behave compared to them.yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. paul is more sexually interested than michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it. the movie does let kids know that sex can cause babies.one thing, there is nudity in the movies. the camera does not focus on it, but it is there.the ending of the movie has paul in good chance of being found out. in "paul and michelle", they separate for a time. if you don't like the ending of a movie, think one up yourself. alternative endings are not just for dvds.

i loved this movie! oh my gosh! this movie rocked so hard! i found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (which btw, mentioned the fact that elton john covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about.), i thought it sounded interesting, and i was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film."what controversy?" i thought to myself as i put the tape in the player, i was curious i get. and my expectations were certainly met. i loved it! i guess it is a really girly kind of movie, but it was so sweet and adorable! it was a beautiful romance, although at times the directing reminded me of the camera work in 'the graduate', which i thought at the time of seeing it the director must have been on acid with some of the close ups they did.ok, so it wasn't entirely conceivable for these two kids to run off and live on their own...but it could happen...in a fantasy...but, the ending just sincerely ticked me off! i was so mad with how they ended it...it sort of leaves you hanging, and i suppose they may address what actually happens to them in the sequel...but at the same time, i'm almost hesitant to see that, since sequels are almost never as good as the first.i totally recommend this movie to anyone sixteen and over! it's an awesome movie...awesome!

'the dresser' is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them. written by ronald harwood (himself a former dresser to the legendary donald wolfit), it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlights.as 'sir', the overbearing actor and main focus of the play, albert finney is a joy to watch - whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the 'blow, winds ...' bit of 'king lear' or chatting to his faithful stage manager, madge (eileen atkins, good as ever) about the old times. as norman, his camp dresser, tom courtenay gives a fabulous performance, wiggling around at the beck and call of 'lear', collecting a bottle to go at the pub, or bitchily disparaging the former fool, mr davenport-scott (often mentioned, but never seen!).in an engaging support cast, there's edward fox as oxenby (a typical arrogant second lead), zena walker as her ladyship, lockwood west as the replacement fool, and many others.this film has great energy, bringing with it some of the greasepaint of its stage origins, it is true, but being so well-acted you don't notice. very well done indeed.

martin ritt seems to be a director who was always interested in social issues (as the son of immigrants, he had every incentive to be so, especially since he was blacklisted in the '50s). "conrack" is based on pat conroy's novel "the water is wide", about his own experience in 1969 teaching a school of impoverished black children about the outside world, much to the chagrin of the right-wing superintendent (hume cronyn). what added to the movie's strength was the cultural and historical context: conroy (jon voight) frustratedly tells another teacher how many of the children don't know about paul newman, sidney poitier, the vietnam war, or even where vietnam is. he proceeds to enlighten them about all these factors.somewhere, i read a complaint that when conroy played music for the children, he only played white music. the truth is, you can't blame the movie for that; it was based on conroy's real experience. either way, the movie's a real gem.

this film launched my theory about films based on books: instead of following the cliche "you've read the book; now see the film," if you are looking for a good book to read, try one upon which a movie you like was based, because it'll be 10 times better.i saw this film on its initial release at the national theater in downtown eugene and liked it so much that i stayed to see it again. it's a perfect merger of the inspiring talents of one of my favorite actors, jon voight, with what became my favorite book, "the water is wide," by pat conroy.i can think of no better movie about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life. two tiny caveats:(1) the video suffers severely from pan-and-scan and deserves a letterbox version. (2) the title should be restored to the name of the book, a reference to one of the most touching, enigmatic songs ever written

all i can say is that each time i see conrack, dir. martin ritt, dp. john alonzo, i feel an utmost sense of inspiration and enlightment in what the power of cinema is possible in such a simple film.the motion picture conrack is set in 1969. it is based on a true story. it is a story about a white man (jon voight) who teaches a group of young black children how incredible the world is outside of their little south carolina island.the story places the job of a teacher as noble cause in changing children's lives.i highly recommend it.

this film had me spellbound this evening. thanks to fox movie classics for showing it uninterrupted. john voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a sunday evening. how wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as paul winfield's excellent portrayal of mad billy. i can't see why anyone would say that hume cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. who would they have chosen? the shrill character actor, charles lane? although his career is laudable, an actor such as lane would have cheapened the role. cronyn was an excellent choice for the part. i will count this film as a true treasure to hold in memory.

an evil land baron is holding up water to a group of ranchers in order to try and take their properties for pennies on the dollar. along comes singin' sandy saunders (john wayne), who saves the day for gabby hayes and his daughter by going undercover as the villain's newest gunman.the first of sixteen films wayne made for lone star/ monogram pictures, this tries to cast him as a singing cowboy, only with an obviously lip-synced voice. the title card prominently features his character as "singin' sandy" leading one to believe that this was meant to be the first in a proposed series!yes it's ridiculous, but also a lot of fun to see wayne singing songs and shooting guns, especially when he does a little ditty before shooting it out with gunman earl dwire.riders of destiny features a rare villainous role for for al "fuzzy" st. john, who clowns around as much with the bad guys as he did playing a heroic sidekick, riding alongside buster crabbe and lash larue.

i just watched the dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago.it's not a "big" movie, and doesn't try to make a big splash, but my god, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.the dresser is the story of sir, an aging shakespearean actor (finney), and his dresser norman (courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii. these are two men, each dependent upon the other: sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of lear. and norman lives his life vicariously through sir; without sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway.this is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. finney, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they're taking their bows! and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. employer is really the wrong term to use, though. for although, technically their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple.yes, there are others in the cast of this movie, but there is no question that the true stars are finney, courtenay, and the marvelous script by ronald harwood. that is not to say that there aren't other fine performances, most notably eileen atkins as the long-suffering stage manager madge. there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been.although it doesn't get talked about these days, it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards: best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay, best picture, best director (peter yates), and best adapted screenplay.i had remembered this as being a good movie, but i wasn't prepared to be as completely mesmerized as i was from beginning to end. if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about, and be hugely entertained all the while, then i encourage you to see the dresser.

there's a unique place in the pantheon of john ford films for wagonmaster, sergeant rutledge, and the sun shines bright. it was these three films with no box office names in them that ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it john wayne, henry fonda, or any of the others he worked with. not surprising that ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. ben johnson and harry carey, jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a mormon wagon train to a valley in arizona territory. along the way they are joined first by a group stranded players from a medicine show and then by a family of outlaws on the run named clegg. their stories merge and what happens is the basis of the film's plot.had wagonmaster been done even 10 years earlier on the strength of the two performances turned in by johnson and carey, both probably would have had substantial careers as b picture cowboys. in the case of johnson it would have been art imitating life. johnson was a real rodeo cowboy and came to hollywood with a string of horses for john ford to use in fort apache. ford was struck by his presence and the rest is history. but the day of the b western was drawing to a close and johnson and carey had great careers as two fine character actors.ward bond plays elder wiggs leader of the mormons. bond is a recent convert though and has trouble remembering to not use some four letter words. but he's the leader because of his strength of character, not his impeccable lds theology. he turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader.in portraying the cleggs, ford only had to reach back four years to his my darling clementine. they are the reincarnation of the clanton gang and pure evil. in fact if walter brennan who after my darling clementine refused to ever work for ford again was willing i could easily see him being cast as shiloh clegg the head of the family. as it was charles kemper did a fine job, this is probably the role he's most noted for. shortly after this film was done, kemper was killed in automobile crash. he might very well have worked for ford in the future.ford makes the mormons pacifists here and i don't recall that pacifism was part of lds doctrine. nevertheless it works here, the whole idea being that these people who carry no weapons are innocents when dealing with evil people like the cleggs. it takes some gun toting cowboys to properly dispose of them. i think that this post world war ii film is trying to say that pacifism isn't always the best policy. another carryover from my darling clementine is alan mowbray playing the same kind of role he did there as head of the medicine show troupe. part of that troupe is joanne dru who's doing another turn as a woman of elastic virtue the same as she did in red river. dru used to do so many westerns that she longed to be out of gingham and into some modern fashions.wagonmaster is great entertainment and i'm willing to wager in the state of utah it's a pretty popular film.

lackawanna blues is a fine stage play by ruben santiago-hudson and an even finer film as the author adapted his own life story for the screen. this brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors, fine music, brilliant editing, superb direction by george c. wolfe, and a cast so stunning that they make an encore viewing compulsory! yes, it is just that good.the story is based on the author's life as the child 'junior' (marcus carl franklin) raised in the inimitable home of soulfully empathetic rachel "nanny" crosby (s. epatha merkerson), a lady who devoted her life to aiding the disenfranchised by transporting them from the south, from mental hospitals, and from the streets to lackawanna, new york. the boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house - odd characters with painful pasts - and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by nanny. the myriad characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business: terrence howard, rosie perez, mos def, the beautiful carmen ejogo, louis gossett jr., jeffrey wright, ernie hudson, charlayne woodward, jimmy smits, patricia wettig, macy gray, liev schreiber, kathleen chalfant, lou myers, hill harper - the list goes on and on.in the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the infectious joy of african american music contributions to our musical culture, and the courage of one fine woman who battled all the hardships the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact. s. epatha merkerson is wholly submerged in this role, a role she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos. she offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years, and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an hbo movie, she without a doubt would add the oscar to place along side her golden globe award.the entire cast is exceptional and wolfe handles the acting and the story like a master: like riffs in a jazz piece, he pastes tiny moments of conversation with each character and junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues, jazz, dancing, and joy. the production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention lag from the momentum of the story. highly recommended, almost compulsory viewing! grady harp

lackawanna blues is a drama through and through. it details the life of a strong woman by the name of rachel crosby (s. epatha merkerson). rachel is referred to as nanny by all who know her, but she could have just as easily been called wonder woman. she epitomized strength, will power, confidence and resolve. she owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject. her tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputee, and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary. each successive event rachel took in stride and handled flawlessly. she wasn't a dictator devoid of compassion, but in fact she was quite the opposite. she displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to over-extend herself.merkerson did a good job, but i believe this role was right up her alley anyway. the movie had an even keel never straying from rachel. there were of course dramatic moments but they were to be expected. nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than rachel herself.

lackawanna blues is a touching story about nanny, a woman who gives all of herself to help those in need. it's told from the viewpoint of a boy, taken in by nanny when his own mother isn't quite up to the task.i have respect for this movie for three main reasons: 1) it is touching, but not sappy. it's told in a very real fashion, without a lot of the aggravating hollywood storytelling baggage. and the ending is quite good (teary but not over-the-top).2) although it's clearly an african-american film, being set in the post-segregation black community of lackawanna, new york, it doesn't wear its ethnicity on its sleeve. the story stands on the strength of the characters and the dramas (and comedies) surrounding their lives. it's not preachy, it's simply good.3) it has a great soundtrack (can't beat old-school r&b and chicago blues).generally the acting is strong, but not universally so. some of the performances simply don't hold up to the characters the actors are supposed to portray. but considering it was a made-for-tv movie, that's to be expected.8 out of 10. imperfect but likable, good film for a rainy day.

kannathil muthamittal was simply one of the most touching and sincere movies ive seen in a long time. the story of an adopted girl who on her 9th birthday learns the truth about her parentage. she sets out in an endeavour to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is now a terrorist.the greatness of the movie lies in its simplicity. mani ratnam generally has a tendency to create unreal and pompous overblown characters in this movie, every person seems real and their interactions are touching and sincere. this is the reason why this ranks as one of his best movies.the movie is emotionally draining and tugs at the heart of the viewer, keerthana as the 9 year old amudha and simran as her adopted mother are simply brilliant. their relationship is the cornerstone of this movie. there are some notable flaws here, particularly the scene where amudha learns that she is an adopted child is jarring and seems totally unreal. it is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would break such a news in the manner that they did. another flaw is, surprisingly enough, the brilliant songs. they again seem forced and stand out, not gelling with the rest of the script.having said these, this still is one of the most poignant and beautiful movies to come out of india in a long long time. this beauty is not just in the script or characters but in teh technical brilliance as well, ravi chandran's camera work is sheer poetry. all characters perform creditably and the realistic humour, especially in teh flashback scenes are entertaining.a sincere 9!!

in sri lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-sinhalese government and the liberation tigers of tamil eelam (ltte), a separatist organization, has claimed an estimated 68,000 lives since 1983. human rights groups have said that, as a result of the war, more than one million people have been displaced, homeless or living in camps. the impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed tamil director mani ratnam in his 2002 film a peck on the cheek, winner of several awards at the national film awards in india. while the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girl's voyage of discovery, the human cost of war is made quite clear and ratnam gives the fighting a universal context, pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoing.beautifully photographed in southern india by cinematographer ravi k chandran in a setting mirroring the terrain of sri lanka, the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9-year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in sri lanka. played with deep feeling and expressiveness by p.s. keerthana in a memorable performance, amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents shyama (nandita das) and dileepan (j.d. chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out, leaving her in a red cross camp. in a loving flashback, we see amudha's adoptive parents, father thiru (madhavan) a prominent tamil writer, and mother indra (simran) a tv personality, marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker-skinned little girl.young amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday, according to the parents' prior agreement. while she is playing, thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that "you are not our daughter" and the response is predictable. distraught, she questions who her father was, what her mother's name was, why she gave her up, and so forth but few answers are forthcoming. amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to sri lanka to help her find her true mother, now a fighter for the tamil separatists. the family's immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions, handled mostly with skill by ratnam, though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurish.a peck on the cheek is of course a bollywood-style film and that means tons of music and melodrama. the melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors; however, i found the musical dramatizations of songs by a. r. rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick, high production techniques and fast-paced music video-style editing. yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the film's limitations. tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even within the country as being too clichéd and commercial, yet a peck on the cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues. that it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute.

i am a big follower of indian movies especially malayalam and tamil.shame on india for not sending this movie as their official oscar entry. i have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up with.by the way to all we westerners, tamil cinema is more qualitative and very different from bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion.coming to the point what was india thinking when they sent a movie like 'devdas' to the oscars? that was a really a masochist move. i think they are trying to punish oscar judges with boredom by sending devdas since the judges toppled lagaan last year.'devdas' is just a brigthly colored but stale and predictable melodrama of love, fate and destiny. i would keep away from it. anyway, not sending a movie like kanathil muthital shows how much of a revamp indian administration needs to save them from poor administrators who lack intelligence. now i know why this country has so many issues. they are heavily talented but not showcased properly.

sri lanka... not a country i've ever given much thought to, i have to admit. i didn't even know it was near india, let alone that there has been a bloody civil war going on there since 1983. it seems that the rebels of the tamil minority have been in an ongoing conflict with the military regime that runs the country for many years, causing many deaths and widespread suffering on the island.mani ratman's latest film, a peck on the cheek, tells the story of a young girl named amudha, who is separated from her sri lankan parents by the war and raised by a young indian couple. amudha is a bright and mischievous girl, whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child. although her adopted parents love her as much as could be, and have raised her without prejudice along with their biological children, amudha cannot help but want to learn more about her biological family.mani ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film dil se, which hides a story about terrorism and politics inside a love story (or is it the other way around?). a peck on the cheek inhabits similar territory, but is perhaps more ambitious in the ground it covers. the central theme that binds the movie is of love between all the various members of a family, and especially that between a child and her adopted parents. it's a pretty honest and open look at feelings, that can be extremely touching and heartwarming at some times and quite painful at others. it's an emotionally complex film, with characters that are somewhat idealised but still behave in a very human way.the film revolves around 9 year old amudha, played with charm and vivaciousness by young actress p.s. keerthana in her first and only acting role. she's a princess and a monster, always getting into trouble but so disarmingly charming nobody can stay mad at her for long. the young actress is perfectly cast for the role, and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of her.a peck on the cheek has such an innocent name i was quite unprepared for the intensity of the experience. never has such a small act come with such an enormous emotional impact, i dare say. the film is a bold and artistic effort to explore issues that are not frequently covered on the silver screen.mani ratman's direction is superb, very confident and mature - the most sophisticated work i've seen from this director yet. the film is visually very stylish, with some excellent camerawork and imagery. a.r. rahman provides the film's soundtrack, which is not as good as his classic dil se or bombay music (based on first impressions at least) but still shows his great musical talent.i'm not aware of a dvd release for the film yet - i saw it in tamil with english subtitles thanks to the san francisco international film festival, of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight. the production is a truly world class effort, and i am sure it will be popular with western audiences as it begins to receive wider exposure.recommended.

i saw this film at the 2002 toronto international film festival.this is the first indian film i've seen in the tamil language, and while it does share some similarities with other indian films (wonderful music and choreography, sweeping storyline), the director attempts more than just to entertain. the film tells the story of amudha, a precocious nine-year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted, thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from india to war-torn sri lanka. gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point, though it is a simplistic one. amudha is played by p.s. keerthana, and she is one of the few child actors i've seen who can be precocious and yet not annoying. her charm and beauty held the film together.

reanhauer (bill roy) is the leader of a desert-dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people, only to have a heart attack himself! he ends up dying on an operating table, and for the sake of revenge, his spirit takes over the body of the title character (jill jacobson), who then proceeds to go about hacking and slashing until her fellow nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demon.while i know enough about the directors' filmography to know that it primarily consists of outright schlock, "nurse sherri" is really not all that bad. sure, it's clear that this was very low-budget stuff, yet all that i found egregiously cheesy about it were the visual effects. the acting is not as bad as one might expect, either.there are two different versions available of this on dvd. a much more sex-oriented version featuring bountiful amounts of t & a is the original cut, with such hilariously silly vignettes as the victim and and her love interest sharing their "strangest sex" moments, including one involving fellatio during a college lecture!the movie would then be re-cut for theatrical version with the horror elements emphasized more strongly. some scenes are dropped with new ones added (with stevens, the role played by j.c. wells, expanded). the movies' most memorable sequence in this cut is a scene in a foundry, and it works quite well. this cut of the movie is more interesting overall; i would recommend that a viewer see them both and compare them.both versions hit their stride in the final third, and benefit from a marvelously scene-stealing performance from bill roy as the crazed reanhauer, and a moody climax set in a graveyard (although actually filmed in adamsons' backyard!). marilyn joi is also worth mentioning as the cute nurse who is attracted to football player turned patient marcus washington (prentiss moulden), who's lost his eyes in a car accident, and who incidentally is key to resolving the story with his knowledge of voodoo rituals. the movie also makes amusing use of music from composer harry lubins' personal collection, including compositions for such tv series as 'one step beyond' and 'the outer limits'."nurse sherri" (known by more alternate titles (including "beyond the living" and "hospital of terror") than any other adamson movie) is actually fairly entertaining low-budget fare. i ended up having a good time watching it.7/10

''meet sherri..for an evening of pleasure and terror!'' cheap special effects,cheesy lines,yep its the original 1978 movie ''nurse sherri'' starting geoffrey land as peter desmond,and jill jacobson as sherri martin and directed by al adamson.the movie is about an evil ancient spirit that possesses a nurse at a hospital,then she starts killing doctors one by one.the acting was okay but some of the acting was robotic.the storyline was good but the sex scenes were just thrown in there probably to get more views.the directing was bad,and the special effects looked like a drawing,the effects didn't fool anybody.the death scenes were pretty good but the director mixed too many things in there that didn't make any sense like the sex scenes,the nudity,the football player,and many more.overall its a good movie,but not the best.7 out of 10

i love just about everything the late al adamson directed in his long and varied career, but "the possession of nurse sherri" stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade-z schlockfests like "horror of the blood monsters" and "dracula vs. frankenstein". this film is actually scary! am i saying that you're going to jump out of your seat when you watch "nurse sherri"? no, of course not. but this pastiche of elements from "the exorcist", "ruby", and "carrie" is one of those nice, eerie little horror movies common to the seventies. you can't put your finger on what's so spooky about it, but the film drips with atmosphere. (and what an ending! don't worry, i won't spoil it for you.) adamson and producer sam sherman really nailed it with this one, and it doesn't matter whether "nurse sherri" was a calculated success or a happy accident. jill jacobson is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader (bill roy, who shines in his brief role). geoffrey land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend. there are some blaxploitative elements here (profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive-in flicks, after all) but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing. "nurse sherri" was a poverty row production, and it shows at times (sets, special effects, etc.). still, the film has heart, mostly decent acting and direction, and some genuine chills. sam sherman also saw fit to use harry lubin's theme music for the late '50s/early '60s television series "one step beyond" in this film, which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere. the dvd contains two significantly different cuts of the movie (the early version features a lot of t&a that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff) as well as the theatrical trailer, the tv spot, and a great commentary by sherman. does anybody know whatever happened to bill roy, by the way? next to john carradine, he's the best actor i've ever seen in an al adamson film, and he plays the cult leader like he means it.

what exactly do people expect when they watch an al adamson film? are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories? you'd think so by some of the reviews. al adamson's films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy, not much more, so if you go into them knowing that already it helps, and they aren't necessarily to be taken at face value, especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value. first off, this starts by ripping off the end theme music from outer limits, so you know things are looking promising. this is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body, the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital. of course nurse sherri tends to his needs and all, and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her. and nurse sherri begins to change. no longer the nice nurse, she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects. there's a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of sherri's co-workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo. this is not bad if you're a cult film fan, but it may be bad if you're a "spiderman" fan because you won't like it. at times this actually lurches towards "respectability" (for adamson, anyway) but then it "unredeems: itself with some ridiculous event. if you enjoy adamson's films and similar trash you may well like this, for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure, keep digging. 7 out of 10.

this is one of those games where you love it to bits or hate it to shreds.even being a hardcore mario fan can make you dislike this game.you can hate it because it is 2 short and somewhat boring and easy.or you can love it because it is a mixture of amazing graphics(not a nintendo fan huge excitement) music or game play.i know a lot of people that say it is amazing,and others who think its the worst mario ever.it really depends on the type of nintendo fan you are.i personally love this game and i think it is the best wii game,but you should determine that for yourself.so i think you should absolutely get it if you are the right nintendo fan.but if you love the classics too much,you may not like it.so try it out yourself.

every once in a while a film comes along with characters we all know and love. a film where you see people you know portrayed on screen. it's cinema very at its best.lackawanna blues is that film. set in 1960s upstate new york, the story surrounds a rock- solid woman, who is the foundation for her community. this, based on a true story film, is told from a child she accepted as her own. this child, ruben santiago-hudson wrote the screenplay.*emmy winner, s. epatha merkerson stars as nanny, a woman who has wit, drive and determination for helping others in her boarding home. she does this as she wrestles with infidelity from her young lover, bill crosby, played by the **oscar nominated terrence howard. but make no mistake; see this film for the amazing performance of merkerson, who is brilliant in this role. she encompasses a person we have all known, and perhaps love.lackawanna blues is already on dvd; be sure to pick it up at your local video story today.*merkerson has already won an emmy, golden globe and screen actors guild for this role.**howard has an oscar nomination for his role in hustle & flow.

ever since 1981, nintendo has been making great video games such as super mario and zelda. most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years. games made by nintendo never seem to get boring because they're always adding something new. it went from arcade games to the wii and i hear that there's a new version of the wii scheduled for release in 2011. the thing that makes wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons. and i have more good news. super mario galaxy 2 is to be released in 2010.

(warning: may contain spoilers) let rosalina help mario lead the way and smile because this game will brighten your day. 120 stars will require luck and skill, but 60 will bring you as much of a thrill!blasting through stars show mario and luigi and what travelers they now are! walking upside down has never been more fun, especially a final battle with koopa near the sun! this is truly a super awesome game and it absolutely deserves a place in nintendo's hall of fame!

like some other people wrote, i'm a die-hard mario fan, and i loved this game. this game starts slightly boring, but trust me, it's worth it. as soon as you start, your hooked! the levels are fun and exiting. they will hook you 'till your mind turns to mush. i'm not kidding. this game is also orchestrated, and is beautifully done. to keep this spoiler free, i have to keep my mouth shut about details. but please try this game! it'll be worth it!story: 9.9 action: 10.1 (it's that good!) hardness: 10 attention grabber: 10 average: 10

the mario series is back, and in my opinion, better than ever. galaxy is the most creative mario yet; even more so than super mario 64. the controls are great; some of the best for the wii. beautiful graphical design as well. the levels are very big, and the good old bosses are back. there is tons to explore in this game; definitely a high level of replay value. i only have 2 complaints: 1: the story is a little to similar to mario 64. and 2: the difficulty isn't very high; though it does require some patience. mario fans: the game you've been waiting for. casual gamers: this game is more than worth the buy. 9.8 out of 10.

*this comment will probably have spoilers!! i checked the spoilers box just in case but it might not have spoilers, but be aware anyways if i say something that you might consider a spoiler and i don't!* wow...best game since super mario 64. i got this game the first day it came out, and before i got it, i went on some gaming websites to look at its ratings (yes, they already reviewed it before it came out), and i was shocked. i was expecting something like sunshine because lately all the mario games have kind of been getting worse and worse. but this one totally beat the other games. the scores on this game even beat halo 3! it's simply amazing.story: not the best, mario games are never known for their plots, and this one isn't really much of a difference. bowser once again kidnaps peach but this time invades the mushroom kingdom on a festival celebrated once every century and gets a flying saucer and it shoots lasers on the ground and then they put anchors inside the ground and rip off the castle and its foundation into outer space.graphics: absolutely gorgeous, the best graphics on wii so far. the water effects are really nice too, if you ever see the water, it looks so real because the effects they put in it.music: simply amazing, the music in this game is orchestrated. not all of it, but even the ones that aren't orchestrated still sound very nice.gameplay: very entertaining, keeps you wanting to play more and more, and for me, since usually i tend to be very frustrated with games if i die a lot, i mean, i'm definitely not the only one, but this game for me didn't have that a lot. now it still kind of did, but not to the point like mario 64 where i totally go crazy and end up turning off the game because it made me mad, this one never did that.difficulty: there are two types of difficulty, because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 stars, which i think is kind of easy, but to beat the game 100%, you have to get 120, like always, and that quest is way harder, but at the same time still very fun.length: good length, definitely not too short. it took me around 15-16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars, but 120 took me more like 45-50 hours. now i didn't play it constantly that much, i played first a lot one day, then the next couple of days just a couple hours each day, then the next two days i played it all day. to me though, i think the quest for 60 stars was a tiny bit short, so if you want a long game, i suggest getting all of them.presentation: now, the cinematic scenes in this movie are superb. the way they are, it just looks so much like something i would see in the theaters. they are hands down the best cinematic scenes on any mario game so far.overall: this game is definitely a great game, and i advise you to not wait until christmas, get it as soon as possible. this game also is a good mixture of old and new, you'll have some sidescroller levels where you move just side to side, or up and down because they'll change on gravity, but even the music has some old classics in it. so this game seems to be like a masterpiece. to me, it's my favorite mario game of all time, but others may disagree. but it's still a great game. i recommend every gamer who wants to have fun in a game to get this.

i have been a mario fan for as long as i can remember, i have very fond memories of playing super mario world as a kid, this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new. super mario galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing mario franchise. there is much very different about this game from any other mario before it, while still keeping intact the greatest elements of mario, the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space.the story begins much like any other mario game, mario receives a letter from princess peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the mushroom kingdom. upon arriving at peach's castle mario finds bowser and his son (bowser jr.) attacking the castle with their airships. bowser kidnaps princess peach and then lifts her castle up into space. in the midst of the castle being lifted into space mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet. mario is found by a talking star named luma and is taken back to the luma's home, a floating space station, here mario meets many other lumas and also meets their leader, a woman named rosalina. rosalina tells mario that bowser has taken away the space station's power stars and scattered them across the universe, it is up to mario to help the lumas find them and save peach, thus the adventure begins.the way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies, each galaxy consists of multiple planets that mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the power stars. mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others are big, many planets are similar to classic mario environments. the best thing about the game are the controls, all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same, but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. you shake the remote mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game, and it will as well activate the shooting stars. you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment. then there is the graphics, these are by far the best graphics on the wii, it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks, you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games.my only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to, and also the story is pretty weak. the worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game, no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives. still these minor problems aside it's a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging. this is the type of game that we've been waiting for on the wii.a perfect 10 out of 10!

i saw what i believe to be the best australian film of the year so far, jon hewitt's acolytes.acolytes is a stylish thriller with a killer premise. get thistwo bullied and molested teens discover a local serial killer in their suburb and then set about blackmailing him to kill the bully who molested them. hewitt has picked a top notch cast including excellent new comers sebastian gregory, josua payne and hanna mangan lawrence to play the teens. add to that three, yes, thats right three great psycho's! lead by joel edgerton in an outstanding performance of serial killer du jour, belinda mcclory his deranged spouse and michael dorman as the teen raping bully, with swastika tattoos. once you add these teens and these menacing adults, all hell breaks loose hewitt has crafted a balls to the wall serial thriller thats damn original and accomplished. you can see the influence of larry clark and david lynch's twin peaks but hewitt makes it all his own, in a qld suburban back water, always ringing with the drones of emptiness. the script by shayne armstong, shane krouse and hewitt is tight.if marketed correctly this film could be a break out hit with teens. the next wolf creek? it could well be. it makes all the right moves. the teens are real ala larry clark. they don't suck and have an attached pc agenda, they are non communicative, good looking and hip. the killers are dark with real menace. joel edgerton steals his scenes as the mild mannered local ted bundy, who sports a butterfly on his 4wd spare ala john fowles the collector. dorman's petrol head rapist pours on the menace that tops suburban mayhem and provides a creepy thug who you can't wait to see buy the farm.the film is fast paced, tough and brutal. not only that, it displays a confidence and directorial mastery from hewitt that is surely to win him an if or afi nomination, if not award! its nuanced and poetic mise en scene, brilliant sound design, excellent cinematography and tight structure mark it as clearly one of the best directed oz features i have seen so far this year.the film leaves you shaken, thinking and unsettled. its a truly great edition to the return to genre going on in australian cinema at present. it will surely garner the interest of hollywood. oh, and did i mention it got into toronto? what other oz feature films can say that much? the world should get ready for a new auteur, jon hewitt.

i would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment. i watched this not expecting too much from it. the fact is that the cast were superb, especially the lead teen female. the dark sides of them all came through, all were messed up in an not obvious way. there was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality. the serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children. what this movie is, is a strong drama/thriller. yes i would agree they don't do the obvious, but you could relate with the messed up teenage heads they did what they did and it is believable. also a decent dark ending, instead of which could have so easily been an opt out happy one. the attention to detail in the movie was fantastic also. i very good solid 7 out of 10. a little slow at times, but lets a thinking person see where the characters are coming from.

one of the intriguing aspects of this historical drama is the way the "tories" or british american loyalists are portrayed, and the sort of gloss given to their ardent support for king george iii. in many ways the american revolution was definitely a family affair, in that some of the wealthier colonial families were split asunder by it. if there is a strong criticism to be made of this film, it is that perhaps the people in this story are made out to be a little bit nicer than they were in real life.in some regards, the actions of the character of major boulton, played by cornel wilde, make him the least likable member of the cast and the flaw in the storyline. he seems to vary from being a prickly kind of patriot to being a kind of 'anything for the cause,' fellow. this film does concentrate heavily on the notions of personal honor and personal prestige which were a major social 'norm' in that day and age.in its subtext, the fact that about twenty-five percent of the colonial population was decidedly pro-british is glossed over, too. but the strength of the tory element is not obviously maligned, although the good doctor character is about eighty-five percent upper class twit ( to steal a fine phrase from monty python's flying circus ). anne francis does a whole lot with a rather thin section of the script, and it stands out. she was a good choice for the woman of divided loyalties, a 'gal' who was rather more modern than the social conventions of that day might have allowed -- if there had not been a life and death struggle going on.one good aspect of the film is the way the rivalries of the american revolutionary leaders degenerated into outright jealousies, and how these personal conflicts very nearly sabotaged the entire revolutionary effort. all in all, the leading characters are very well drawn, the minor characters are not just human "props" and the fight scenes are believable enough to carry the dramatic action.this is a great spy movie. it's not quite a great historical drama, but it does satisfy well enough. it rates a seven largely because cornel wilde is so deeply immersed in his role, and does it so well, and because anne francis makes the most of her supporting effort.the color print used on turner classic movies was very clear, as well, and so it was an enjoyable presentation in that important regard.hope it runs again soon.

scarlet coat like most revolution flicks wasnt well received but is nears perfection in the art of movie making. a great character study of john andre the heroic redcoat who is revered by both friend and foe for courage,,, scarlett coat also probes the duality of the undercover agent ,,, as a counterfeit traitor maj bolton befriends andre and undertakes a high level penetration of british intelligence yet he defends andre in andre's courtmartial ... the film captures the moral ambiguity of the spyhow much of the spy's world is real ,,, which reality does he belong to the reality of his mision or the reality which the cover story createsandre's capture and courtmartial is a success for bolton in his mission beyond that whch wahington would have ever demanded ,,, the mission was merely to identify the traitor in us ranks ,,, bolton has knocked out enemy intelligence as well ,,, yet bolton mourns the death of the man he was sent to destroyann francis plays a stock american character,,, compliant with the british but willing to engage them in a war of witsa movie well worth revisiting

i can't get this flick off my brain. it's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. i've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way blindspot did. there is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. it's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave. i guess some politically correctos won't appreciate the vibe (don't bring your grandma) but it is totally awesome. the thing that's best is the kaliedescope style. there is some really serious stuff mixed with super interesting footage of the road. the movie really makes you sad and scared in parts but it also spins your head with what is happening and the way it is filmed. wtf is up with the world? sooo many critics are raving about all these supposedly revolutionary ground-breaking films and when you see them they're boring and predictable and not-all-that. i don't get it because there are a lot of other better choices. blind spot is really kinda great because it gives you thrills and chills and major upcoming star power but does it in a way that is completely fresh and definitely totally rad.

it reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. a brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. the landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. the stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. the drama is compelling. james franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances. naive schoolboy, suicidal blonde, embittered car thief -- all converge with unexpected twists. together they create an explosive portrait of fractured love -- one that unwittingly conspires to mend amidst the hardest forms of adversity and illusion -- the blindness of human emotion.

blind spot's images are great. the action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. by the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. the lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. the story is heart-wrenching. the film score is nicely understated . completely moving in its own powerful way. not your standard melodramatic cuing. trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. hope you get a chance to see this film. it delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.

james franco is totally cool in this movie. not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. at the tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole james dean thing but i don't think this true. blind spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. in this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. it's a unique performance. bittersweet and really moving. the lines from his journal cut you like a knife. you sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words. the tone is everything. he carries it through the action and suspense as well as the grim bits of gallows humor. i like the other two actors a great deal too. the blonde girl is totally gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his twisted tough guy stoicism. some of the thugs seemed a little sketchy but this is a mini-point really. the film is totally solid and franco is way cool all around.

when i saw this film at a festival years ago i was very impressed and i started to looking for it. nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on dvd neither on blue ray. absolutely nothing!!! how it's possible this could really happen??? the direction is impeccable, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and james franco is hot as hell!!!please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!! this is really a very great movie that people should see and it deserve another chance!!!!!! edvard

i recently saw blind spot in coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. i really admired the story and visual approach. the action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. there is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. not just in the desert but in the city too. my best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. you really feel for this guy. i never heard of the actors before but i liked all three very much. i think they did a terrific job on their journey to self-discovery. all in all, this is an amazingly cool and suspenseful suspenseful film. i still carry many of the images in my mind.

i really enjoyed this film. i'm not usually one for fairy tales or make believe storeys but this film captured my attention.i first saw this film on the uk channel hallmark...which usually shows afew tacky films...but then snow queen came along...and i was loving it! i really really admire bridget fonda in this movie...she plays the snow queen brilliantly and glamorously.i won't explain what the story is about as other people have already done so, so there is no point repeating.i would just suggest that if you want to watch a fun fairy tale journey...get this film...but if you want to purchase it and you live in the uk, you might have a hard time. i've bought it from south korea brand new (english edition of course).

this is a wonderful movie, and i still love it! it just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! i recommend it to people of all ages. i promise you will not be disappointed! the characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! the story of gerda and kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.i don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, i mean the movie was amazing! i haven't even read the book, and guess what? i don't care. in fact, if the movie and book are so different, then you can just call them two separate stories and be happy with it.i thought the acting was bloody brilliant! bridget fonda plays the snow queen, so evil, and so cold - you just have to hate her. chelsea hobbs plays gerda, a love-struck girl who is determined to find her love no matter what it takes, and goes on a wonderful adventure. and i just love all of the snow queen's sisters (the spring witch, the summer princess, and autumn robber)they are so fun and different in many ways.i haven't seen this movie in awhile, so forgive me if i make a minor mistake.... but there's no doubt that i will always love this movie.

i know the girl who did the figure skating for the lead girl. she once dated my brother and she was always really nice! i also live in cranbrook b.c, about 15 or so minutes from fort steele. haha i used to go there for field trips when i was in elementary school. it was kinda weird seeing it in the movie. i also had the chance when the movie was filming to be an extra because there was a casting call for them at the mall.but i didn't feel like going to it at the time because i wasn't interested in acting. now i totally wish i did. this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay. it never came out here, (which is kind of weird seeing it was partially filmed here) so i was excited when it came. i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.but if anyone has a question about fort steele, just ask away:)

first off, i can remember vaguely being told this story in primary school, about 6 or 7 years ago so i am sort of familiar with the story.a lot of that has changed however, and there are many differences and mistakes (sometimes unnecessary) in the film that die hard fans will not appreciate.however as a whole i really love this film. i first saw it near christmas about 2 years ago (well the 1st part) then caught the whole thing again last christmas probably on the same channel.i was very impressed, at times it may be a bit overdrawn and long, but with an engaging story, decent acting (especially from frosty fonda and hobbs) and beautiful scenery, costume and little touches of magic make this a really special film - which for me really reminds me of christmas.despite differences from the book, i think the film does well to incorporate new themes and ideas (the seasons with autumn, winter etc. with i think a new thief character to represent autumn) throughout the imagery once you notice is quite startling and brilliantly executed.i live in the uk so have waited a long time for the dvd, and luckily enough i saw an advert showing a series of free dvd's being offered in the daily mail newspaper which i don't normally get, so i got yesterdays issue and finally have my dvd. if you missed it and want this rare dvd for region 2 i suggest you collect the tokens from the daily mail and send them off as your dvd will then be delivered by christmas.so for a bit of escape into the christmas season this year, put on your fire, get cosy and watch this as you and kids probably will really enjoy this great film. if you don't have it, it will probably be repeated on channel 4 this christmas, so record it!

enchanting. the best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. it's all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the queen in secret and gets her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of gerda and kai gave. it's music is also very nice. the two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he'll see the snow queen is not so bad. she only tries to surround herself with love in the wrong way. the evening this movie was on here (first part) i only watched it, because i was bored, but i loved it a lot more after and was very angry, when they didn't show the next part because of the pope's funeral... yeah, that was terribly sad for me. but when they said it will be on next week, i was so happy, that i recorded it and now i'm glad to have done so.

i thought the movie started out a bit slow and disjointed for the first hour. however, it became more absorbing, fascinating, and surprising in its last two hours. so, while it starts out like a cheap horror film, it evolves into a beautiful and wonderful fantasy film.bridget fonda stands out as the snow queen. this was her best performance and it is sad that this apparently was her last performance, as she has not acted in the last 7 years. she absolutely personifies both the beauty and coldness of winter.my daughter, age 14, found the film a bit frightening, so if you are showing it as family entertainment, please stay with your child and reassure her or him that it is just a fairy tale fantasy and not to take it too seriously.it is really one of the best fantasy films that i have seen in a long time, slightly better than "eragon" or any of the "lord of the rings." it is about as good as "the golden compass".

people comparing this movie to big blockbusters like lord of the rings or the matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. the acting talent, although not a-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an a-list cast. my particular favourite from this movie is bridget fonda, whose performance as the snow queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup. she injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season corrupted by the devil's evil magic. fonda aside the acting was not what we have come to expect from hollywood, which i think is a good thing since hollywood seems to have run out of ideas on how to train its acting talent to portray roles and so they have become stale and reliant on cgi and other special effects to take us away from the actors who all use the same tricks on us. instead it shows new ideas some real thinking on the part of the actors about how they can find new variations on the the old themes of love and danger.

i caught this on local mexican television at 2:00 a.m. and i decided to give it a chance since it's based on a real life case that deals with the murder of the typical all american family (a dad, a mom, and a young son).on the beginning the hints point to walker to be the murderer as he had strong differences with his father. shortly after, when walker and luke are taken to the sheriff's dept. to being examined by the lies detection machine, things turn out to be very different...also, when walker and luke attend to an appointment with their father's lawyer, they learn that luke would receive $200,000 and walker is out of the heresy. luke immediately buys a convertible.anyways, this is an excellent mystery movie that deals with betrayal, ambition, feelings, and cold , very cold blood.i know the real names were changed but still the experience is the same. give this movie a try. i know there are hundreds of "based on real murders" or events of the like, but this one is truly worthy. pure quality on acting, direction, and plot.

i thought the movie was good, but i like to read the real story behind the "based on a true story" movies. does anyone know the names and locations of the real characters the movie is based on? i have done a complete internet search and cannot find any information on this case. all i get is the movie information and the fact that it is based on a "true story." i find it hard to believe that a judge would change his sentence rendered immediately in the courtroom, even after such a heartfelt speech by the brother (gorgeous john corbett), but overall the story was very gripping. anyway, if anyone knows the real "real story", i would appreciate you sharing it!

i don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while i did. i got so engrossed i gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. and i sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but i was crying at the end. a lot of emotional nuance. great acting, and good southern feel. john corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played luke was really good too. highly recommend.

tv churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. you can see 3 or 4 every saturday on lifetime, and court tv can be relied on for a few every weekend. so i started watching the morrison murders thinking i knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. what i got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.both the brothers were totally convincing, and jonathan scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of luke. the look and feel of georgia was in almost every frame. if i had any complaint, it was gordon clapp as the sheriff. he just doesn't look or act like a small-town southern lawman named byron calhoun. he looks and sounds like medavoy, and medavoy is not right for this part.but this is a minor quibble: the morrison murders is well worth watching, and not just on a rainy saturday afternoon. if you're going out, tape it. you won't regret it.

like some people here, i love/loved stingers! in norway it got aired a lot later. that also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) i have to say that i really love stingers! it can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. i think i'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. stingers might be the on series(except from grey's anatomy) that i really watch! the actors are amazing! especially jacinta stapleton! personallly i think she is one of the best access we have! i know he is not like super-known, but she is really a great actress! stingers makes me want to be a cop! i love it!p.s: do you know if you can buy the episodes?

like a few people i know, i came in late on 'stingers'; not until 2000. three years later there is no way i'd miss an episode. the show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'blue heelers', for example. the crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! when gary sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me. gary could measure up to any british or us actor in a similar series. the cast changes occasionally but each change brings something new and fresh. with arguably australia's finest crew behind the scenes, 'stingers' will continue to remain a cutting edge drama series.

why take a perfectly good original drama, based on a perfectly good novel, and remake it as a quasi-musical? and cast it with actors exclusively lacking in singing or dancing talent? somewhat akin to "showgirls" or the two most recent "star wars" films, "lost horizon" is full of unintentional laughs. who can forget sir john gielgud smiling uneasily in his dali lhama outfit, overseeing an interpretive dance to the republican party ("family")?or sally kellerman warbling lovingly to george kennedy, doing her best cher impression as she hops from one rock to another ("every little thing you do")? and my favourite, bobby van embodying the strength of america's education system ("question me an answer")? i can't wait for the dvd release, as hopefully it will contain comments by liv ullmann, who will finally explain what she was thinking when she agreed to do this film!

i've seen the 1973 movie lost horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. i agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, i was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. i watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what i got. you can be critical of the acting the singing, and dialog but that't not what i look for when i go to a movie. i look for a little release from my daily life, a little time where i can sit back and imagine a better life, where people love another and help another. it's a shame we can't we enjoy a movie for what it tells us and quit picking it apart like an english teacher reading a fifth grade essay. this may be very simplistic, but really, wouldn't it be nice.

the movie is excellent. acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. it seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring ronald coleman. that movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. from talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, i believe the impact was something akin to the first "starwars" movie in modern times. i have seen it. it was and is wonderful. but that does not mean that this version is not also worthy. from the first scene the 1973 version grabs you. the noise and tumult are fantastic, especially in they way they prepare you for the peace of shangri la. and burt bacharach's music is beautiful. so - by all means enjoy the 1937 version. but do not let it detract from your enjoyment of this 1973 version any more than you would let the 1935 king kong destroy peter jackson's of this year.

i recently purchased lost horizon on ebay, having vivid memories of the things i will not miss number from childhood (i am an ancient 29). i also recently finished the novel upon which it is based. i was so pleasantly surprised to find a genuine hidden treasure. a wonderful cast brings such warmth and depth to a beautifully simple and elegantly told story, subtly updated from the original film (and by now quite a separate entity to the far more intellectual and thought provoking book by james hilton). sally kellerman in particular has a radiant presence as the suicidal neurotic sally hughes, who gradually warms to the charms of shangri-la. only liv ullmann flounders in her wooden portrayal of the schoolteacher (a role far more suited to a julie andrews type. the fact that finch, ullmann and hussey are all dubbed isn't important as it is almost impossible to tell. the songs do vary in quality, the music being far superior to the lyrics but it is still a vibrant and engrossing film that really deserves a proper dvd release and a lot more recognition.

i have to offset all the terrible comments. i love this movie. i own the movie and the soundtrack. i watch it whenever i need a pick me up. granted it's not like the sound of music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. i adored the late (and great) bobby vann, and james shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. i saw this when it first came out in the theaters. i'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than twiggy in "the boyfriend". it's a modern musical and shouldn't be judged by all that went before. it's just the best for dreamers like me, who wish they could find this place - no illness, no wars, no drugs, all the bad things in life are gone. this is nothing more than a feel good movie. that is what all movies should be about. shaun phillips title song is superb and explains the entire feel of the movie. if the acting isn't the greatest-who cares. i love the idea of the movie. peter finch, a very stiff actor, liv ullmann, gorgeous as ever, sally kellerman, surprisingly good voice, michael york, typical, and olivia hussey, stunning, all convinced me they were normal run of the mill people. not one of them acted like actors in a movie. they acted like real people, the same way i would act if i found this place. torn between going home and staying there, in awe of everything. yes, there are flaws in this movie, but get over it, it's not citizen kane, it's a feel good musical!

the 1973 musical version of lost horizon is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of all time. the 1973 musical remake of the james hilton novel about mythical shangri-la! is a real special gem. music by burt bacharach and lyrics by hal david. a strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. it has the distinction of being the only anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. this film was a critical and financial disappointment in the united states, but made a lot of money overseas. only in america did it fail. highly different and unique in it's approach as a film musical, it deserves far better credit than it's given. as a story, lost horizon is an incredible adventure and both the 1937 frank capra film and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of the james hilton novel. what i like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented. the film has a prestigious cast and a gifted director and cinematographer. this is a burt bacharach shangri-la and it's a wonderful place. songs like the world is a circle, share the joy and living together, growing together evoke a happiness that hilton wrote about in his novel. why shouldn't shangri-la be a slightly goofy place? the two love songs, i might frighten her away and the deleted i come to you are the sensitive spots in the picture. there's a peacefulness and soft spoken quality in both these songs that is very much keeping with the philosophy of the story. moreover, the things i will not miss is a good duet with a strong melody. it's a nice exchange of different types of perspective and who can fault with olivia hussey and sally kellerman stomping, singing and dancing on tables? they're a wonderful team and the number is well staged. i always found it interesting in this story how the high lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in shangri-la. the character of the high lama is a gentle soul but somewhat radical in his view of mankind as a whole. he has no hope for the world outside of shangri-la. if this film were to be remade today, it would be interesting to see more emphasis put on the leading character, richard onway's conflict with what he left behind in the outside world as opposed to what he's found in shangri-la.of course, for the film to be believable, the character of richard conway must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end, like he was in the book. neither film versions of lost horizon were faithful to the novel in that regard. did conway find shangri-la or was it imagined? did they all die in the plane crash? every man has his own idea of what his shangri-la would be. the conflict with conway wanting to believe in shangri-la and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful. i like the melancholy on the faces of kellerman, kennedy and van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. interesting how conway doesn't want to leave paradise, but is being pressured out by his brother. both versions of lost horizon work in different ways, but both are successful in probing james hiltons ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. so in a sense it's anti capitalism in it's theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation. human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule. lost horizon has a much stronger story than most musicals. it attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding. one has to remember that lost horizon in 1973 was post cabaret. it was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. lost horizon was an easy target for jaded critics. the expectations for it were high, almost unreasonable. there were two targets to be hit, the producer, ross hunter and burt bacharach and the critics were out to get both of them. ross hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and lost horizon was his follow up film to his 1970 blockbuster airport that film was universals biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films. for years airport was the most watched film ever to be shown on television. it was nominated for 11 academy awards including best picture. at the time, burt bacharach and hal david were the most successful songwriters in the country. the unabashed sentimentality of lost horizon hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like easy rider, midnight cowboy and the godfather. sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 60's and early 70's audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen. lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made. today lost horizon can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels. it's the ultimate escapist film with a strong story, wonderful music, an expensive budget and some quirky humor. it's unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the film. it changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not? lost horizon '73 is a heavenly film that deserves rediscovering. a lost and legendary treasure deserving far better than it's reputation.

i was about 14 years old as i saw the musical version of lost horizon. i loved the film so much as well as the songs that i went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. my mother bought the lp and i learnt the songs off by heart, just as i did with "the sound of music" (which people hardly know in austria). i think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager. maybe he is an ingrid bergman fan but i was happy with liv ullman. could ingrid bergman sing and dance? what was so great about her? perhaps the critic did n't appreciate it because he needed new glasses or contact lenses since he sees a close resemblance between liv ullman and bill clinton. it was the idea and story behind the film, the philosophy, which was the most important and interesting factor and a musical in colour just made it more entertaining and enjoyable without damaging the intellectually appealing aspects. it's a shame that many other films with so called great actors and actresses with unimportant themes / stories are utterly boring in comparison.

this version of "the lost horizon" is actually not a bad film at all. i think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. i saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (i was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (burt bacharach has always been a favorite.) the story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all. i have this film on video and watch it every so often...and i enjoy it each and every time!

i really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. it is just not available and it has not been on tv for many many years. i enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.my 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. someday i hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it. (oh would i love to see it again too!)

i saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. since then i've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when i ordered it from moviehunter. sorry to say it doesn't hold up. this glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. i love burt bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and i even bought a cd of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. just doesn't fit. michael york is lost here. sally kellerman tosses off a fine performance but olivia hussy is just ridiculous and not worth lugging through the himalayas. the best performance is charles boyer as the head lama.

really, this movie should be released to dvd. i just got a bootleg copy of what i think was a studio film and i was utterly pleased!!! it was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. three of my people, michael york, olivia hussey. both having been in romeo & juliet, and also john gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone i thought that for the small amount i was spending it would be fine. boy was i right. i'm not going to give any of this one away, you may already know the story anyway, but i'll just say if you can get yourself a copy in any format...do it!@ you won't be sorry. jpc

as a film buff, i obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being woody allen's quip "if i had my life to live over again i wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of lost horizon"). therefore i've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. just recently i came across a widescreen dvd and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation. he really enjoyed it, and - after trying to block out all the negative prejudices i obviously had about the film - so did i. there is nothing especially bad about lost horizon, and it is far more enjoyable and watchable than many other early 1970's movies. it isn't even especially camp. the lyrics to some of the songs are rather repetitive and simplistic, but this isn't really apparent when hearing them for the first time or having the flaws pointed out in advance so you are ready to scoff at them. as for all the reviewers who claimed the cast cannot sing in tune, this criticism falls apart since liv ullmann, olivia hussey and peter finch were dubbed (brilliantly too, as the vocals match their speaking voices perfectly), and sally kellerman has a really lovely and totally unique singing style. vocally, kellerman's duet with olivia hussey on "the things i will not miss" is excellent. special mention should be made of the legendary hollywood star charles boyer's brilliant performance as the high lama - and his comments about mankind destroying itself are chillingly apt to today's fractured world. i wouldn't claim for a second that lost horizon is a masterpiece (the things i wouldn't miss about it are the uninspired choreography, and bobby van's "question me an answer" number, which could easily have been cut), but if you haven't even seen lost horizon, or haven't seen it for some time, try watching without that "oh boy, let's have a laugh at this pile of junk" attitude, and you will be surprised at how enjoyable it actually is.

the retelling of a classic story is set to the music of burt bacharach and lyrics of hal david. the actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical shangra-la. it is a joy to watch bobby van, whose acting puts me in mind of red buttons, and, as always, george kennedy (cool-hand luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. the surprise here is charles boyer as the elder high lama. who would have known? all-star cast including michael york and olivia hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.

i'll make this brief. this was a joy to watch. it may or may not have been more effective if the characters had resembled their real life counterparts, but aside from this minor observation i found the fantasy animal characters to be most enjoyable. the visuals were most stunning except for the second-rate cg scenes, which could have been left out. i dislike computer generated animation anyways, it defeats the purpose of a biopic such as this one. watch it, you will appreciate it too!

all the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. norman the viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill max with some insane cackling. the writing is the best. i was glued to the set when this would come on when i was younger. if they came out with a dvd of all the episodes they made i would be forced to buy it. this and a conan the barbarian cartoon are the ones i miss the most from childhood. i think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons. i used to watch these cartoons on channel 13 in the los angeles area. i remember the owl was always afraid, warning max that he was in trouble and that he was the chosen one. max didn't believe that he was the chosen one and always gave the owl trouble. norman was less talkative but his simplicity was funny. he would say things like "i eat monsters for breakfast" when he was battling them. and then when he was battling zombies he would say "i eat zombies for...nevermind." classic cartoon comedy and action.i vote that they re-air mighty max.

a surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as batman:tas and its ilk, i enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from tim curry, richard moll, tony jay, and maurice lamarche in various roles. the only qualm i had was rob paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending. some people say it was a cop-out, but i found it refreshing compared to many series that just leave things hanging. hopefully one day they put this series out on dvd, unfortunately it came out at a time when dvd's weren't yet prevalent and the cartoon probably only served to sell a particular type of toy, which i never found appealing despite the entertaining cartoon.

the title of my summary pretty much covers my review. this is to me what teenage mutant ninja turtles was to someone 5 years older. while i missed out on that little pop-culture wave, i embraced the toy line and t.v. series that was mighty max with both arms.you wanna know how into this i was? i went as mighty max for halloween.thank god for the internet. thanks to demonoid, last week i was able to watch this great show from my childhood for the first time in over a decade.i'm watching this right now, having just been blown away by recognizing rob paulson of animaniacs, and am also loving the celebrity humor in "tar wars". 4 minutes in, and they have already mentioned, by name: clint eastwood, governor arnold, dustin hoffman, john wayne, and ace ventura. hells yeah. damn, it is only upon writing this that i realize there is no way in hell i can give this series anything less than a perfect score. any imperfections have been lost in the fog of time. this is my childhood. this is awesomeness. this is the mighty one.

wow. this movie is the voice of a climbing generation. director sam keith takes us to the darkest depths of man's soul where we find love, life, and top-roping. world-weary telly (leo fitzpatrick) follows his heart and his anchors through a cerebral journey to find sanity in a post-apocalyptic colorado. instead, telly meets confrontation in don (jason bortz), the embodiment of machismo and a zeitgeist of humanities foibles. the epic film comes to a climbax at a gut-wrenching top-roping competition that will make even the strongest willed viewers squeamish at the dizzying heights.this movie has it all: top-roping outside, top-roping in the gym, cut-off shorts and sleeveless flannel shirts, awesome climbing footage (some so good, you see it 2 or 3 times!), bear and snake attacks.i gave the movie 8 out of 10 because i wanted to see the romance develop a bit more. it seemed as if the film was leading up to a spicy, top-roped sex scene between telly and his new lover, but alas, it wouldn't fit into the already jam-packed hour and a half thrill ride.fans of cliffhanger and mission impossible ii will find this flick to be a diamond in the rough. overall, if you are ready to challenge your world view on humanity and climbing, this is the film for you!!!1

my friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. the only good that came from it was this movie, "take it to limit" right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. the music is probably done by rural white boys from colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. the star of the show, actor leo fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie. this movie is based on climbing, and i'm not a climber, yet even i think it's hilarious when they have the climber struggling to climb and there's a guy in the background who is basically walking up the 'cliff'. you don't want to miss this movie, you'll get to see the same clips over and over again. you'll get surprises at every turn. you'll find yourself quoting the unforgettable lines. i highly recommend this movie to anyone. take it snow. disclaimer: this movie is poorly done, but that is what makes it great

wow. we watched this film in the hopes that it would have at least some decent rock climbing scenes. we were disappointed there, but it was still a great movie! it was soooo cheesy it was great! i haven't laughed so hard at a movie in a long time. if you are into rock climbing, and you enjoy cheesy movies, then this one is absolutely for you!

pity the monkees. people always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a american knock-off of the beatles (again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. discussions about who were better the monkees or the beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the monkess did not receive much respect for their albums. sadly a similar fate was met by their one movie vehicle despite the fact that it stands as the best band film ever. beatle fans may argue that "hard days night" was better and i am sure that many of the kids think "8 mile" was superior but none of these films were as daring and inventive as "head" and that is probably why it failed.if head had told a direct a to b type story perhaps it would have appealed to the bands young fans but by pushing the envelope and using the movie opportunity to mock their own image they really sabotaged the film with their fans. could you imagine eminem turning to the camera and actually talking about how sad it is that he is the best selling guy in a genre in which only 5% (and i am being generous) of the acts are white. if you can picture that than you have an idea how daring it was for the monkess to sing "hey, hey we are the monkees. you know we like to please. a manufactured image, with no philosophy". when you have a film in which frank zappa tells davy that he should focus less on the dancing, and more on the music its clear that there is a lot more going on then you expected.the story, what there is, concerns the boys trying to flee their manager, who at one point forces them to play dandruff in a commercial, but every time they run away they end up inside a box. i don't think you need to be fellini to figure out the symbolism of that bit. some neat little comedy bits follow with davy as a boxer who has to give up playing the violin to take a dive in the big match and peter refusing to throw away a ice cream cone he does not want because there are starving children so its wrong to waste food but the real selling point to this film is the music and its some of the best the band ever recorded. even if you are put off by the story, you can sit back and enjoy some terrific music.any film that begins and ends with mickey attempting suicide by jumping off a bridge (at the end the band follows him) is never going to be a mainstream classic but if you are a fan of either the band or experimental cinema of the era than you will enjoy this film.

a very weird, psychedelic, esoteric, (and did i say weird? :) experience.but on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. it bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the monkees tv program and the adult, musically growing and evolving, and yet still a little silly monkees of the '70s and beyond.the most important line in the film is mike nesmith's, "if they think we are plastic now, wait till they see how we do it." that the monkees were tired of all of the negative comments about their image and their work is a matter of record. they said it over and over in interviews. they needed to re-make themselves, and what better way that to de-bunk and hilariously lampoon the very machine that created them. and at the same time, they commented on our whole society (news, movies, art, everything) and said, "hey, why pick on us - isn't all of this stuff manufactured on one point or another." these are the orwellian "proles" (the monkees represented the persecuted "everyman" even at their silliest in the tv series)pulling down "big brother's" pants and kicking him in his very deserving butt.loved the ideas, loved the music, loved the effects, loved the movie! but then, as peter tork says in the movie, "but then, why should i speak, since i know nothing?" :)

this film stands as one of the most amazing examples of compelling and artful film-making i've every seen. herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of dieter's story, as well as his endearing personal character. by the end of the film, i was left wishing that i'd had the opportunity to meet dieter before his passing.on a technical note, the cinematography is intimate and astoundingly beautiful. the narrative is intricately woven, with great awareness of the subject and his capacity for reliving and reenacting traumatic events. few documentary directors have so strong an ability to so thoroughly invest the audience in the character. this film is a must see!!!

we see at the beginning of little dieter needs to fly dieter dengler, the subject of the film, an obsessive-compulsive. or at least that's what he seems to be by way of constantly opening/closing doors and with his large stock-pile of food in the cellar. in a way director werner herzog sets up a central question, in a manner of speaking, to why dieter is like this. well, in fact, he's not necessarily obsessive-compulsive as he is just, well, prepared. and why shouldn't he be after the life he's lived? aside from the juiciest, most dark and exhilarating and frightening and just downright haunting story of survival that's the core of the picture, the back-story to dieter is fascinating too. dieter's own childhood, for example, was already a slog from the start, being in post-war germnay, poor in a family without much food or prospects, eating wallpaper for "the blue in the walls". but enter in a passion, an un-yielding desire (which, of course, is part of herzog's bread & butter and love of man in his films), which is flying, and for dieter there was nothing else but to fulfill this. what it ends up leading to, after becoming an american citizen, is more than he could've bargained for.dieter is one of herzog's most compelling, quirky, and compassionately observed figures in his whole career, a man who's memory is scarred by brutal memories of his time being a vietnam pow, though at the least it provides for some of the most compelling storytelling in any documentary of the last 20 years. ironically, the storytelling comes through- unlike in the wild blue yonder- mostly in lots and lots of exposition from dieter on some of the most minute details of his time in the different prison camps (the torture tactics, the bugs, the brutal, wretched violence and threats like with the wedding ring tale), and leading into the most interesting and sad portions with his best friend duane. they escaped the prisons together, but found that their journey to reach cambodia would not be so easy. now, through most of this, the talking does something that is enthralling, which is that as dieter goes through his stories and occasionally does re-enactments (in fashion herzog could only do, with dieter already middle-aged being led in handcuffs et all through the jungle), one can picture all of this in the mind. it all becomes even more vivid to try and get these little details and the intensity of it all together into a form of reality. that herzog keeps these portions simple, and knows when to hold dieter back in his answers, makes him all the more a key figure of interest. he's not ever totally 'normal', but unlike a timothy treadwell, you wont think ever really about laughing at him either.so, along with his hero (whether of war or not is hard to say, as dieter disputes that claim as saying the ones who died were the real heroes, typical but perhaps quite true), herzog stylizes his film with a mix of old stock footage when detailing dieter's early life (the period footage of ww2 scenes and post german rubble is always a captivating sight, and with herzog gets up a notch in his timing and assemblage with music), and in capturing the footage of vietnam in aerial viewings of jungles and fields. herzog is also very wise at not injecting politics much at all into the proceedings, there's no 'i was used by the americans' or whatever thrown into the mix. there's even a sense that dieter doesn't hold too much of a grudge with everything that happened to him, that it's just what happens in time of war (and, of course, he was dropping bombs on people from his plane). now, through much of these harrowing- and even in the smaller bits involving what went on in prisons, bathrooms and the scraps of food it's always harrowing- luckily herzog keeps a level of humor in check as well. one of my very favorite scenes in the film, where herzog breaks away for a moment from dieter, is when he shows a 'trainee' film used for american soldiers meant to show what should happen in case they get abandoned in the jungle alone...with all of the gear that they could possibly have including a knife, a flare gun, and a very fast helicopter to come around (and this is put to hilariously dead-pan voice-over work).yet even the moments where one laughs only brings to mind the moments of absurdity in a time of absolute crisis, and how one can't ever really imagine what it's like to be alone in a foreign territory surrounded by people who will do anything to keep said person as a form of collateral in war-time. dieter, aside from knowing that flying and airplanes are the only way of life he would ever want to have (and herzog ends the film on a wonderfully somber, elegiac note where he flies over a large field of airplanes), knows what it is to have to survive at all costs. but yet, as well, as in many of herzog's protagonist driven films, there's the near unalterable spirit that will keep on enduring if one's strong enough, even through horrid moments (the fate of dunae) and problems all the way up to the rescue by the helicopter (is he american, or a spy, they ask on the chopper). dieter is such a man with a spirit, and he's given via herzog a fantastic, tragic, creative, well-shot, albeit maybe too short, tribute to his life. and, of course, it pumps me up even more for the upcoming dramatization rescue dawn.

my architect is a great film about nathaniel kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous architect father, louis kahn, dead since 1974. the film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.i had never heard of louis kahn prior to this film, although i was vaguely familiar with some of his work. through the words (both good and bad) of louis kahn's colleagues, you get a very good sense of what nathaniel must have felt as memories are recalled and stories retold. sometimes it seemed as though these people were telling nathaniel how to feel about his father. as i listened to each recollection, my own opinion of this man would range from beautiful to horrible, sometimes in the span of a moment, so you get a good feel for the rollercoaster that nathaniel's emotions must have been riding.the final sequence in bangladesh totally made the film for me. the reverence of which the people of bangladesh spoke of louis kahn's work tied all the loose ends together nicely for me, and, hopefully, for nathaniel.i think nathaniel kahn finally found what he was looking for.

my impression, having seen this documentary, is that nathaniel kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film. he took five years to make it, a labour of love and longing. i can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take out. his father, the renowned architect louis kahn,comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. but like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity. one of his mistresses said he was "accessible" but that is never explored. other comments by people who knew him well suffer the same fate. a pity. the tension between the three half-siblings in the room of a home louis designed is also palpable. the unsaid hovers over the conversation. the only tracks that his father left were in the buildings he left behind, some great, some not so great. i was captivated by the music ship and the salk institute. saddened by the baby mothers who got caught forever by his callous impregnations never more exemplified than what he said to the director's mother upon being told of her pregnancy - "not again!" 8 out of 10, beautifully filmed, genuine. it appears, in this case at least, the son is not the father of the man.

documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, by the process, their own lives are not that uncommon. also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unsubtle quest for publicly-splashed revenge for countless past hurts, real and fantasized. what is unusual is a brilliant, fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and "my architect: a son's journey" is that rare achievement.louis kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident. he and his parents settled in philadelphia where the talented youngster loved art and music. soon he became enamored of buildings and decided only an architect's career would answer his creative abilities.kahn became an architect but as this film shows it took a long time before he attracted the attention of the leaders in his field. one architect suggests that he was a victim of the "yellow armband," that anti-semitism that along with bias against women was long a disreputable aspect of the american profession of architecture.when he did achieve notice, he was seen, clearly accurately, as a self-assured, workaholic prophet exclaiming unyielding demands that his vision and only his vision be realized. that inflexibility was the reason that while he drew wonderful plans for many buildings he built but a few. the interview with an aged gentleman who fired kahn in philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a transformed urban center where people left their cars on the perimeter and walked into the city is hilarious.kahn was a born teacher and some of the extensive archival footage here shows him with students, his voice steady but passionate, their gazes respectful and intense.many architects were interviewed by director, writer and project honcho nathaniel kahn, the architect's only son. some are world famous - i. m. pei, robert a.m. stone, moshe safdie, frank gehry and the still active nonagenarian, philip johnson. their comments paint a vivid picture of this idealistic but in the end financially unsuccessful designer of buildings that blended the castles, fortresses and grand buildings of past centuries into designs for the present. kahn's buildings are shown, among the most impressive being the salk research laboratories in la jolla, ca. to me his style has a neo-romantic air deadened by too much blank space that repels rather than attracts human interaction.but kahn's son was after more than the story of his father, the architect. for many years louis kahn had three families: a wife with whom he had a daughter and two long-term relationships, one of which produced a daughter, the other the son. kahn visited his son at the mother's home often but at the end of an evening mother and son would drive kahn back to the marital home. nathaniel clearly wanted to know about this unusual set of relationships but he doesn't appear to be scarred by what was certainly a strange affair for a little boy. when nathaniel was a young boy louis kahn died of a massive heart attack in the men's room of new york's pennsylvania station after returning from india where he had pitched one of his massive projects, another one that was never built. at that point his philadelphia firm was at least $500,000 in debt and had he lived a trip to the federal bankruptcy court was probably in the offing.kahn left several monumental structures of which the government building in bangladesh is clearly the biggest. a teary local architect hails kahn for having created a building where democracy may (and hopefully will) flourish.fellow architect moshe safdie opines that there might have been something fitting in kahn's suffering a mortal heart attack in a train station given his incessant globetrotting. i disagree: it's sadly ironic that kahn should die in the faceless replacement for one of america's true architectural gems, the old pennsylvania station, wrecked to make way for a sterile replacement with no character and no continuation of civic memory.there are a number of emotional moments filmed during the younger kahn's journey, including with his half-sisters and his mother, but they're genuine and moving, not maudlin and staged. historians of architecture will always study kahn. his son found reasons to remember him as a flawed but very iconoclastic and ultimately private man.9/10.

lucio fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'the godfather of gore'. while don't torture a duckling was made before fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn't all that gory; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that fulci ever made! don't torture a duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of fulci's later films, everything about this giallo is great. the plot focuses on a small rustic community where dead bodies have began turning up. the murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys. shortly after the police convict an innocent man of the crimes, a reporter named andrea martelli arrives in the village and decides to start investigating the murders on his own. martelli soon encounters various suspects, including a sexy young lady named patricia, a sinister priest and a local witch who enjoys making wax effigies and sticking pins into them.while this film may not feature loads of gore, it does have two of fulci's nastiest sequences to make up for it. the nastiest involves a woman being brutally slaughtered by a group of men in a cemetery, while the image of a man falling from a cliff and hitting any number of rocks on the way down is liable to turn some stomachs. don't torture a duckling features an absolutely great italian cast. barbara bouchet (a personal favourite of mine) is incredibly sexy in her role as patricia, and gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in many later films. tomas millian is excellent as usual while the rest of the cast is well fleshed out by likes of irene pappas, florinda bolkan and marc porel. the cinematography on display is stunning and fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he puts a lot of care and effort into every scene. the story plays out slowly, and it's always interesting as fulci never allows the film to stray too much from the central plot line. there isn't a great deal of mystery towards the identity of the murderer; but fulci almost manages to keep us guessing right up until the end and don't torture a duckling does climax on a high. overall, it's a shame that fulci didn't make more films like this. don't torture a duckling is his out and out best work and i insist that every giallo fans sees it!

this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. set in rural italy, there is a serial killer of children at large. add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema  a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffectual police, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mentally-retarded loner etc. this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's.unusually for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle. the fact that it is kids who are the target of the maniac only serves to make things a little more uncomfortable. fulci is pushing the envelope a bit here and he goes even further in a gloriously outrageous unpc scene where a young boy is subjected to the somewhat inappropriate attention of a sexy naked young woman (barbara bouchet) who he is tasked with delivering a drink to. she displays herself openly and actively invites the youngster to ogle her; ultimately asking him if he wants to go to bed with her. although she is clearly playing around with him, it's still quite an unusual scene. admittedly there are one or two unintentionally funny bits of dialogue here but it's very nicely photographed and barbara bouchet exudes high levels of confident sex-appeal. a standout scene. even if you might feel slightly wrong watching it!along with barbara bouchet, the other standout performance is from florinda bolkan, who plays a madwoman who is accused of murdering the children. she is not directly responsible but it is left to the viewer to decide whether her black magic may or may not have kicked off the subsequent killing spree. irrespective, she is hunted down by a lynch mob and chain-whipped while a car radio blasts out rock music. this scene is very strong and unpleasant. its viciousness indicates the path fulci's career would subsequently go.despite the visceral impact of the above murder it's maybe a little surprising that the other killings are either bloodless or committed off-screen. the only other death scene comparable with the lynch-mob is the demise of the killer at the end of the movie, although this sequence is kind of silly. the plot is convoluted and awash with red herrings, although personally, i found the identity of the killer a little predictable. this weakness is less problematic on subsequent viewings though  like most gialli, don't torture a duckling is eminently re-watchable.technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill. fulci obviously went on to make more graphically violent horror movies but here he shows a talent for slightly more restrained material. it's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.

i'm not a huge fan of lucio fulci's films. most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate dario argento imitations. with the exception of the entertaining "zombi" (which was a george romero imitation), i didn't really enjoy them. i know italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. this is why "don't torture a duckling" surprised me. its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery. its possibly the best giallo ever made, only seriously rivaled by dario argento's entries into the genre. and unlike fulci's previous giallo "a lizard in a woman's skin", this never drags.fulci's direction here is quite good. he keeps the story moving at a good pace and maintains the viewer's interest throughout. also, the conclusion to the mystery comes as a complete surprise to the audience. plus, he adds some clever touches, such as the upbeat soul music during a particularly disturbing graveyard beating sequence. overall, the violence here is restrained and only used when necessary for the story. the acting is good for the most part also, full of familiar faces from 70s italian exploitation cinema. both thomas milian and barbara bouchet are super cool throughout. the only weak link is florinda bolkan, whose performance is just far too over-the-top. its the only laughable aspect of the film. "don't torture a duckling" definitely comes with my recommendation and may be a good introduction to the giallo subgenre as a whole. (8/10)

first of all i have to say that i'm a huge lucio fulci and dario argento fan. although i have not seen absolutely all of their movies, i really enjoyed almost every one i did see. i really like giallos and i thought argento was the master of this genre, after seeing films like "tenebre" and "phenomena". but after i saw "new york ripper" by fulci, i found out that he could do pretty good giallos besides his graphic zombie movies and even outdo argento, on a certain level.i love fulci's style, and yes i love gore, but this film i think, although it has a more developed plot and characters than his other films, is not his best one. what i don't like is that it can be confusing at times, especially at the end. and the fact that we go from one suspect, to another, and then another until we even suspect the retarded little girl for a moment, i think it goes too far. i know giallos are supposed to keep you guessing until the end, and the killer should be very hard to find, but this film plays a little too much with our minds. however i did like the scene when the witch is killed, i think it is very well done and gave me the chills. the acting is also pretty good and the photography is great.although this is not a bad film, i think lucio fulci has made better films than this, and i think his best one is "the beyond", a very different movie but a more atmospheric and visual experience.i give "don't torture a duckling" a 7 out of 10.

i saw this movie five times and never get tired of it. this features traces of the "giallo" genre, but also with a vivid italian countryside setting, where ignorance and superstition are deadlier than any serial killer. featuring excellent location (reminiscent sometimes of fellini, sometimes of the taviani brothers), good characterisation and some of the finest genre actors (including the great tomas milian and ida lupino in an unforgettable role), this is not euro-trash, just a masterpiece that should be discovered generation after generation (it recently recieved great acclaim at the paris cinematheque at a double-feature tribute to lucio fulci)

this film shows a serious side to the often thought of as gore-fest works of fulci. not a lot of blood and guts here , but a fine tale about murder and the lives affected by it.a real find, considering it was made in 1972 and will soon celebrate its 30th anniversary.check this one out, but be warned it is hard to find!ron

i was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.this film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (the beyond, zombie 2, city of the living dead, house by the cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of italy. the scenery is at moments reminiscent of cherished folklore and then immediately contrasted by mud and blood-soaked terror shrouded by crumbling ruins. the gore in this film is not quite as prevalent and seems restrained compared to fulci's later films however, splatter and giallo fans will most likely be satiated by a few close-ups of oozing wounds and the last 5 minutes of the film.overall a fantastic and mature film from one of our great italian horror directors.

cult-director lucio fulci is probably most famous for his gory zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the "godfather of gore". fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. "non si sevizia un paperino" aka. "don't torture a duckling" of 1972 is not only by far fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre. the stunning atmosphere and tantalizing suspense, the great sizilian setting, the intriguing story the brilliant performances or the intense moments of sheer shock - i don't know what to praise most about this ingenious giallo! "don't torture a duckling" truly delivers cinematic perfection in every aspect, which makes it an absolute masterpiece of italian horror cinema.contrary to other gialli, it is not seductive beauty queens who are slain one by one, but little boys who fall victims to a killer on the loose. bodies of little boys are found in rural sicily. while the police are desperately searching for the killer, the little town is basically full of strange people, and the townsfolk are screaming for a culprit...the film is stunningly suspenseful and uncompromising from the very beginning, with a gritty, dark, and constantly tense atmosphere that has yet to find an equal. the acting performances are among the best in italian horror cinema. tomas milian (one of my personal all-time favorite actors) is excellent in the lead, as journalist andrea martinelli who is investigating the crimes. sexy barbara bouchet delivers both eye-candy and a brilliant performance. equally outstanding performances come from irene papas and florinda bolkan, who is utterly brilliant in her role. the great score by riz ortolani brilliantly intensifies the suspense and atmosphere, and the film is ingeniously shot in fascinating sicilian landscapes. although not as gory as many other fulci films, this film is definitely gritty and uncompromising in its violence, with a few shockingly brutal scenes."don't torture a duckling" has everything brilliant horror requires. this is not quite as easy to get hold of as most other fulci flicks, but i assure that searching it will pay off. any horror fan must see this personal favorite of mine, and i highly recommend any true lover of film in general not to miss this. a masterpiece!

in this early fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. personally i think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. it's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on. the comparative lack of gore in the film shows a more urgent and psychological imperative to this film in its prevailing "mystery" but the gore and puppetry he does utilise is put to good use here most notably in the scene where a falsely accused murderer is senselessly lynched by a mob of men in a graveyard and left for dead in a show of vile and antiquated vigilantism, expertly choreographed to the modern tunes off a diegetic radio.another example was the final scene (which was indeed awesome) in which a strikingly handsome priest falls from a cliff and the puppet used is markedly showed in a medium closeup which accentuated its demonic appearance and evident ugliness. curiously, considering his later works, fulci also invokes the idea of modernity seized upon the hamlet holding on to its anachronistic superstitions and ignorance when the idea of black magic is just that, a quaint idea of supernatural evil that never really ends up manifesting from the voodoo dolls while making its witch nothing more than a disturbed woman. another thing i liked was that he adds to these character layers by making a bourgeois city girl into an ambiguous figure - is she the corrupter the priest fears for his wards and perhaps more tellingly, for himself? this giallo does lend itself to becoming one of fulci's more personal and substantive films, in that we actually get a fair influx of ideas from him.

i saw 2:37 at the toronto international film festival in september and was blown away by it! a scene of panic opens this film, at 2:37 pm set in an adelaide high school. this scene is left unresolved as we revert to the beginning of the day, and are introduced to the teenagers getting ready to go to school. the audience becomes intimate with each of the main characters, and explores the day-to-day issues facing teenagers - including drugs, promiscuity, being gay, bullying and violence. each scene is played again and again from different teens' perspectives, and is reminiscent of gus van sant's elephant. this is a remarkable film by first-time director murali k. thalluri. it was made with non-professional student actors, and work-shopped through an unprecedented 76 drafts of a script. it features stunning performances by a number of the student actors, particularly teresa palmer in the role of melody. this coming-of-age film is both intimate and thought-provoking with a surprising and disturbing ending.

this movie is not about the soda nor is it quite the french connection.the seven ups are a group of elite policemen that use tactics not in accordance with protocol of the nypd. scheider heads the group with his posse or regular looking joes. they are running surveillance on a local costra nostra cartel and things go awry when a cop's wire is found out.meanwhile, richard lynch, the most evil looking man in film (invasion:america, little nikita) and his partner end up killing the cop by accident and escape from scheider in the coolest chase scene i've seen, bullitt and french connection are not as good as they one up the west side to the george washington and onto the palisades parkway in new jersey. the stunt drivers are terrific and lynch makes it away free though he looks scared witless from the dangerous trip. roy scheider is nearly killed when his car slams into the abutted rear of mack truck ripping the roof of his vehicle off. things come to a head and one has to keep watching to follow up on such a sequence. quick moving and intense, fresh for a thirty years.

while both this movie and the signature car chase have been shown a lack of respect by many critics, both are way above average. roy scheider does an excellent job playing his best type; a tough, courageous cop who works hard to get the job done in spite of the desk drivers and politicians who should be supporting him rather than hindering. (he played a suburbanized version of this same role as the tourist town police chief in jaws. not nearly as gritty, but the same "get the job done despite the politicians" and gutsy approach. if a man who can't swim and is terrified of everything in the water going out on an old boat with an ahab wannabee and a nerd, to confront a huge killer shark, isn't gutsy, then tell me what is...).tony lo bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain; most of the villains, in fact, have some depth and complexity. this is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings. overall, it captures the atmosphere of parts of ny city: gritty, unglamorous, often dangerous, but filled with energy. the story is spare, tight, and subtle; it gets the job done without extraneous elements. it may not be one of the all time greats, but it is an exceptionally good movie.everyone has an opinion about car chases. mine is that this one is right up there with the mustang vs dodge charger chase in bullitt. the pontiac ventura/chevy nova was similar to the mustang in being a compact car chassis with beefed up suspension and a powerful small block v8 stuffed into an engine bay meant for an insipid 6. the ventura/novas got little respect off the drag strip, but with the proper suspension mods, they made affordable performance cars that could handle on both the road and the track. the bawling of those gm v8's as they wind up is music to the enthusiast's ear. i've heard this chase criticized for "imitating" the bullitt chase. the truth is that they are two works by the same master, bill hickman, who also choreographed and drove for the french connection chase. besides driving most of the car chase scenes, he created a brooding, malevolent presence and a good match with richard lynch as a pair of coldly evil killers.yes, the chase has "realism errors" often noted, like the use of 3 different ny roads to represent the palisades parkway, the ending of the chase in a crash with an 18 wheeler on a roadway for passenger vehicles only, and the miraculous timing that allows all pedestrians to escape harm. that's beside the point. let's face it: movie car chases are "unreal" by nature. in bullitt, the french connection, and the seven ups, however, bill hickman and phillip d'antoni crafted chases far more realistic, and therefore more exciting, than the flying, rolling, exploding vehicle fantasy chases so common in recent films.

this movie has a great chase scene, if you listen to the soundtrack when the cars are chasing each other , it sounds very much like the soundtrack from the movie bullet, you'll hear the shifting of a 4 speed and they'll show the brake pedal in roy schneider's car, it's an automatic brake pedal!, i think one of the funniest moments in the movie is when the bad guy richard lynch is looking at the driver of the car they are in, like the guy is nuts!.........the crook who runs the garage is also the guy who in the the first rocky movie, rocky's boss. good movie! also when the door gets ripped off you can see the guy sitting in the car just flinging the door open, the guy who helps him out of the car kind of looks like mr brady from the brady bunch doesn't he?

buddy manucci(roy scheider, solid in a chance leading role)heads a secret undercover police squad called the seven-ups whose tactics don't necessarily follow the exact ways of the law. they get the job done in their own way without anything being leaked to the press, and this gives them a freedom to expand their means of getting to the criminals most working detectives and policeman just can not nab. buddy has a pal from childhood named vito(tony lo bianco)who swaps information with him regarding mob types and shysters working the streets in nyc. what buddy doesn't know is that vito is hatching a scheme using names from buddy's "check list"(he has this book open taking down notes provided by vito, but doesn't know that his friend has copied those very names written within his mind)to set up mob families in a series of mob kidnappings eliciting cash thanks to two cop-posers, moon(the always-villainous richard lynch)and bo(bill hickman)working with him. when this scheme goes awry, with one of the seven-ups being killed, vito becomes fearful because he knows how buddy can be when he's doggedly after someone..especially when one of his own is murdered.extremely underrated cop flick has thrilling car chase through new york city as buddy follows the kidnapping cop-imposter's trying to get them after killing his partner. the film isn't overly complex after the plot is set-up and we realize who is the ring-leader in the scheming of mobsters. scheider has never been given the credit he deserves as a fine lead actor. he has emotional range and we see how losing his cop and friend takes it's toll on him. the film is briskly paced with good action sequences and sets up an interesting plot of betrayal between friends as greed comes before that childhood friendship and how what seems like a smooth crime-spree against evil mob families can get cops killed.

a team of tough rogue new york cops led by the rugged, hard-nosed buddy manucci (superbly played by the always excellent roy scheider) go after a group of nasty mobsters involved in a kidnapping ring after one of their number gets killed by them. director philip d'antoni, the producer of "bullet" and "the french connection," ably creates a potent, gritty, starkly amoral no-nonsense tone, maintains a steady pace throughout and stages the action scenes with considerable rip-roaring vigor. don ellis' rousing string score further pumps up the raw'n'rattling intensity while the scrappy big apple locations and urs furrer's rough, grainy cinematography both greatly enhance the overall grungy realism. moreover, the fine line distinguishing cops from criminals gets chillingly blurred in this picture: the titular squad use harsh, brutish and morally dubious strong-arm tactics as a means to an end for enforcing the law and there's certainly no code of honor amongst the thugs and thieves who populate the seedy urban underbelly that's vividly depicted in this movie. nice supporting performances by tony lo bianco as wormy, sniveling snitch vito lucia the undertaker, richard lynch as vicious psychotic hoodlum moon, bill hickman as moon's equally coldblooded partner bo, jerry leon as funky flatfoot mingo, and joe spinell as a parking garage attendant. an extremely wild and exciting protracted heart-in-your-throat mondo destructo car chase qualifies as a definite highlight. the climactic shootout likewise delivers the stirring goods. a real bang-up little winner.

"the seven-ups" seems like a replay of "the french connection," which was released two years prior. both the late roy scheider and tony lo bianco make appearances, as well as stunt driver bill hickman.but we aren't dealing with french drug baddies; instead, we are dealing with a war against assorted hoods and criminals after a cop is brutally killed by a hoodlum. we get to see unpleasantness and a pre-1990s new york city.i love watching this film because it is exciting to see the action, and it is a reminder of a cooler time. that said, when one compares the car chases, mr. hickman had involvement in the three most compared: this movie, bullitt and the french connection. each chase scene has its own qualities, and this one is simply superb.and i am glad this title has seen the light of day on dvd.

having grown up in new jersey and having spent many a day and night on the gritty streets of new york in the 1970's, watching a film like "the seven-ups", or its kindred spirit, "the french connection", always evokes fond memories of a time and place which, for some, might have been nyc's darkest hour, but which for me, in my early twenties, was always one fun-filled adventure after another. i truly miss those times. as one reviewer remarked, "this film very aptly captures the stark, cold, matter-of-fact feel of the nyc winter season, while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region's infamous underworld of crime and policing. a great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture.". a spot-on characterization of both the film and the city. the stellar attributes of this film -- the plot, the cast, the characters, and of course, the car chase -- are amply described in many of the reviews here, so i won't go into that except to say that one of my favorite moments occurs during the car chase, when the camera focuses on richard lynch riding shotgun to the maniacal bill hickman. the look of horror on richard lynch's face, along with the defensive gestures, are so out-of-character for an actor much better known as a source of terror rather than an object of it, that it is actually comical to watch. i get a chuckle out of it every time.

i was born in '68 with not much parental guidance as far as what i watched on tv (as a kid in the 70's). i always loved this movie (and the french connection) and would always try to catch it whenever it was on (checking the sunday tv guide ahead of time). i bought it on dvd a few years ago and have watched it twice since then and i must say, i still love it!!!! roy s. was a great actor from the 70's (jaws is one of my all-time favs, marathon man etc) and although the 7-ups is not an oscar-worthy film, it puts you precisely in a time a place (ny, early 70's, as did french connection) and gives you some tough characters and a glimpse of life as a cop at that time. and yes, the car chase is one of the all-time best.

octavio paz, mexican poet, writer, and diplomat, who received the nobel prize for literature in 1990, said about "nazarin": "nazarin follows the great tradition of mad spaniards originated by cervantes. his madness consists in taking seriously great ideas and trying to live accordingly". a humble and spiritual priest (francisco rabal in a wonderful performance) attempts to live by the principles of christianity but is cast out of his church for helping a local prostitute by giving her a shelter after she had committed a murder. nazarin wanders the country roads of the turn of the 20th-century mexico, offering help to poor and begging for food. his two followers, a murderous prostitute andara and her sister beatriz who is a failed suicide desperately searching for love, consider him saint but it does not prevent him from hatred and humiliation from both the church and the people he meets on the road. he ends up beaten in prison and begins to question his faith for not be able to forgive his attacker. bunuel tells the story in a manner of a christian parable masterfully and uniquely combining admiration and irony for the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. the film is simple and profound as well as beautiful, ironic, and heartbreaking.i consider bunuel one of the best filmmakers ever. i've seen twenty of his films and they all belong to the different periods of his life but they have in common his magic touch, the masterful combination of gritty realism and surrealism, his curiosity, his inquisitive mind, his sense of humor, and his dark and shining fantasies. with great pleasure i am adding little seen and almost unknown but amazingly candid and touching surrealistic tragic-comedy "nazarin" to the list of my favorite films.

you know i've seen a lot of crappy hong kong movies in terms of production and were good. but running out of time was great.i guess what made it so good was the fact that andy lau and ching wang, have such great chemistry. the film at first is really fast paced but slows down not enough to even notice which is also good, we don't want to have a heart attack,lol. in terms of plot their is enough of other things going on to keep you interested. lau has some pretty good moments as he uses make up to impersonate people from the underworld. also the movie has the best oriental supporting cast since "house of flying daggers".the movie is great because its so unpredictable and leaves you wondering at every corner. definitely a good rental with tons of comedy, action and thrills pact in to one, 8 out of 10

this was a very strong look at prejudice and group mentality. the cast is composed of superb actors doing a remarkable job. the sets are beautiful and just a bit stylized. the art direction is top notch along with great cinematography. the story is taut and shows how prejudice and bigotry can flourish easily. it is disturbing for its realistic violence and protrayal of a fairly typical community. i was very impressed.

look...i've come to expect this level of acting from william macy...the guy just keeps putting in terrific performances...but meat loaf? just when did his loafness decide to leave jim steinman behind and throw his decidedly lower weight around in the wonderful world of stanislavsky? well...what can i say? i'm duly impressed. to paraphrase an old adage: "it ain't the meat, it's the emotion"...and the loaf is quietly buffing up his acting chops of late..laura dern carries off the 40's look perfectly here...great job by the costume and hair departments...david paymer is typecast but right on the money. solid camera work throughout the flick. the plot line is reminiscent of "gentleman's agreement" (post-wwii anti-semitism). well worth your time...particularly for the growing legions of bill macy acolytes.

the most striking feature about this well acted film, is the almost surrealimages of the era and time it was shot it. i could sense the time and moments were stark and very real. even the language was so well chosen. it's all too often when colloquialisms of today's world are carelessly used in movies aboutanother time and place

headlines warn us of the current campaign to demonize drug users, note the nostalgia for mussolini in italy and remind us of our wont to profile likely terrorists. "focus" reminds us of the evils of rampant fear and distrust and the anti-semitism disguised as pro-americanism of the wwii era. what goes around...lawrence newman (william c. macy) becomes the unfortunate victim of hate crimes after he is mistaken for a jew and these attacks increase when his bride, gerty (laura dern) highlights the look. newman rails against the false accusations when they cause him direct harm but he minds his own business. we see the rise in anti-semitic attacks through his myopia, a condition not completely cured by eyeglasses.macy's typical everyman role is featured again and the long road to realization that we are all connected nearly costs him his life. what is it about the character macy portrays to us? we can't choose to ignore the violence, hate, and bigotry because citizenship forces us to take sides. newman's dilemma is that he has no alternative but to side with the mistreated and goes through hell to see it. and our sadness is that most of us need to be beaten up to realize the dangers surrounding us.let's focus.

being relatively young, i didn't know how bad anti-semitism was in brooklyn, where my family is originally from. this movie absolutely horrified me. i've seen many movies about prejudice, racism, and anti-semitism, but this seemed to hit me harder than most.this was definitely one of the best indie films i've ever seen...i had to travel 45 minutes to see it, and it was well worth it. nearly everything about the movie was great. sometimes it was a little slow, but that didn't really bother me because the movie was very atmospheric. it took place in the 40s, and it really did look like it was the 40s. the acting was great...william h. macy as always was wonderful, so was laura dern, and i was pleasantly surprised by meatloaf's performance, playing the vicious anti-semite neighbor. 9/10

did this gem go direct to video? fabulous art direction. mood that never misses a beat. the truman show meets metropolis. an excellent cast. i've never seen laura dern better, and bill macy is always fabulous. same said for david paymer, and meat loaf. this is just an incredible film.

a very good movie about anti-semitism near the end of wwii. the scene that really speaks loudly of the ignorance of these people is the meeting at the church when the priest is giving his speech against the "international money grubbers and communists". it sounds amazingly like the speeches that adolph hitler used to force down his peoples' throats, yet none of the meeting attendees seem to make this comparison.

without question, film is a powerful medium, more so now than ever before, due to the accessibility of dvd/video, which gives the filmmaker the added assurance that his story or message is going to be seen by possibly millions of people. use of this medium, therefore, attaches an innate responsibility to the artist, inasmuch as film can be educational, as well as entertaining, which dictates that certain subjects should be approached accordingly and with a corresponding sensitivity and sensibility. a film like spielberg's `schindler's list,' for example, is important, in that it keeps alive the memory of that which must not be forgotten, and as history tends to repeat itself, spielberg's film can be viewed as a valuable tool in preventing a recurrence of that tragedy. in that same vein, this film, `focus,' directed by neal slavin, is important, in it illuminates the problematic reality of anti-semitism, which for years beyond number has affected millions of people, is still unimaginably prevalent today, and like any manifestation of bigotry, will perpetuate itself if left unchecked or ignored. born of a xenophobic strain, it's a disease infecting society which, unabated, could be terminal; and with it's penetrating insights into the condition, this film is an effective vaccine that just may at the very least help stem the proliferation of it, and hopefully may act as a step toward eradicating it altogether.lawrence newman (william h. macy) served his country in the great war, and has since lived a quiet, conventional life in new york. he's had the same job as a personnel director for some twenty years, and owns the house, located in an average, middle-class neighborhood, in which he lives with his mother (kay hawtrey). lawrence is the kind of guy who gets by just fine by minding his own business and refusing to involve himself with matters that are not (he feels) his concern.all of that is about to change, however, as with the advent of world war 2, lawrence, along with the owner of the corner market, mr. finkelstein (david paymer), inexplicably finds himself a target of the neighborhood xenophobes, who have aligned themselves with the `union crusaders,' a national organization currently taken to channeling their fears and hatred upon jews, or anyone who even `looks' like a jew. and suddenly lawrence finds that he can no longer just stand on the sidelines and watch the game being played; because now, he is the game, whether he wants to be or not.working from an intelligent, well written screenplay by kendrew lascelles, which he adapted from arthur miller's novel, slavin presents a chilling scenario that incisively examines the effects of bigotry upon those against whom it is leveled; and when one considers the fact that this is not merely a hypothetical situation, but a depiction of reality, it becomes all the more disquieting, even unnerving. and what makes the film so effective is slavin's obvious grasp of his subject, and his studied presentation, which is thought-provoking in it's subtlety. in the opening scene, slavin establishes lawrence's `character,' and very soon afterward reaffirms it in another scene, which affords the audience the opportunity to observe and assimilate how lawrence's mind actually works; the thought processes that direct his life. with that in place, then, slavin is able to take his audience along with lawrence as his problems gradually begin to unfold. by so doing, he effectively illustrates how the problem evolves, rather than merely stating the problem and addressing it head on, which heightens the viewers emotional involvement, and ultimately enhances the impact of the film. slavin makes an important statement with this film, which is not only an indictment of bigotry, but carries a cautionary message about apathy, as well. and to his credit, he never hits you over the head with it or engages in subjective finger-pointing to make his case; instead, he proceeds carefully, taking great pains to be as objective as possible with all that he is submitting for your consideration. his approach is that of a cinematic diplomat; and it's an approach that serves slavin-- and his film-- quite well.as lawrence, william h. macy-- one of the best character actors in the business-- gives an amazing performance, establishing the credibility and believability of his character with a sensitive, honest and introspective portrayal. he never attempts to circumvent the personal flaws of lawrence's nature, but uses them, instead, to create a character that is decidedly three-dimensional, which not only makes him convincing, but serves to reaffirm the integrity of the portrayal. what makes it so compelling is macy's ability to convey the process by which he examines his own conscience, which successfully enables the viewer to share in the experience of his personal epiphany. in the final analysis, it's the strength of macy's performance, more than anything else, that makes this film so significantly distinct. another of the film's strengths is the performance turned in by laura dern, as gertrude hart, a portrayal that effectively complements macy's work, as well as that of slavin. dern lends tremendous substance to her character, capturing her physically as well as emotionally, and her colorful zeal crates a striking contrast to lawrence's reserve that works extremely well, for her character as well as the film itself.and just as sean combs recently (in `monster's ball') made a good case against dismissing out-of-hand the acting endeavors of an established `rock star,' meat loaf aday gives a powerful performance here, as fred, lawrence's next-door neighbor. it demonstrates, too, that a true artist will produce, regardless of the kind of canvas he's given to work with.the supporting cast includes michael copeman (carlson), kenneth welsh (father crighton), joseph ziegler (gargan) and arlene meadows (mrs. dewitt). the kind of film that makes a filmmaker proud of his craft, `focus,' offers a memorable experience that hopefully will prove to be enlightening, as well, to those unaware that such conditions have existed, and still do-- even in this, the land of the free. 10/10.  

focus is another great movie starring william h. macy. i first discovered macy in fargo and i've seen a few of his films and he hasn't yet deceived me. macy is the archetypal "nice guy with something to hide". in focus, he plays the role of lawrence newman, a loyal and hard-working stiff, who harbours his handicapped mother at home. the scene is set after world war ii, at the height of mccarthyism. newman is the head of human resources for a company which is basically, anti-semite. after he accidentally hires a woman of jewish descent, he is asked to buy a pair of glasses, to improve his failing eyesight.unbelievably, the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and that of gertrude hart, his wife (played by a great laura dern). as the film unravels, newman will begin to see a whole different world, where being jewish is akin to being an animal.the movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal. the chilling thought is that in some places, it probably still is.

arthur miller certainly knows. his stories give a clearer picture of what it means to live in the united states in the 20th century than any other writer i can think of.focus, based on one of his novels, is no exception.william h. macy and laura dern give fantastic performances here. emotionally bruising but ultimately rewarding, this movie is excellent.

i had to call my mother (a wasp) to ask her about this. was it really that bad in the 40s in new york? surprise, she couldn't remember. so i told her to see the movie. arthur miller, in not a screen play but a novel for a change, was 30 when he wrote this in 1945. it is a painful depiction of anti-semitism. yet oddly enough, there is a tender story of human relationships (finkelstein, the jew, with newman, the non-jew, primarily) underlying the cruel story. the acting is competent and the cinematography is very good.the only reason i can think of for this not making it big in the theatre is that it's >>aaagh<< controversial.i actually give it ten of ten. maybe a bit high, but it's so worth seeing.

mpaa rating pg-13my rating: 10 and upmy * rating 9.5/10william h. macy delivers a stunning performance as the role of mr. neuman. he makes you feel sympathetic and scared for him simultaniously. the story starts out as a comedy and slowly but steadily becomes almost like a horror film with twists and turns that macy effortly masters. i couldn't take my eyes off this film even after it ended, and i couldn't beleive it ended when it did. a must to see.this paragraph may be considered a spoiler by someafter you watch the film, look at the plot this way: the neumans are the united states as a whole, and the charactor meat loaf aday plays is the people in the united states who are anti-semetic.this was a very enjoyable film and would reccomend to anyone i saw in the street.

focus is an engaging story told in urban, wwii-era setting. william macy portrays everyman who is taken out of his personal circumstances and challenged with decisions testing his values affecting the community. laura dern, macy and david paymer give good performances, so also the good supporting ensemble.

i'm a huge fan of legendary director elia kazan . his movies often deal with people trying to overcome their weaknesses. be it obsessive love in 'splendor in the grass, poverty in "a tree grows in brooklyn" or racism in "gentlemen's agreement." while looking for other movies made by kazan, i stumbled across a movie that was based on a novel by arthur miller. the movie called "focus" stars william h.macy (who happens to be one of my favorite actors) and laura dern. it deals with anti-semitism in a very realistic way. macy's character seems to go along with the bigots in his neighborhood and on his job, until it affects him personally. that's the key here... the reason he acted wasn't because he knew it was wrong and he wanted to take a stand, he acted because he was now considered an outsider, and he began to experience the same looks, the same remarks, and the same brutally that mr. finklestein (david pamyers)experienced .the movie is very well written and well acted. meat loaf does a awesome job of playing a dirt bag! both macy and dern's performances are outstanding! it's easier in life to go along with, instead of going against. sometimes in order for people to take a stand things have to impact their lives, or the lives of their loved ones...only then will some find their moral compass.

this is a movie about a man everybody thinks is jewish.this is a movie about lawrence newman, who lives in brooklyn in the 1940's, at the time of wwii.one day, when he gets himself glasses, people start thinking he's a jew.and that only, because he looks like one.and he lives in a very antisemitic neighborhood.so some people start treating him like dirt.they make that judgment, being a jew, of larry's fresh wife, gertrude hart, too.that makes their lives unbearable.neal slavin's focus (2001) is a fairly good look at the antisemitism.that's a problem that won't go away.the movie is based on athur miller's novel, which, i admit, i haven't read.but the movie is really good, so i'm sure the book would also.the actors do good job.william h.macy is always good, and his work as larry newman is brilliant.laura dern is gert hart and she's magnificent.meat loaf is almost scary as the neighbor who wants to keep jews out by any means necessary.david paymer's character as the jewish shop-owner mr. finkelstein is the most sympathetic in the movie.paymer is the perfect choice for the role.one of the greatest scenes is in the end when mr.finkelstein and newman fight against those nazi-like people with baseball bats.they join together to fight the evil.the christian and the jew.

well acted drama based on a novel by arthur miller. something as simple as a pair of glasses becomes life altering. lawrence newman(william h. macy)is a man that has chosen to be satisfied with his mundane life; the same job for twenty years and still living with his mother. he is told by his boss to correct his vision with a pair of glasses. newman's life drastically changes and delves him into hell. the glasses he chose makes him look jewish. he looses his job and becomes the object of heavy scrutiny by his brooklyn neighborhood. searching for a job, he encounters the attractive and outspoken gertrude(laura dern), herself living with conflict because of her jewish appearance. soon the couple's new life together becomes a nightmare filled with humiliation and bigotry driven attacks. a very apt cast that features: joseph ziegler, peter oldring, kay hawtrey and of musical fame, meat loaf.

the first reviewer is right - in this movie we see ourselves, snuggling up to the majority, being agreeable, trying to stay out of trouble, just trying to live our lives, and we see how easily these very human traits, so fundamental to the functioning of society, can lead us to become complicit in a great evil.the story is set during world war ii, with the radio, newspapers and movies reminding us of hitler's attacks on jews to underscore the irony of the same kind of violent anti-semitism taking place in america. at times that seemed a little heavy-handed to me.it feels more like a play than a movie, but it's so thought-provoking that such quibbles mean little. perhaps less trivial is the fact that the entire plot hinges one one little fact that struck me as rather implausible. larry has lived an uneventful life until middle age; yet all it takes is his beginning to wear a pair of spectacles for everyone - everyone - to, at the first glance, take him for a jew. i willingly suspended disbelief because the plot kept me moving forward, but the implausibility did bother me throughout the film. (and, quite frankly, i didn't understand why his wife was also taken for a jew. larry seemed to think so because her name was "hart." and later when he married her, i don't know why his neighbours assumed she was jewish.) for the first part of the film i wondered if there were going to be elements of fantasy. larry's unassumingness seemed exaggerated, almost to the point of the grotesque. why not call the police on seeing the rape, even if the attacker was a neighbour? and i thought the lighting seemed to suggest something slightly unreal - the red of the houses seemed too red, gertrude's entrance seemed deliberately overlit, generally the colours were almost crayon-like in their intensity.in the credits i see that it was filmed on campbell avenue and wallace avenue in toronto, so i plan to drive down there (near bloor & dufferin) today to check out the colours. really :) it was good to be reminded that the clergy at that time were often leading the evil of racism. (remember how the pope refused to speak out against hitler, seeking only to get protection for the church? it was the same pope, by the way, who, when rome was about to be liberated by american troops, requested that the first soldiers to enter the city not be black. check your history.) i don't recall ever hearing of this movie before. that's a shame. it certainly is of great interest to every thinking person, to everyone interested in american history or racism; it's one of the clearest illustrations i've ever seen of bertrand russell's dictum, "do not go with a crowd to do evil."

i just saw it at the toronto international film festival. director neal slavin's impressive starring cast includes william macy (seen in the contender at last year's tiff), meat loaf (aka meat loaf aday, aka michael lee aday), david paymer, and laura dern (also starring in novocaine, also at this year's festival).based on the arthur miller novel by the same name, focus follows christian but "jewish-looking" lawrence newman (macy) as he struggles among the hatred and anti-semitism in his neighbourhood. pitted between the jewish store-owner down the street (paymer) and his card-carrying anti-semite next door neighbour (meat loaf) newman faces difficulty in dealing with inner conflict and conflict around him. guilt over knowing what's right but not doing anything battles with wanting to blend in and keep peace with the neighbours. things gets more complex when he meets and marries gertrude (dern) who everyone thinks is jewish. gertrude teaches her husband a few things about judging books by covers.will newman stick up for the jewish man in the end or will he flee? go see it to find out.the acting was fabulous. the writing was incredible. the cinematography was excellent. the sound was well done. technically amazing, the movie was disturbing. chilling. emotionally intense. i found myself bringing my knees up into the fetal position a couple of times. i have great admiration for everyone who worked on it. i have not seen a film this good in a long time. it touched me.wow.

some people think this was a rather bad tv series, with cheesy effects. (considering it was filmed between 1977-1979) but really, look back at those years and think, "we didn't have computers back then." so if you think about it, it's a rather good tv series.i always figured bad ratings killed the show, but no. the network did. they canceled out their theme as "the superhero network" and abandoned a short lived spider-man series. if it had gone on, it probably would have run well into the 80's, and if it was really lucky (and i mean really lucky), the early 90s.and no one wanted to pick this series up.anyways, jolly old (or young) nicholas hammond, of the sound of music fame, is brought to the tv screen as peter parker, the secret identity of the amazing spider-man. along the series, peter deals with a clone, a beautiful girl from a foreign country, and a corrupt politician.while the series is way out of timeline (being that peter is already graduated from university, and thats when he gets bit, and uncle ben is already dead,) the audience is treated to action, suspense, and the attitude that the characters have towards peter and his alter ego, spider-man.while it's also slightly disappointing that robert. f simon looks nothing like j.j.jameson, it's not so disappointing that betty grant isn't betty grant, but a hot african american girl (who reminds me of halle berry, who is one of the hottest women on the planet) so really, this one wasn't so bad.but considering the time, and how much drama they packed into this one, it kind of foreshadows what bad tv is today. either way, it's entertaining, even for today.8/10

hoot is a nice young person's film about a group of middle school kids that try and keep a pancake house chain from bulldozing a plot of land that is home to some endangered burrowing owls. the acting is pretty good and the fresh faces are nice to see. many well known comedians are in this film and keep the humor going almost nonstop. it is a film for the young crowd, perhaps 5 to 11 years of age. i thought it was a nice change of pace from the adult films that pervade the screen these days. there is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or kids. it's just a bunch of fun with a constant message about saving the beautiful places in this country from becoming over developed. if you can remember back to the day when you weren't fight for a buck you may remember that money isn't everything. not many people over 12 are going to enjoy it unless they really have a soft spot for the old after school special series.

i took a group of young people who were the same age as the protagonists and it appealed to us all. i agree with the other post, the wilson guy worked a thankless script into a great minor character. it is good to have a movie for a certain age demographic (too old for pg, too young for r). it also shows how they think and maneuver in junior high school. you had to love how well jimmy buffet did as the cool teacher. he kept us adults awake. the level of kids questioning authority was kept reasonable. their motives were specific and not like some a.d.d. rebel. the setting and music were beautiful. overall, if you enjoyed holes, this is really similar.

i took my younger niece to an early showing and she loved it (i enjoyed it myself as well). i don't need to explain the plot, since the movie remains completely true to the award-winning, top-selling book by famed author carl hiaasen. the movie takes the popular book and layers it with beautiful cinematography (i want to go to florida now!), humor (thanks to funny-man, luke wilson and some new-comers), and great music! i have to get to get a jimmy buffet cd now! i know a movie is good when i get goose-bumps in the end. overall, it was great family film that i felt comfortable taking my younger niece to. i'd recommend it to any and everyone.

if you read the book by carl hiaasen, the movie follows pretty much true to form, with a few minor changes for hollywood. in my opinion this is a great family movie. luke wilson (officer delinko)pretty well steals the show from an all-star cast that includes robert wagner and jimmy buffet. the kids in the movie do a great job led by logan lerman, brie larson, and cody linley.brie larson is maybe a little too petite to play beatrice. i pictured a bigger girl, maybe 6 foot, 175 lbs, in the role of beatrice. this might have made her more believable in her role of beating up dana. they should have developed her "tough girl" character more, and had her bite through a tire, or kick a soccer ball through a person. she is very pretty, and i understand why she was cast, she is a box office attraction.this is about as pg as a movie gets these days, no sex, and very little violence. this movie is a parents'dream come true, a movie with a strong environmental message, with kids that have deep appreciation for the beauty of florida and its wildlife. it shows how adults have fallen short in the stewardship of our planet, and that our children can demand better. one of my favorite lines in the movie is when mullet fingers says, "florida could use some mountains like montana. florida is so flat there is nothing to stop developers from clearing it coast to coast". also, the photography of florida wildlife spoke volumes without dialog. as a family movie with kids ages 5-15, this is a great movie! as a bonus parents' will be entertained, especially if they're "parrotheads".

in 'hoot' logan lerman plays roy eberhardt, the new kid in school who has just moved from montana. but florida is a lot different from montana. despite is troubles in blending in, roy discovers a bigger problem. a new franchise restaurant is coming to town and families of burrowing owls are in trouble. can the new kid, a tomboy (brie larson) and a runaway (cody linley) stop big business from destroying these owls' home? this movie was pretty good. the kids (logan lerman, brie larson and cody linley) are the real stars of this film. luke wilson (officer delinko) is okay, but really does not have a very big part. neither does robert wagner (mayor) or jimmy buffett (mr. ryan).nevertheless this was a fun film that the whole family will enjoy. for a first time producer, i thought jimmy buffett put together a quality piece of work. plus the owls were really cute.

what a refreshing change from the pg movies that have teen girls jumping in and out of bed, young high school boys counting how many girls they can "hook up" with, kids drinking, doing drugs, etc., etc., etc. carl hiaasen has written so many books that are enjoyable but hardly classic literature. but he has finally written something that middle school kids want to read. and this movie sends a message to kids that maybe they can make a difference, that maybe their voices can be heard. filmed in south florida, the scenery is beautiful and natural and real. who cares if its predictable, and a little corny. so was free willy and look how well that did. this is a good family movie..........a rare breed.

it is great to see a film starring kids whose idea of "acting adult" is not engaging in sensuality. instead, these kids see a problem in their community and take responsibility for helping to solve it. hoot is a film aimed squarely at families looking for a fun day at the cinema. the production values are good, especially sweeping shots of montana and florida. the soundtrack by jimmy buffet is a perfect fit. the young actors are spirited and refreshing.the plot, about a trio of kids who work together to save some burrowing owls from death at the hands of an unscrupulous pancake house empire builder, will engage kids. so many films make children appear powerless, it is nice to see a movie that shows children working hard to make a difference. and even though parents are absent or temporarily distracted, it was pleasant to see kids who want to follow in their parents footsteps and try to right injustices.if you are tired of all of the self-indulgent story lines about children that fill the cinema, give hoot a shot. then take some time to talk to your kids about the adventure of serving others and caring about the world they live in. a positive message from a positive film.

a movie like this doesn't come along too often. i'm surprised it took 9 years to finally see it. politicians and civilian hawks should view this before making decisions on how the destroy peoples lives, i watched this the day after viewing the tv version of "uprising" about the warsaw ghetto. even with this fresh in mind i felt sympathy for the german soldier. i felt sympathy for all parties that this tragedy could happen. it will take awhile to thaw out from this one. i'm surprised they have not made a movie based on "the forgotten soldier" by buy sajer. this movie shares the cold with the book. both will haunt me for the rest of my life.

this movie shocked me. it was so realistic and the story was incredible touching. they talk german and russian, which makes it more believable and real. this is a must-see movie. the actors are great too. really a good piece of work. the plot takes place within a german troop in wwii. they have to go to stalingrad, sovjet, to fight against the sovjetian armies. you get more connected with every soldier in this group and follow them through all the perils as they get captured within stalingrad. they get face-to-face meetings with death, blood, grief and the coldness of russia. this is a must-see-movie and you cant afford not to see it.

i just recently saw this movie in hopes of seeing an accurate portrayal of the bloodiest battle of the 20th century. i got what i had expected and so much more. just to think i came across this movie by luck, before i had never even heard of it. it's a german film made in 1993 so i suppose i can't be surprised that it's almost completely unknown to the modern american audience. it's a shame cause this really is a remarkable film, i dare say that its as good if not better then platoon, full metal jacket, apocalypse now, and all quiet on the western front; all of which are iconic war movies.1942: world war ii is in full swing. nazi germany has over run mainland europe and parts of north africa, then adolf hitler orders the full scale invasion of the soviet union. a fateful move that ultimately dooms nazi germany to defeat. in the early stages the invasion goes well and the german armies conquer large sections of soviet territory, but a critical battle ensues at stalingrad, a city that hold great symbolic & strategic value. the battle soon turns into a blood bath of epic proportions, a nightmare for both the german & russian soldiers fighting. on the verge of taking the city the germans are suddenly counter attacked by the russians who end up cutting off the entire german 6th army inside stalingrad. to make matters worse, the russian winter arrives causing incredible suffering for the germans. this entire battle is seen through the eyes of a few young german soldiers fighting for survival not only against the russians and the harsh winter conditions but also against their own sadistic officers who care only about medals & glory and the generals who have little regard for the average foot soldier.this film is going to haunt me for a while. the german soldiers the film concentrates on are so young and naive, then their humanity & sanity are stripped from them and you really do feel sorry for them cause their not the demonic nazi's often portrayed in film. everything they were fighting for is no longer important, and everything they believed in was shattered, and after fighting a gruesome battle against the russians inside stalingrad we see them further deteriorate with the onset of winter causing many to freeze to death. the battle & winter scenes were like a horrible nightmare but it also felt so real. it's amazing, in the beginning we see strapping young men in the prime of their life, and at the end they a shells of their former selves stripped of everything. after witnessing so much carnage these men just loose their will to live on, it was really sad. when there is finally a moment of hope they are betrayed by hitler who ultimately abandons these men to a horrible death, which is just another one of hitler's crimes abandoning the men who fought for him to be slaughtered by the russians. a good anti-war film depicts the horrors of war and that's what this movie does. the battle for the tractor factory sequence is the closest thing that comes to hell on earth, but that's really what the battle for stalingrad was like. the german & russian soldiers were depicted with humanity, it was only the bad apples (specifically on the german side) that doomed the men. bottom line is this film is amazing cause we see how men breakdown physically & emotionally during war. we all have our limits and these men were pushed far beyond their limits in the most deadly battle of our time. what the average foot soldier endured at stalingrad was beyond imagination. even if they had survived everything they had seen & done would have scarred them for life.stalingrad shows us why war is hell, and what exactly hell looks like.

apart from the low budget, there never seems to be more than 50 germans in one scene at any one time, plus the same 2 half tracks, this film is absolute top class. everything is accurate. that is the point, i think, from the uniforms to to the horror and the disillusionment.everyone is as grey as the field grey uniforms. grey men with the life drained out of them. forget us made gung ho rubbish like blackhawk down and private ryan. this is one of the best war films ever. only cross of iron beats this for tension and story. please could we have a proper un-dubbed german language with english subtitles version in the uk ? without having to pay ridiculous import charges from europe. most other dvd's are multilingual. why not this one ?

simply the best and most realistic movie about world war ii i've ever seen. not only because the german soldiers talk german and russian soldiers talk russian (no english in a german or russian dialect)also because of the realistic decor in which the movie was shot. the acting is outstanding. no hollywood-sentiment at all even no love story...stalingrad was supposed to be one of the most horrific battles during the war, and in such context there's no place for sentiment or romantic scenes. what you get is a movie which will make you thrill to the bone and which have one of the best unhappy endings a movie could have.

if we compare the movie industry with an ocean, we have the tendencies to observe only the surface. driven by the strong hollywood marketing force, we all saw war movies like saving private ryan, the thin red line, apocalypse now or full metal jacket. but underneath the splashy waves grow in silence, from time to time, less known pearls. when you pick one and look carefully at it, you wonder why this pearl lie almost unknown and why it's not already on the crown."stalingrad" is such a gem. why, it has a bunch of multi-million dollars rated actors? no. it have thousand of extras? no. it have breathtaking, spectacular, shiny computerized visual effects?. not at all. so, what's so special? well, in one word, it's pure past reality recreated and transposed to celluloid fifty years later. the tragedy of the most bloody battle in the history is here. filthy, wounded soldiers, russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion, burning villages, collapsing buildings, decayed suburbs, gunfires, explosions, tanks in flames, soldiers shot, burned alive, ground by tanks in their pits or shred to pieces - you got all. but the real horror is elsewhere. people are reduced to simple pawns, without the power to change anything. the soldiers we follow in film try to leave the combat zone and they fail. the civilians stay in prostration in the middle of nowhere, only crying for their children killed. mercyless, the huge grinding machine of war melt together humans, equipment, villages, cities - and ask for more victims and destruction, over and over.in all this collective insanity a group of german soldiers struggle to survive and to keep at least a minimum level of normality. they do their duty and fight bravely. but, as everyone know, a battle is almost lost when people start to loose confidence and faith. we see how all those people are abandoned, how they plan to desert, how they struggle to catch the very last plane to berlin (full of wounded), how some very bad injured soldiers were treated as simulants and shot, how they were forced to execute a small group of russian civilians, including a young boy, how they later discovered a place literally full up to the ceiling of food and drinks - destined only for some "superior" officers, of course. one by one, they drop dead. the end of the movie is one of the most bitter, depressing and touching ending i ever saw, all on the magnificent score of the munich philarmonic orchestra. the war destroyed everything in its path.this movie is a must-see for everyone. a true movie-lover should have it in his/her collection. the strong anti-war message must be a warning for all of us. unfortunately, the mankind never learn, nor the politicians. self-destruction is in our dna and the human pain seem to last forever. can we be enough reasonable to stop the war?

ben (a fine charles bateman), his young daughter k.t. (a cute geri reischl), and his new girlfriend nicky (the extremely attractive ahna capri) are on their way to a birthday party for k.t. they unexpectedly get waylaid in a remote southern town where no-one is able to leave, and with the exception of ben, k.t., and nicky, no-one can get in either. to top that off, children are disappearing and adults are being murdered at an alarming rate. ben helps some of the locals - sheriff pete (l.q. jones), tobey (alvy moore), and jack (charles robinson), the local priest, try to solve the mystery.this early 70's devil-themed horror movie actually predates "the exorcist", and combines a "bad day at black rock" type plot of a rural town with a great big skeleton in its closet with horror elements, for interesting results. it actually sent a few chills down my spine this viewing, as it inexorably moves along its ominous path. the moody and solemn atmosphere is established quickly and holds for the duration; the ever-growing sense of panic gives it a real kick. some memorable set pieces include the bizarre opening of a toy tank turning into a real one and squashing a car flat, not to mention nickys' twisted nightmare, vividly and stylishly realized by director bernard mceveety and crew. jaime mendoza-navas' music is subtly sinister and gives it that extra sense of eeriness.the steadfast and professional cast does some fine work, especially the ever engaging strother martin as the affable doc duncan, and producers / actors l.q. jones and alvy moore.just the fact that the whole plot is right under the noses of our heroes makes it that much more scary. jack the priest starts leading them in the right direction, but will they be in time to put a stop to things? it's an enjoyable little chiller worth re-visiting; just speaking for myself, i was able to appreciate it a lot more after giving it a second chance. i can say now that yes, it is indeed under-rated, telling a good story in an interesting, unconventional, and effective way.8/10

a family is traveling through the mid west. there's widower ben (charles bateman), his girlfriend nicky (ahna capri) and ben's little daughter k.t. (geri reischl). then hit a town named hillsboro where everyone acts more than a little strangely. their car breaks down and they're forced to stay. they soon find out a witches coven has a spell over the town and is up to incredible evil.the story is not that good. people just figure things out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the witches are at the end. also there are a lot of loopholes left dangling at the end. the acting is pretty poor too. bateman and capri are bland and everybody else is about the same. only old pros strother martin and l.q. jones give good performances. still this movie does work. it forgoes blood and gore (there's some but this is pg) and manges to work with some very creepy visuals and atmosphere. the acting hampers a lot of it but it still works. martin especially chews the scenery in his role. i can't explain exactly why i (sort of) like this movie but it did work on me. it's a quiet kind of horror that isn't made anymore. hardly a masterwork but this deserves to be rediscovered. a 7.

the '70s were a great time for horror movies. the brotherhood of satan is yet another overlooked gem. it's full to the brim with great surreal, unsettling scenes. it's also great to see stother martin and l.q. jones (who also produced) in decent roles.some of it is a little dated and cheesy, but the brotherhood of satan kicks butt over race the devil and many other '70s satanism flicks.

susan sarandon. she made this movie for me. i've never appreciated her acting more than as i did in this movie. she really acted as though she were adele august. i can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who's truly believable. natalie portman as ann august helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie. the movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral.i gave this movie an eight rating, but susan received a ten from me because of her performance. as far as relationship movies go, beaches and terms of endearment had a greater impact on me than this movie, but i highly recommend it.

it´s a movie to see on tv and only once.. i mean, it´s good, but it´s a little too lengthy and the plot is so well-known, it isn´t very original but it isn´t boring. the best thing of the movie are the performances, natalie portman and susan sarandon are great actress and in this movie they have done a great job. i give it a 7.

i was laying in bed, flicking through the channels... and boy do i have channels... 500 of them. with over 70 movie channels, i probably watch a movie on cable, once or twice a month... dvd has spolied me.anyway, i'm flicking through and i come to this movie and because i see natilie portman, i take interest. 110 minutes later i am still interested. how could this be? when i first saw the previews to this movie in the theater i remember making fun of it. i never thought i'd watch it... nevermind like it.the story is based on a book, and you can tell. the movie is very episodic, andit's not like the movie has a great plot, it just sucks you in. may-be its that performances that do it. i'm pretty sure in must have been.this movie was good for no reason...peter's movie rating (out of 10): 7

i was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script. susan sarandon plays the part of a flighty, irrational and possessive mother, who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together. she removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in hollywood. the daughter is dubious, but at first she has no choice--- the bond with mother is pathologically strong.in time the girl sees that the mother is off into flights of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground. she sees her mother go head over heels for a handsome, seductive guy who loves 'em and leaves 'em. she sees that the mother doesn't get it. so how can she look to her mother for guidance?the mother directs the girl to a drama try-out and sees the daughter act out the part of the mother in such a way that a shockingly painful mirror is held up to the fly-by-night mother. this causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified at the impact on the mother and is apologetic, but the lesson takes hold.there is character-growth as the mother realizes her selfish claim on the daughter and eventually is persuaded to let the girl go. it is a touching scene and a valuable lesson, that parents, however emotionally dependent, have to let the child go and become her own separate person.

anywhere but here is not exactly anything new, but the excellent performances by both of the main actresses made it worth watching. sarandon and portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural wisconsin to sunny beverly hills, california, in search of a better life. the main conflict comes from the fact that natalie would much rather have stayed in wisconsin with all of her friends and family, and she felt that she was forced to go to california with her overbearing mother. (spoilers) while it's true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable, susan sarandon and especially natalie portman give performances that are so good that they almost make the material seem new. anywhere but here doesn't cover any new ground, but it does have the rare quality of being able to take overused subject matter and make it fairly interesting again. also seen in this movie is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen in years, seen on natalie portman's face when her mother drops her off on the side of the road and she watches the car fade into the distance. particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot about natalie's mother pressing her to become an actress, as well as a very convincing performance from shawn hatosy as one of natalie's very close cousins from back home. his death is a tragic cliché almost always seen in movies like this one, but the rest of the film makes up for numerous weaknesses like this. not great, but anywhere but here is definitely worth a look.

chick flick? of course.... been done before? many times.... predictable? yes..... worth watching? you bet! i was delighted with sarandon and portman's portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line. i am a great fan of mother/daughter stories. what makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones are the performances and the character development. although this is not the best of its genre, i will buy it and watch it again. i felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior.

regarded as another one of the recent over-the-top drama's brought upon us by hollywood, this movie excels where others have totally failed(especially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of natalie portman), this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both susan and natalie share. they seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family. they go through so many mother-daughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities. i feel that these two actress' talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar (full of cliche's) and really saved the suffering plot. i would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of the two actresses or such over-the-top drama's.

when taken as a whole for its ideas and dissection of the current 2-party system and political process, i think this is a great film. granted the movie was not the comedy i expected, but once i got over that this film really made me think. so much of what we see and hear in regards to any election is such a joke. there is in particular a debate scene in this movie that i felt was a masterful critique of our political debates and how policies are "discussed" at them. i encourage anyone who thinks our process is fine to go see this film. if you want something to laugh at however, robin williams and christopher walken are not their usual selves. in this movie they show us that the truth hurts, not that the truth is funny.

i completely disagree with the other comments! i too saw this film at an early screening and found it quite enjoyable. robin williams is in top form. true, the tone is familiar, but it is williams of good morning vietnam: smart, funny, on point. after too many dark turns, williams is finally back to what he does best. the supporting actors give great performances, especially laura linney and chris walken. chris plays himself, as usual, but as the "agent" to the next president he was a delight each time on screen. lewis black plays only himself basically, but he is wonderfully well used here. there is also a fun turn by jeff goldblum. the movie is more than what the trailer suggests, as well. the movie is funny, but it is not a pure comedy as suggested. it has a bit of a thriller line, which everyone should seriously consider, especially if you pay attention to the newspaper.

"man of the year" tells the story of tom dobbs (robin williams) a political comedian (like jon stewart or stephen colbert) who has his own television show. on his show he talks about all sorts of things but his main focus are political issues which he is very opinionated about. one day on his show, a fan from the audience raises the idea that dobbs should run for president of the united states. after that episode aired, millions flocked to the web to create various petitions and voice their opinions on why dobbs would make a great candidate for the president for the united states. a few weeks later, dobbs decides to run for president and low and behold wins the election. everything seems to be going as planned until a woman by the name of eleanor green (laura linney) shows up and starts some controversy regarding his position. a funny yet serious political thriller ensues man anyone walking into this film expecting to see a brainless comedy will surely be disappointed. i always wonder how some people are film marketers when i see how misleading their marketing campaigns. "man of the year" is a great example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything from the poster, to the trailer, to the online advertisements makes this movie look and feel like a comedy. i would honestly have to say about 1/3 of the film is funny while the rest of it plays off as a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows its audience to think. i kind of wonder in this case if the marketing was done on purpose since this film addresses pretty serious issues in-between its comedy routine.but enough about marketing, lets get down to the film itself.i really liked "man of the year" even though i was expecting to see a comedy instead of a serious film. one of the many things i will give this film credit for is that the film does a decent job switching between comedy and drama even though at first it seems a little awkward. i really think that after you figure this out that the movie is going to be more of a political thriller than a comedy you get comfortable with it. some may not because they are lead to believe that they are seeing a comedy and don't understand what this film is trying to say in the end but for those people they can blame the marketers for not advertising this film right."man of the year" talks about a lot of things and seems to have a very strong opinion. as tom dobbs speaks he is saying things that need to be said and isn't about candy coating them. i also think the whole political subplot, while most critics say hurt the film probably again because of the misleading marketing, was very good. the idea of computerize voting has been tossed around the last few years and with all the problems computers have the issue being addressed in this film could surely be realistic. also the control big businesses have over voting also gets addressed.as far as acting goes, i think everyone involved did a good job. robin williams had a chance to be funny yet serious at the same time by playing tom dobbs. some say that williams has overstayed his welcome as a comedian but i personally still think he is funny and he's a good serious actor as well. this is probably one of the few occasions though that we get to see him go back and forth from serious to funny and i think it works well. also it's nice to see lewis black co-star in a decent film. again i like black when he appears on "the daily show" and does stand up however most of the films he has been in were awful. this was a good movie for him because i think his political views fit in with the story that director barry levinson was trying to convey. laura linney is a fine addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress and lastly christopher walken and jeff goldblum both do a very good job as always with this roles handed to them."man of the year" was written and directed by barry levinson, the man who has brought us such films as "rain man," "good morning vietnam," and "wag the dog." levinson does a fine job writing the film and directing it. like i said i know a lot of critics didn't like the whole political thriller aspect of the film but i thought it fit in nicely. it was actually nice to watch a mainstream movie that allowed me to both think and laugh at the same time. barry levinson did a fine job with this film.in the end, don't go into this film expecting to see the movie that the commercials are selling you. it does have laughs but at the same time it plays off more as a political drama. it's not as stupid or silly as the marketing campaign leads you to believe. i really liked the fact that this film that this film wasn't a typical hollywood film. it tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and worked at least for me. i like the fact that the film didn't really tone down any of the issues it addressed nor did it have a typical hollywood ending. i was trying to call the ending from the get go but surprisingly it didn't end the way i thought which made me happy. it's a movie that will make you laugh but then a few minutes later allow you to think and wonder what's going to happen next. i think its a good movie that will be hurt by its bad marketing.

leno talks through his punch lines. this spoils the joke, for those of you who haven't figured it out. his show is held in a micro sized studio for a reason, or two reasons -- the small amount of laughter will be amplified, and few want to see him. letterman's set is the polar opposite -- ed sullivan would be proud and the balcony is always full.nbc, tacky nbc, will never get it. founder david sarnoff's megalomaniacal enterprise continues to be all about the money. at least cbs has a bit of a family feel to it.leno collects cars, or is it stamps, while letterman races cars. the difference is informative.when i chatted i used to ask other chatters to email me if leno _ever_ said something that was funny. i never got a single email. letterman has superb timing. he also can re-use the most unfunny joke in such a way that it becomes one of the funniest things in that night's show.letterman has built other careers. paul is now well known and respected in his own musical right. even paul's other band members get recognition and career boosting. biff henderson has become a name america knows of. even the businesses in the same block as the ed sullivan theater get a boost. what has leno ever done for anyone else? personally, i am glad that dave moved and leno got the carson gig. i never watched nbc shows before and had no reason to after.the top ten list is an american icon. so is letterman. leno is a caricaturist's dream, nothing more.

now, i'm a bit biased, since i'm a big fan of late night television. i've been a loyal fan of jay leno for about 6 or 7 years, and think he's one of the funniest, most talented comedians out there. and david letterman is one hell of a comedian as well, though i only watch his show (unless jay's a repeat) during commercials or when he has a better guest than jay on the show. daniel roebuck and john michael higgins are both fine actors and they very much resembled jay and dave, but did they disappear into the characters? nope. roebuck barely nails down jay's voice and expression, mumbling at a high pitch, sounding like a castrati marlon brando. higgins nails down david's facial expressions (for example, his trademark squirm) but he doesn't nail down dave's voice. those who aren't big fans of late night tv might be a lot less biased. there's a couple comedians who can do dead-on impersonations of jay. why couldn't they have selected one of them for the part? and the same goes with dave. i'd rather they had norm mcdonald play the part. norm doesn't look a hell of a lot like dave, but he did a great impersonation of him on snl. "hey...you got any gum?" that was so hilarious!however, i learned a lot about the late night wars which i had very little knowledge of at first. i never watched "the tonight show" prior to when jay leno was host, so i didn't know about the struggle to finally replace johnny carson and the countless negotiations that finally convinced dave to move to cbs. i knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and found the film very enlightening. and kathy bates gives a knockout performance as the foul-mouthed former executive producer of "the tonight show." she basically steals the film. my score: 7 (out of 10) 

i remember this movie getting a lot of flak from reviewers when it was new. letterman and leno themselves had objections. letterman called it (paraphrasing) the biggest waste of film he'd ever seen, and leno objected to the simpleton portrayal of himself. but letterman had john michael higgins as a guest on his show so it seems he didn't take anything too personally. a dvd re-release, with opinions and such from those involved, could be interesting, though i suspect the days when late night talkshow wars captivated the nation are gone and not returning soon.i preferred the letterman impersonation to the leno, but could never buy in to either. they never rose above caricature, and i never simply accepted them as actors. for comparison: paul sorvino as kissinger in oliver stone's "nixon" comes to mind as an impersonation which may have seemed laughable in the first few moments but which seemed at least plausible after the first moments of amusement wore off.the highlight of the show for me was treat williams as michael ovitz. williams' speech to letterman was not as great as but reminiscent of alec baldwin's entrance (and quick exit) as blake in glengerry glen ross.they could have done more with johnny's role in all this. i know he was mostly uninvolved in the events portrayed in this movie, and most audiences will be familiar with his reputation such that johnny carson needs no introduction. but more context about why dave and jay and all comedians revere johnny would have given this flick the substance it lacks in being a gossip film.guess i should read the book...rich little imitating johnny carson, unfortunately, came across as nothing more than rich little imitating johnny carson.i tell you what, after watching this movie, then watching either the letterman or leno show, all i want to do is crack open my johnny carson dvds and see the real thing.

i thought anywhere but here was a good movie.it stars two wonderful actresses, susan sarandon and natlie portman, which when i heard they were in a movie together i resist watching it.overall, it was a pretty enjoyable movie.it had it's moments where i felt as if they tried to hard, and there was also some really overdone and worn-out material, but there wasn't anything in the movie that i absolutely hated.i even liked how they used the pop-up performance of the uncredited thora birch, and all the little happy/sad moments are touching and effective.if you want to watch this movie, go ahead, because even though i don't recommend it, it's not something you should avoid, and a 5.9 rating seems unfair in my opinion.

this film is about a single mother who is happy go lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible, and her sensible teenage daughter who is undergoing adolescent turmoils."anywhere but here" is an engaging film from beginning to the end. both ann and adele are described well right at the start, so we get to know how different their personalities are. clashes inevitably ensue, and they are engagingly presented. i find myself so drawn to their state of minds and their circumstances. it is as if i am living their lives, feeling what they are feeling.susan sarandon gives another excellent performance in "anywhere but here". she is charismatic, happy go lucky, hedonistic, warm and loving all at once. i have always liked susan sarandon, and i think she is grossly underrated."anywhere but here" is a captivating emotional journey.

the main attraction of anywhere but here is the superb performance of natalie portman. she gave her rather thankless character a lot of much-appreciated emotional depth. susan sarandon, a fine actress, is suitably sincere as the mother figure. i thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable, a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script. i am not saying the script was bad in any way, i am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times. i don't think it was the script writer's fault. the film did suffer from being overlong, and became sometimes unfocused in the longer scenes. the film does look beautiful, with some good direction and excellent performances. all in all, watchable certainly, but maybe more for an older audience. 7/10 bethany cox.

i'm not a fan of this brand of comedy - stereotyped characters over-acting their way through a cops and robbers farce. but there are enough likable characters to sustain interest. michelle pfeiffer is adorable, but the person really carrying the film is dean stockwell, who steals every scene as the head mobster (named tony, no less). stockwell's performance is the reason i'm writing this review (and the only reason i'd recommend it), in fact. you'll be tickled by his screen time. he's plays the mob boss perfectly, with comedic touches in the right places, managing to avoid becoming an overbearing cliche. in fact, stockwell's a complete delight to watch - a master of the 'double take,' and a real 'looker' in those classy suits and fedoras. meesa says: a good film to watch while folding laundry or eating leftovers.

what happened to ava gardner in the 1940s and marilyn monroe in the '50s also seemed to take place for modern-day actress michelle pfeiffer in the '80s: her remarkable good looks got in the way of her being taken seriously as an accomplished, superbly talented actress. anyone looking for validation of pfeiffer's dramatic abilities need look no further than her work in 1991's "frankie and johnny" or '92's "love field" (a personal favorite of mine); those looking to see what a splendid comedic actress she can be, when given the right part, should check out 1988's "married to the mob." in this one, she plays angela demarco, the widow of a recently "iced" mob hit-man, who moves from her garishly tacky long island home to start a new life for herself and her son, while being pursued by mob boss dean stockwell and fbi man matthew modine. while this movie has lots going for it (a very amusing script; offbeat characters; sudden sharp turns to unexpected violence, as in director jonathan demme's previous effort "something wild"; and hilarious yet menacing performances by stockwell and mercedes ruehl, as his jealous wife from hell), michelle steals the show easily. notice how perfectly she nails angela's undereducated, long island italian accent, and the many fine mannerisms that she brings to the role to really flesh out this spunky and surprisingly bright character. once upon a time, long ago, oscars were handed out to actresses for comedic roles such as this one. had this film been made 60 years ago, michelle mighta been a contenduh...

first, don't be fooled by my family name. my mother was full blooded italian, so i really know italian families, and i love mobster movies, even the funny ones like this.for those people who have bad rapped this film (you know who you are) you should have your movie privileges taken from you because you don't know what good is. this is a damn funny and well-styled film. the fact that almost nobody is italian in it is part of the joke, so far as i can see. and what red-blooded straight male could complain about spending an hour and something with the likes of michelle pfieffer? puh-lease! when i saw this film it won me over with the opening song by rosemary clooney who was as irish as one can get, but her pronunciation of the italian words in "mambo italiano" is flawless and sets the tone of what is to follow perfectly. (hell, i even bought the record the next day because of it.) just the look of every garish thing in the apartment that i have personally seen in my relatives houses, though not in the same place (which i found hysterical) sold it for me.this movie is like goodfellas on laughing gas. i just wonder why there are no burger worlds and what happened to the food these guys were supposed to get? my guess is the crew ate it. "the fries are crispy. the shakes are creamy." my mouth is watering almost as much as it is thinking of the gorgeous ms. pfieffer. (and i never trusted clowns anyway.) and the three best things about this film are mercedes ruehl's achingly funny mob wife spurned, dean stockwell as her philandering husband tony "the tiger" and last, but definitely not least, the great mugging by oliver platt who should get more comic roles. and note to myself: find out where that black chick went. ouch! why does she work so infrequently? this picture is right alongside the great mob movies as it should be.

michelle pfeiffer and matthew modine are a joy to watch in this screwball comedy. alec baldwin, who was an up and coming star when the film was made, is a hoot. dean stockwell, in a sendup of john gotti, is hysterical. but mercedes ruehl, as the paranoid and over the top connie steals the movie.jonathan demme, previously known for wacky comedies like "something wild" and "melvin and howard"-proves once again that he is a genius. i was not surprised at all when he went on to win the oscar for directing "silence of the lambs." the performances he evokes from his actors in "married" are inspired, and the audience is taken along for a wild and wooly ride.one of the cutest, most endearing films of the 80's, it stands head and shoulders above many of the satires of its era.

this is a fun movie with subtle intention. its off-beat comedy is hilarious to me, unfunny to my friends. the soundtrack is perfect.i own this on vhs and i have watched it many, many times, because it's simply a fun and funny love story with great performances by all the principals (though using joan cusack solely as a perch for big hair was a waste of her talent. i know, i know, she was still young...).on a sad note, i decided to check out the dvd last night (instead of watching my vhs tape), and was shocked to find many crucial scenes cut. and on the copy i watched, there was no special feature of deleted scenes: it was as if the deleted scenes never existed!! i am so glad i bought the used vhs at a flea market.it is clear there was a great deal of choreography in this, which is another reason i love it so much. it takes great skill, talent, and genius to move around the scenes like mercedes ruehl, dean stockwell, and matthew modine do from scene to scene (note the scene when the grocery carts converge, the rolling on the floor during the shoot-out in miami, the chicken lickin' debacle, the foot massage, the salon hair-washing.) there is a very "theatrical" feel to this film, which may be the turn-off for so many whose poor reviews follow: i know some viewers who don't quite understand this style mistake the exaggerations and over-the-top performances for poor acting and worse direction. not so. jonathan demme does a great job bringing to life the entire company and their respective roles.the opening credits and first scene rank among my all-time favorites, as well (another favorite opening credits/first scene: fly away home).too bad matthew modine so ardently skipped out of the public eye; i really like him, and found his casting perfect in the role of mike smith. actually, this film is well-cast from soup to nuts: everyone is believable and true to his role. as for the question of expecting audience to accept pfeiffer and stockwell as italians - why not? i thought they pulled it off perfectly well.charming, fun, exciting... what is there not to like? if you want a little fun, watch this quirky, colorful adventure-mob-love story. if you are looking to learn more about organized crime and families, tune to hbo's the sopranos.

this is a romantic comedy, so it's really a fairy tale, but an unconventional one. cinderella, rather than living in the ashes, lives in an overdecorated castle in the suburbs with a good looking husband who's no prince. she does find her prince, but he's not that handsome. instead of a castle, at least initially, she gets a tiny walk-up in manhattan.pfeifer, stockwell and ruehl lead a cast of fully realized, if a little over-the-top, characters. demme reaches the highest level of movie-making in my mind. he creates a world i want to move into - a manhattan neighborhood and street life teeming with life and community.i wish imdb linked to reviewers' other comments. i'd like to know what other movies the people who panned this one hate. i am always looking for a lot of laughs and for nice places in which to "live" at least for an hour or so.

time does extraordinary things. it's the ultimate judge. time has granted "married to the mob" an extra doses of freshness. there aren't any dead moments or cheap shots. it's more of a delight now than it ever was. michelle pfeiffer creates a mafia widow that it's as far away from a caricature as anything she's ever done. a true original creation touching or hinting at the stereotype just to guide us through but her angela is quite unique. the legendary dean stockwell presents us with a a mafia boss that it's just as menacingly real as he is hilarious. and matthew modine? why did i think back then that he didn't have any chemistry with pfeiffer? i was wrong. they are wonderful together. they reminded me, this time, to the barbara stanwyck, fred macmurray of "remember the night" i'm writing this comment now to entice you to visit or revisit this jonathan demme gem.

this is probably the greatest war film and certainly one of the greatest films. there's no sentimentality, no patriotic agenda, not even a hopeful message of universal brotherhood in this bleak glimpse of what we can only call hell. it's this quiet rigor and lack of manipulation that give the film its astounding power. there aren't any attempts to make a hero out of ichikawa's protagonist tamura either. he's just a poor doomed sap trying to stay alive in a world of horror who hopes, but isn't sure, he can hang on to his humanity in the process. ichikawa's fierce lack of cant and illusion make fires on the plain stand alone. ichikawa died february 2008.

my first ichikawa in many years, and the first of his war films that i've seen, this was gripping and brutal from the very get-go. in the very first scene, nominal hero tamura is told that he can't continue on with his unit, to which he has returned from the hospital. he apparently has tb  but he is not sick enough for the hospital to take him given the quantity of war-wounded they have. but his old unit won't take him back either; his co gives him a grenade, and tells him that if he feels truly hopeless to blow himself upit's the honorable thing to do.the phillipines, 1945, and the situation really does seem hopeless, for pfc tamura and everyone else. nobi is an odyssey through hell, or rather hells  denuded forests, dead rocky plains, and the dead and dying japanese soldiers hoping just for an end, through peace or death. ichikawa's film is photographed in stunning b&w scope which serves to highlight both the desolation felt by tamura and those he meets on his journey towards his doom, and to show how truly small and naked they all are amidst the immensity of the mountains and the forests.this small affair of humans will end soon, the earth seems to be saying, but i will survive and barely notice it.tamura travels back towards the hospital, but is (not surprisingly) rejected there, and spends the rest of the film trying to stay alive, stay human, and get out of danger. he doesn't manage to do very well on any account, slowly starving and eventually committing some fairly repellent acts. eventually he hooks up with two other desperate men who have lost, or survived their units, and have resorted to cannibalismand in his weakened state facing other armed men, finds that the only way to live is to break with everything that he believes in.ichikawa's film is as brutal, uncompromising and intense as any war film i've seen. there are moments of humor and tenderness, but they are fleeting and don't stick in the memory such as the scene with the man on the mountaintop who practically begs tamura to eat his fleshthe recurring black-comic bit with tamura exchanging his ragged shoes for the better leathers of a fallen comrade.the degradations that humans will endure to survive.the truth that this is any war, all wars, all mankind as long as we continue thus. a masterpiece that i probably won't watch again for a long, long time. watched via the beautiful criterion collection dvd.

kon ichikawa had lived through world war two, and saw what its effects it had on his people in japan. but so did novelist shohei ooka, whose book was the inspiration for ichikawa's film, fires on the plain. it's a film about the men in this war, or perhaps more universally in wars in general, who lose their humanity. the soldiers trudging along through these fields and jungles of the philippenes in this story are almost completely without hope, if not already just that. it makes stone's platoon look like a picnic: at least they had certain things, like food, after all.they have little to no reserves or supplies or ammunition, no back-up, no sense of anything going their way in this combat that they've been thrust into. they can't even get some proper hospital care, unless if they can no longer walk at all or have lost limbs (for example, say, if you have tb, you're on your way). but its really through the prism of one soldier, a private tamura, that we get a full sense of the futility of war, both in its bleak scenes of nothingness and boredom and decay, and those flashes of intense and brutal violence.in the film tamura just wants to get some medical care. this is right at the start, and his told by his superior officer- already he is with eyes that stare off and an expression that has been drained by years of battle- that he will die if he doesn't find a hospital. he doesn't, really, but does end up in with some soldiers: at first with a platoon that seems to sort of have their act together, but is really led on by a power-hungry brute who just wants tamura's stash of salt, and then later with two other stray soldiers who are part of a group that had previously been ambushed while crossing a road at night.the story isn't entirely a straight line, but it doesn't need to be. tamura's path in fires on the plain is told in vignettes, little stories like when he comes upon a seemingly deserted enemy village. two of the populous comes back to get some supplies, and tamura sneaks up on them. it's an excruciating scene, since so far with tamura we haven't seen him do anything outright *wrong*, but he does so in this scene, not even so much out of evil but out of fear and desperation (this is also, without spoiling it, how he gets a stash of salt). little scenes build up so brilliantly and with devastation, like a simple task of finding a pair of walkable shoes, which there seem to be none. or when tamura, later in the film, discovers his teeth are becoming torn apart and falling out from lack of total hygiene. so much for food, so it goes.it should also be mentioned that this is a hauntingly realized film from ichikawa, shot in a stark black and white view of the fields and woods, the cinematography filling everything we see in black-blacks and white-hot white. ichikawa also makes sure to get everything authentic from his actors, not simply emotionally but with their own emaciated look and looks of desperation right on them. it's as if ichikawa has to have them all surviving the film as well as characters surviving out in the wild; by wild, by the way, i mean also cannibalism. the shock of this is two-fold; first is the way that a soldier says half-jokingly early on about eating other soldiers to tamaura, who asks if it was true and only in response getting a "don't ask" word of caution, and the second with the depiction of cannibalism itself, from the crazy starving man on the hill who pulls out guts out of his lap and says with a straight face to our hero that "you can eat me when i die." this makes thing especially more brutal when it comes to the director filming the brief 'action' scenes. these are, i would argue, more brutal than 'private ryan' in their depictions of violence in battle, the carnage that is completely random. a scene i would point to, and that contains just a shot that is excruciating to watch, is when from a high angle we see a group of about twenty soldiers walking slowly along, a hail of gunfire comes that kills only four or five, but it just happens so fast, and the soldiers just keep walking along at the same crawl. this isn't the only shot of horrible carnage that's shown - when needing to be bloody its there, but splashed across the screen like something completely of the macabre - but it drives the point completely.all of the acting is staggering (funakoshi especially, who looks to be both most at peace and most horrified by what he sees in the subtlest of looks most of the time), all of the major set-pieces provide something else to the gruesome experience, and it all amounts to the ultimate question with an anti-war film: how can, or why, do people fight in wars like these? it's almost too depressing to put into words, and so ichikawa pushes our noses right up into the muck and filth and blood and demands for us to take it in, so maybe, some day, it will never happen again. or one can hope this, by the end of such a bleak and great film as this.

an unflinching descent into psychological and physical oblivion that will undoubtedly burn images of the truthful brutality and suffering of war into your cerebral cortex in a way not many other films will. in fact, there is simply no other war film like it.director kon ichikawa witnessed the unthinkable horror of hiroshima first hand only 10 days after the bomb was dropped. he has said that from that day it would always be his mission to express the pointless, empty violence humans inflict on each other and themselves. mr. ichikawa shows us that there are no winners in war... for the paths to victory and defeat are paved with the same soldiers soullessly marching down roads which only have death and destruction at their end.mr. ichikawa succeeds in bringing his message to the world thru this haunting piece of cinema.

i saw this in 1993 on a vhs tape but have been unable to find it at any source since. this is a very bleak and uncompromising look at the last days of the japanese army in the phillipines. anyone with an interest in the pacific war would do well to view this film and see what conditions the other side fought under.from what i can tell, this is historically accurate, and depicts how easily men can descend into complete barbarism. i understand the japanese army was completely cut off from any re-supply in the phillipines by 1945, so there is no doubt many of the horrific incidents depicted here happened. i might not have been able to identify with the film's characters, but i appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive. if i had to compile a list of the ten greatest war films, this film would be on it. see it if you can get it.

fires on the plain (1959) ****you don't see films like this anymore. 'fires on the plain' is an incredible depiction of the lives of the soldiers of the japanese imperial army. kon ichikawa's masterpiece follows tamura, a soldier with tuberculosis as he wanders around the philippine landscape in the last year of the war. he is sent away to the hospital by his commanding officer only to be refused treatment and so he is sent back. his co tells him to go back and if they refuse him again then his last order is to kill himself with his grenade. he is refused again, but meets up with a band of squatters sitting outside the hospital. the next day they are shelled by american troops and tamura flees, choosing not to kill himself, and from there he wanders from place to place trying to get to palompon. he discovers that some men have been eating human flesh in order to survive, while others trade as much tobacco as they can for whatever they can get back.the film is filled with a quiet sense of desperation and desolation, with a hint of insanity. everyone we see is skin and bones, covered in dirt wearing torn and tattered rags. ichikawa uses his camera to catch some beautiful shots of the destructed landscape and the japanese soldiers who walk it. kon ichikawa was famous in japan for making many comedies and satires, and there are moments in fires on the plain that are bitingly hilarious. take for example a shot of what appears to be a dead man lying face down in a pool of water; a soldier walks but and asks himself aloud if that is how they will all end up, to which the man lifts his head out of the water and replies "what was that?" and then drops his face even deeper into the puddle than before. another hilarious sequence involves one man finding a pair of boots along the trail. he takes the boots, replacing them with his old ones. another man walks by and sees that pair of boots and switches up for his old boots. the scene continues until finally tamura finds the exchange spot and examines the boots left without hardly any sole. he looks carefully at his own and at ones on the ground, and deciding that they're both kaput he removes his own and goes barefoot. the film is filled with incredible scenes, one after another. like mizoguchi and kurosawa, ichikawa knew how to use his camera to paint beautiful and stunning pictures. there are many stunning shots of men in barren empty plains surrounded by nothing but smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies on the broken earth. there is another incredible scene where dozens of japanese soldiers attempt to cross a road guarded by yanks in the middle of the night, all crawling on their hands and knees as the camera watches on from above. the film gets its name from the columns of smoke rising up from fires on the plains seen throughout the film. they represent to the soldiers life a little more ordinary; the lives of japanese farmers back home burning husks of corn. their beacons of hope for the normal life however are in hostile hands.the film caused a stir in its day with its graphic content. much emphasis is placed on the horror of war, not just with the enemy but within your ranks and yourself. kon ichikawa's fires on the plains is an incredibly authentic and moving, and somewhat disturbing, portrait of the horror suffered by the men making up the lower ranks of the imperial army. clint eastwood's letters from iwo jima, while it is a very good film, comes nowhere close to realizing the horror of war depicted in fires on the plain. (eastwood was no doubt influenced by the film, seeing as he claims to be such a classic japanese film buff.) many war films show that war is hell through the eyes of the winners. in fires on the plain, we're shown that war is even more hellish when you're on the losing end 4/4

this film is a knockout, fires on the plain referred to is, (the burning off at the end of harvest time) a happy memory for tamura, he relives this in his mind many time's,and at the end of this bleak film, like a man dying of thirst, he believe's he is home and this last illusion is all he has left. billy wilder's the big carnival (ace in the hole) is the only film (that comes to mind)that is as bleak as this little masterpiece by kon ichikawa. while i think the whole film is brilliant two scenes that come to mind are when a platoon of japanese soldiers trying to escape (crawling on there belly's)are ambushed by americans and massacred,true horror, and as an american soldier and a pretty philippine girl soldier are having a cigarette on the side on the road, she smiles as she flits with the yank,then her face changes to rage as she see's two japanese soldiers trying to surrrender, she grabs a gun and kills them with joy, the american soldier attempts to stop her but has no chance , to me this speaks volumes at the atrocity's committed by the japanese in the philippines, all in all a great film if you have the stomach for it.

the main achievement of this film is that though racially unipolar, the film still manages to carve out a tableaux of war portrayals that leave a lasting identification with whoever may view it, and whoever was present at this time. though good films may have the ability of universalizing their subjects, which is often a hard thing to do; great films have the ability of universalizing their unipolar subjects, which is what this film does.instead of carving a context of unity, the film depicts the japanese in the sick finality of the phillipines war-front in february, 1945, making signs for pacifism or war, but rather making signs of the feelings, death, destruction, victory and sickness of war with the bloody hands of the defeated.far different, and superior, to films such as apocalypse now and full metal jacket, both which needed a satirical methodology of trivializing and depersonalizing the american troupes, and using all races as one struggle, which is fine, yet not as grand as a film that uses one race and view, which would look fascist if created in america, to convey the horror of war and show what it is really like.the only way the main character makes it through this movie to the end, is by being sick, thence inedible; hence through this character, through his sickness, his saving face, we see the end of wwii in the phillipines in february of 1945, and the way in which the americans, japanese and phillipinians came together in bloody acts of warfare where you live to die.the film is patently influenced by a neorealist way of filmic portrayal, which is original and beneficial to a viewer, whether then or now, for the neorealist techniques it employs conveys all the horrors of war in pictorial form, whether a showcase for pacifism or 'militaristic responsibility'. like germania anno zero, by roberto rossellini, a story emerges from the environment and the conditions associated with it.the film's opening, with the two-way discussion between the two japanese soldiers, prefigures and reechoes the events. through this opening we feel that the struggle is human against human, and human with human; it shows that they relied on each other to face the enemy in the past battles, but now, in this opening, or 'pivot' of the experiences of the japanese in the phillipines, new information is relayed to the main character tamura, giving a presentiment of a cannibal reliance on one another if they wish to survive.the jungle is gritty, wet and thick, and the sky is not infrequently cloudy and pouring. we wade with the stragglers though puddles and marshes, as sick as the land around them. nameless cadavers are strewn everywhere. every now and then one can not tell if they are bodies, rocks or corn. apparently there is no difference here, all is dead and sick. all is dying. all they have lest to feed upon are rare monkeys and dead bodies of fallen comrades and/or nameless enemies.often tamura meets a fallen other near death. though crushed in spirit, and crushing his, some offer up their bodies for him to eat, but he refuses; he still, like hiroshi kawaguchi as nishi in giants and toys, will not droop into the death of dignity and japanese morals; for this is all he really has to hold up for his survival, a dignity of self. hence, when nagamatsu is dissecting a soldier for consumption, he shoots him because of it. tamura may be used to the killing, but to the sickness of killing and pillaging he can't decipher. he is neither a good man or a bad man. he wishes to survive, but will not go the extra mile beyond simple straight-war-killing. his self belonged dead on the battlefield, he isn't happy here to wade and wipe the weak for his survival.the sickness he carrys he sees everywhere, in everyone; and sadly he lacks the ethical rationale of thinking either thinking entirely about others, since he can't give up his body for them since of his contagious malady, or thinking entirely about himself, since he sees the sickness in everyone, though still killing them even if they do no harm. seen in his attack on the two philippians's in the hut. he can't see anyone. no one can see anyone. the only see an aversion from malady and an adversion to health, the heart of survival instincts.often, an arm appears pointing to the left of the screen, towards what must be hope, for there, in that far thule lies their freedom. yet it is blocked by american soldiers, leaving the japanese stragglers to slowly die in this disconsolate dirt. even a church tower appears, reflecting the light off an unseen sun. but on closer inspection crows flutter wildly about it; religion too is an air of poison.nobi, the japanese title of the film, gives more evidence to the themes, or feelings of the film: the servitude to fate, the heaviness of existence under leaders and lives controlled by others. its proper anglophone translation has a subject of heavy debate among historians, as non-koreans translate it as "slave" and "slavery", while many koreans argue that nobi was not a slave system, but a servant class system that does not meet the criteria for slavery. a way to typically to escape wrenching poverty. this improves upon the war theme, and symbolism of soldiery.isn't it important at the time period to ask ourselves what the purpose is of what will become our won history? should we be comfortable of letting it unroll without conscious effort for change? is it not who we are fighting, that age old history question, but rather why are we fighting? fires on the plain is with eiji funakoshi, osamu takizawa, and mickey curtis; based on a novel by shohei ooka. in japanese with subtitles.

"nobi" or "fires on the plain" is a film that is so excellent on so many levels, that not enough good things can be said about it. my only regret is that i was not able to see this 1959 film sooner.being something of a film purist, i tend to look at films for their artistic merits based upon dialog, acting, photography and even the efforts to remain true to the period in terms of costume. ultimately, i want to know if the film is "truthful" enough in revealing the human condition to make me think without oppressing me with what the director wants me to think."fires on the plain" is a great film because it crafts a portrait filled with realistic human reactions to the dying fires of a great historical catastrophe.ichikawa's film is a condemnation of war on all levels -- as any good war film should be. war is horrifying, bloody, destructive. it is also murderous on the psyche. however, what is fundamental about "fires on the plain" is its unapologetic look at the japanese soldiers. it shows them slowly collapsing under the weight of superior american firepower and their nation's inability to wage a war of its own making. a fatalistic code encouraging death before surrender is at the heart of this madness.i was astonished to see such an honest and brutally close look at the bitter fruits of japan's military misadventure made just 14 years after the end of what the japanese call the "great pacific war." ichikawa, reveals what the germans called the "war life," the plight of the common soldier.ichikawa's film is interesting, since even today japan is having a hard time fully coming to terms with its wartime fanaticism, its subjugation of conquered peoples, the racism of its war against the chinese and war crimes which included cannibalism by soldiers and officers practiced not only against one another, but against allied prisoners of war.ichikawa produces a stark representation of the victimization of soldiers by a confluence of bad political decisions and cultural pressures.this stark examination is skillfully done by portraying the doomed soldiers as human beings who exhibit, at various times, fear, brilliantly laconic humor, dialog enriched by its sparseness, and a plot whose complexity is belied by the grim, wilderness setting.ichikawa's portrait is a ragged and painful tapestry of defeated men. the tubercular tamura, played as a woebegone and gentle soul by eiji funakoshi, is a good soldier who can't abandon his humanity, though he is as frightened and lost as his comrades. before he departs for a hospital that will reject him as too healthy, tamura is given a hand grenade by a superior who, recognizing the hopelessness of their situation, advises tamura to kill himself.why tamura's hopelessly ill-supplied and militarily incapable unit was not ordered to surrender at the start of the film is telling. ichikawa makes it plain that the war is over and everyone is merely waiting to die. as tamura leaves his unit for his hopeless search for physical and spiritual salvation, he sees his comrades pointlessly digging an air raid shelter. they appear like corpses looking up from their own mass grave.we later watch as the overworked hospital's medical staff abandons the dying patients to an all-consuming american artillery barrage. the pathetic patients, who crawl from their huts in a vain attempt to survive, appear like pathetic, serpentine creatures dragging themselves from an omnipotent force. you know they won't survive.ichikawa makes it plain that the only thing worse than a defeated army is one that has lost its honor by abandoning its humanity and its comrades. as tamura staggers through the jungles of leyte we encounter the noble, the dying and the exploitive. cannibalism rears its ugly head as soldiers begin to eat one another rather than surrender to american "corned beef."when the men do talk of surrender, the propaganda of how americans kills prisoners is countered by a worldly-wise soldier who reveals that the approaching americans feed and care for prisoners of war because they, unlike the japanese, respect brave soldiers who are forced to give up.it is the japanese who intend to die fighting for the emperor long after resistance has lost all meaning. those willing to fight to the death will be killed. it is the calculus of war.after shooting a murderous and cannibalistic comrade, whom he earlier offered his own body to as food, the fatalistic tamura's careless surrender also seems to be an intentional form of suicide. his death is a lonely image. was ichikawa trying to tell us of the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live, but who is still trapped by his nation's suicidal cultural codes?if someone watches this film carefully, he or she will see that absolutism and fanaticism is the enemy. the americans are portrayed as a technologically advanced people willing to employ that technology in the form of inexorable military power -- a lesson that transformed japanese postwar society. ichikawa's film isn't so shallow that it indicts america. ichikawa indicts the sedimentary layers of japan's destructive policies that created the war and then to continue it when all was lost.ichikawa does not mention the nuclear weapons dropped upon nagasaki and hiroshima. he doesn't have to. the slow-motion destruction of the imperial japanese army in the philippines reveals the seeds of japan's immolation.

a harrowing masterpiece on the sheer madness and despair of war, fires on the plain (nobi) is not going to be to everybody's taste: this is a war movie in the truest possible sense of the term, one that resorts neither to flag-waving patriotism nor saccharine sentimentality. nobi cuts deep, it's ugly, tenebrous and bleak as few things ever committed on celluloid will ever be. this is war behind the cannons, with no triumphs or heroes, no moral victories or defeats to be had, just a handful of gaunt and terrible-looking men strewn across a land ravaged by war like penitents fleeing a great disaster. the characters defy moral judgment because they are creatures beset by a great woe, a woe that does not permit questions of a moral nature. war and survival. pitting one's will against the other's in a battlefield arena. the loser is simply removed from existence.tamura, soldier in the japanese imperial army, is discharged from his platoon and ordered to report in a nearby hospital on account of him coughing blood and being disliked by the rest of the platoon. he's told to never come back and instead commit suicide by hand grenade in case the hospital rejects him. which it does. the hospital is nothing but a shack made of wooden planks and the hospital surgeon simply tells him that if he's capable of walking he's just fine. it is in that shabby excuse of a hospital that one of the most harrowing scenes of the film takes place. as the area is carpet bombed by american planes the doctors and those who can walk and sustain themselves flee from the hospital and into the woods. moments before the hospital is blown to pieces, the gaunt and crippled figures of the sick and injured crawl out of it in every manner of posture, dressed in their sickly white robes, as if the building is some kind of beast spewing viscera and filth out upon the earth.that is nobi's greatest success; the stark and brooding depiction of the suffering of war in simple but evocative images, without melodrama or pseudo-heroism. soldiers cross a marsh, wading knee-deep in mud, move across the opposite bank and into a field only to discover enemy tanks hiding in the woods, their lights shining like malignant eyes as they scan the dark. a procession of injured soldiers, dirty and half-mad, crossing a road, dropping to the ground on the sound of enemy planes. buzzards feasting on a pile of dead bodies. an abandoned village. a mad soldier that believes himself to be buddha sitting under a tree, covered with flies and his own excrement, offering his arm to be eaten by tamura when he's dead. these are the images kon ichikawa conjures for our eyes, merciless and unflinching in their poignancy but honest and raw.nobi doesn't rush to get somewhere. it is content to follow tamura's travels through the war-torn land as he tries to reach the regrouping center of palompa, and observe the madness and obscenities of war. the movie wades through the sludge of the horror of war, slow and brooding, just like the characters it follows. the final thirty minutes with tamura taking refuge with two deserters who feed on 'monkey meat' are the closest nobi comes to adhering to conventional narratives and they're no less powerful for that matter. strikingly photographed in black and white, with great performances from the cast, and ichikawa's assured direction, nobi is not only among the best war movies to be made but also among the finest of japanese cinema.

every american who thinks he or she understands world war two should see this movie. few hollywood films about the war have defied the stereotype of japanese soldiers as emotionless brutes obeying orders without thinking. we like to think that every japanese man was ready and able to fight to the death, right up to the day we bombed nagasaki. "fires on the plain" shows a different reality: troops pathetically undersupplied, demoralized and starved to the point of cannibalism. they euphemistically refer to human flesh as "monkey meat." the movie and novel on which it was based also put to death the myth that japanese soldiers all preferred death to surrender: they had good reason to believe that their enemies were in no mood to take prisoners. to me it raises a question most americans would rather avoid: if the japanese military was so beaten down at this point in the war, why was it necessary to nuke hiroshima?

this is undoubtedly the most harrowing black-and-white war film that i've watched; as a matter of fact, the only western director during this time to remotely approach its level of intensity and sheer visceral power in his work was samuel fuller. by the way, i had attended a kon ichikawa retrospective at london's national film theatre in september 2002, but only managed to catch some of his work made between 1960 and 1973.the film is certainly as depressing as it's reputed to be; however, it also displays welcome touches of black humor throughout - the 'dead' man who wakes up to answer a querying soldier and promptly 'dies' again, the deliciously ironic shoe exchange sequence, a moribund eccentric telling the famished hero which part of the body he should eat, etc. incidentally, the script was written by a woman - natto wada, the director's own wife!ichikawa is a versatile and prolific film-maker whose reputation may not be as high as it was during his peak years (1956-65), but his direction here is often striking - the startling pre-credits sequence (the hero is violently rebuked by his superior officer for being discharged from hospital earlier than expected!), the death of a surrendering japanese at the hands of a gun-toting philippine woman, the bombing of a hospital (with the medical staff running away to save themselves, leaving the wounded soldiers behind to crawl out of the shack at their own limited pace), the automated march in the rain of the disillusioned soldiers (which also involves the afore-mentioned business with the shoes that, actually, recalls a similar scene in all quiet on the western front [1930]), a hill littered with the bodies of soldiers attempting to climb it, the finale, etc. surely one of the film's major assets is the stunning cinematography of the unforgiving and desolate muddy landscape.the film is notorious for treating the taboo subject of cannibalism (almost 10 years before it became a staple of horror movies) but ichikawa's approach is not only subtle but highly effective: the flesh is actually referred to as "monkey meat", while the hero is seen partaking only once (and promptly spits out the piece along with most of his decaying teeth!); conversely, when the weak underling soldier (played by mickey curtis who, despite his name, was a japanese pop idol of the time!) rabidly indulges, the ground nearby is splashed with blood.in the supplements, ichikawa remembers that method-practicing lead actor eiji funakoshi (whose portrayal is unforgettable, by the way) arrived on the set at starvation point - with the result that production was forced to shut down for two weeks until he recuperated! donald richie's perceptive interview favors the nihilism of the film over the underlying patriotism behind such gut-wrenching recent hollywood fare as saving private ryan (1998).fires on the plain is universally considered to be one of its director's top efforts and, out of the several films of ichikawa i've watched, the closest to it in spirit are the burmese harp (1956; another character-driven war film but with a spiritual tone, and which is also available on dvd from criterion) and enjo aka conflagration (1958; which was actually given a limited theatrical showing locally, as part of a foreign-film week, a couple of years ago). personally, i also have a particular soft spot for the director's stunningly stylized color extravaganza, an actor's revenge (1963), which i've actually caught twice at the nft in 1999 and the afore-mentioned 2002 retrospective.

this is one of the most anti-traditional war movies about was i have seen. instead of the typical films that stress glory and perhaps super-human characters (like john wayne), this film is the exact opposite--stressing the de-humanization that also happens in war. the story concerns the japanese who are stranded in the phillipines after the us returned in late 1944-early 1945. by the time the movie begins, the japanese have clearly been beaten but because of the insane logic of bushido, they cannot allow themselves to consider surrender. at one of many poignant moments, the lead character is told at the beginning of the film to report to the hospital since he isn't capable of fighting due to his tb. the problem is that the hospital won't accept him, so his commander tells him to once again go to the hospital--and if they won't accept him he should blow himself up with a grenade! well, this happens just in the first five minutes of the movie--a lot worse things befall this soldier and the few stragglers because they won't surrender. plus, there is a case in the movie where a soldier does try to surrender but is gunned down. this happened a lot later in the war because so often the surrendering japanese soldiers booby-trapped themselves to blow up when they came near. in addition, the film shows the most vivid depiction of starvation and the accompanying madness of any film i have seen. in addition, cannibalism, cowardice and betrayal all accompany this very gritty, realistic and depressingly realistic film. you simply couldn't have made a better film of this type. horrible but great.

during ww2 in the philipines, japanese soldiers are starving, dying, growing weak, and becoming more and more insane. a small group of soldiers, trying to stay alive, have eventually resorted to cannibalism. this film perfectly portrays the insanity that overtakes people under extreme conditions. there are a few humorous parts in this movie, but the majority of it is just a very slow moving and realistic film. it follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another, and eventually to death. a very interesting film, showing the death, and the horror, of what may have been the worst war the world has ever seen.

although it has been a failure in movie theaters because mainly mylene farmer, one of the 3 top stars in france had not the first role. fans had changed their mind after that and were waiting for it on dvd. when it has been released on dvd this year it has have a tremendous success ! the others fails was the slow pace and the incredible length (3h) at that time (1994) that have annoyed critics. but the melancholic story makes mandatory that slow pace and long time. the moral of the film is you cannot escape from the death you are destined for. it is the same theme than in the movie "final destination" and makes it a gothic tale. the atmosphere is very melancholic.

i finally managed to see this movie...after so many years of expectancy...i was so curious to see if this movie it is as bad as some people say..and my opinion is that this movie it wasn't bad at all,on the contrary it was amazing...i enjoyed every second from it...from the beginning until the end...the actors were great they sent me the feeling that i was living the story at the same time as the movie was playing...the landscapes were so beautiful were the film was shot...and it did charmed me.. also the music was extraordinary and i have nothingto reproach..i think that the plot was very original i don't think that i saw a movie like this...it is a shame that it isn't recognized all over the world..to bad for those who didn't get the chance to see it. i give this movie 10/10

how to summarize this film ? it is simply impossible. why you should see it ? maybe for the story, very probably for the actors (giorgio, catherine...), above all for the universe and the poetry. this is a tale. sad, sometimes dark, but a tale. i love this film !!!! just waiting for the dvd !! thank you mister boutonnat.

giorgino can to some people look a bit long but it's one of rare real romantique adventure film. it could be compare to docter jivago with a bit of sleepy holow. you must see it.

i think it's incredibly hard to write any kind of full-scale review to giorgino, merely because it's one of those viewer-dependent, complex, poetical and philosophical movies that are brain-wearing if, while watching them, you're trying to enjoy their shell and get to their core simultaneously, yet there are several things which are certain and beyond any doubt for any man of art (which, i hope, i am). the first thing: it's a certain masterpiece, even of that kind of art which remains through a long long time; the second: it's one of those rare "dark" movies in which darkness is poetic, even romantic, attractive and much more sad than depressing, like the art of pieter brueghel or caspar david friedrich. as to the core of the movie, someone called it kafkian, though i don't agree with that because actually it's far beyond kafka's misanthropic logic and much more like edgar poe's parables: dark and scary but through that touching the most gentle strings of our souls. actually, on the poetic side (which is much more important than the narrative), giorgino is a tale about eternal peace and love which can be achieved only through eternal childhood of soul. those who have such souls are usually branded as crazy by our society, but from another point of view, they all have the virtue all the others lost when become "grown": the virtue of god's love. indeed, giorgino is a very christian movie, "be like children" (mt 18:3) is it's real hidden tag-line, though the movie never deals with any kind of moral and concentrates only on the christian philosophy for, dare to suppose, true god is beyond any human moral. yet i think that boutonnat is too harsh portraying "grown" people as a sort of demons trying to steal childhood from rare survived souls, but it's his point of view and he has a right to think so. while watching giorgino don't try to look for some hidden symbols (though there are some), better look for thoughts expressed through characters and their behavior, and do learn from them. also i cannot mention that the movie looks astonishingly through excellent photography, especially through rational use of color filters, incredibly apposite editing, wonderful acting of all the cast and, of course, due to the atmospheric beauty of winter mountains that reminded me of the brueghel's "hunters in the snow". also, interestingly enough, the scene with death in the form of an old woman with sunken black-ringed eyes riding a cart, instantly reminded me of pesta (plague) from the series of drawings by the norwegian painter theodor kittelsen, depicting how a black plague is sweeping out the population of a small town in the mountain valley. is it a coincidence?

that's certainly not the best film ever. but that's certainly worth seeing for people with a special kind of mind. so the one who loves sadness and depression, and scary fairy-tales at night, and wolves and real madness - welcome! if you find a copy, of course:) as for me, i could stand it only once... but since that the wolves, and saint-lucy, and children's drawings, and a headless christ live in my nightmares.

giorgino is a long, excruciating journey from bad to worse in the life of protagonist after whom the movie is named. young demobilized, gas-poisoned first world war lieutenant of very delicate health, who previously was a doctor in an orphanage for children with some mental deprivations, goes in a search of their new location and finds much more than he ever intended to and quite of a different nature. depressive atmosphere of ultimate despair, where the insane ones are much less horrible than the sane, where the madness is a kind of poetry, will hold you hypnotized from the very first frames of this film to the last. and all the beauty: beauty of the winter and mountains, beauty of snowy landscapes and wild woods, i don't even know how all the sorrow and sadness of last days of war could be made so beautiful.

giorgino is a strange, dark, obsessive object; the casting is impressive, the plot is powerful, reminded me of edgar poe's tales. probably not a masterpiece, but it does leave us with the remembrance of strong images, fine music, fear, sadness, confusion, and a sentence that says it all : the wolves are coming. giorgino is quite forgotten now, and when it was released nobody seemed to appreciate it. that's a shame. if you ever have a chance to see this, well... give it a try.

simply one of the best movies ever. if you won't get it - sorry for you. i believe that someday people will include this one in their all-time top 10's. not now, but in the far future.

a wonderful film - a charming, quirky family story. a cross-country journey filled with lots of interesting, oddball stops along the way (& several very cool cameos). great cast led by rod steiger carries the film along and leads to a surprise ending. well directed & shot - a really nice movie.

john leguizamo is a great comedian and storyteller. every time this has been on hbo i've had to stop and watch it. john tells the story of how he grew up (probably some fact and fiction) and adds hilarious stories in the midst. if you like john's comedy i would have to say this is probably his comedy at his best.

this one man show may be the most fantastic show i've ever seen. to call this simply a stand up act is to do it a great injustice, there is a definate reason that this was a broadway show. john leguizamo is a master of making people of every culture feel at home listening to his story of growing up and dealing with his family and life in general. i would reccomend this show to anyone, as long as they can handle the language.

after watching john preform this one of a kind show, i had to share.....it was really something to watch a grown man portray himself as a child. i like the fact that with every character he "became," you could picture what they looked like. it is more entertaining when you can understand the individual. "freak" is what real "stand up" should be. john is real talent.

john has made two one man shows. spic o rama and freaks, and neither one has shown up on dvd... john!!! why do you this to me john?? put it on dvd john, so the people can see,they need to see john!! :d... just in case anyones keeping a watchful aye!!

this was very energetic and well played show. i saw it back in 98 and my friends and i still joke about it. each time i watch it's always as funny as the first. i also love the way that everyone can relate to it in their own particular ways. i am very much looking forward to seeing more of john's own scripts and productions. unfortunately i can't find it anywhere for sale, and i've done quite a lot of looking. if anyone knows a website or store to refer me to, i would very much appreciate it as i am looking for his other live performances as well. please send me a message if any of you have info on the subject. thankyou.

i never saw any of john leguizamo's stand-up before i watched freak, and after seeing it again on hbo comedy recently it was better, more enlivening and with things that, at the age of 14, i couldn't understand quite before. spike lee did a wonderful job directing, keeping the visual angle up to par with leguizamo's theatrics and the style of personal storytelling; it's substance and style merging together but unobtrusively. we get leguizamo's rants about race and sex (the bits about sex are classic), but a lot of it is about family, and what sticks still fresh in my mind is about his father. even when things get dark in some of the stories, there's something fresh or crazy or random that leguizamo pulls out to get a laugh, and it works more often than not. if something does fall flat (for me at any rate) it might be his personality tics here and there. but overall, it's the kind of fun material that isn't heady, but is so true to itself that it stings. find it if you can!

after seeing this routine by john leguizamo, i finally realize why he is such a talent. i enjoy great stage work, and this is stage work at its best. i cannot label it as a stand-up routine, because leguizamo is so intense when playing the different characters. the only time he breaks character is when it is necessary for him to complete his part in which he does so coolly, that you cannot help, but appreciate his talents. i wasn't really sure how i felt about him as an actor, but freak solidified my appreciation of him. for those out there that have not had the opportunity to see this show, i feel for you. definitely check it out. it is one of the nest routines i have ever seen. ranks with eddie murphy, bill cosby and chris rock. four stars and more.

john leguizamo's one man shows are hit or miss: mambo mouth showed off his intense characterizations and great timing but the material was average, spic-o-rama accomplished the former as well but this time the material was funny, freak is a classic followed by his disappointing sex-o-holic. but his stuff in freak showcases his genius and when he's in the spotlight he's without peer.freak's semi-autobiographical look at the journey of a young man has power and resonance i don't think even it's creator knew about. by allowing us the chance to see his soul, mr. leguizamo gives us an opportunity to project our own life onto his and there can be no greater gift a performer can give. the willingness to drop 'the wall', expose and share is too terrifying for most actors-they use characters to hide behind-but jl goes full-throttle and gleefully smashes any pretenses. lenny bruce and richard pryor were our best cultural observers/comedians/actors because they spoke from their heart about whatever they noticed in society and the truth provided slashing humor. combine that with a great actor's gift of mimicry and being in-the-moment (not to mention a sense of humanity) and you'll see john leguizamo has the power to do the same. at least in freak he does.from birth to his first big break and every life altering moment in between, a viewer sees our host and other characters in their most private moments all the while experiencing the pain, hope, and humor that comes with. looking drained and lean muscled-tight jl is ringing with sweat by evening's end having offered up his crazy life for an audience; spike lee's fluid camera work captures the actor's nuances down to the last lip curl and slow blink. the scenarios range from drinking with his machismo-fueled father (when he was 9) to seeing a chorus line with his gay, deaf uncle; his first girlfriend's vicious humiliation when he strips naked, eager to have sex. a nightmarish first sexual encounter with a large german woman in the back of a kentucky fried chicken follows an unsuccessful attempt to pick up a "drunk lapsed catholic" in a bar on st.patty's day. climaxing in a serious showdown with his mother and father, it's here that he shows his true genius: he plays a scene between these two characters and himself and his brother with such a strong dramatic/humourous intensity, you forget you're watching only one person. there's no costume changes, bad wigs, lighting tricks, or makeup. just an actor giving his all. it's simply amazing.other actors/comedians that stand out right now are eddie izzard and chris rock but they don't dive into themselves as deeply as john leguizamo does; that's not a criticism, not by a long shot. i love their work but freak is different. it's moving in a no-b******* way. it's the best one man show out there and no one will be able to touch it for a long time.

definitely not a film to revolutionize the industry or introduce any new techniques of film-making, this is a very handsome and solid production. it's miraculous that we can today enjoy it in superb quality on dvd - probably most of the viewers about a 100 years ago saw a black and white copy, as the stencil tinted de luxe edition was available only at the very best theaters. even if you are not fascinated by this film or the subject of it, you can't but marvel at the copy released by image entertainment (together with another gem, from the manger to the cross, 1912). it's virtually impossible to see a film that is over a century old but shows so little damage. the process of stencil colouring was a very effective one and, compared to the occasionally blurry and smeared images of hand coloured film, the colours are crisp and well defined. filmed within the limitations of the film-making as known back in 1902 when the filming commenced, the static nature of the scenes can today be considered almost intentional, meditative and solemn. the tableaux keep moving at a steady paste, so the film never gets tedious. you might not be fascinated by this film as a work of cinematography, but it sure is handsome as a work of academic, picturesque art. if you are a religious person, the fact that you are watching anonymous, long since departed people playing long since departed characters, adds to the mystery significantly. a proper viewing for christmas or lent. p.s: i've ticked the "contains spoilers" box just for fun. as you can see, i haven't revealed the ending.

i have always been fascinated by silent films. there is something about seeing actors and actresses from 100 years ago performing. jaded by today's high-tech special effects, i always try and imagine what it was like to watch a particular film at the time of it's original release. it helps to appreciate the crudeness of early cinema."the life and passion of jesus christ" is a very charming production from pathe, originally filmed in 1902, but expanded and finally released in 1905. imagine a series of famous religious paintings coming to life, separated by title cards, and you will have a pretty good idea of what this film is like. for example, the scene in which mary and joseph rest as they are escaping to egypt, is almost identical to luc olivier merson's 1879 painting "rest on the flight to egypt", right down to mary sitting on the famous sphinx. while some might find these "living paintings" an unimaginative cop-out, i found them to be very charming, and very nostalgic.the sets and costumes appear to be right out of a stage production of the life of christ. possibly from and elaborate passion play of the day. the make-up on the cast is very theatrical, so much so that a close-up of jesus is almost comical. again, where others might be bothered by the cudeness of them, i was quite charmed.having been filmed over a period of 3 years, the continuity isn't too bad. the biggest flaws are in the casting changes made over that time. the characters of john the apostle and the 12 year old jesus change in mid scene, much to the audiences surprise!the best unintentional humor, of the film, is in the birth of jesus scene. the baby literally appears, as if by magic, in the manger between mary and joseph. maybe it was simply my frame of mind at the time i viewed it, but i laughed out loud! if only child birth were that easy!!!! to top it off, the actress who plays mary looks bored through the whole scene (actually, through the whole movie), as if this sort of thing happens every day! my, how times have changed!as simplistic as this film is, compared to today, it's really a wonderful window into the past. i recommend it!

tempo di uccidere (time to kill) by guiliano montaldo is a bit of a strange film, but it's good in it's own way.i won't bother with a summary of the plot. most that i've read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most people who wrote those didn't really understand the film. and you need to understand it to some level, even if you cannot describe for yourself what it's actually about. this film is strange in a "once upon a time in america" way- only shorter.many 'hollywood' stars (whatever that may mean...) have played in lesser known italian productions. it's known that many actors who are past their prime or slowly rising to it do this. cage was not yet a real star when this was made. i'm not a fan of him. he's very good in some roles (raising arizona, bringing out the dead) and weak when he plays the hero. i don't really know what to think of him in this one, but he sure doesn't portray the typical hero main character. this film could have done without him, but the fact that he starred may be the only reason this one ever made it to dvd.the supporting cast is good. not one of them looks fake and they act as if they are really there. solid support.i have seen 3 films by montaldo (marco polo, sacco&vanzetti and this one) and i think he is one of the greater directors of this time. unfortunately, nobody knows him. this movie was his last in a long time (a break of 19 years). i think that this movie might have failed at the office, but from the way it is done i think that for montaldo it was a personal project that he really liked.the production is great. it's always enough. the dusty army camps, the claustophobic cities and the magnificent landscape all play a great part. it all feels very real. in some scenes you can almost feel the heat. the sound itself is nothing special, but the music by ennio morricone is very good. it's not a piece that you will whistle when in the shower, but it sure works great.so this movie looks, feels and sounds just right. it doesn't serve the lessons learned from it on a golden platter, but that may be the biggest difference between hollywood and euro-cinema all around. it might sound strange to give it an 8 and not recommend it to people, but that is what i do. if you are looking for action; avoid this one! if you are looking for a well made apocalypse now in a different time and setting, but with a bit of similar journey into a 'state of mind'(sorry if this sound corny but i don't know what else to call it) you just might enjoy this one a lot.

in the wake of my personal research into the pending "end cycle" time of 2012 presented by the mayan calendar system, i believe this movie should be seen every bit as much as "what the bleep do we know?" while some may believe that matters of top level science should only be communicated in doctorate level "speak," "the elegant universe" breaks such barriers. the visuals and the select dialog make it easy to comprehend this walk through the history of physics. there are numerous messages in this movie, the least of which is that academic science must always be ready to revise what's being taught. true, pure discovery science is beautiful because there's always something additional and exciting to bring to the fore if we have the courage to seek it out in the face of "established" science.

the elegant documentary -don't watch this movie ... if you're an egotistical know-all student of physics. this much less than one percent (miniscule fraction) of the population may find that this show just tells them what they have already learned and already know.do watch this movie! - if you're one of the massive majority of people that fall into the greater than 99% of the population that does not study or already have a sound knowledge of the theories of physics including relativity, quantum, string and m-theory.what a brilliantly architected documentary. starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a universe of pure magic - and dimensions beyond. i have always had a huge appreciation of mathematics. this movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics is without making you feel like you're about to fail the grade.the show is repetitive at times as the original format was a mini-series split over three shows. it therefore makes sense to give us polite little reminders of the principles being presented. i found this immensely helpful as it kept reminding me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence.we are all (and everything around us) is vibrational-energy with a natural tendency towards harmony. this movie may blow your mind - or at least help you realize that the universe is far far bigger than that which we see around us (even with the hubble telescope) and far far smaller than the protons and neutrons within the atoms we learned about in high-school. m-theory holds many magnificent magnitudes of 'possibility'.it just seemed so appropriate that all of this elegance should by it's very nature move (by admission by the many brilliant scientists presenting) out of the realm of science and into the realm of philisophy.you do not have to be religious at all to feel like this movie brought you one step closer to god.bravo brian greene. well done indeed.p.s. if you're interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place in the universe and would like some more insight into the 'possibilities' quantum mechanics blended with spirituality (of all things) can bring then i highly recommend that you also watch "what the bleep!? - down the rabbit hole". yes i know they make a few silly mistakes by suggesting a shaman may not be able to see a boat if he hasn't seen one before (my eyes process light reflections just fine - i see things everyday that i've never seen before) and brain cells are cells in the body that actually don't divide. but if you can get over these little hurdles and put down the things you don't like and hang on to those that you do - there is a lot to like about this film.then watch "the secret" (2006 documentary about the law of attraction - search for imdb title "tt0846789"). this information just might change your life profoundly - forever. if you search deeper you might even find the universe is talking to us with thought (if you'll listen) - and some are - and that is truly incredible. there is a modern day jesus/mohammad/buddha (those, among others, that history suggests have communicated with the non-physical) alive today and she lives in texas. i know some of you know what i'm talking about.i do not consider myself religious by any traditional definition but i have never felt more at home or as comfortable in the universe as i do now.

ok. on the whole, this three part documentary will bring most interested people up to date with going's on in the world of physics, and the last 300 years of discovery of our universe. if you have read stephen hawkings brilliant book "a brief history of time" and understood it then you might benefit from the visual description of certain concepts..which i did to a certain extent. greene is bearable, but obviously for the sake of the masses, tends to explain things in a slighty patronising way. this is of course deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who watches this series.the guest scientists were good. (no hawking, but i suppose he has his own dvd(s) ) i kept waiting for him to appear but they rotate through the same ones for almost 3 parts... (very american weighted here, with a few brits and one antipodean) i bought the nova 2 disc edition (ntsc) and there were a few inclusions that really detracted from the overall experience.1. the "this is brought to you by.." at the start of each part was a necessary evil for the first part, but seeing it 2 more times before it was over was very ordinary.2. can't be helped i suppose but there is quite a bit of overlap at the start of 2 and 3 which had me reaching for the ffw button a few times.3. this disc set was straight from tv..(ie ads, what happen last show for those that missed it, and frequent "goto pbs.org for more ...." )appearing throughout the presentation. (quite unlike bbc material which is unmatched for presentation..planets, the blue planet, etc) my 7/10 is based on content alone. the niggles were there but i got over them. if this had have been done with that classic british accented presenter( you know the one) it would be a perfect disc set in my opinion.if you have seen this and want more...then i highly recommend hawkings book " a brief history of time"... i wish it was a movie too.happy viewing.

i myself am a physics student, and i have to say i think this is one of the best 'popular' introductions to string theory that's out there. the elegant universe manages to make the entire topic of string (although it's actually m) theory accessible to a wider audience.some 'popular science' programmes feel that the best approach is just to throw the audience in at the deep end, throwing technical jargon at them without so much as an explanation, and presenting the theory in a boring, stale style. this programme goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics, and explains the issues that need to be resolved between the two so we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe on both a large and small scale.i suppose some could say it's slow and takes too long to get to the interesting stuff like extra dimensions and wormholes, but the thing is: that's against the point. explaining string theory from the start is nigh on impossible without at least mentioning the physics at its base, and the way it's explained in the elegant universe is clear and entertaining.whether you'll like this program really does depend on if you're willing to perhaps be initially dumbfounded by some of the ideas that greene presents: extra dimensions and warping of spacetime aren't exactly prevalent in everyday life, are they? but, if you persevere with some of the more exotic concepts in this programme, you'll find that it will give you an insight into the research that drives the world of physics today. and if you're studying physics, well, it's great entertainment as well as you'll be likely able to follow this and appreciate it even more!

iv been a fan of rik mayall and ade edmednson ever since i can remember weather its young ones or bottom. and i just have to say i have never laughed so much in all my life!!! guest house paradiso is bloody brilliant! i know its not going to be everyones cup of tea (with the vomiting,slapstick comedy, violence and foul language) but then just don't watch it if it ain't yours. its not like no one knows what sick and twisted things rik and ade come up with when they're working with one another!! i think its unfair that this film received such a slatting from critics because,and i don't think i'm the only one to think this, this film is 10 out of 10! : )

why did i vote 10/10 for this movie that is just completely off guts*? quite simply because if you just let yourself find it funny, you can just laugh until you choke. some people might find that it goes too far, it is certainly not for everyone, but whenever i'm down and just need something really really stupid to laugh at, chuck on bottom or ghp and i can forget all of my troubles and be transported into a magical dark and weird world.*"completely off guts" is an australian expression, it has no literal translation.

this film had some very funny moments. the aforementioned feeb sketch for starters. the parts where rik tries to act dignified in front of his guests, looking down at them through his nose. very subtly done, especially as the guest was a toffee nosed adulterer himself.the scene where rik finds out that gina has a fiancé, "ahhh. she was stringing me along all the time, the brazen hussy." with his 2 candle eyes. like as if she really fancied him. but he believed it. that's why it was so funny. great moment. gino was also excellent. he should have been used more as the bad man. "where are the whores i ordered!" he bellows. brilliant stuff.

the first bottom movie was an absolute laugh from the beginning. excellently made and thought out. i will definitely take my hat off to the production team and the actors. the bottom actors attempt to run a hotel. if you look closely this film was most probably shot in the isle of wight, near my home.

i haven't written a review on here in ages but rewatching all of bottom tv show, live shows and this i felt i had to make my views on this movie known! it is, i feel, the perfect comedy movie. it lacks the lovey dovey story lines(i wouldn't really call richies enfatuation with gina carbonara love would you? or him and eddie going up there naked... not love) that make the rest of comedys go from good to crap, it lacks the usual dilemmas that one must overcome in most other comedy movies... unless you count the fact that they poisoned the guests and must escape from the guests green vomit as a dilemma thats similar to other comedy movies..... no, this movie just sets out and succeeds in doing one thing and one thing only: making one laugh. what does one require from comedy movies? laughter. this movie just piles on laugh after laugh without stuffing up the laughs with serious crap like other comedy movies! thus i call it the, so far, only perfect comedy movie ever made and i will never ever stop watching this beautiful movie! i appluad rick and ade on such fantastic genius!

it may not be oscar material, however this was a very funny film. i was always a fan of eddie (edmondson) & richie (mayall). "bottom" & "young ones" were legendary tv series', and it was about time they made a film. some of the stuff they get up to is brilliant, from the pencil is the rear-end, to the rubber sex-pants, as well was the infamous line that richie says when he falls and a candle he is carrying goes into his eye. he says to eddie "candle in the eye, candle in the eye", and eddie been the simpleton that he is, sticks the candle he's carrying into his eye. can't forget when eddie is on his motorbike, and he needs to urinate.... it was a great comedy, not to be taken seriously at all, but the film lacked with an ridicilous ending. overall, a exellent comedy, full of laughs, and lots of fake green vomit. a 9/10.

bottom at its absolute highest perfection. who ever says slap stick comedy is dead and boring is completely wrong. not that this film will only appeal to those who are of a masculine nature. this is another quality british dark comedy with many many jokes not violence related, but it helps if you can let your senses go and laugh at the sheer stupidity of it all.this is a true example of thriving british ingenuity and homegrown talent hats off to them. on a performance level it reminds me very much of the early works of the marx brothers where the same level of enthusiasm and devotion are present in their acting styles, resulting in a performance where the audience can really engage the innate human desire to see others suffer, yet to be detached and still feel safe, much like the principle many tv chat shows operate on. a truly marvelous bit of manipulation leaving all parties feeling better off.

while possibly the stupidest, most tasteless, and violent slapstick comedy ever made, guest house is also a very funny one. don't listen to the critics, they have no sense of humour. while the climax runs out of steam (but not vomit), it's still a funny party movie. seven candles in the eye out of ten.

this is probably the funniest thing i have ever seen - from start to finish it was perfect in timing, atmosphere, punch lines, background music, fighting sequences and every other possible aspect you can think of. to be absolutely honest i find this movie as funny as their (rik & ade's) sitcom "bottom" - maybe even funnier. i laughed constantly throughout the whole movie and can only recommend seeing this film... however, if you watch it without knowing (or liking?) the type of comedy rik mayall and ade edmondson has done before, you might not think it's funny at all - but i really can't understand those who dislike it - this is humour folks!!! (people getting hit with frying pans, guys running around wearing red rubber lingerie, green vomit filling the hallways, guys getting kicked in the b******s and getting candlesticks in the eyes - how can this not be funny???) 10/10

i saw this when it first came out, and found it to be a work of some genius; but i must confess i was clearly in the minority at the time.for me, the progressive lunacy of the proprietors of guest house paradiso just gets better and better throughout the film, with one of the most hilarious climaxes to a film ever.but i wouldn't recommend it to mother.lovers of gross-out comic book style humour will appreciate this movie; there are subtle jokes hidden away, but they are usually quickly flattened by a comedy frying pan. rik mayall and ade edmondson are superb, and the deadpan, unsuspecting guests are also excellent.

a sign of what to expect in this film came when i spotted that this was the first (and probably the last) film to have in its credits a "vomit technician".in what is a couple of hours of silly gags, hilarious violence and excellent slapstick humour.this film was just what you'd expect from the bottom boys, and it is great to see them back in their best form after rik mayall's life threatening accident.richie (mayall) and eddie (edmondson) are too similar to their bottom characters, if we can have any criticism at all, and edmondson does a surprisingly good job in directing the film also.this film has already spawned the predictable comparisons to fawlty towers that just aren't there, and the guest house paradiso itself is hardly torquay!watch out for some excellently crafted dialogue amongst all the violence and mayhem.if you don't like bottom you'll probably hate this - but i loved it.

this movie i watched back in 1981 when it came out. although i missed the first part of the movie what i did see was great. this movie is hard to find but if found you must see. the acting is great. very believable sad movie. if i ever find me a copy i definitely will buy me a copy to treasure.

hello, i was wondering if anyone has a copy of the movie broken promise?? i loved this movie growing up and watched it every time it was on. it has been years since i have seen it and would love to get a copy. i have checked all of the internet and have been unable to find it. if anyone has a copy to trade or sell em please email me at noelgypsy@yahoo.com... thank you and have a great night!! christine --------- the "broken promise" was made to eleven-year-old melissa michaelsen, whose parents have deserted her and her siblings. taken in by the county, michaelsen has had to watch helplessly as her brothers and sisters are split up and farmed out to different families. one of the kids is even institutionalized. juvenile court officer chris sarandon joins michaelsen in her struggle to reunite her family under one roof. broken promise was originally offered as a "general foods golden showcase" presentation. it was first telecast may 5, 1981.

this movie from what i remember was such a great movie! i watched it on television when i was 11, and couldn't remember the title of it. if i remember correctly, i do believe that it was a christmas television movie special. one of my friends at work and i were discussing it several years back, but neither one of us could remember the title. but we did remember almost the entire movie. no one else at work remembered ever seeing it! thank goodness someone at a tv movie website answered my post! now i have the fun job of locating a copy of it! it's amazing what you can remember as a child, but this movie definitely remains vividly playing in my head... even after 28 years. and i do believe i only watched it once. maybe it was because i am the oldest sister in my family, or maybe because i babysat and worked in day care centers, that it stuck with me that long. regardless of the real reason, it has remained one of the movies that i have been really wanting to watch lately!!! if anyone knows where to watch it online, or has a copy, please let me know. i would so love to see it again!!!! thanks so much! seriously, i tried to post this and it says my comment isn't long enough. so, apparently i have to type more, did you know that melissa michaelsen is the sister of peter billingsley who starred in a christmas story? i know i'm not the only fan of this movie, so if anyone has any idea on where to find this i would greatly appreciate it.

i saw this movie, when it first came out. patty didn't want to be separated from her siblings. however the juvenile justice system don't care. when patty looked at the case file, the judge sent her to a juvenile detention facility. he claimed she violated the rules of privacy, by looking at private files. she just wanted her family together. i couldn't blame her. the parents were not even fit parents. one of the smaller children had to have a restroom. the father stopped and let them off. he drove off him and left the children stranded, at the service station. patty had to take authority to protect them, since she was the oldest. they were placed in foster homes. the good part is that the social worker got them back as a family. the head social worker, kept telling him to butt out and not interfere. he was power crazy. he was the one, who had patty placed in the juvenile facility. why didn't they go after the father, who was released from prison, for abandonment. yet the children are caught in the middle and made to feel insecure.

this film broke a lot of ground and receives on the whole a lot less credit than it's due. it touches on a topic that is ever-present in our daily lives, but which is seen as a phenomenon so common that it does not merit discussion. this phenomenon is that of caregivers (be they doctors or, as in "broken promise", a senior social worker) who abuse their position in order to harm those they have been charged to protect.in broken promise, patty clawson and her family are abandoned by their parents; but are soon picked up by local law enforcement. faced with the certain prospect of foster care, patty begs a young social worker to keep her and her brothers and sisters together. this social worker approaches a senior member of another department, but his request is denied.the children are parcelled off to seperate homes, thereby following the prevailing opinions of the day and ensuring a "clean break." but it is this event, the "broken promise" which gives the film it's name, which causes the dramatic tension that is to continue throughout the film. angered by the young social worker's apparent betrayal, patty clawson runs away from the foster home she has been sent to.faced with the daunting task of finding her family in a climate where the ideal is seen to be a complete separation from the past; she does the only the thing she can to ascertain their whereabouts and breaks into the senior social worker's office to steal the casefile.apprehended soon after she finds she has made a dangerous enemy. furious at the embarrassment this little girl has caused him and his department, the senior social worker decides to use his power and authority to destroy her; something that legally he is quite capable of doing.---------------this topic, of the harm of caregivers to clients, is relatively taboo. it certainly has been touched on very little in films as few directors wish to tread the path that would imply that caregivers cause harm.i think that this film plays a very important role in making the public more aware of this sort of thing. the case portrayed is not only plausible, but has probably happened many times before to many other children all over the world. this film is critical to changing public opinion in order to get rid of the laws that protect harmful people like the senior social worker in "broken promise".i strongly recommend broken promise. it is especially appropriate viewing for trainee social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors, and other caregiving professions. it is a lesson in avoidance that should be taken to heart.-----------in terms of the acting in "broken promise." melissa michaelsen plays a superb part as patty clawson. especially in films such as this believability is critical. if the viewer did not identify with the character of patty, the whole message of the film would be in jeopardy. it's unfortunate that melissa doesn't still act in films today, as her performance in "broken promise" shows her to have had exceptional talent.

well someone who enjoys traveling down the highway at 120kmph, eating mcdonalds, and running the air conditioner twenty four seven, and watching fox news non-stop, i found this documentary interesting. one thing i picked up, when they being they talk about north america, i assume this documentary was fabrique au canadie. for the canadian bashing i will leave that to bill o'reilly.the consequence of the depletion of oil will affect everyone, especially those who live in big countries of australia, canada and the united states. i am sure that green peace are cheering no more gas, means no more suvs, without realizing people who live in the sub zero temperatures could starve to death. as someone who has studied economics, i know for a fact we are living in a world of finite resources. i will give the documentary props for trying to present a balanced point of view about the depletion of oil. however i am studying a degree in journalism, this documentary is full of loaded messages - republican as warmongers. what the democrats didn't send troops to vietnam? if you are going to present a documentary about economics and resources, it is best to leave the political bashing to one side, because it could cause a potential audience member to totally shut down. concentrate on the issue of finite resources. at the end of the day, it is best to open the minds of the mainstream, as it is no good preaching to the minuscule choir. i really do enjoy watching documentaries such as fahrenheit 911, and end of suburbia not for their political bias, because they do remind us the world isn't so safe. sure i like to shop, and consumer junk food like there is no tomorrow, but if the world is going to end tomorrow i would rather die rich and consume the living beep out of it. for the potential documentary makers out there, just give the people facts, and let the viewers make up their own minds. if you are trying package your political views as a balanced documentary the people are going to smell a rat a mile away.

i own a video store with hundreds of documentaries. i have seen loads of them and love all of the great info out there. only a small handful though even come close to offering info as important as this one. i have been reading through other peoples reviews of this film and can't help but notice that the main things people are criticizing are irrelevant. such as "it is very one sided" such a pathetic criticism, every where in society that you look you will see the other side, and if you still need help go to globalpublicmedia.com. "it is the same people over and over" uh one might be led to believe that these people are the experts, so maybe they are the best people to interview. "filming style is all the same, head shots with few exceptions" if you want flash and dazzle watch micheal moore if you want info watch real docs such as this one. as you can plainly see none of these complaints have any relevance to the information contained. my guess is that these people are just missing the point and don't wanna give up there suv's.my recommendation: watch it. learn from it, and continue your education about such subjects. it is very important stuff for everyone.

the end of suburbia neatly collects many of the concerns with the coming "peak" of the world's oil supply. as the world population grows, so does demand for oil and power. as we extract oil and power, we come to a "peak" in production. more oil is demanded, less oil is generated. the inevitable outcome is conflict, and major change. this film will be disturbing, and alarming if you're new to the topic. you may react at first with anger and denial because the implications are so grim. it should be required viewing. beyond politics, beyond optimism, the math is undeniable. suburbia is the focus, because our suburban living areas will be the communities most impacted when the price of energy skyrockets. while intuitive logic would tell you that the big cities will be the places to avoid during a time of crisis, the spread out nature of suburbia will make it difficult if not impossible to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles to transport us. peak oil is no longer a topic for discussion by survivalists and backwoods crazies. this issue will be at our doorstep sooner than we think. this film is a lucid, coherent look at it.

i have the good common logical sense to know that oil cannot last forever and i am acutely aware of how much of my life in the suburbs revolves around petrochemical products. i've been an avid consumer of new technology and i keep running out of space on powerboards - so i know that even the energy crunch associated with peak oil will change my life appreciably.the end of suburbia shows, in a rational and entertaining manner, just how much my whole family's lifestyle will have to change in my lifetime. i am particularly concerned for the future generations who will have to pick up the tab for our excesses, however the film-makers do offer a glimmer of hope in that they acknowledge human resourcefulness and determination - and the sense of community that tends to be engendered by shared hardship.there is no point in trying to pretend that peak oil is baseless propaganda - or in treating it like the approaching radioactive cloud in "on the beach" (i.e. with suicide pills at the ready). even with our best efforts, times will get harder all over, and i'm hoping there's enough compassion and humanity to go around.

i always knew the day was coming. we all knew. there's only so much oil in the ground, and one day we'll run short. but isn't there supposed to be enough coal to use instead? and wind power, or something. things for future generations to worry about.then this documentary hit me smack between the eyes. oil makes the fertilizer that is the reason for the first time in world history practically no one lives on farms. when the inevitable oil shortages hit, a lot of things -- air travel, many drugs, plastics, life in the suburbs -- will become impossible. but the craziest insight from the documentary is this: oil gives us so much energy with so little effort, that without it our lives must change. even if substitutes and conservation are implemented immediately, at best they'll smooth our landing into a strange post-oil world which (the documentary claims) could be starting now.despite its gloomy message, the documentary is often highly entertaining. it contains fabulous historical footage (sober images of dark urban factories, and campy funny stuff from the 1950's) which reminds us of why we moved to the suburbs in the first place. it also offers hope that a massive effort started now could both ease our transition from oil and make the world a better place.my only complaint about the documentary is that it does not spend time on the mystery of why we are finding this stuff out now. how can this be a big emergency all of a sudden? we knew in the 1970s we should be preparing for a post-oil world -- and we started to prepare with alternative energy research and smaller cars. if our failure to follow through on president jimmy carter's initiatives 25 years ago has doomed us to a hard landing in a post-oil world, why was no one shouting about it on soapboxes?in the end i found the documentary highly persuasive; and it left me with the terrible chill of being dragged out of a very lovely dream. this is must viewing for everyone not afraid to face a very likely near future that we still have time to do something about.- charles

this documentary was my first introduction to peak oil theory. a fascinating concept that has a lot of frightening consequences if it turns out to be correct. i had absolutely no idea that the effects of oil depletion would come so soon, it literally took my breath away. this movie will probably open your eyes as to how strongly the american way of life is dependent on the "abundance of cheap oil" - a term used throughout the film. a lot of the topics are plain common sense, and they don't go into a huge amount of depth about any of them. but you've probably never put all the pieces together like this movie does. the interviews with the authors and energy experts are all very interesting. i don't think this film is meant to scare people. it's merely meant to inform people about what to expect in the years ahead, and maybe to encourage you to think twice about commuting 100miles to work and leaving your lights on all day long.after watching this film i was no longer able to look at the cars and buses zooming by quite the same. great documentary, everyone should see it.

first of all this movie is a piece of reality very well realized artistically. some kind of combination between "american beauty" and "as good as it gets". and of course something specifically to all russian movies ( of course the valuable one, no dirty propaganda !) : the problem of loneliness of man ... especially recommended for the people which really want to see beyond all vomitive propaganda about communism ( both positive or negative propaganda ! ). a movie about common people, their problems, lack of satisfactions - especially for young ones, fear when touch the real and too dirty face of the society ... and about the fake "solutions" : alcohol and violence ... and probably the only real solution : true love ... of course it's very well "located" in the space and time of "russian perestroika" but it's valid for all the society ( except a perfect one, but don't worry - not possible to find this on our earth !). for the last time - definitely recommended ...

a great movie about triumph over all the nay-sayers who try to kill your spirit, achieving the impossible. i won't go on about it, other than to say that i liked to reflect on the this film when i'm facing something particularly daunting, and realize that if lindberg could do what he did, i can certainly face the task before me. definitely a "feel good" movie.see it. you won't be disappointed.

1st watched 10/10/2009 - 8 out of 10 (dir - billy wilder): spectacular rendering of lindbergh's famous flight by james stewart as lindbergh and director billy wilder. there isn't really a whole lot of background built into this story but that's ok because wilder makes the event really remarkable as it comes directly from lindbergh's perspective since he used his book as the basis of the movie. this early movie about flying has to be one of the best about the act itself as well. stewart talking and thinking to himself during the flight gives you so much insight into what lindbergh went thru in this 33 hour solo flight across the atlantic. and he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before -- which is amazing!! there is a little backstory about how he purchased the plane and got the financing, and some flashbacks about his life during the flight but the movie is mostly about the flight. the story is also beautifully made and photographed and is a joy to watch despite it's age. i appreciate the fact that they didn't throw in a lot of fluff and just let the story tell itself. well done throughout. this is a classic movie that should be viewed by all.

every year there's one can't-miss much-anticipated red-hot big-budget title with the right combination of star, director and subject matter that fails miserably at the box-office. this year it was superman returns. in 1982 it was blade runner. in 1957 it was billy wilder's the spirit of st louis, a film that had everything - top director, huge star, best-selling true story about an american hero - except enough of an audience to cover its costs. maybe the public still remembered lucky lindy's anti-semitism and his loud admiration for nazi germany's achievements before the war (neither covered in the film, which ends with his arrival in paris before the legend got too tarnished). maybe because they thought they knew the story or that it was just going to be one guy stuck in a cockpit for two hours. certainly wilder and co-writer wendell mayes are aware of the dramatic pitfalls of lindbergh's relatively uneventful flight, alternating between a well-executed flashback structure to key points in his life and the build-up to the flight itself. once the film is airborne, it's both surprising and suspenseful, finding genuine drama in his attempts to stay awake and to navigate without proper instruments.it also builds up a quite remarkable sense of dread that's unlike anything else in wilder's filmography, allied to a real sense of the epic: shots like the ominous storm clouds over the hanger the dark dawn before the flight carry a real chill of foreboding to them. even the typically muted and problematic warnercolor adds to the film rather than detracts from it. along with the superb use of cinemascope, there's a remarkable score from franz waxman: majestic, soaring but filled with understated menace, and cleverly used as part of the fabric of the film rather than mere musical accompaniment. the film does lose points for implying, though never actually saying outright, that this was a race to be the first to fly the atlantic - in fact, lindbergh was the third man to fly across the atlantic after almost completely forgotten brits alcock and brown's astonishing flight eight years earlier - but it's still a remarkably tense and engrossing adventure story that deserved the success it never found.

the word impossible has led many to select a particular view concerning any incredible task. in 1927, it was believed no man could fly the breath of the atlantic ocean. many had tried but failed and some even gave their lives to the effort. nevertheless, it had to be done as every challenge needs to be met with equal determination. such then is the heart of this movie called "the spirit of st. louis." the actor chosen for this historic film is none other than america's own james stewart who convincingly plays charles lindbergh. although there are many facets of lindbergh's life, the segment featured here is his efforts to be the first man to fly across the atlantic. the story is an interesting one and for stewards' fans compelling to say the least. seeking enough funds to build a special aircraft, to the fateful decision to began the journey on a gloomy day in may 1927, 'luck lindy' as he was christened, endured enormous risks, which are featured in this superb film. other notables which helped make this film believable are murray hamilton who plays bud gurney, bartlett robinson as ben mahoney, arthur space and charles watts as o.w. schultz. the sum total of this now famous movie is that despite poor endorsement on its debut, it has since become a classic in it's own right. well done! ****

i have watched this film several times over the years and always find it an entertaining experience. as a retired airline pilot, i am interested in most aviation movies and this is one of the better ones. i know that lindbergh was only 25 years old at the time of his historic solo flight to paris and that james stewart was almost 50 when making this movie but i can overlook that fact because stewart has always been one of my all-time favorite actors and does one of his usual outstanding performances as the "lone eagle".there is a good mixture of comedy and drama throughout the film and a good use of flashbacks. it also helps that james stewart was a pilot in real life both in the military and civilian life.

"the spirit of st. louis" is billy wilder's film tribute to one of the best figures in aeronautical history, remembered for the first nonstop solo flight across the atlantic ocean in may 1927 with james stewart (a little too old for the part) playing charles lindbergh...as a tribute it is eloquent enough and, although a few nice liberties may have been taken with historical fact, the motion picture describing the detailed odyssey before and after the paris flight on may 20-21 in the monoplane "spirit of st. louis."although the lengthy internal monologue employed during the journey may be disappointing to an audience, the truth is that it helps keep the picture focused tightly on its essential point... stewart dignified the portrait of one of the greatest adventurers in the air the world has ever know, departing, in a highly modified single engine monoplane, from long island, new york to paris, france...no action is depicted in the trip, only some flashbacks to break up the monotony of the long flight... but there is superb determination of the ordeal of a brave and talented pilot decided to fly alone... his equation is simple: less weight (one engine, one pilot) would increase fuel efficiency and allow for a longer flying range, but with so much risk... lindbergh's claim to fame was doing something that many had tried and failed...even though wilder has bravely put it upon the screen in a calm, unhurried fashion, it comes out as biography of intense restraint and power... but it is james stewart's performance (controlled to the last detail) that gives life and strong, heroic stature to the principal figure in the film...from it there, emerges an awareness of a clever, firm but truly humble man who tackles a task with resolution, plans as much about it as he can, makes his decisions with courageous finality and then awaits with only one thought in mind, to get to paris... in his efforts to cut off the plane's weight, any item considered too heavy or unnecessary was left behind...the record-setting flight proved not only to be a fight with the elements and a test of navigation, but also a long battle against fatigue... a busy schedule and an active mind kept lindbergh up all of the previous night... still, he managed to stay conscious enough to keep the monoplane from crashing and landed at le bourget aerodrome, near paris, 33 hours and 30 minutes after leaving new york...stewart gives an able portrait of a brave pilot who attains legendary status, emphasizing the intention and dominant resolution to fly nonstop 5,810 kilometers (3,610 miles) across the atlantic...photographed in cinemascope and warnercolor and backed by franz waxman's beautiful music, the film effectively captures the pioneering spirit of the era and the hero's ultimate achievement since he takes off, that day, from roosevelt wet field, and clears telephone wires at the end of the runway...

if you are looking for king kong, you mispelled your search! this is a low-low budget movie that was soley >ment to entertain people in a comic sense. here is the >most ordinary human who is the only 1 who can save the >world from a 185' 300 ton behmouth. surely you can see the humor in that.

this year's royal rumble wasn't really bad, but last year's was definitely way better.first match- shawn michaels vs. edge even though this match did take a little too long, it was still alright. edge wins after using the ropes to pin shawn michaels. 4/10second match- undertaker vs. heidenreich in a casket match now i don't really like casket matches, this match was boring & sloppy but in the end it picked up it's pace as undertaker nailed the tombstone then rolled heidenreich in the casket for the victory. 4/10third match- jbl vs. kurt angle vs. big show in a triple-threat match for the wwe women's championship not a bad triple-threat match. too bad jbl wins again to retain his title after nailing a clothesline from hell on angle for the win. 5/10fourth match- randy orton vs. triple h for the world heavyweight championship great match by these two men, the match was a bit sloppy but it was still good & it picked up pretty towards the end. even though orton lost the match was fast paced & great towards the end. hhh nails the pedigree on orton for the win to retain his world title. 5/10fifth match- royal rumble this was a cool royal rumble {every royal rumble is good}. after all 30 men entered, the last four remaining superstars in the rumble were cena, edge, mysterio & batista. edge was able to spear mysterio out, later batista & cena clotheslined edge out together. it was now up to cena & batista. first after reversing an f-u, batista went for the batista bomb but suddenly both men crumbled on the outside at the same time. after a controversial decision & mr. mcmahon making his way to the ring to settle the matter. the match was restarted again as batista & cena battled it out, but batista got the better out of cena, nailed a spine-buster & threw cena out to win the 2005 royal rumble & go on to wrestlemania 21 to face the champion in the mainevent. 10/10 this was a very good royal rumble, but last year's would always top every royal rumble in history.overall: i'll give it 8/10 & b+

probably the best royal rumble in years.match 1 sees edge battle shawn michaels in a good but very long match. next up one of the worst wrestlers on the roster - heidenreich takes on the undertaker in a boring casket match. match number 3 sees bradshaw defend his wwe title against big show and kurt angle in a surprisingly good contest. the next match up sees triple h defending his 10th heavyweight title reign against randy orton in a great match up.next up the royal rumble takes place in which 15 raw superstars and 15 smackdown! superstars hit the ring to try and win the rumble and face the champion whoever that may be at wrestlemania 21. highlights included tough enough 3 winner daniel puder getting his ass kicked by chris benoit, eddie guerrero and hardcore holly! all of the superstars beating the crap out of muhammad hassan, and raw superstars vs smackdown! superstars!not a bad ppv at all.edge vs hbk - 8/10 taker vs heidenreich - 4/10 jbl vs angle vs big show - 7.5/10 triple h vs orton - 8.5/10 the royal rumble match - 9/10

this royal rumble basically had the message of wrestling these days. gimmick and image are more popular then wrestling ability.hbk vs edge. pretty good match. a lot of heat for edge who was just starting out as a heel again and what better way to go into a match with hbk. it kind of got a little slower at the end then usual. overall this match gets a 6/10. undertaker vs hedinreich. not a good match. undertaker had to carry hedinreich through this match who seemed to be really lost and screwed up his moves. it did get interesting to see raws gene snitsky and a bit later kane come into this match. overall the fans seemed more interested when this match ended. 2/10 kurt angle vs jbl vs big show. this match was slow at first but got pretty good at the end when angle managed to speed up the match.kurt angle did some really good wrestling moves and proves he is the best wrestler out of the match. jbl and big show put on a slow match. the ending to this match was bad. over all this match was a 5/10 mainlly because of kurt angle. randy orton vs hhh. good match,surprising heat for randy orton who was the face in this match. randy proved he can go the limit with any top star. this match also marked the first match hhh has wrestled where someone dosn't run down and save him from a loss. over all this match was about a 6/10.royal rumble match was ok. some surprises. some not so good surprises. i was kind of upset that kurt angle wasn't given enough time in this match. but over all this match had a guy who i never thought would be pushed so soon. i won't tell ya who wins. i give this match a 8/10

the royal rumble has traditionally been one of my favourite events, and i've been a wrestling fan for a good few years now. the other shows may have better matches, but i've always found the actual rumble match to be full of excitement.i'm not going to reveal the winners of any match as i don't see it as fair to ruin the results on a review. i will comment on the quality of them though.we have the standard 4 matches, and then the big rumble event. two from smackdown and two from raw.shawn michaels and edge open up for raw. this proves to be a good match from two talented guys. this is a match i'd recommend watching. it's hard to sum up without giving away the winner.next we have the usual undertaker against some big nasty monster, be whoever it is. giant gonzales, yokozuna, kamala... well this time it's heidenreich. its also a casket match. typical undertaker fare. watch if you're a fan. i have to admit i am, purely for the entertainment factor. it can hardly be regarded as a classic wrestling match.the next two matches are the title matches. for once smackdown manages to upstage raw. their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable, but with a anti-climax and let down to end it. raw's match is a pretty dull and boring affair, which is a pity as i'm a fan of both guys involved.now to the main reason i love the event, the rumble. it's a pretty good one this year. coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win, and it may not prove a big surprise, but hey, its very enjoyable. there are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated. there is the token guy who doesn't make it to the ring, the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished, and someone gets eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant. it has its usual highs and lows, and i loved the ending, in particular the vince mcmahon entrance.i'd recommend this show. not the wwe on top form, but its still good. add it to your collection.

as a french, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of french like that, at some defaults of westerners, at spy movies etc...and at a lot of other things too, en route... i already saw it 3 times and each time i discovered new things and laughed to tears... jean dujardin, bérénice béjo, aure atika the director and all the cast, all the crew did a fantastic job. this movie is funny but is although much more than that : it's got plenty of levels to it. you laugh because of simple gags, because of some critics made with wit (the movie's courageous enough to be critical), because of physical comedy, because you believe in the characters etc... esthetically and musically, it's a success too. go see it if you can.

that's how i'd sum it up! there were other who said, naked gun meets james bond. i think mine is more accurate, but i'm not neutral on that point ... ;o) this movie is kind of a blast from the past. it reminds you of the old movies (from the '50s & '60s) and that's not only because it plays in that time period (1955 to be exact, with the flashback exception), but it's the mood the movie is made in and it shows on screen! the main actor here (who is as i've been told very popular in his homeland france), is perfect in his role here. he's the spy with the number 117 attached to him. there is one character who sums him up in the movie, by asking a question, about if he's good or not ... you'll see when you watch the movie! very funny indeed this is and if you like your spies mixed with comedy with old school flair, but not taking itself or anything else for that matter seriously, than you need to watch this! :o)

i recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival where it ended up as one of the audience favorites. this is a spoof on the french cottage industry of oss 117 films of the 50's and 60's. the first oss 117 film based on the novel by jean bruce was brought to the screen in 1956, long before the first james bond film, staring ivan desny as hubert bonisseur de la bath and six subsequent action adventure spy films were made up to 1970 with luc merenda, frederick stafford, kerwin matthews and john gaven all taking turns as oss 117. jean dujardin is in the title role in this comedic take on the series. as the film begins set in 1945 he has a french mustache and resembles desny but as the film begins it's setting of 1955 he really looks like sean connery. jean françois halim wrote this hilarious screenplay of a spy sent to egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. it borrows on the silliness of naked gun, get smart and the pink panther and uses fresh humor on current events in a delightful combination that international audiences will enjoy and i am sure this will be the only the first of more to come of a revived oss 117 reworked to comedy adventures. michel hazanavicius directs. i would give this a 7.5 and recommend it.

i just saw this film last night, and i have to say that i loved every minute. if taken in the spirit of a parody of bond-esquire films, it's truly superior. the true comedy of the film is in its blatant disregard for political correctness. the misogyny, cultural insensitivity, and almost laughable macho-ism of the films of this genre are used for major comic effect. it also calls the illogic and formulaic elements to task, with agent oss 117 constantly learning difficult things insanely quick (such as arabic and how to play a traditional instrument) while missing some pathetically obvious clues. some of the lines from the film left me laughing for hours after the movie was finished...and i have to say i have learned some...interesting...french vocabulary that would probably have my professors quite exasperated with me were i to use. all in all, i thought this film excellent. intensely funny and the first film i've ever seen that truly parodies all aspects of the spy film.

one of starevich's earliest films made in france is possibly his only political satire. the story of the frogs who wanted a king mirrors its title as a group of high "croakers" feel that democracy has gone flat so they demand a king from jupiter to rule their land. when he sends down a stump, the frogs ask for another king, saying the stump is but "political timber." jupiter sends down a hungry stork this time whose frog lusty eyes devour the town's residents. as the original "croaker" is about to slide down the stork's beak, he speaks his moral: "let well enough alone." this film features a few beautiful crowd scenes of dozens of puppet frogs. starewicz tricks the audience into believing they are all moving at once by keeping the background in constant motion and animating only about six frogs or so at one time. the slightly corny dialogue and problems with lighting in a few places diminish the quality of repeat viewings, however its historical significance in starewicz's life make it of importance to watch. his feelings towards government immediately following his flee from russia are likely expressed in this film. in addition, the technical accomplishments of animating so many characters at once in a stop-motion film is astounding.

wladyslaw starewicz was a russian-born animator living in france who did incredible things using stop-motion. i've seen a couple of these films before and they feature his favorite subjects--insects, frogs and various animals. they are extremely realistic and lifelike and even today are amazing to watch--the quality is simply fantastic.this one stars lots and lots of frogs. they appeal to their god, jupiter, to give them a king. why do they need a king, wonders jupiter--their lives are perfectly fine now. so, to teach them a nasty lesson, he makes an egret the king and one by one it starts eating its subjects! then, the frogs once again appeal to jupiter, who states the obvious moral that it's best to be happy with what you have! while the animation quality is incredible, this is a very creepy film for kids. i would think this would terrify them both by how real the animals look as well as the story itself which is not for the faint of heart!

the frogs who wanted a king or frogland is ladislaw starewicz's most cautionary tale about people wanting government to solve their problems that i've ever seen. the ironic thing is that they pray to the god jupiter for their answers. jupiter responds first by sending a tree stump and then a stork. neither works out and the stork is especially dangerous to the amphibian creatures! the frogs have some human qualities when we see them dress in the latest fashions of the day and we see some take pictures or use a movie camera when the stork arrives! like i said, this short is very much a political allegory more suitable for adults than children. in fact, i first saw this on the rhino vhs that had bambi meets godzilla. that alone should tell you what to expect here!

many animation buffs consider wladyslaw starewicz the great forgotten genius of one special branch of the art, puppet animation, which he invented almost single-handedly . . . and, as it happened, almost accidentally. as a young man starewicz was more interested in entomology than the cinema, but his unsuccessful attempt to film two stag beetles fighting led to an unexpected breakthrough in film-making when he realized he could simulate movement by manipulating beetle carcasses and photographing them one frame at a time. this discovery led to the production of starewicz' amazingly elaborate classic short the cameraman's revenge, which he made in russia in 1912, at a time when motion picture animation of all sorts was in its infancy.the political tumult of the russian revolution caused starewicz to move to paris, where one of his first productions-- coincidentally? --was a dark political satire variously known as "frogland" or "the frogs who wanted a king." a strain of black comedy can be found in almost all of starewicz' films but here it is very dark indeed, aimed more at grown-ups who can appreciate the satirical aspects than children, who would most likely find the climax upsetting. (i'm middle-aged and found it pretty upsetting, myself.) and indeed, prints of the film intended for english-speaking viewers of the 1920s were given title cards filled with puns and quips in order to help soften the sharp sting of the finale.our tale is set in a swamp, the frogland commonwealth, where the citizens are unhappy with their government and have called a special session to see what they can do to improve matters. they decide to beseech jupiter for a king. the crowds are impressively animated in this opening sequence-- it couldn't have been easy to make so many frog puppets look alive simultaneously --while jupiter, for his part, is depicted as a droll white-bearded guy in the clouds who looks like he'd rather be taking a nap. when jupiter sends them a tree-like god who regards them impassively the frogs decide that this is no improvement and demand a different king. irritated, jupiter sends them a stork.delighted with this formidable-looking new king who towers above them, the frogs welcome him with a delegation of formally dressed dignitaries. the mayor steps forward to hand him the key to the commonwealth as newsreel cameras record the event. to everyone's horror, the stork promptly eats the mayor and then goes on a merry rampage, swallowing citizens at random. a title card dryly reads: "news of the king's appetite spreadeth throughout the kingdom." when the now-terrified frogs once more beseech jupiter for help, he loses his temper and showers their community with lightning bolts. the moral of our story, delivered by a hapless frog just before he is eaten, is "let well enough alone."considering the time period when this startling little film was made, and considering the fact that it was made by a russian émigré at the height of that beleaguered country's civil war, it would be easy to see this as a parable about those events. starewicz may or may not have had russia's turmoil in mind when he made "frogland," but whatever prompted his choice of material the film stands as a cautionary tale of universal application. "frogland" could be the soviet union, italy, germany or japan in the 1930s, or any country of any era that lets its guard down and is overwhelmed by tyranny. it's a fascinating film, even a charming one in its macabre way, but its message is no joke.

the ascent is a very worthwhile addition to recent re-releases from the soviet union. director larisa shepitko's 1977 film examines the moral ramifications of allegiance and honor in german occupied russia during the second world war. on foot and in a blizzard, two members of a partisan soviet group leave to locate supplies, and are captured by nazi soldiers. the focus of the movie is on how each man handles or internalizes his moral alternatives. one chooses dignity and integrity, while the other opts for collaboration with the enemy. however, in the end, he cannot abide by his selfish decision. the film makes much use of slow, wide-angle pans which shift to extreme closeups, and highlight the spiritual quandary within the souls of each man. this is not a great film, but it does effectively portray an intense moral dilemma against the backdrop of a harsh and frigid soviet wilderness.

i missed the beginning of the film. i came in when the partisan's were in the farm house. i can truthfully say that it was horrifying. the moral ramifications are staggering. my fear of pain and torture leave me unable to see myself other than cowardly. i see the christ like ability that was depicted by the brave patriot, and i can only pray that i could or would have the moral turpitude to follow his example.i see that a main theme of the film is to show the weakness/strength of the tortured, but what a dismal decision to have to be confronted with. all because the soul of man can be distorted in such a way that, pain and suffering being brought to bear on a fellow human being is in some way satisfying. be it mental or physical. i found the film very thought provoking.

during world war ii, two byelorussian (soviet russian) soldiers try to avoid being captured by occupying nazis, as they trudge through snowy terrain, searching for food and safety. if you happen not to like black-and-white "foreign" films, you may still enjoy "voskhozhdeniye" (retiled in english "the ascent"). director larisa shepitko paces the film extraordinarily well, despite its being a largely introspective piece of work. her untimely death, in a car accident, made this ms. shepitko's final film, unfortunately.after the opening mission is declared, there doesn't seem to be much that could happen in the snowy woods, but shepitko and a changing setting make it unexpectedly exciting. leading players vladimir gostyukhin (as the spiritually wounded "rybak") and boris plotnikov (as the physically wounded 'sotnikov") successfully avoid being crushed by the ever increasing symbolism. their allegorical performances, under shepitko's sharp direction, provide a memorable and thought-provoking take on a familiar story.******** voskhozhdeniye (4/2/77) larisa shepitko ~ vladimir gostyukhin, boris plotnikov, lyudmila polyakova, anatoli solonitsyn

reading the comments i am struck by the obvious effect this wonderful film has on viewers. but, how can you watch this movie and not reflect that the artful dialog was a subtle and oh so daring rebuke to the authorities "in control" in what was then the ussr at that moment in history? it wasn't the souls only in the time and place of the action being revealed. the questions, superficially asked, are nakedly provocative when directed to the here and now. who are the real "collaborators"? i marvel that the writer stayed out of prison. i read somewhere that great stress can be a catalyst for producing great art. this film is a masterpiece of misdirection, apparently pointing one way, while asking the audience to "look over my shoulder, at what i'm really talking about." what courage.

it comes as no surprise that larisa shepitko was married to elem klimov, who would later direct the most harrowing war film ever made, 'come and see (1985).' 'the ascent (1977)'  shepikto's final completed film before a premature death  is built in very much the same mould. set during wwii, the film follows a pair of soviet partisans who try to secure food for their starving army while evading the occupying german forces. the first forty minutes are agonisingly tense, as the two men drag themselves though the harsh, snow-covered landscape, the world around them completely sapped of life, warmth and colour (indeed, so monotonously drab is the scenery that it literally took me this long to realise that the film was shot in black-and-white).following the partisans' capture by german soldiers, the film becomes a cold meditation on loyalty and morality. whereas sotnikov (boris plotnikov) refuses to betray his army, even under extreme duress, the less resolute ryback (vladimir gostyukhin) attempts to save himself. is he wrong to do so? ryback's betrayal is disheartening, but the film doesn't immediately condemn his actions are treacherous; instead, the viewer is forced to consider what their own response might be in such a situation. shepitko pities ryback as the bible pities judas. both men betrayed their allies to the enemy, and were forced to watch them executed. however, whereas judas committed suicide by hanging (at least according to gospel of matthew), ryback finds even that option closed to him  in an excruciatingly taut climax, the belt around his neck becomes unfastened.'the ascent' draws its emotional power from shepitko's astonishing pursuit of realism. i have no doubt that the two principal actors spent days on end clambering across the snow-covered earth on their hands and knees, and, indeed, so convincing is their misery that i actually developed a cold while watching the film (seriously, i did). interestingly, the film interjects on this reality on several occasions, as ryback imagines himself making a bid for freedom, and then being gunned down by his german captors. this device, though unusual, works well with its biblical allegory; ryback is facing a trial of his worthiness, and, faced with a new dilemma at every turn, he consistently chooses the selfish alternative, his own life the only deciding criteria. at film's end, he is still alive, but the nightmare of war and guilt persists.

if you have a chance, see this russian(how should i call them: gems, masterpieces,hidden treasures?), war movies like this one, or the dawns here are quiet, or proverka na dorogah... and , right after that, watch again the american war movies, or the international productions, those one with the allies and the germans,etc. or, even worse, watch the italian war movies. everything from the west will seem shallow, contrived, ridiculous, in comparison with the russian movies. i am sooooo stunned by the quality of the aforementioned russian war movies that i cannot find the words to praise enough their shattering superiority over anglo-saxon war movies.

fantastic russian wwii movie. like most russian wwii movies, the ascent is incredibly harrowing. it's also dense in its symbolism. the story follows two partisans, sotnikov and rybak (boris plotnikov and vladimir gostyukhin), who go on a mission to search for food. on their trip, they are spotted by german soldiers, who wound sotnikov. sotnikov, in turn, kills one of the germans, which leads to trouble for the two partisans and everyone else they later run into. the greatest success of the film is its vivid sense of place. russia is frozen and snowy, and it's hard not to feel that cold go straight to your own bones. shepitko keeps her shot close to the characters, examining every crag of their faces. it was probably not the choice, but the film is framed 1.33:1, which gives the film a sense of claustrophobia. while the entire film is quite an achievement, i did feel that the first half was stronger than the second. my main complaint about the movie is that it develops into a very unsubtle christian allegory by its climax. i just don't think the symbolism adds much to the proceedings, especially when i was already intrigued by the debate between the two partisans. it's not quite fair. i was weighing the pros and cons of their argument. i began to lean toward the point of view of a certain character, and then the director pops up and tells me that he's judas! despite some heavy-handedness, this is still a must-see.

i agree with another reviewer, this is such a shattering film, that will be tough to watch again soon, though for quality alone, it deserves repeated viewing. the complexity of the characters, the incredible cinematography and superb direction make this movie worth the emotional price of watching.there is one scene, of the two partisans dragging themselves through the snow to escape a patrol, that's perhaps, for sheer physicality, the most amazing performance i've ever seen. in fact, though not episodic -- the story flows -- this is a movie of memorable scenes. there's the passing of rations amongst the partisans, the snow scenes, the ruined farm scene, the encounters in the houses, the interrogation, the "basement" scene, the "ascent". all stand out like jewels in a necklace.for me, the religiosity isn't overt. frankly, i don't think it would have been permitted in a soviet film. i do see this as an existential parable about the value of life. here is a tale where the hero -- and he is a true hero -- becomes the villain, and the weaker one becomes the stronger one. is this a mystical process or one dictated by circumstances? there is a transfiguration, but does it come from within or without? you must see the movie to understand the issues, for they can't be discussed without giving away too much of the story. i can't say enough about the acting. it's hard for me to choose which of the leads is more affecting. i'm not familiar with soviet film of the 70s and am not familiar with any of the actors, but they are all superb. i also note how director larisa shepitko uses children. they remind me of giotto's child angels.there is a little muddling in the end. there is apparently a prior relationship between the soldier sotnikov and the interrogator portnov, but this is left dangling. and the final scene is a bit ambiguous. but compared to the total experience these are quibbles. this is a movie that will mark you for life.

the ascent (1977) larisa shepitko is a name very few are familiar with. her bright career as a director only lasted a single decade, ended abruptly by a tragic car accident. despite her short career, she however managed to create some of the best soviet films of her time. her last film, the ascent, is widely regarded as one of the finest soviet films of the 1970s. nevertheless, her work remained in obscurity throughout the years that followed, usually only available on rare and poor copies on video. that has now changed thanks to the folks at criterion. they've released two of shepitko's best works through their eclipse department - wings, and her penultimate masterpiece the ascent.set during the darkest days of wwii in snowy rural russia, two partisans trudge their way across the land in search of food after their party is attacked by nazi patrols. they're originally only to go to a nearby farm, but when they arrive they find it razed by the germans. not wanting to return empty handed, they continue on deeper into enemy territory. along the way they must confront not only enemy soldiers, but the harsh conditions of the russian plains, potential betrayal and their own souls.the movie does not fall into simplistic plot devices or destinations. it addresses difficult questions with painful rationality. it never takes the easy road or gives us comforting answers. the second half of the film is filled with moral dilemmas. shepitko shows us the intimate horrors of war through the internal conflict between fellow russians - those who collaborated and those who fought back. while she does show the collaborators as the clear heels, she nevertheless also shows why many turned to such tactics - survival.the film contains a number of religious references, particularly to the lead up to the crucifixion. this is a spiritual journey, into the hearts, souls, and minds of the two partisans and those they encounter. shepitko and her cinematographer capture the journey in beautiful black and white photography. the camera moves in long shots, similar to the camera-work of another of russia's greatest filmmakers, andrei tarkovsky. shepitko, like many others, was clearly influenced by tarkovsky's style, and the ascent takes some of its rhythmic notes from ivan's childhood. it is a stunning film to look at, and does a fantastic job of capturing the cold and terrifying atmosphere of occupied russia.shepitko's husband would pay homage to her great film a decade later. elem klimov made his own war masterpiece with one of the greatest films i've ever seen - come and see. the story and themes of that film were clearly influenced by the ascent. though that film is also a fairly obscure one, it received far more attention that any of shepitko's films. that however acted as a bridge to shepitko, and has been one of the best helps to keeping her work alive.the ascent is a truly magnificent film, and rightly should be considered one of the best films of the 70s. it's stunning cinematography is inspiring; its mood is frighteningly authentic; and its lessons are unforgettable. it is, in any definition of the word, nothing less than a masterpiece. how unfortunate that shepitko's career was cut short just as it was hitting its peak.

this greatest movie gives us clue to the depth of our souls in most deadly moments of our lives. my heart is shrinking every time i saw the scene of hanging. i have no words any... you must see this brilliant picture.

i saw this film many years ago (along with another of shepitko's films, wings) as part of a soviet film series at a local film archive. but none of shepitko's films, as far as i can tell, have ever made it to video or dvd in the united states. ascent is a great film by any standard, with stunning black and white photography, hypnotic direction, and actors so deep into their roles that you have no sense of them merely giving a performance. although the period details of russian resistance to (and collaboration with) german occupation are very telling, the story is timeless. two russian partisans are captured by the germans, and the interrogation tests their integrity as well as their courage. i suspect the reason why it has not been released on dvd by the russians (here comes the spoiler) is that the jewish intellectual (and not the tough russian peasant) is the partisan who resists both threats and temptation, goes serenely to his death, and sets an heroic example for the villagers.

even if voskhozhdeniye was your favorite film it would only be possible to watch it, at most, every ten years. its just too emotionally strenuous.widely regarded as shepitko's finest film, the ascent is the story of partisans operating in the byelorussian forest in the dead of winter in german occupied soviet union.while assaulting the audience with the sheer physicality of the wartime experience, particularly the privations of cold and snow, the actual struggle for survival against both nature and the fascists, there is always a subtle, barely inferred sub-text of moral judgment and the question about whether a man can be moral or immoral in one context but otherwise in another.a partisan group hiding in the woods is attacked by a german patrol and loses their food supplies. two men, rybak, who knows the area, and sotnikov, a jewish schoolteacher, are assigned the task of going to a small village for food. they find the village burnt to the ground with nothing edible and nothing more than charred timbers and foundations in which in one cubby hole there's a children's mirror hidden. the overwhelming feeling is that whoever brings the brutality of war to a land and a people become truly cursed. i thought of the war that the americans and british brought to iraq and about how bringing the horrors of war to people is the act of a degenerate nation.the two move on to a nearby larger village where they obtain, under duress, a lamb from the collaborator headman. the german's arrive and the two partisans escape under fire. sotnikov is hit in his foot and holds off the german's as rybak gets away with the lamb. sotnikov becomes so desperate that prepared not to be taken alive he removes his boot in order to put a bullet into his head. just then rybak returns and drags sotnikov out of the line of fire.rybak drags sotnikov through the forest, bloody meter by meter all done in one long take. each meter is an agony and yet he still pulls him through deep snow, up ridges, across depressions, over black bush stumps which crack as they snap under the weight of the men. there are several similarities to the cinematic vocabulary of tarkowsky here - the long takes documenting a process, the effect of using repetition, and the resulting emotional stress which builds the longer the shot goes on. in the background, unnoticed because of the action, there hangs a question- did rybak commit an immoral act by going back for sotnikov? whether under the moral standards of marxist-leninism or merely the common imperative of the survival of the group, wasn't his duty to get the food back to his starving band and leave sotnikov to cover his escape? to sacrifice one man in order for the group to survive? which leads to the question - can a man who is immoral under one philosophical system be expected to be moral under a different moral system? the partisans come as if another curse of war to a farm house containing a woman with three small children. she is embittered by the scourge of war and barely hanging on with her three children. they are barely rested when more germans show up. they make their way to leave and are directed to the loft to hide.sotnikov's cough gives them away. when a german pops his head in to have a look and no one responds he threatens to fire across the loft and rybak's nerves break and they are captured. now who has the moral responsibility here? sotnikov for coughing or rybek for cracking? the two partisans and the mother are trussed up and taken to a nearby town passing ominously under a wrought iron arch at the entrance. they find the headman and a small girl already in custody. they are interrogated by a turncoat byelorussian played by tarkowsky favorite anatoli solonitsyn. sotnikov keeps his head during interrogation and torture and only asks what the interrogator's prewar profession was? he doesn't answer but from his ease standing behind a desk the likely answer was 'schoolteacher'.rybak on the other hand begs for his life and even offers to join the police. the previously unnoticed character defect, making a 'wrong' moral decision, the ambiguity (sentimentality) of which disguised it from judgment, now becomes obvious, unsettling and very ugly.the five sit in a dark cell. they are all scheduled to die the next day. from here the elements of a christian parable become stronger. genuine rembrandt lighting and compositions are used as other old master poses of christ are represented. he decides he can save everyone if he takes on the guilt for everyone. he must be kept alive until morning so he can save everyone. he asks the mother for forgiveness and the headman knowing what is taking place doesn't feel such despair at dying uselessly as he did before.morning comes. the germans don't care if sotnikov takes on all of the sins of his companions or not. they will all be hung. they trudge up a steeply inclined street which is a virtual via dolorosa. a bench is taken up to the site of execution which is the gateway to the town. five ropes hang from it. the bench only stands three, so sotnikov stands on a tree stump which rybak kicks out from under him. they all are hung.as rybak descend the road with the germans, someone in the crowd calls him a judas, an unnecessary allusion, shepitko's only misstep. rybak imagines several times being shot in the back trying to escape, dying an honorable death and tries, unsuccessfully, to hang himself in the shithouse, but leaves with the germans as the beaten dog he is. however if rybak was morally right to go back and save sotnikov's life, is he wrong to try to save his own life?

having just seen this, i find it hard to believe that it is not better known. this and the slightly-better-known, but almost-as-shamefully-neglected come and see (klimov, 1986) must be two of the greatest war films. they are meaningful, powerful, incisive. the ascent is also gifted with a sparingly-used, but brilliantly trenchant score by schnittke.

shepitko is the wife of russian filmmaker elem klimov, who directed the more commercially known 1984 film come and see, generally regarded as one of the most realistic war films ever, bar none, notable for its searing poetic intensity, but i believe it lacks the inner complexity of this even greater russian film, which examines not just the graphic outer horrors, but she finds truly inspiring images focusing on individuals or small groups of characters that reflect the absolute insanity taking place inside these human beings, the ending of which is simply awe-inspiring. bullets are flying and bodies are dying in a gun skirmish over the opening credits, where the intensity of the film never lets up throughout the duration, focusing on grim faces, worn out soldiers with next to nothing to eat, a terrified population under occupation, starving children with petrified mothers, all cast in an immense landscape of endless white snow. like cranes are flying (1957), this features a russian army in retreat, a traumatizing shock early in the war when they were nearly wiped out. the russian countryside has been overrun by german nazi's who are terrorizing the citizens, stealing what food they have, forcing them under duress to become their informant eyes and ears. what russian soldiers are left hide under cover of forests, but are forced to send food expeditions to neighboring farms. this film follows two soldiers that from the outset are on a near impossible mission, as there's little food left anywhere in the dead of winter. one is healthy and fit, vladimir gostyukhin as rybak, while the other, boris plotnikov as sotnikov, is slowed down by a tubercular sounding cough and eventually a bullet in his leg that nearly leaves him for dead, but his partner heroically rescues him. as they step through knee deep snow drifts, crawling at some points with insufficient protection against the harsh elements, like so many other russian films, nature itself becomes their toughest foe.spoilers!! everything is reduced to a matter of survival. when they reach their destination, the farm has been demolished and left in a state of rubble, pushing forward into german occupied territory where the next farm is manned by an elderly soviet collaborator who fears nazi retribution. the partisan soldiers think him a coward but move on, where they are eventually captured and brought to a nazi camp in a nearby town and held as prisoners, along with a proud and protective mother (lyudmila polyakova) who helped hide them. tarkovsky stalwart anatoli solonitsyn appears as portnov the interrogator, a russian teacher from a nearby academy turned nazi sympathizer. russians torturing and executing fellow russians is the depth of war depravity and solonitsyn is brilliant in the despicable role he's perfectly suited for. from what we can see, as nazi officers chat jovially in close proximity to one another, he is an outsider even among this group, seen instead as a kind of gruesome black-cloaked undertaker who routinely sends men to their graves. the audience is not spared from witnessing acts of torture on sotnikov, who offers nothing but contempt, while rybak speaks freely, hoping to save his life, but both are condemned to die, though rybak is offered a chance to serve the german reich as a police agent. the mother, the elderly collaborator, and a child are added to this group, spending one last night together alive where together they discuss the merits of a soldier's mission, of being a patriot, a mother, a coward, or a collaborator. each seems individually driven by a desperate need to survive, but sotnikov offers himself as a selfless example, attempting to confess his guilt to spare the others, where the aptly chosen title reflects his spiritual redemption.by the next morning, portnov seems mildly amused, mocking them at their sudden willingness to talk, but spares no one except rybak, who changes sides to keep his life, rationalizing in his thoughts that if he's alive, at least he has a chance to escape. but there is no escapenot from this torment. what happens is shown with exquisite delicacy and poetic grace, as we witness the treachery of war without a single shot being fired, as the execution by hanging is turned into a public spectacle, where the villagers at the point of a gun are forced to witness. the pace and harrowing intensity of this film is relentless, as there is never a moment without impending menace, gorgeously shot by vladimir chukhnov (who died in the same car accident as shepitko), featuring perfectly composed landscapes and plenty of camera movement, much of it at close range using portraitures, especially that of a fierce young boy at the end who eyes the condemned men, who makes a surreal connection to the next generation without any words being spoken, accentuated by the psychologically horrific music of alfred shnittke which resembles the transcendent yet furiously disturbing monolith music from kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey (1968). the sound design of this film is highly advanced and uniquely modern, where the use of off screen sound continually exposes the raw nerves of each moment, dogs barking, wind blowing, bullets firing, nearby nazi's chattering in untranslated german or laughing sadistically at their helplessness, which only ratchets up the hideous tension to insane heights. in many ways resembling dreyer's the passion of joan of arc (1928), utter insanity is exposed here, the relentless realization that you have no choice, yet you are forced to make one anyway. the nightmarish inner thoughts at the end are expressed wordlessly, where the nobility of the dead speaks volumes, where voices continue to reverberate inside the heads of the living like an explosion of neverending echoes, yet only silence fills the crisp wintry air with a mournful reverence and a profound sense of loss.

larisa shepitko's the ascent (1976) is an extraordinary, gruelling account of the partisans' fight against the nazis in german-occupied belorussia, the ascent reflects the russian obsession with the horrors of the great patriotic war, but unusually is both steeped in religious symbolism and ready to acknowledge the existence of the less than great russian collaborator. the true battle is not with the nazis, who hover in the background as mere extras, but between the russian nazi investigator and sotnikov, the captured partisan who finds the spiritual strength to go to his death unbeaten. with its many references to the crucifixion, the story takes on heroic proportions glorifying the sufferings of the martyr and his influence on future generations. a remarkable piece of work.

this is one of the very, very few films that are so overwhelming that you are very unlikely to watch it more than once or twice in your lifetime (other examples are claude lanzmann's documentary shoah and come and see by the director's husband elem klimov - which covers much the same unbearable territory but in a very different way).i suppose this is just as well given the difficulty of ever seeing a print.apparently it's extraordinarily overt christian symbolism and admission that there were active russian collaborators, ensured that it was hardly ever seen in the ussr - and of course post-soviet russia has very little interest in films of that era.the one time i saw it in london was in a festival of russian movies shown during the glasnost era (i.e. probably c.1988) - however it apparently has been shown several times in the uk more recently so at least one subtitled print must exist here.as far as i know it has never been released in the west on dvd or video so if you haven't seen it, your best chance is probably to join a film society and endlessly nag them to find a print and screen it.

a stunningly harrowing account of two soldiers plight in wwii. set against a freezing backdrop of, not only the fight against the nazis and traitors in belorussia, but the harsh natural elements, this film tells a tale of two soldiers of polarized morals, one who survives, but finds it somewhat impossible to deal with his own circumstances, and one who dies, having done all that can be done in the face of intimidation and everything possible to break one's spirit, in fact, the "ascendant" of the title. a film that should be seen by all, particularly for the phenomenal performances of the main characters, and shuddering set pieces (the incarceration and hanging scenes, in particular. an absolute must see.

in the belarus of 1942, two soviet soldiers are captured by nazi-friendly belarusians. in captivity, the attitude of the two men toward their fate differs greatly. one of the soldiers manages to find an inner strength and spirituality, incomprehensible to the other man. larisa shepitko's last film is one of the most beautiful war films in cinema history. the cinematography, by vladimir chuchnov, is incredible - particularly in the opening sequence, where long, slow, tracking shots depicting the solitude and almost desperate nature of winter landscape in rural belarus set the mood perfectly. it is easy to draw comparison to tarkovsky's films, even more so since tarkovsky's alter ego anatoli solonitsyn has a small but important part in the ascent. the acting is overall brilliant, especially by boris plotnikov, in the part of sotnikov. the film reveals an old-fashioned belief in the strength of religious passion, which feels related to characters such as dostoyevsky's prince myshkin, or tarkovsky's stalker. however, this is not a weakness of the film, but rather one of its greatest strengths. the religious content seems so honest, and human, that it is impossible not to be moved. the emotional richness of the film cannot be overstated; the answer is not as simplified as a short summary of the plot would make you think. the slow development of the characters, and the emphasis on their complicated relationships to each other, are somewhat reminiscent of the commissar, another great soviet film. the ascent deserves a second watching, as well as a third, and a tenth. it continues to provide interesting ideas, beautiful images, and emotional complexity.

this is one of my favourite films; a delightful comedy; so i was thrilled to learn it is about to be released on dvd in the uk, september 2007.romuald, played by daniel auteuil is a rich company president of a dairy firm. juliette, played by the excellent firmine richard, is a cleaner of the company's paris offices.juliette, a black mother of several children, discovers a plot against romuald who initially ignores her attempts to warn him. slowly he grasps what this charming lady from the parisian underclass has been trying to tell him. 'he seeks shelter in her crowded apartment as his marriage and career fall apart. an unlikely love blossoms. cultures clash in what is a truly delightful light-hearted comedy.

this movie is a gem! it is the story of juliette, a perfectly ordinary cleaning woman who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company, and romuald, the president of same. he takes no notice of her, he takes no notice of anyone until several plots to wrest his company away from him all hit at the same time. he is lost, no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers juliette. as the cleaning woman, no one pays any attention to her, so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to catch on to and use to help her helpless and hapless boss.i have been keeping an eye out for years for the dvd of this and to see a previous comment about it being released in sep 2007 raised my hopes. alas, i cannot find a dvd, does anyone know if there is/was one?

i would not compare it to le placard, which imho had more comic moments, but romuald & juliette while being a slow starter certainly kept your attention going throughout the film, nicely paced and reaching a heart warming conclusion :) there were many marvellous comedic moments, some brilliant pathos and realistic situation acting by all actors.it was a typically french film, in which while confronting prejudices and phobias, which in turn the made the viewer confront his own shortcomings! i am certainly pleased to have this in my library, and will no doubt watch it time and time again, which to me is a mark of a great film.

in a style reminiscent of the best of david lean, this romantic love story sweeps across the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert regions against which it is set. it's a film which purports that one does not choose love, but rather that it's love that does the choosing, regardless of who, where or when; and furthermore, that it's a matter of the heart often contingent upon prevailing conditions and circumstances. and thus is the situation in `the english patient,' directed by anthony minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune of places and times, proving that when it is predestined, love will find a way.it's wwii; flying above the african desert, hungarian count laszlo de almasy (ralph fiennes) is shot down, his biplane mistaken for an enemy aircraft. and though he survives the crash, he is severely burned. to his great good fortune, however, he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and winds up in a hospital. but existing conditions are governed by circumstances of war, and almasy soon becomes one of many patients being transported via convoy to a different facility. upon reaching italy, he is too weak and ill to continue on, and a canadian nurse, hana (juliette binoche), volunteers to stay behind with him at an abandoned monastery.hana soon discovers that her charge is something of a man of mystery, as almasy remembers nothing of his past, and not even his own name. thought to be english, the only clues pointing to who he is are contained in a book found in his possession after the crash, but even they are as cryptic as hana's patient. slowly, however, under prompting from hana, almasy begins to remember bits and pieces of his life, and his story begins to unfold. and his memory is helped along even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named caravaggio (willem dafoe), who suspects that almasy is the man he's been looking for-- a man with whom he wants to settle a score. but, burned beyond recognition, almasy may or may not be that man. meanwhile, almasy's memories continue to surface; memories of a woman he loved, katherine clifton (kristin scott thomas)-- as well as memories of katherine's husband, geoffrey (colin firth). and, crippled in mind and body as he is, those memories become the only thing left to which he can cling with any hope at all, even as his life seems to be slipping farther away with each passing moment.in addition to directing, anthony minghella also wrote the screenplay for this film, which he adapted from the novel by michael ondaatje. the result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of lean's `doctor zhivago' and `lawrence of arabia'; a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty. simply put, minghella's film is genius realized; crafted and delivered with a poetic perfection, watching it is like watching a monet come to life. from the opening frames, minghella casts a hypnotic spell over his audience that is binding and transporting, with a story that has an emotional beauty that equals the engagingly stunning and vibrant images brought to life by john seale's remarkable cinematography; images that virtually fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer. in every sense, this is a film of rare eloquence, with a striking emotional capacity that facilitates an experience that is truly transcendental. nominated in twelve categories, it deservedly received a total of nine oscars, including best picture, director, supporting actress (binoche) and cinematography.if one had to choose a single word to describe the `essence' of this film, it would be `excellence.' even an extraordinary film, however, does not receive nine oscars without performances that are extraordinary in kind; and the performances given by ralph fiennes and kristin scott thomas here transcend the term `oscar worthy.' nominated for best actor for his portrayal of almasy (geoffrey rush was awarded the gold for `shine'), fiennes has never been better, achieving an emotional depth with his character that is nearly palpable. private and introspective, almasy is not by his very nature an individual to whom the audience will be able to form an intimate connection; fiennes, however, finds a way to open that emotional door just enough to let you in, enough so that you taste the honest passion welling up within him. and it works. almasy does not seek your friendship; he will, however, gain your compassion.kristen scott thomas, too, received an oscar nomination for best actress (frances mcdormand received the award for `fargo') for her portrayal of katherine, a woman whose stoic countenance masks the emotional conflict raging within her, born of the forbidden passion that enslaves her and yet to which she gives herself willingly, casting off her shackles of repression to embrace a love so strong it threatens to consume her. the reserve katherine must maintain evokes the empathy of the audience, as scott thomas successfully mines the emotional depths of her character to the greatest possible effect. it's the kind of performance that draws you in and holds you fast, taking you as it does beyond that curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what must be if only for the sake of appearances, and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion. understated and shaded with subtlety, it's terrific work by kristin scott thomas.binoche gives a stunning, affecting performance, as well, as the kindhearted nurse, hana; it is her humanity, in fact, which defines love in it's purest sense and offers a balanced perspective of it within the context of the film. her relationship with kip (naveen andrews) affords us a glimpse of passion of another kind, which contrasts effectively with the intensity of that between almasy and katherine. `the english patient' is a film that will move you and fill you emotionally; one you will not want to see end. 10/10.   

the biggest heroes, is one of the greatest movies ever. a good story, great actors and a brilliant ending is what makes this film the jumping start of the director thomas vinterberg's great carrier.

this must be one of the funniest danish movies ever made. ulrich thomsen and thomas bo larsen are hilarious, as they drive across sweden. i don't know how ulrich thomsen does it, but somehow he can manage to play insane in a very sane way. but if you don't understand danish (i am not referring to your pastry here) don't waste your time on this  i don't think it would work with subtitles.

this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. it is about true love and friendship. about turning your life around and doing something good for someone else. thomas bo larsen may play the same role he has done in so many other movies, but recently we have seen him in other roles which he does great too. but so what if he plays the same role that he has done in other movies  he's perfect for that role. ulrich thomsen does a great job too. these two criminal "low-lifes" are the best friends ever. they share everything and they do everything for each other no matter what the costs are. when they find out that peter's daughter is being abused they put everything on hold (things you can't put on hold unless you have to make even more criminal acts) and takes her to a better place. they do the best they can  these two men are not masterminds but they have their heart in the right place. all i can say is that peter and carsten are my biggest heroes too

it's all there: two classic anti-hero buddies, a headlong chase through beautiful swedish scenery, guns, violence, sex, and a butch cassidy / sundance kid - style finale.add a touch of surrealism and some distinctly danish humour, and you've got this excellent road-movie.

"hit and run" is a shattering story starring the always wonderful margaret colin as a society lady who "has it all" until she hits a child with her car and leaves the scene. hence the title. the tragedy is that she goes to call for help and returns, but is frightened away by angry passers-by who think the hitter abandoned the scene. this was made in the days when not everyone had a cell phone or there wouldn't be a story.colin's guilt and anguish are palpable and cause her to act so strangely that a detective gets onto her right away. her lies sink her deeper and deeper into a self-loathing hole, causing her to make a bad situation worse.this is a very thought-provoking story, and one can't help but to feel this lady's pain, wishing throughout that she would simply come clean.as a tv movie, thanks to colin and a strong script, this is a well above average tv movie.

a brilliant film by the great john waters. the characters are unforgettable. the acting, script, and camera-work only enhance the overall greatness of this film. perversion as an art-form. a must see for all. easily a perfect 10!

for all viewers out there who have slammed john waters for creating a film like pink flamingos, just stop. it's getting you nowhere. has anyone ever cared to stop and think about the ambition and dedication mr.waters possesses. to gather your best friends up and to create a movie just to gross out thousands of viewers all over shows this man has a great deal of ambition inside himself. just read his biography shock value. it discusses the lengths he went through to get this film finished. maybe it wasn't just the fact that john made this film to gross people out, it was to prove that there can be something such as good bad taste>

rating-10 classic waters! one of his best and most shocking films! divine is the most filthy person ever! mink stole also delivers a superb performance!

i loved this thing. the most wonderful thing about pink flamingos is that it strives desperately to be in horrible taste, but has really gained a cult following world wide. says a lot about us (us being people) doesn't it. pink flamingos succeeds because waters made the film he wanted to make. a film need not be disgusting to succeed, but it may be. when you watch this film, you see things that are disgusting, but are ultimately brilliant because they are freely displayed. what we have here is an honest piece of personal creative expression. everyone who ever cares to succeed as an artist, be it in film or any other media, should watch this film.

the film that gave us john waters is one of the funniest films ever. yes it may be gross but it's filled with hysterical moments that nobody has done since. the infamous dog-scene has to be one of the highlights of cinema. not a film for the easily offended it's one of those movies where you always see something new. divine's performance is worth the reputation. mink stole is hysterical. this is the film responsible for the farrely brothers and the entire gross-out comedy genre. i know that sounds a bit extreme but think about it. before this comedies were very run of the mill and almost identical. after this movie comedies became strange and weird, but in a good way. i'd give it 15 out of 10 if i could.

out of any category, this is one demented and over the edge film, even in todays standards. filmed entirely in crap-o-rama, this film will blow your mind (and something else too!)the amount of hilarious bad taste and sleaze is astonishing. the dialog is breathtakingly fast and campy. you'll either love or hate this film, but give it go. i've seen it 4 times and absolutely love it. divine is in the quest for being the filthiest person alive, but so are her rivals too in this obscene and disgusting (but funny) and stylish little film. divine was phenomenal, and "she" will always be missed greatly. edith massey does the unforgettable performance as the "egglady" and don't forget the energetic mink stole!über crazy s**t! recommended also for you sick little puppies;female trouble desperate living polyester

more entertaining than all the gay orgies in "300" combined. more heartbreaking than a shakespearian tragedy. more poetic than even the most melodramatic poems about lost love and blah blah blah. and on top of all that, the greatest trash ever made.a black comedy testing the limits of the human senses, john waters's cult movie "pink flamingos" is a story about the conflict between two families that ends in humiliation, death and of course the eating of dog feces (yeah by the way that is not actually the humiliating part). no no, this is not about the impossible love, there are no romeos or juliets on these 90 or so minutes. this movie is about the battle for prestige if you could call it that. the battle for the title - filthiest person alive.on one side we have divine (played by the cross-dressing waters regular... umm... divine) a caring daughter, good mother, cannibal, murderer, pervert and current owner of said title. she loves her son crackers a bit way too much. crackers himself sports a sexual attraction to both chickens and young ladies sometimes mixing them up in threesomes. family friend and loyal accomplice cotton gets her satisfaction from watching crackers during some of his... acts involving the mentioned earlier objects of attraction. last but not least divine's mother and grandmother to crackers, edie. a 400 hundred pound woman, sleeping, eating and basically living in a baby cradle. she is addicted to eggs and loves the egg-man (the man who brings the eggs...lol).the four of them live peacefully in a caravan outside the city until the moment when they become a target for the marbles. exhibitionists, manipulators, cheaters, very evil people actually. their main source of income comes from the kidnapping and impregnating of young women. for the impregnating part they use their trusted and loyal cross-dressing butler to provide the semen. after that they sale the birthed child to the highest bidder.it was the marbles's envy towards divine and her title that will lead to an inevitable confrontation between the two families. an epic battle of filth, perversion and violence."pink flamingos" is an unsurpassed masterpiece in the trash-movie genre. loaded with oddities and strange acts, john waters's movie is loathed and hated by traditionalists, critics and the average movie-going audience. but for the few that remain unscratched by these generalizations the flamingos is an unforgettable experience. funny and sick, violent and poetic. it truly is an exercise in poor taste

for me, pink flamingos lived up to it's reputation as being the shocking, disgusting, repulsive, trashy film i was expecting it to be, that really contains everything but the kitchen sink. we are treated to almost two hours of nastiness that never lets up: rape, sex, sex with chickens, transsexuals, castration, murder, cannibalism, and a horrid display of singing out ones anus. it is about a strange couple who begin a competition with a trailer trash family, trying to steal their title as the "filthiest people alive". divine (a fat guy in drag) is an unbelievably vile human being, who actually becomes painful to watch. trust me when i say that this film is not one to be quickly forgotten, especially the end scene in which divine eats dog crap off the sidewalk. i have always thought john waters was over-rated and i cannot say i like this film, but it is an experience if you ever get a chance to see it.

i grew up in baltimore, so i was exposed to the films of john waters, since i was way too young to watch them. and if you're knowledge of john waters is limited to hairspray or cry-baby, or other family friendly movies, then you must prepare yourself for pink flamingos.explicit sex acts, incest, an old lady who eats nothing but eggs, and unsanitary acts with chickens are just a mere portion of some of the depravity in this movie. the film ends with divine, waters' 300 lbs. cross-dressing star eating dog excrement.the premise is about two families: one a pair of inbred trailer trash, which includes divine and edith massey as the egg lady; and the other is a rich, swinging couple. both families are competing for the title of "filthiest person alive." enjoy john waters' finest movie, but only see it if you're an open-minded individual with a strong stomach, because some scenes in this movie will gross you out.

you know the saying "curiosity killed the cat"? well, i have heard so much about this film, from a magazine that named this one of the most shocking movies of all time, my 1001 movies you must see before you die, my sister who saw this at a film festival, and the i love the 70's show on vh1. i just had to see this movie since it was named the grossest movie of all time, and well, after viewing this film last night, i have to say that it really did live up to it's title. my god, this movie was so weird! i thought i really did see it all with some of the sickest movies and tv shows i've seen, some things i guess will always still feel like a shock.well, babs johnson, aka divine, has been named the filthiest person alive and a jealous couple named the marbles are competing for that title. they want to take divine out and be named the filthiest couple alive by kidnapping women, raping them, impregnating them, and selling their babies to lesbian couples. but it seems like divine and her family of well... i don't know, seems to keep the title by having sex with chickens, butt lip syncing, eating dog feces, stuffing meat up their skirts, incest, and it just gets grosser and grosser.pink flamingos is horribly acted, horribly made, and well, just plain horrible. the reason for the 10 rating i'm going to give it is due to the fact, well, how could you rate this film? i always rate, so i just figure what the heck? through the grossness of this film, you have got to give john waters some credit, who the heck would ever think of this movie over 35 years later? to the cast and crew who worked on this film, you guys are just plain nasty!10/10

babs johnson (divine) lives in a trailer with her son crackers, her daughter cotton and her mother edie (edie massey). she's in competition with a couple named connie and raymond marbles (mink stole, david lochary) to be named the filthiest person alive. the film shows their attempts to outdo each other.this film is very much not for everyone. it's a in your face no holds barred assault in bad taste. crackers has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister watches; the marbles pick up female hitchhikers, impregnate them, keep them chained in the basement and sell the babies to lesbian couples; divine and family have a party which includes cannibalism etc etc. it's disgusting but, in a way, not unwatchable. it's so over the top and is so unapologetic about it that it's kind of fascinating. as director john waters might say, it's bad taste done well. also it's kind of amusing to watch--the acting is so wretched (especially by massey) that you just watch it in disbelief. a friend laughed out loud at how bad massey was (she improved in later pictures).this is not for people who are easily offended. even though it's over 30 years old it's still shocking. however if you have an open mind and can take a lot of extreme behaviour this is a must-see. the only part that really was too much is what divine does at the very end.

what's there to say about "pink flamingos"? it is beyond criticism or even explanation because it doesn't really aspire to be like any other movie you've seen. you will either get it, or you won't, laugh at it or roll your eyes in disgust (or both). john waters is an odd filmmaker (putting that mildly), mixing both innocent, childlike humor with shockingly offensive moments intended to...well, who knows what his intentions were. it is like a form of assault, albeit a funny one.the thing that makes waters's humor so infectious and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that can seem both alien and completely familiar to the viewer, like the petty rivalries that form the plot of "pink flamingos". surely everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point, but almost certainly the matter at stake was not the title of "the filthiest person alive." what makes the movie compelling viewing for me is the way that waters creates giddy, self-contained environments and doesn't let you in on the joke right away. the people in his films are completely in tune with one another. for instance, when cotton tells babs that she doesn't want to accompany her into town because crackers is bringing his "lady friend" out to the trailer, babs reacts with a knowing smirk and says to her, in a conspiratorial aside, "that little shed's just perfect..." at this point, we do not know yet that crackers plans to take his "lady friend" out to the shed to thrust live chickens at her naked body while cotton watches orgasmically through a window, but this weirdness is totally commonplace and understood by the characters in the fictitiously degenerate world that waters creates.another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and channing, the marbles' deviant butler. the first time we see them, waters cuts jarringly from a scene in connie's cozy office to channing descending into the basement, where we see that there are two women down there, one dead and one very much alive and p***ed off. susan is not a cowering victim, but is enraged and abusive to channing, leaping up to launch a full-scale verbal attack on her jailer. they both have a weird understanding of the bizarre situation, and she is not so much intimidated by her kidnapping as she is violently insulted and righteously furious. she does not let up for one second while channing is in her sight, and the two scenes that feature their delirious banter are two of the comic highlights of the film. later in the film, when divine and crackers break into the marbles's home and discover their crimes of keeping abducted women in their basement, it represents the total lack of support that divine and her family have for the brand of depravity that the marbles are pandering--here is something divine is unfamiliar with, a corruption devised by her newfound rivals, and she despises it. furthermore, while kidnapping does not seem like something divine would think twice about, she is indignant that the girls are being held down there and happily sets them free, relishing the revenge that they take on channing.at the other end of the filth spectrum, waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the "real" world. the first time we see connie, she is belittling a minor character named sandy sandstone, who has never heard of divine. cookie, on the other hand, reacts with a hilariously matter-of-fact evaluation of divine's title as the "filthiest person alive", revealing that she inhabits this world of unspoken and understood lunacy as well.something also must be said for the way the players are in touch with their respective roles, especially divine, who doesn't miss a note. not once does he falter in the ridiculous garb and character he's been given, and it takes "pink flamingos" to a new level or weirdness. people actually believed divine was like this in real life, and it's easy to understand why, because while watching the movie, you're not really thinking about the movie, you're thinking about these people who made it. since they're really doing the outrageous things in the script, you start to think that maybe this is not a story but a bizarre documentary.but even more so, "pink flamingos" is not so much a movie as it is an event, or something that happens to you. even though its shock value is mostly gone for me now (i say mostly because the a**hole scene and the chicken scene still make me wince), i still find this film to be hilarious and habit-forming.

a very strange, disturbing but intriguing film. i don't think i ever needed to see what a human being can do with his butt, and i doubt if i'll ever want to see it again. that said, there is much to be amused by, like divine's take on jayne mansfield's classic walk in "the girl can't help it" and putting slabs of meat between her legs in a grocery store. a gritty feel very much like a russ meyer film. generally poor acting, with the notable exception of divine.

my 10/10 rating of course applies only if you're willing to get completely and utterly grossed out*. because you know that only john waters can do that. in "pink flamingos" (his directorial debut), he portrays two families locked in combat to see who can be the filthiest person alive. what divine famously does at the end pretty much answers the question. but even aside from that, the movie is basically an excuse to shock people beyond what anyone would usually imagine. you had better have a very strong stomach to watch this movie. even some of the lines are rather mind-blowing.*otherwise, avoid this movie like you would the ebola virus!

like those who listened to radio reports about the attack on pearl harbor, every one who has ever seen pink flamingos can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw it--and some thirty years later the movie is still one of the most unspeakably vile, obnoxious, repulsive, and hilariously funny films ever put to celluloid, guaranteed to test the strongest stomachs and the toughest funny bones.filmed with a close-to-zero budget and some of the shakiest cinematography around, pink flamingos tells the story of two families that compete for the tabloid title of "the filthiest people alive." just how filthy can they be? plenty: the film includes everything from sex with chickens to what i can only describe as a remarkable display of rectal control to a heaping helping of doggie doo, and i guarantee that you won't want to eat an egg for at least several weeks after seeing it.the cast is either wonderful, atrocious, or atrociously wonderful, depending on how you look at it. the star, of course, is divine... and to describe divine as the biggest drag queen on the planet would the understatement of the year. she is a mammoth creature given to big eye makeup, big orange hair, and big expressions--she is the charleton heston of drag, and whether she is almost running down a jogger, pausing to use the bathroom on some one's front lawn, or startling real-life shoppers by taking a stroll along a baltimore sidewalk she is both unspeakable and unspeakably funny. others in the cast include mary vivian pearce, danny mills, and the ever-appalling edith massey as members of divine's family; and mink stole and david lochary as the white-slaving, baby-selling couple who challenge divine's status.it should be pretty obvious that pink flamingos is not exactly a movie that will appeal to just every one, and viewers who know director john waters only through such later films as hairspray and crybaby will be in for a major jolt. but if you want to see something so completely different that even monty python couldn't imagine it, this is the movie for you. just make sure you eat before you see it, because you probably won't want to eat afterward--and you might want to keep a barf bag handy just in case.gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

"pink flamingos" is a cult classic.the plot of this film revolves around the throwdown challenge to divine's supremacy as the filthiest person alive."pink flamingos" contains some memorably repulsive scenes like a sex scene with a chicken and the scene where divine eats fresh dog feces.yes,the movie is shocking and funny at the same time,but the biggest laughs come from the actors' lines.check out especially this line from divine:"kill everyone now!condone first degree murder!advocate cannibalism!eat s***!filth is my politics!filth is my life!".on the whole,i really enjoyed this film.still its tagline "an exercise in bad taste" should be taken to heart and even those used to the gross out movies today may find this gem hard to stomach.highly recommended.

this is a really amazing story and the most amazing part of it all is that it really happend! in case you haven't noticed: it's based on a true story.(possible spoiler)imagine the shock and horror of discovering that your own father was once a ss officer in ww ii.it's a very intriguing story and i'm really surprised the movie is rated a lousy 5.3 here on imdb.com.my rate: 7

i watched this movie "miniseries" on television back in 1989 and it was an amazing movie. i would love to track down a copy of it just to watch it again and again. it's been 15 years since i watched it and it still sticks out in my mind. from the beginning, it draws you in. the characters and plot line keep holding you. the ending was superb. the feeling and rage that the son displayed when finding out the truth about his father are unforgettable. the suspense on how it will turn out and how he will confront his father is really intense.if you can get a copy of this movie, you will thoroughly enjoy watching it.then, email me and tell me where i can get a copy.

i stumbled upon this movie by chance. i was traveling a few years back and this movie was on some channel on cable at the hotel late one night. not much else on and figured i watch it for about 20 to 30 minutes until i decided to go to bed. needless to say, i stayed up and watched the complete movie. the plot was very interesting and does make you wonder if there had not been ss who did this or at least thought of doing it. i have been looking all over for this movie. i even sent and email to the production company, but the weren't sure that it would ever make it to dvd, but said there was always hope. if anyone finds this movie drop a note here where you found it, as i'd sure like to get a copy some day.

absolutely one of the best aviation movies of all times on so many levels. hardware junkies will drool over the largest single massing of flyable spitfires outside of a battle of britain reenactment. no less than eight flying spits are on hand for very accurate ground and air sequences.those that marvel over the lore of flying and get misty-eyed reciting high flight will identify with the central characters' reverence for the freedom of being fast, free and high in their dark blue world. be warned: romantics and even dog lovers are treated to a very emotional ride in this movie. the core message is one that is shared by many war vets, in that their finest hours, their period of life when they felt most alive, was in fact during the war when everything else is sad and gray.the plot concerns czech pilots who escape from their country when the nazis invade and join the raf free czech squadron. there are a few subplots, all of which are worth careful attention. this is just a plain old excellent movie that even the most ardent anti-hardware romantic will love (keep the kleenex on hand). beautiful photography, first-rate acting, accurate details of raf life during the battle of britain. easily a candidate for any aviation enthusiast's personal dvd collection.

this film is about so many things. most obvious is the hold that film can have over an audience and how capturing life on film can be a kind of magic. there is also the tense relationship between china and the west as many chinese saw (probably rightly so) the "barbarians" as trying to take over and pollute their way of life. liu even seeks to preserve their way of life on film because he sees that it will one day disappear. their is also liu's internal conflict between the loyalties and traditions of china versus the self-determination philosophy of the west. all these themes are woven quite skillfully into a coherent and enjoyable whole by hu. a very enjoyable film.

gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a triviality...and to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as drama....but i feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years. immensely sympathetic performance from jared harriss (who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charisma...hopefully without poor richards penchant for hellraising and haminess)....and charming offbeat cuteness from costar yu xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer. radiant location photography (including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall) and sensitive direction by ann hu give film added impact. in short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to life...and making magic in the dark.

a very sweet movie about a young chinese man enamored of western technology and an englishman trying to make his fortune showing movies in china. it's a very interesting story that is presumably based on true events, although i'm assuming it's more fantasy than real. it's got a fairy tale quality you rarely get in real life, and it's also got 8 people credited for the script, so they must have been making up stuff right and left.this is a very likable movie that conveys how magical film was to people who had never seen it before. it is not an especially deep movie, touching briefly on the loss of tradition and the encroachment of western culture but mainly just being a pleasant little movie. it's actually a movie i enjoyed very much that is already beginning to disappear from my mind 15 minutes after seeing it. light as a soufflé, but i enjoyed every minute.

despite myself, i really kinda like this movie. pauley shore is invariably laugh-out-loud funny, and here is no exception. he is just excellent at playing the weirdo with a heart of gold.his performance in this, although nothing out of the ordinary for him, is so good, it seems to lift other cast members' performances. perhaps this is because he's the kind of guy it's easy to bounce off of.the clichés about country life in this movie are hilarious and the way shore's "city boy", crawl is so at odds with the way of life, is funny too, but it's not only he who's a fish out of water; comedy also comes from the fact, that to any "ordinary" person or people, crawl is a freakish nightmare of a person. that's why this movie works in such a great way: we love crawl, he's a breath of fresh air, but we can also sympathise with the warners. he is one hell of a culture shock.although this movie is classic pauley shore, so there's no great brain power needed to enjoy the movie, enjoy it you do, and there's even a "never judge a book by it's cover" type moral here somewhere. not bad, not bad at all.

i didn't expect much when i decided to watch this movie, so i was surprised to find myself thoroughly enjoying it. a couple of scenes had me laughing almost uncontrollably. the characters were engaging (no pun intended); however, the story is predictable. the fun of it comes from watching crawl (shore's character), a ditzy-yet-wise california dude a country college girl brings home for thanksgiving, trying in his awkward (yet endearing) way to fit in to their lifestyle. i was also surprised that in all this there was a message. if you have a chance, see this movie!

i love it! i love pauly shore. it seems some people don't agree. it's humor, and he's not like everyone else. the movie is great. i love the story line and most of the people in the movie. it's funny from the first time she meets him at school. i like the fact that she chooses him over the guy back home. i like that tiffani theissan isn't a bad girl in the end. all the secrets are let out. only the people you want to see are left in the end. (except for those of you who don't like pauly shore.) even if you don't like him, there are funny parts, and her family tortures him through most of the movie. she's country girl gone wild and needs to be heard. she finally makes it. it's got just the right amount of love and romance. i give it an 8 out of 10.

one of our all time family favorites. when we need a laugh...we just put this one in and laugh all way thru like it is the first time we've seen it. this film has good, clean family humor. pauly shore is brilliant! with no plans for the thanksgiving holiday, crawl (shore) is invited to spend the holiday with a conservative coed, becca. crawl, being a big city boy, must adjust to the farm life if he is to fall in love with becca. but, crawl isn't the only one who is learning new things. crawl teaches becca and her parents how to be more open about their feelings and accepting others. this is fun for viewers of all ages.

along with in the army!, this ranks as one of pauly shore's best movies, if there is such a thing. while the whole west coast-meets- midwest-culture-clash isn't anything new, this film proves to make the story a little more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antics of a then fresh shore. while the change in values probably would have gone in the other direction, the whole concept was rather entertaining. not only was shore's interaction with the family hilarious, it also had carla gugino and tiffani- amber theissen (she'll always have the amber in my book) in two ravishing and early roles. one of those films i have no problem watching when it is on tv.

"miss cast away" is an amusing trifle, which dispenses with serious plot or character development to pack in as many gags as possible. best enjoyed with a large audience that is open to such entertainments and perhaps, has had a few drinks. most of the jokes are current-event based so in future years this film may become a time-capsule of turn-of-the-21st-century pop culture references.the 30i to 24p conversion of the footage does create a jerky appearance in some parts, most noticeably the opening aerial shots.the appearance of micheal jackson is indeed a strange non-sequiter event. but i, for one, find it encouraging that mr. jackson has shown a helpful interest in one of his protégés even after he (the director) has passed from the cute-preteen-boy stage.the effects work is not as bad as one review suggested. most of it was done by a one-man crew in a brief span of time consisting of animator william sutton, whose name seems to have been omitted from the imdb credits. his work is an extraordinary achievement and really helps to fill in the gaps in this movie. i hope he's finally been paid!

i love this movie, one of my all time favorites. ann blythe as sally o'moyne is sweet and trouble-free. she believes that praying to saint anne will solve all her and her friends troubles. the sub-plot of the dastardly bad man to get her father's property is funny and clever. her brothers are what kind of brothers any girl would love to have. also, look for "aunt bee" as her mother, a strong irish woman who won't leave her house that she brought her family up in. they don't make them like this anymore, that's for sure.

sally and saint anne is a very funny movie. the first time my mom told me about it i was 7 and saint anne had just been the saint i had for my communion saint. my mom knew this, so she told me to watch this with her. i did, and have seen it many times since because it is really funny. aunt bea from the andy griffith show was in it and sally's grandfather was the guy who played santa claus in miracle on 34th street. so, there were lots of actors we seen on tv shows too. there is a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house away, and sally keeps trying things with st. anne to help raise money so they can keep the house. that includes a boxing match with hugh o'brian who plays her older brother. this is a good and funny movie that i still love.

shame is rather unique as a war film (or rather quite the anti-war film) in that it not only doesn't focus on the soldiers or politics involved (there is politics but not how you'd think it'd be shown), it deals with its two main subjects as the only two beings that can possibly be cared about at all in this brutal, decaying society they inhabit. ingmar bergman, in the midst of his prime, and following two other heavily psychological films, persona and hour of the wolf, is far more interested in seeing what the effect of war has on usually civilized beings, that it brings out the worst in them, and also in a cathartic way is a reminder of what is truly crucial in living. his two key actors are frequent collaborators and friends max von sydow and liv ullman (as the rosenbergs oddly enough), who are musicians living on a farm on an island (not too dissimilar from 'wolf' when one thinks about it).they see the tanks roll by, and a couple of old friends already getting worn down, but they try not to put it too much to heart; there's a sweet scene where the couple just talk, rather frankly but with heart (all one shot, as is repeated through the film is to perhaps create a sense of being provoked)...then comes the trouble, including a fake film of propaganda made at gunpoint with the rosenbergs, the psychological turmoil in being prisoners of war, and the terror involved with a 'friend' in the military (one of gunnar bjornstrand's most subtle works with bergman). needless to say this is not one of the easier films to go through in terms of bergman's filmography, however for some it may be one of his more accessible works. his religious themes this time is kept very low key, even as the idea of keeping a sort of faith pervades the film's atmosphere. when there is war action it's shot in unconventional, quick ways (via great amigo sven nykvist).and the deconstruction of the relationship between jan and eva is corresponded successfully with the backdrop of a chaotic kind of war-ground where the lines are never too surely drawn. in a way this film, shot right at the height of the worst times in vietnam, is even more relevant for today; i couldn't help but see chilling, uncompromising coincidences between iraq and elsewhere with some of jan and eva's scenes with the fighters, or those 'in charge'. the very last scene, by the way, is one of bergman's very best, all around (acting, directing, lighting). it's not the kind of war picture (or, again, anti-war, i find little of the john wayne spirit in this svensk production) that i would recommend right off the bat to my friends all into saving private ryan- it has a little more in kinship with paths of glory, looking at the effects of the hypocrisy of war. but in reality, like any of bergman's "genre" films, it stands alone, however one that packs a wallop for the art-house crowd.

a gruelling watch, but one of bergman's finest films. interesting to compare this with the hour of the wolf, as both feature the same lead actors as artists (or an artist and his wife) who have taken sanctuary on an island. in the earlier film it's largely inner demons that lead to von sydows disintegrating personality (at least that's how i read it) whereas here it's very much circumstances beyond his control.much has been written about the unsympathetic central characters, particularly von sydow's. for me there are flashes of a good (if flawed) man early in the film, but one who copes badly with adversity. the flaws become all that is left as his humanity is gradually eroded by one horror after another.i watched a passion (ullmann and von sydow on their island again) soon after this, and was amazed to recognise many of the same locations. and then there's a dream sequence...

first of all the story is not so simple as many earlier reviewers tend to emphasize, it is actually a very complex story, unlike bergman's other movies that are more bend towards character study. in skammen we have two main characters but as we are thrown from the start in the middle of a war we have no idea who is fighting and why, everything is open for any resolution. this creates a huge tension and makes every event meaningful. as the story unfolds we are introduced to numerous characters, that are turned into symbols of humanity, both its dark and luminous sides. we have the example of the innocent bystanders who try to get by during an absurd war, the cynical doctor who makes fun of his patients and provides the only bitter humor of the whole movie, the perverse opportunists who try to make the best of an atrocious event (bjornstrand's character), the innocent dead children, the nameless figures almost turned into animals from the boat etc. all of them are somehow seen through the eyes of jan (von sydow) and eva (ulmann), their characters are more restrained then in other begrman films (en passion) and this is exactly because what is important here is the story, the way exterior events have the capacity to radically change human nature.bergman made this film two years after persona where the main conclusion expressed by the only word uttered by liv ulmann's character is ingenting, nothing. that's it: the meaning of art and the meaning of life, the latter being nothing more than a play that includes all plays. but what about war? and especially the annihilating ones of the xx'th century. in persona, the only real emotion suffered by ulmann's character is when she sees a victim of the vietnam war turned into a human torch. in skammen that idea is extended to a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war. in a nameless region of a nameless country (we only assume it's sweeden) two factions speaking the same language fight an absurd war. jan and eva are two dreamers caught in the middle but their dreams are woven in a sort of counterpoint. jan is at first an idealist, unable to react properly to the world and a subject to his wife's will. towards the end he turns into a radically different personality, capable of unmotivated murder, strong-willed, pitiless (watch carefully the suicidal on the boat..the simplicity of the act is harrowing). on the other hand eva progressively looses touch with reality and at the end she is completely suffused in her own unfulfilled dream.from a technical point of view the whole movie delivers its message in a very effective way. bergman places the viewer alongside the character, putting the camera in the car with the actors, or in an extreme close-up behind the actor. nykvist manages an extraordinary control of the camera, there are some masterful "hand-held" effects, very good in making everything seem "real". the shots when the characters are captured by the army look remarkably documentary-like. the screenplay is minimalist but the story is quite complex for that matter. actually the whole movie is paradoxical, it has an intensity in the subject that is in a sharp contrast to the coldness and lack of emotional involvement with which it is directed and filmed. nothing is melodramatic here, there is no compassion, no hope and no apparent redemption. but, as in liv ulmann's dream at the end it is all so beautiful one cannot help but being amazed at it...it was not so awful since it was so beautiful!

i first saw this as a kid (the little rascals first went on tv the year i was born) and fairly recently bought this on dvd. in between, i watched it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes at 1) the pie fight itself and 2) how racist some of these parts were: farina as a nubian slave, doing voodoo, for example. i think roach and mcgowan would have been beaten to death if they'd tried to do that now.notice how the pie fights in the three stooges' halfwits' holiday and in the sweet pie and pie resemble this one...and this film came out a few years before their initial contract with harry cohn at columbia pictures. there was obviously some inspiration from ss and laurel & hardy's the battle of the century for these films...remember, at that time, they all stole from the best, each other!!! one more note: laurel & hardy buffs, that bake sale lady was none other than dorothy coburn, who also appeared in tbotc-the 'flapper' getting into her car and getting it in the rear end. it always escapes me why she was never credited?

"shivering shakespeare" could be considered the first classic of the "our gang" talkie era. by now, hal roach studios began to hit their stride in making talking pictures, and "shakespeare" is the happy result.the gang is appearing in a version of quo vadis produced by kennedy the cop's wife. the kids don't find the play very fun to be in and are distracted by people in the theatre and cannot remember their lines. among the funniest bits are kennedy the cop as the giant, who pulls off his makeup to fight an overzealous man in a bull costume; and the terrible dancing girl (played by director bob mcgowan's daughter.)several filmographies mention that "shakespeare" has the first pie fight in a talkie. this may be true, seeing as they tried different speeds with the film during the fight. buster keaton's brother harry is at the receiving end of one of the pies. very funny and an early gang talkie classic. 9 out of 10.

i swear if i did ever tried cocaine i'd be able to relate to this film perfectly. its pace, as well as the dialog, churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads.there are great little elements that pop up through out the film, like how rob lowe's character seems to always be loosing a shoe, or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path. the story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless.the movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness. this is one i think most could enjoy. a few laugh-out-loud-even-if-you-are-alone moments ensure that i'll certainly be watching this again.

this one is a hilarious diamond in the rough. the acting and plot aren't that impressive, but the lines just keep on coming. this catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like, well, a bad movie, but it's so kooky that you can't help but be amused. the spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going... i was especially fond of sharon, the canuck on shrooms eh? however, the one that really stole the show was richard's little brother andrew (ira heiden), his high pitched whining was somehow endearing. the whole movie rocked.

oh my gosh! this was one of the best sci-fi movies i have ever seen, and quite frankly i can't stand sci-fi films.vin diesel and his co-workers made this movie really enjoyable!!i also must say that vin diesel is by far the most sexiest and most talented male actors i have seen. keep it up vin! your doing great!! as for everyone else good job. i thought the drama and suspense kept the viewers really intrigued. again, great job everyone and i 'm rooting for you vin.sincerely yours, alexandra

this was a great movie and the sequel should know our socks off!!! the action will be nonstop and i just bought the special edition dvd with the animated background story similar to the animatrix. this will put vin diesel back in the spotlight and hopefully get him the coveted role in spider man 3 as venom. he would be the most logical choice for the role. back to pb this movie even though it is a indie thriller, it has a great story and characters with backgrounds that scream for you to want to learn more. if they were to do books or comics it would be a great read. there was one thing that i felt was a little under done. the ending it needed a little work but not every movie will have the best ending.

even though this movie starts off with the usual: something goes wrong, spacecraft crashes, people are stranded etc. it still pulls off and introduces the viewer to some new ideas. riddick is somewhat of a bad-ass convict and has modified his eyes so he is able to see in the dark which is a much sought after ability due to the situation the ship-crew and he gets in. the cutting in the movie is very good and emphasizes the mystique that shrouds around the anti-hero and male protagonist: "riddick." the story in pitch black is, as already mentioned, to some extent very unoriginal and dissatisfied, but the clipping and cutting in the movie blended with some surprising elements which has been added to the story helps it to still support itself very well and one is afterward left behind with a hybrid feeling of satisfaction and hunger for more. vin diesel acts really well in the role as riddick and even though his character is a hardcore, tough survivor he still takes morale decisions almost on the verge of good, but that does not mean his decisions do not turn in his favor at the very end... why destroy an already perfect reputation? all in all this is a very good movie though not perfect. the story seems very unoriginal at the surface, but underneath it shines with enough originality to entertain. some scenes has that wow factor while it as a whole is a bit better than average. it could maybe be described as a cult movie and it is definitely a recommendation for people who wants a spiced up sci-fi story blended with some minor psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist, namely riddick.

people who thought that the chronicles of riddick sucked harder than the black hole that swallowed up event horizon, probably didn't see the movie that spawned vin diesel's skin-headed killer to begin with, and probably have no intention of doing so. too bad, because pitch black actually does kick major ass.directed by genre vet david twohy, (warlock and the excellent but underrated below) and written by siblings jim and ken wheat (lies, silent scream), pitch black begins with an 'alien'-esque prologue. when a combination cargo freighter/passenger ship is badly damaged by a freak meteor shower (in which the captain is also killed), the co-pilot, carolyn fry (silent hill's radha mitchell) has an important decision to make: ditch the cargo or the passengers? close to picking ore over occupants, the crash landing derails her ultimate course of action.no matter, because the catastrophic landing has been made on a foreboding rock that once held a mining colony. amongst the survivors are a couple of settlers, shazza (farscape's claudia black) and zeke (john moore); an imam (keith david) and his young followers (can you say "red shirts" boys and girls?); an antiques dealer named paris ogilvie (lewis fitz-gerald); a 'young boy' named jack (rhianna griffith), and the most controversial members of the group: a marshall named johns (the excellently slimy cole hauser) and his prisoner...a dangerous murderer named riddick (diesel). how the group dynamics shake out make for a lot of the dramatic tension, especially with concerns about riddick and how many people he might slice and dice if he ever gets away. but no one here gets out alive, as the saying goes, and the biggest twists have less to do with how they get along, than how they'll survive when they discover the unthinkable. they are not alone on the planetoid. things that are hungry, taloned and quick are slithering around just where they can't be seen, living in the darkness where they can survive and thrive. they want the flesh of the new arrivals to sate their appetites, but they can't come out into the searing daylight to forage for food.does the phrase "total eclipse" make things a little more interesting? you betcha. hence the more-than-fitting title.vin, more monosyllabic than clint eastwood's dirty harry on his grumpiest day, dripping more testosterone than sweat, has a field day here with a character that really does seem worth a sequel or two, and hauser, oozing menace and bile is every bit as good as his dad wings was at on-screen villainy. surprisingly, though, mitchell holds her own and manages to be strong and sympathetic as fry. you would expect no less than a strong showing from black, she who once was 'aeryn sun', and she doesn't disappoint. (too bad her role wasn't bigger, but that's all i'll say about it.) and david makes his usual indelible impression as the holy man whose faith will truly be tested in the very pit of hell itself.the pace moves faster than riddick slipping up behind his prey with a shank in his teeth, and once the darkness descends, the terror and tension never let up, pretty much as in other classic sci-fi/horror flicks which this imitates. but if imitation truly is the sincerest form of flattery, dave twohy and the wheats deserve major backslaps for getting this one right with a vengeance, and for giving us an ending that is anti-hollywood to the max.i don't want to spoil the surprises, so i won't say much more, except that if you saw chronicles first and weren't too happy, give pitch black a chance anyway. and if you've seen neither, definitely start with this one. i don't know what vin is up to now, but he could certainly do worse than to give these guys a call again. i'd love to see what they would dream up next...

this was a "sleeper" for sure!! much better than i thought! never realizing it was a horror flick.....and who was this gorgeous,baritoned voiced hunk, named vin diesel..adding spice and intrigue to this otherwise unpromoted film ??? the monsters in this film were quite unusual, not the same ol run of the mill gobble-you-up types!!the ending was great, too, for a change, not all "bad guys are bad"!!! i give it 2 thumbs up !!!

pitch black is a surprisingly good movie. i was not a fan of vin diesel before i saw pitch black, but after seeing pitch black my respect for vin diesel has gone up. he did a great job playing riddick a man wanted for many murders. his character is cold and makes many decisions that surprised me, like near the end riddick was going to get on the ship and save his own ass leaving everyone behind to die. i like this movie and how it deals with human instinct. this movie is low budget but this movie goes to show you don't need amazing special effects and lots of money to make a good movie, i think all the characters made this movie. i give this movie 8 out of 10 ;)

this film is a variation of a theme we've all seen over and over again - the posiedan adventure in space. the characters are all stock characters - feisty heroine, judas, coward, etc. etc. the only question really is who's next to snuff it. sometimes this tried and tested formula works - like in this case - but more often not - like the truly mind-numbing "red planet." so why does this one work? because it's stylish. the acting is above average. and above all it isn't predictable. the conclusion isn't sign-posted. i really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end. that alone deserves top marks in my book.it's an intriguing and entertaining movie. and though it was never likely to change the face of cinema as we know it, it doesn't disappoint.

even a bad julie andrews musical is worth watching and this isn't bad! in fact it's quite entertaining. actually it's a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a star's personae.to break julie's "goody two shoes mold" she plays a german spy/english musical hall actress. she subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie s.o.b. and play a drag queen in victor victoria and other not so goody girls usually under hubby blake edward's direction.the movie is admittedly problematic it is hard to feel for her character because she's a german spy. we want to love julie but she's on the wrong side of the law. probably this is why this movie flopped. julie as a german spy? our mary poppins? our maria van trapp suddenly a german spy?the romance seems to happen overnight and come from nowhere. but never mind, it's a musical and it has jullie. oh and did i mention hunky rock hudson is in it too?julie gives a glowing wonderful performance that any musical comedy buff should not miss. great ww 1 songs and nice tunes by mancini.yes the film has plot holes and at times doesn't seem logical. for example, why is julie and her uncle suddenly pursued by the germans when a minute ago she was spying for them. but on another note, who cares? the musical numbers are fun and exciting. the costumes and scenery extraordinarily lavish. the cinematography quite on the mark.it has the annoying idiot detectives that blake edwards puts in all his movies. (yawn)but it has julie- trying desperately to change her image. (you can imagine dinner with blake and julie - julie: "blake we need to change my image." blake: "i will make you a german spy, then we will take your clothes off in another movie and then play a transvestite in a another movie. they won't recognize you. it will be the death of maria von trapp"fascinating study on changing an image. wonderful julie. a must see for musical comedy buffs. much more entertaining than star!

yes!! they finally got it down to perfection. what a great idea, a refreshing exploitation epic for generation-x, whether they know it or not. after disasters like sgt. kabukiman nypd, and getting screwed by blockbuster, our hero, lloyd kaufman just decided to go for it, stop catering to distributors, and let troma be all the troma it can be. lloyd would make this one the most unapologetic, outlandish and downright hilarious troma movie yet. this time, lloyd takes shakespeare's love story, turns it inside out, tromatizes it, and adds that long, lost, entertainment value it was always lacking. entertainment value, such as lemmy kilmister (the narrator), debbie rochon (the cook), joe fleishaker (the fat guy), and of course, brutal mutilations and toilet humor. tromeo and juliet is the definitive edition of a rather lackluster story, and the crown jewel of the troma universe.years ago, in tromaville, n.j. business partners, monty que and cap capulet start a film company called silky films, which would produce supposedly tasteful, soft core films. monty considers cap his friend, but cap is out to screw the poor sucker out of his share of the company. on paper, and in books, it appears that monty gave away his life's work for free. fast forward to mid-90's manhattan, we have two families who are extremely displeased with one another, it's to the point that they're just looking for a reason to take a limb, or preferably, a life. monty has a son, tromeo, nephew, benny, they, with their friend, murray martini, who's just a little too excited about all the carnage, wage war on the incestuous capulets, except monty, he's too drunk to care. like in the original, there is a confusing situation, leading to tromeo falling for cap's daughter, who he has never met, or never even knew about. unfortunately, cap is a sadistic pervert, who, not unlike tromeo's dad, has a thing for the bottle, and this would of course, lead to daddy's little chenshaw melon being physically, and emotionally abused, and molested, and kept in a plexiglas cage, off and on, depending on how foul of a mood cap is in. cap is also forcing his vegetarian daughter to marry london arbuckle, a billionaire butcher, who, would make just about anyone uneasy, with or without the raisin loaf. with all these inconveniences, the young lovers feel that eloping would be the best decision, but how will this effect the big feud? it might, or might not, go a little something like the original, but figuring out how this one ends up is just simply not going to happen, you'll never see it coming."the one with leo" is downright sleep-inducing compared to tromeo & juliet, but if watered-down, over-directed, big-budget, hollywood, garbage is what you've been programmed to go for, then by all means, go for it, but if you're in the mood for something a little more colorful, something that really packs a punch, and doesn't follow the "normal" movie pattern, and if you happen to have a rather abnormal sense of humor, then you just might not hate this movie. tromeo and juliet gives the finger to all that is mainstream. full-blast exploitation with as much mean-spirited humor as anything from a young john waters. along with some badass acting, tromeo and juliet flaunts a thunderous score which includes the legendary motorhead, and not to mention, much input from james gunn, that really brought this one together. for more awesomeness from james gunn, check out lollilove, and for more excellence from lloyd kaufman, check out his next vision, terror firmer. tromeo and juliet is jaw-droppingly priceless exploitation for the 90's brought to us by the one, and only, king of the b-movies. thank's, lloyd. 10/10

this movie is truly unique. it really captures the spirit of the play, but makes it entertaining to the modern generation. the romance between tromeo and juliet was believable, and erotic, not pulled off by many adaptations. it is also so funny i was almost crying with laughter.like with most troma its in your face, taboo subjects, gore and sex, and yet add in some really good acting and a shakespeare plot. you really have to see this movie to believe it!there are some hillarious jokes in the credits (best credits i've seen since hot shots) loads of troma in jokes as well as general satire and shakespeare refs. and lemmy from the house of motorhead narrates. i lent this movie to a friend and had an almost impossible job of getting it back. troma at its best, this film really is a gem, and goes in my top 5 favourite movies of all time. though its not the sort of film you'd watch with your mum, and might offend some people. for anybody bored with run of the mill cinema, with a wacky sense of humour you must see this film.

a very bizarre bringing to the screen of william shakespeare's tragic love story.the que family and the capulet family have a long running hatred of one another which often results in violence. the hatred has something to do with a film company and the fact that everyone is pretty much crazy. in the middle of all of this insanity are tromeo and juliet, literature's most famous "star crossed" lovers that fall for each other at first sight and problems arise when they realize whose family the other belongs to.the film follows the basic plot of the original play remarkably well and key scenes even use the original, or close to original, lines. but the infamous troma bizarreness pervades the film from beginning to end. that makes for a movie that is definitely not for all tastes, but it is nonetheless pretty inventive. tyrone (tybalt in shakespeare) has a particularly funny death scene. 7/10many differently edited and rated versions exist. each contains violence, profanity, drug use, and sex, all with a big dose of bizarreness.

what often gets overlooked in agatha christie's stories is her progressive, anti-conservative attitude on a number of issues - from the role of women to the effects of tradition to people's belief in the supernatural. in "nemesis", you can spot a lot of those subtexts - but you can also find a good old-fashioned intriguing mystery that keeps you in the dark for most of its length. also lifting "nemesis" above other series entries ("they do it with mirrors", "4:50 from paddington", etc.), is the fact that in the crucial moments before and after the revelation of the killer you can actually feel the suspense. and finally, jane booker is welcome to guard my body any time. (***)

if you like subtle psychological dramas/thrillers this is a movie for you. those who want to see an ordinary sex'n'crime erotic thriller surely will not understand this movie, as colin firth obviously did when he called it "rubbish". but jennifer rubin is the real star of the movie anyway. she is such a brilliant and beautiful actress! along with the twisting and turning storyline, that gets more and more psychological and makes you think about yourself, the wonderful directing, photography and especially the music make this movie a masterpiece. also the small parts are very good, especially belinda waymouth is terrific in her small scene. i hope it gets released on dvd soon, and a soundtrack album would be a dream coming true!!

this mystery/psychological-thriller is i think one of the best i've ever seen. all the actors give a wonderful performance, especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star. you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself. the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the "acting coach" are fascinating. also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard. you won't forget this movie!

after reading the terrible reviews of this movie, including comments said to be quoted from colin, i almost didn't bother to add this film to my firth film collection, however being the firth fan which i am, intrigue got the better of me!to my surprise i thoroughly enjoyed the movie. it had suspense,drama and intrigue and v.sexy colin scene's. the plot kept me guessing right until the end credits and i felt that once one got past jennifer rubens opening scene's that the actress played her role convincingly. colin was as brilliant as ever and its great to see him play a character from the 'dark side', a 'chill went down my spine' and after watching this i can't wait to see colins recent film 'trauma'soon to be out on dvd. ok, perhaps it 'wasn't a film that was 'in your face' so to speak and one couldn't 'go to sleep on the plot',especially towards the end as there was a lot going on, but that was what i liked about it, the acting was subtle, thankfully not overdone (like many suspense thrillers), this made the film all the more chilling to watch. one just couldn't second guess what colins character (ross talbert), or for that matter jennifer rubens character(jamie harris) was going to do next, and there were quite a few surprises in store, i sat on the edge of my seat throughout, with a cushion handy!!personally i am very glad that i watched 'playmaker' and i shall certainly rewind and view again. i think that any firth fan would benefit from watching this film, if they didn't like the plot then just watch colin ;-))

wow, i loved this movie, this film was filled with plot twists, good acting, great story, and a surprising ending. to be completely honest this movie wasn't overly gory, it does contain some gore, though, but was more on the psychological side. i read it on the internet: the film cost 3000 dollars and was shoot in 8 days. amazing!!! this is for someone that wants to think and loves great film making. what starts out as a terrorizing thriller slowly transforms into something a bit more twisted, even a bit more sinister. not much i can say without giving away plot points only that this movie went beyond my expectations

the first thing i noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up. a quality movie all round. i suppose you could love this film just for its action, but i liked it for more than that.this is a pure thriller/horror movie. it offers a more fully-fleshed script than most horror films do. i thought, at least the u.s. version, ended brilliantly, and was great throughout. the story felt honest and brutal.the film has an excellent, tight script that keeps the action moving, with believable characters in largely believable situations.

this is a very dark movie, somewhat better than the average asylum film. it was a lot better than i thought it would be, is a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror film. the voice on the telephone is really creepy - this voice without a face, this unknown and threatening voice works really well in the film, since we never see the killer face is left to the imagination of the spectator.the action and suspense never decay and after the first half of the film, it becomes vertiginous; there is not much gore in this film, just enough to serve the story and also the director does a good job at holding your attention. i gave this movie a 8/10 because some clichés.

i was pleasantly surprised to find a very enjoyable film that kept my attention throughout. i am a horror fan and i see almost everything in that genre, but dead line managed to freak me out. the pace is very cleverly set and andrés bagg does a good performance as a desperate man. what is underneath the main plot? a trip to madness. how can you end up like that? martin sanders ask him self while he sees a homeless speaking to him self, alone in the street. close to the end of the film, the character of aaron mandel asks the same question while he sees another homeless doing the same thing; not knowing, yet, that this homeless is martin sanders, answering the question of the beginning of the film. the broken eyeglasses in two are a clear symbol of rupture and division... of personality. the ending is jaw dropping and you just know that a sequel would have to be made.

good movie, all elements of a good movie was there, story, actors, script, and direction. i was on the edge of my seat the whole time.no question about it, is a low budget film, but i liked it more than many big budget films.andres bagg plays martin sanders, who is dealing with his unfaithful wife. then a voice in the telephone and then just fear.virginia lustig is beautiful and brings a powerful performance. she is an excellent part to the film.i liked the increasing ambiguity near the end, even though we know that the main character can be involved, we continued seeing everything from his point of view and asking: who is the killer?

sometimes, when seeking a movie nothing will do except a good thriller. dead line certainly fits the bill. a little warning however: if you are going to watch this film you are better off not knowing too much specifics about the plot. the plot thickens as the film goes by. a really remarkably well built tension mounts. it is deep and horrifying. it goes all the way to the darkest places in human mind.the plot also has some very surprising shifts. just wait till nightfall, turn off the light and watch this film.

i was pleasantly surprised by how good the movie was. whether you're a gore fan or a suspense fan; you'll love this. i used to dislike horror movies, considered them stupid. but, anyway, it happens i make exceptions. i find something really extraordinary in this film. rarely have i ever seen a film that has scared the crap out of me but i tell you the truth this film gave me shivers down my neck. unlike most horror films this one cares about the development of the characters. i highly recommend this film and i'm glad that asylum are finally bringing out good horror movies these days i recommend! enjoy!

it's become extremely difficult to find a good horror movie anymore, thought this movie was a good thriller.could have had better production values but what kept me going was the suspense and the twists. i had real reservations before seeing this movie (because of the cover). i was afraid that it would be excessively bloody and gory. i was wrong.although there is a lot of scary parts, there is a lot of suspense and drama too.the acting in dead line was better than what you would expect from a micro budget horror flick. the characters were believablethe movie is really thrilling and quite scary at moments so it makes you grab your seat until the ending credits rollbecause of its production values (the sound is not very good for example) 8/10.

i absolutely loved this movie! it's my number one favorite. although there were a few flaws (what movie doesn't have flaws?), this movie was very well written, directed, and produced. the characters in this movie are very real and believable. they made all of the characters fit into a specific role. i think that the most apparent thing about "here on earth" was the love triangle as well as the other emotional situations brought into the movie. it's not one of those movies where you just can't seem to relate to anything, because in it are situations that everyone is or has been in. there are so many different things going on in this movie that it is hard not to relate to it. i am just 18 years old and i can even relate to it. it was heart warming and wrenching at the same time. "here on earth" will make you laugh, cry, and sometimes angry. i give this movie an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion!

ok..you people need to settle down! this movie is not that bad. i saw it for the first time last night and fell in love with it! i do have to admit that i have never been a fan of leelee sobieski but she grew on me in this movie. i do think josh hartnett is good looking, but c'mon..chris klein is the most gorgeous man i think i have ever seen!!! he made that movie better for me. c'mon girls..when he has no shirt on and goes to get water i know your mouth dropped. yes, i know in the beginning he is a jerk, but in the end he realizes how he acted and learns to be a great guy. if he wouldn't have come at the end..then i would have been mad. i do think a couple of lines did not need to be said but all in all it was a great movie! i definitely recommend it!

i own this movie. i've seen it over 20 times and every time i still get weepy. its a great love story, surprises, and you can definately feel chemistry between klein and sobiesky. i definately give this movie a perfect 10. i recommend this to anyone.

i just watched this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week. what's the problem here? folks admit that the performances are great--i mean, lange is stellar!--and that the film is good-looking, but it's got less than a '6'! i don't get it. come on! the writing's not that bad!having read a lot of pulitzer-winning novels, and having seen a lot of the films based on them, i think a better-than-decent job was done in bringing the screenplay together. i thought the paring down of all the dialogue in the novel was executed almost perfectly. this story had a pretty hefty amount of dialogue in it, and the story really came through on the screen despite the fact that only a portion of it was used.**book spoiler part** i was, however, a little disappointed in the ginny-tries-to-kill-rose subplot's being omitted. i thought that was one of the more emotionally jarring parts of the book, but it was probably a good bet to leave it out. avid movie-goers, more than avid readers, i think, tend to be less forgiving of protagonists pulling antagonistic stuff. it's apt to confuse johnny lunchpail and joe sixpack.if you loved the book, you will like the movie. if you hated the book, you will likely hate the movie.********rog

okay...so i am gazing through my mom and dad's extensive dvd collection (mostly because they don't charge late fees;-)) and i come upon "a thousand acres." i was stunned that here was a movie that had jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer (with a small appearance by jennifer jason leigh) that i had not seen. i don't think i had ever even heard of it before. well, this is exactly the kind of find that i dream about since i have to admit that my parents raised two movie buffs in my brother and me. with a few exceptions (neither of us can even get them to consider watching the lord of the rings movies, but my dad loves the matrix trilogy -- go figure), we have very similar tastes in movies.it was a particularly awful day today, weather-wise. it poured rain all day, so i popped in this movie and shortly after i was mesmerized.this has to be one of the all-time best "sleepers" i have seen. jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer are great in their roles especially since they are playing very different types. jessica lange's character is a people-pleasing follower who, despite her being the senior child in the family rarely takes a leadership role. rather, she bows to her father (jason robards) and sister rose (pfeiffer) and is hell-bent on teaching her little sister caroline (leigh) how to follow suit. michelle pfeiffer plays a very strong willed cancer survivor who is barely able to keep the anger at her unhappy life contained. this movie is five years prior to white oleander, mind you, so it was definitely inspiring to see her playing such a strong, angry character.i would have to say that this movie will probably appeal more to women. however, true movie buffs who enjoy a film for what it is, regardless of genre or target audience, will have a hard time denying the charm of this touching drama about family secrets and what they do the people involved and those who love them. i don't know how i missed seeing this movie before now, but it sure was a nice distraction on a rainy afternoon. enjoy!!

a touching movie. it is full of emotions and wonderful acting. i could have sat through it a second time.

yes, i am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill! julie andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the "whistling in the dark" production number. the sedate-to-outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that rock hudson has been seeing a dancing/call girl is eye-popping and will certainly make you giggle.i only wish that this film could be found in video or dvd as i would surely purchase it in a heartbeat for my home library!

i watched this movie, having never read the book, and took the characters at face value, but having already been introduced to them, watched it again recently. i got a whole different viewpoint out of the film.without the burden of having to focus intently on each character, learning their quirks and foibles, allowed me to focus on the cultural issues laid out in the film. the farm families of iowa are so intimately inter-related as they are in the area of indiana where i grew up in the 40's and 50's that i immediately recognized the back-stories and motives behind the characters. perhaps, jane smiley did mean for us to see beyond the superficial into the world these people had to live, but viewers are so caught up in the "hollywood" aura of the individual actors that they miss a rich layout of a lifestyle that exists less and less as each decade passes. another film with these characteristics is the "bridges of madison county". try watching both of these films again with an eye to the whole picture.

a jane smiley novel, loosely based on shakespeare's king lear about the cook family and its dark secrets. director moorhouse seems tamed in her approach, allowing the characters to step forward and take a bow. and how could you go wrong with the talents of pfeiffer, lange, leigh, firth, carradine and robards?

this movie is excellent in how it portrays the reality of sexual abuse. the daughters perfectly express their conflicting emotions of affection and betrayal. the on-location scenery is absorbingly authentic, and the soundtrack is unobtrusive yet moving. this film is a graduate-level course in a reality that's too little recognized in american society. personally, i'm freaked out by the names of the characters -- lange's character is ginny cook smith -- my name is connie cook smith, and my mom is genny cook. the youngest daughter is caroline cook, which is my sister's name, and the father is larry cook, my cousin's name.but sex abuse was not in our immediate family.

having watched this film years ago, it never faded from my memory. i always thought this was the finest performance by michelle pfeiffer that i've seen. but, i am astounded by the number of negative reviews that this film has received. after seeing it once more today, i still think it is powerful, moving and couldn't care less if it is "based loosely on king lear".i now realize that this is the greatest performance by jessica lange that i've ever seen - and she has had accolades for much shallower efforts.a thousand acres is complex, human, vibrant and immensely moving, but surely doesn't present either of the primary female leads with any touch of glamour or "sexiness". i don't think this is well received in these times.perhaps one reason for this film's underwhelming response lies in the fact that the writer (jane smiley(, screenplay (laura jones), and director (jocelhyn moorehouse) are all women. i know that, in my younger days, i wouldn't have read a book written by a woman. i didn't focus on this fact until years later.if you haven't seen this movie or gave it a chance in the past, try watching it anew. maybe you are ready for it.

i liked this movie a lot, but the feeling that i most came away with was the memory of how much i´d enjoyed the novel. the film features two of the best actresses working today--jessica lange, who is great here, and the divine jennifer jason leigh, who does the best she can with the thinly-drawn character she is given--as well as a surprisingly excellent michelle pfeiffer and a steady jason robards. the adaptation is basically faithful to the book, at least as faithful as it can be in an hour and forty minutes. the film doesn´t really dazzle, except for certain scenes between lange and pfeiffer, but it does a thoroughly competent job of visualizing this wonderfully tragic story. as far as movies adapted from novels go, this was definitely among the better ones. if nothing else, it has sent me back to my bookshelves to rediscover favorite passages from jane smiley´s excellent novel, and back to king lear to brush up on the minor characters in order to see just how deep the parallels go. worth your time as a film, definitely, and hopefully enough to make you remember that reading great literature is a joy as well.

i was very moved by the gentle power of this movie and by the mood it created. i think it should have gotten a great deal more credit than it did. i agree that michelle pfeiffer should have been nominated, but i think all the performances were outstanding, and that michelle pfeiffer and jessica lange portrayed the deep affinity and conflicts of sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity. although i didn't read the book, i found the modern concept of king lear very cool. i certainly will never look at the play quite the same way again!

i think several others have already commented on this film, but i liked it so well i wanted to just say how good a film this is. i gave it a rating of 9 out of 10. it did not get a 10 because it is very slow starting. i almost quit on it, but am glad i didn't. hang in there, it is well worth the wait.this is primarily a film about relationships: deceit, trust, and betrayal.michelle pfeiffer, jessica lange and jason robards all do bang up jobs in this movie.set in midwest farm country, jason robards character is a farmer whose grandfather first settled there. jason's character is getting older and he decides to set up a trust dividing the thousand acres of farmland among his three adult daughters. that's when the plot of this film really beginning cooking.sisters turn against each other due to misunderstandings rather than greed over the land. they also make some discoveries about each other's childhoods, and their present day marriages, including an adulterous affair, while the father becomes increasingly abusive, demanding and paranoid--until the terrible truth about everyone finally comes boiling out.this film really reached me emotionally, i got angry right along with some of the characters, and sad with them. i could feel their pain due to the excellent performances that were given.the ending was a bit of a surprise to me, but in keeping with the growth of the characters.

at the beginning it was almost a shock to see norma shearer without her makeup. then she glamorizes herself and becomes the life of the party.anyway, she divorces her husband, makes herself over and gets on with her life; or so she thinks. somewhat keeps you guessing if they'll get back together.

norma had spent most of the 20s playing beautiful ingenues but her first talkie cast her as a brassy showgirl in "the trial of mary dugan" and she came through with flying colours. from then on her sweet and lovely ingenues were cast aside and she sizzled in parts that cast her as sophisticated women of the world or society girls out for thrills. "let us be gay" was made before but released after "the divorcée" and was an unusual twist on the upper crust dramas that shearer made her own.norma first appears without make-up as frumpish kitty brown, who's main purpose in life is to pander to her very unappreciative husband bob (rod la rocque). she is hurrying to get him off to his golf game - but in reality he is going to see his mistress. when helen, the mistress, comes to the house for a showdown, kitty faces the situation with civility but behind closed doors she is a mass of emotions and bob leaves for good.three years later mrs. courtland brown (kitty) comes to stay as a house guest of the eccentric mrs. bouccicoult ("bouccy")(marie dressler). kitty is now a knockout and "bouccy" has a job for her. she wants kitty to romance a house guest, who in his turn is romancing her grand-daughter diane (beautiful sally eilers). shock!! horror!! - the man is none other than bob, her ex husband!!! kitty carries off the meeting with sophistication and witty repartee - "there seems to be something strangely familiar about that man"!!! - and no one is the wiser.the film then settles down into one of those early very "talkie", boring "drawing room" comedies. kitty casts a spell over all the men and bob is desperate to start again. the women have all the strong roles in this film - men are just puppets. raymond hackett seems to be in the film as an extra butler - "pass me a cushion", "get me a drink", "move this chair" instead of diane's harassed fiancé. norma shearer is of course the whole show, marie dressler adds "bouccy" to her list of eccentric portrayals and sally eilers is a real eyeful as the gorgeous diane.

the film begins with a dowdy housewife (norma shearer) finding out that her husband (rod la rocque) had been cheating on her. three years pass and apparently they'd been divorced during these years due to the infidelity. oddly, during this time, la rocque did not see shearer or his two kids as shearer took them to paris.marie dressler is a rich society lady and she has invited a new and improved norma to come to her house for the weekend--ostensibly to help marie break up a budding romance between her daughter and la rocque! apparently, norma is now a super-vamp and with her magical sex appeal, she can break up the romance--and no one seems to realize that she and la rocque were married. several others are there for the weekend and immediately norma is a hit with her gay, carefree sexy ways--and almost all the men (including la rocque) are captivated by her. neither tells anyone that they were married but it's obvious that her ex- wants the new and improved norma back! this film is a sophisticated comedy of manners among the upper-crust--similar in some ways to jean renoir's the rules of the game. oddly, despite the severity of the depression, such films about pretty rich folks were pretty popular though many today will doubtless find them a bit too droll in spots. however, fortunately, in let us be gay, there are plenty of cute and funny moments (particularly towards the end when marie dressler shows her true colors). while not a great film, it certainly is a good one and more than just another time-passer. my only real regret is that i didn't love the very end. you'll just have to see it for yourself--perhaps you'll agree about the ending, perhaps you won't, but i'm pretty sure you will enjoy this clever film.

dutiful wife norma shearer (as katherine "kitty" brown) waits on husband rod la rocque (as bob brown) hand and foot. while making him breakfast in bed, and helping him dress for a sunday golf outing, ms. shearer suggests joining mr. la rocque for the day, noting how infrequently the two see each other. but, la rocque puts her off, saying her presence adversely affects his game. then, unexpectedly, shearer meets the real reason for her husband's frequent absences his pretty blonde mistress!three years later, shearer is a glamorous and flirty divorcée. while summering in paris, she has struck up a friendship with wealthy, older socialite marie dressler (as as mrs. "boucci" bouccicault). ms. dressler invites shearer to her long island home, to socialize with some friends, and ask a favor. dressler is worried about her granddaughter's relationship with a suave, worldly man. she wants young sally eilers (as dionne) to marry raymond hackett (as bruce), instead. aware of shearer's flirtatious conquests, dressler asks her to lure the undesirable man away from ms. eilers. shearer is stunned to discover the man is la rocque, her ex-husband.shearer and dressler make this a cute, entertaining play. they are in top form, giving guaranteed-to-be-popular performances, with enthusiasm and professionalism. the story is silly and predictable; yet, in a way which helps the humorous situation. and, the ending is quite clever. in fact, the comic "let us be gay" may have aged better than shearer's larger-produced, and more serious, "the divorcée", which was released around the same time. the cast uniformly fine. la rocque is better than his film with lilian gish; but, his role is not at all endearing. gilbert emery (as towney) and tyrell davis (as wallace) are funny supporting suitors.those not familiar with norma shearer may not realize it is she who appears as the dowdy wife in the opening scenes. this is shearer as "kitty" before her make-over. watch the close-ups of shearer with light, natural make-up, for a good look at an intriguingly beautiful woman.******* let us be gay (1930) robert z. leonard ~ norma shearer, marie dressler, rod la rocque

when a dowdy wife (shearer) loses her husband, she decides to completely make herself over to win him back. not "politically correct" by today's standards, but still fun to watch, especially the scenes with marie dressler and hedda hopper.

a rich old lady calls on a flirtatious divorcée to woo a lothario away from her silly soon-to-be-married granddaughter.let us be gay is an interesting little domestic comedy which features some tart dialogue (courtesy of celebrated screenwriter frances marion) & good performances. while perhaps a bit mawkish at times, this can probably be blamed on the difficulties with early sound technology which tended to limit action & movement.norma shearer can be credited with appearing in this minor film, rather than using her undoubted clout as irving thalberg's spouse to insist upon only a-grade pictures. she is especially effective in her first few scenes, where dowdy flat makeup makes her almost unrecognizable. her extreme transmogrification from goose to swan could only happen in hollywood, but it's scarcely profitable to spend much time worrying about that.rod larocque doesn't come off too well as shearer's adulterous husband. quite popular during silent days, the talkies were not especially kind to him and his career would suffer. here his role is not in the least sympathetic and one has to wonder what masochistic impulse moves women to desire the cad so much.magnificent marie dressler is on hand as an eccentric long island dowager. as a great friend of frances marion, one can easily imagine that the part was written expressly for her. full of cranks & crotchets, she is very humorous. however, the tremendous warmth & essential goodness which would very shortly make her hollywood's biggest star are largely missing.among the supporting cast, hedda hopper scores as a slinky society serpent, as does wilfred noy playing a comic butler. movie mavens will spot little dickie moore as shearer's young son & elderly mary gordon as her housekeeper, both uncredited.

norma shearer dazzles as she is transformed from a frump, addle-brained house-wife to an alluring potential divorcee. most 1930 films have a creaky edge to them -- the camera work is pretty sluggish at times -- but we must forgive these all-talking pleasures for their thump-a-long "qualities". as a guest of the eccentric globe-trotting marie dressler -- shearer mixes with an odd assortment of lovelorn types, including her long-lost husband. the dialogue is fun, oft-times clever and the performances on cue. shearer and dressler shine the most. shearer even shows off her piano expertise in a musical brevity. her strange, yet appealing posturing and "affair with the camera" are evident throughout -- and she hits every emotional note, genuinely and on target. for its time . . .a good show.

the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved. i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. i love all six of the stooges (curly, shemp, moe, larry, joe, and curly joe)! all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team! one of the most hilarious three stooges shorts is men in black. in this short are bud jamison, jeanie roberts, phyllis crane, dell henderson, 'little billy' rhodes, billy gilbert, and ruth hiatt the acting by these actors are good especially by jamison and roberts. there are many funny scenes here that i think most three stooges fans will love! in my opinion this one of the most different three stooges shorts. i recommend this one to all!

i found this one to be more chaotic than the average stooges short (as strange as that may sound). there were several funny bits, especially the running gags ("calling dr. howard, dr. fine, dr. howard!", the glass door breaking, the stooges running into the supply room and coming back out with... well, you know), but also quite of bit of it was taken up with things that just didn't make any sense to me. i have to assume that these were generally take-offs of scenes from the film "men in white", but since i don't know much about that movie i can't say for sure. maybe if someone could explain these i'd appreciate this short more.

everyone's favorite trio of bumbling imbeciles run amok in a hospital in this incredibly raucous and often hysterically funny romp. these guys are without a doubt the single most incompetent bunch of doctors to ever fumble their way across the screen. comic highlights include the stooges constantly breaking a glass pane in a door, their encounter with a deranged patient who claims that rats used to come out of the buttonhole of his shirt, the stooges riding through the hallways on a giant bicycle, a huge horse, and miniature race cars, and our sublimely stupid threesome accidentally leaving instruments inside a hapless patient's abdomen after they finish operating on the poor fellow. director ray mccarey relates the frantic comic shenanigans at an appropriately nonstop hectic pace and stages the broad slapstick gags with considerable gusto. moe howard, larry fine, and curly howard are all in peak loopy form, with sterling support from dell henderson as long-suffering hospital supervisor dr. graves, squeaky-voiced jeanie roberts as a hiccuping nurse (the scene where the stooges do an absurd impromptu group singalong with this gal is absolutely sidesplitting!), ruth hiatt as a whispering nurse, billy gilbert as the ranting crazy patient, and "little billy" rhodes as a feisty tiny patient. the spirited lunacy never lets up for a minute, thereby making this beautifully berserk baby one of the stooges' best-ever outings.

this is an early one from the boys, but some people may not be satisfied with this one like all the others. i found it to be different somehow than the your average stooge slapstick. it was more funny for it's jokes rather than the poke in the eye or slap. watch for a hilarious part when larry grabs the stethoscope from moe and sings into it. moe gives him a good smack. that part made me crack up for a good ten minutes. another hit for the stooges.

this is one of the stooges best shorts. it was the only one of their shorts to be nominated for an oscar. in this short the stooges play doctors, who cause some trouble as usual. this short has non-stop sight-gags, puns, and jokes. the part at the end, where the stooges are breaking apart the machine. this is definitely a classic. i would highly recommend this three stooges short.

though not a huge fan, i am a three stooges purist. i believe that their best work, by far, was with curly as the third stooge and their earliest films are generally their best. that's because after a while, they began remaking their films and the gags started to get stale. here, in 1934, they were still rather fresh (in more ways than one) and funny.here they boys play very improbably roles--respected doctors in a hospital! the three run amok acting silly, hitting each other and scaring the pants off anyone who expects to get better. the non-stop energy and freshness make this one a must-see for fans.by the way, although i liked this film, i strongly recommend you try to find a much lesser known short from tiny educational pictures. nifty nurses is much like men in black but manages to be funnier and is about the best hospital comedy of the era--better even than laurel & hardy's county hospital.

this is the third three stooges short that the team ever made, and like a lot of their early ones, this is absolutely and totally hysterical! now owning it on dvd as part of the three stooges collection vol. 1, whenever i feel like it, i watch this! in this short film, moe, larry, and curly play these three doctors in a hospital who are trying to help out everyone, but boy, they end up making a mess out of everything!this short is another one of my all time favorite three stooges shorts, i also am a very huge fan of slapstick comedy, and the three stooges are the kings of slapstick! when i heard that it got nominated for the academy award for best short film, i really became curious about this, when i heard that it had lost, i was very disappointed about it! this short is one of the three stooges funniest by far, i extremely recommend that you see this hysterical riot! 10/10

directed by the younger brother of great director leo mccarey this is a pretty good short from the three stooges, nominated for an academy award. here the stooges are doctors named doctor howard, doctor fine and doctor howard. they are not the brightest doctors but they get the benefit of the doubt as long as they handle for duty and humanity.i liked this short. it is not one of their best but some moments are hilarious though. one joke that is repeated more than once works every time. the part where they must operate the hospital's boss is terrific. to say more would spoil some of the jokes, so you must see it for yourself. just another fine short from the three stooges.

this is one particular stooge short that actually uses satire in conjunction with slapstick, a rarity. as mentioned, the title and concept for this short was "borrowed" from a feature film from the same year with clark gable called "men in white". it's basically about the trials and tribulations of interns and their sacred cause for "duty and humanity". i saw this recently and almost treated it like the stooge version because it does take itself a little too seriously. in any case, "men in black" is so well written, directed and not to mention original, it didn't borrow a thing from chaplin or any of the others, that the motion picture academy nominated it for an award as the best short comedy of 1934. some stinky short called "la cucaracha" outdid it though and stole the award. some producer's brother in law must have been on the academy's voting board. "men in black" pokes fun at the whole concept of the medical profession much in the same way that the marx bros. always did at this time. may not be a fair comparison but i can see the marx bros. in this short. in fact in their feature "a day at the races", there is a scene where there's "medical things" going on and they cause anarchy as usual. my guess that this particular short was judged along those lines and hence why it was nominated in the first place. try this in fact: watch this short first and then watch "duck soup" or "day at the races" with the marxes and then see if there isn't the same great quality of comedy.

the columbia pictures short subject unit never had any delusions about producing any 'art' films. they wanted to give the film exhibitors just a little more for their money, when booking a columbia picture into their theatres. this would go double for the 3 stooges films.men in black (1934) came about as close as any of their comedy shorts in that it received an oscar nomination for best short subject, comedy. though it did not win, it well could have. it was good enough and even those who do not number themselves among stooge-files, still seem to be won over by the clarion cry of ".......calling dr. howard, dr. fine, dr. howard!" this was the second entry in the long series of comedy shorts made by the stooges for producer jules white, head of columbia's short subjects department. only woman haters, described in its credits as a 'musical novelty' preceded it at harry cohen's poverty row sweatshop.the film starts off in the office of dr. graves, the head of the hospital. he is receiving new interns and in addressing the group, he relates that three of them are passed along from medical conditionally as they had remained there so long. but, the good doctor states that he will not reveal their identities as long as they pledge their all "......for duty and humanity!" the stooges run up front pledging "...for duty and humanity!", and run out of office, breaking window glass in door. the game was on.the stooges took off and did not stop for the remainder of the 2 reels. every type of gag was in evidence. from broad sennett-like sight gags, to puns, to dialect humor, to 'theatre of the absurd' and a surrealistic running gag involving a public address system, which seemingly takes on a life of its own and having the true culprit, a radio tube get shot to a "........he got me!" (it all plays out quite well, honest!) the sets used were very authentic looking and were no doubt borrowed from columbia features being made around the same time. there are plenty of wheel chairs, surgical cotts, stethascopes, surcical scalpels, etc., in evidence to maintain the illusion of a hospital.a true strength of men in black is the high number of usually nameless players, whom we all recognize by face. along with them, the film boasts of a great number of veteran comedy actors, who always turn in fine performances, often stealing the scene. the people with names like billy gilbert, hank mann and bud jamison shine in even small parts.and lastly we have the maestro, the conductor-director raymond mccarey, kid brother to leo mccarey who showed off his abilities in getting this little film 'in the can'. he skillfully kept it all moving, acting as a traffic cop at times, what with all the actors, extras and behind the scenes crew moving and outside of each other's way. and that doesn't count the giant 3 man tandem bicycle, the sway backed horse and miniature race cars, not to mention the 'giant, green canaries!'

this belongs in their top tier, although there were others, such as micro-phonies and punch drunks, that were more deserving of oscar nominations than this one. but if nothing else, the recurring loudspeaker announcement, "dr. howard, dr. fine, dr. howard," followed by curly's "woo woo woo woo," makes this a classic on two levels. first, it symbolizes all that the stooges represent; my daughter loves to repeat the announcement when she is in the middle of doing something silly. second, the absurdity of these three as physicians in a hospital; i imagine the terror i would feel if i were a real patient in a real hospital and heard this announcement over the loudspeaker. throughout this short, you hear that announcement and you know that something horrible is about to happen, and the loudspeaker voice stays with you for months afterward.

this film is brilliant it has cute little dolphins in it and its a great storyline and it has elijah wood in it which makes it a great film too. his acting skills are very good and if you want a good soft family film. this is the one to watch.

universal studios version of "flipper" (1996) is a great heartwarming film for the entire family with good values and sentimentality. it is the story of sandy ricks, a teenager from chicago who reluctantly spends his vacation with his uncle porter ricks in the bahamas. this ultimately changes the teenagers life and he grows up in the process. he learns to appreciate nature and to have a respect for the environment. i grew up in the 1960's and the nbc television show "flipper" was my favorite childhood show. elijah wood is perfectly cast as a 1990's sandy ricks and gives an excellent performance. as much as i liked the nbc television show and mgm theatrical feature films with luke halpin as sandy in the 1960's i liked this feature the best! i feel elijah wood is the best sandy ricks. with respect to luke halpin i feel elijah wood has more of a range of acting talent and emotes more as an actor which makes his performance excellent and more believable. i think elijah wood is the best young actor working today in films. director alan shapiro also wrote the screenplay and has done an excellent job as both writer and director of this film. paul hogan gives a comical and likable performance as sandy's uncle porter ricks. mr. hogan's performance perfectly offsets elijah's role as sandy. i am a big fan of underwater films. this film was beautifully shot in the bahamas like "thunderball" (1965 ua) was. the director of photography was bill butler a.s.c. who lensed the film "jaws" in 1975. mr. butler is a very talented cinematographer. the underwater director of photography was pete romano. he did a superb job with the underwater cinematography. i enjoyed the film score by joel mcneely. this good film score featured crosby, stills and nash among other talented artists. this motion picture was shot in panavision like "thunderball" in the aspect ratio of 2.35:1 if possible try to see this film in a scope version as originally framed and visioned by alan shapiro and bill butler. another very nice thing is that mr. shapiro gave the "original" sandy ricks (luke halpin) a small part in this remake. he portrayed bounty fisherman #3 in this film. this was a very kind gesture on mr. shapiro's part! as you can tell i am a real true fan of this film. sadly this beautiful film was met with harsh words by the majority of movie critics. i originally saw this movie on my birthday, may 31st of 1996 in a movie theater. it meant a lot to me. i have it on numerous video versions. the vhs versions are in "pan and scan". the laserdisc version is "letterboxed" 2.35:1! i even have a vcd in 2.35:1 from hong kong which is "letterboxed". but my most prized possession is an "original" 16mm theatrical feature print which i will treasure for the rest of my life! thank you mr. shapiro, elijah wood, paul hogan and everyone involved for making this a memorable movie for me to enjoy!p.s. i must add that the quality of the universal dvd is superb! it is the best dvd as far as quality i have ever seen. the color and resolution is spectacular. the soundtrack is great. i think universal must have used the same transfer for the dvd that they did for the laserdisc version. the 35mm scope print is "mint" and alan's film really has a wonderful look to it. a great tribute to a wonderful film! the dvd's resolution is even superior to the laserdisc quality! it's just spectacular! thank you universal home video for the great quality control and transfer. many thank's for doing a superb job on this wonderful family film. also many thank's to you alan for all your extreme kindness to me!!! it's a real honor to know you!!! (review revised/updated june 27, 2005)

yes, it's "flipper". but writer/director alan shapiro has put together a gem of a version. spectacular above and underwater photography from "jaws" veteran bill butler and haunting music by joel mcneely and crosby, stills & nash make this truly memorable family entertainment. shapiro, whose last film was improbably "the crush", shows himself once again to be an extremely talented -- and versatile -- filmmaker. rent it!

definitely not only for urban legend aficionados, campfire tales is an often scary and always fun ride through several popular stories. it is also a film that exceeded the (low) expectations i had. a horror film i had never heard or read about, a straight-to-video release (granted, the latter often presents us with a pleasant surprise, but with horror films nowadays it can be all or nothing), a cast of mostly unknowns... well, i'll leave the math to you.the film proves to be an entertaining, suspenseful and overall very enjoyable experience. the four stories are well-paced and satisfying. the only one i felt was a little weaker was "the locket", for the simple reason that it offers almost no explanation for its plot or the characters' actions; however, i still loved the tale, its atmosphere and ending. my favorite one was the third story, "people can lick too" - the suspense in it is not only palpable, but also educational.i found campfire tales to be one of those horror gems one discovers by chance, and then goes on recommending it to everyone.7/10

i saw this movie late at night on a free-to-air channel, and i must say, i was pleasantly surprised. being a horror movie fan, i often watch these sort of midnight movies during the school holidays. more often than not, the horror movies shown during this time are usually big lamers. 'campfire tales' certainly does not fit into that category.campfire tales is basically an anthology of short stories based loosely on well-known urban legends. they are pieced together with a setting involving teenagers telling these stories around a campfire. this campfire setting has a mysterious plot in itself. however, this particular story is weak and confusing, obviously used predominantly to set up the other spooky tales.there are three tales in this movie (four if you count 'the hook' at the beginning), all of which are truly spooky and well-made. i especially enjoyed the third tale ('the locket') involving a guy whose motorbike breaks down in front of a mysterious household. this particular story works well in really freaking you out with sudden flashbacks of the house's history. in addition to this, the ending of the tale will completely shock you! the first tale ('the honeymoon') was also very creepy, though the second tale ('people can lick too') was somewhat lacking.being a horror movie veteran, i don't usually get freaked out. this film certainly did that job well! what i particularly liked about this movie is the fact that it's split up into three shorts. this means the movie won't plod through an hour or so of character development and setting establishment before the real bloodshed begins. that makes 'campfire tales' perfect for sleepovers, parties, etc.campfire tales is a creepy, crisp horror movie that will make your heart stop more than once. it's certainly better than the crap you'll often find in the cinemas these days (blair witch 2, urban legends: final cut...bleah!). find a copy and watch it...if you dare!

i originally posted the first user comment on this movie,and claimed it was crap and it didnt make sense.i didnt make sense. campfire tales is a thoroughly enjoying film (now that im 2 years older and watched it last night).the actors were famous but not too famous. the acting itself was more than acceptable,it was rather good.i will rate the movie per segment of films.1)the black and white scene (a.k.a-"the hook") this one was rather pointless,it looked good,but didnt hold much grip at all,the only disappointing one,i dont think it was even included as a segment.here is the scare-o-meter.------(poor)2)the r.v story (honeymooners stuck in woods) possibly the most entertaining of all tales,the acting was good in this one too,dissapointing bout the typical caravan sex scenes.yet it was intruiging,you think "who was knocking on that door".it had suspense,and not too gory.liked this one--------------------------(very good)3)internet chat tale (little girl meets psycho) this was a smart addition,gore left at a minimal,frights left at extreme.although dull at times,the last few minutes were most entertaining,dont get me wrong it was still fun to watch.real creepy,and could happen to anybody,so watch who youre talking to.---------------------------(very good)4)ghost tale (man kisses ghost)?? not the best,it wasnt too atmospheric for a ghost tale.this one was strange,the aspects were rather good,playing music and the screaming,but everything was too real to be ghastly,although it was good,it was quiet bloody,and could have been better with that idea.-------------(acceptable)5)the ending (the 4 lost teenagers) these are the 2 attractive gals and guys telling the tales through-out the film.the best thing about the film is definantley the ending,it set a great impression,the ending was totally un-expected.watch it,it was so well done,the realism was spectacular.-----------------------------------(top notch)6)the film overall campfire tales was more than i used to take it for,i actually like it so much now im buying it on video,cause its a truly entertaining horror movie forget the trash you see these days,like many,im dissapointed that this didnt really go nowhere,it was straight to video,to me it was better than all the hype "horror" you see these days. overall for campfire tales----------------------------- (very good)8 out of 10

i would like to say that i absolutely loved campfire tales! to me, it was one of the original horror flicks with a twisted ending. as if the contents of the movie weren't scary or weird enough, you have the ending. it's a very awesome movie and i'm so happy that it's being released on dvd on august 30th.i will not hesitate to get my copy on that day.i don't think the movie received all the credit or recognition it should have, because all these other movies came out shortly after and was acknowledge, but if it weren't for my brother telling me about the movie, i wouldn't have known. which stinks because in my opinion it's far better than any "scream", "i know what you did last summer", or any other horror for that time. so i hope that you are able to see the movie yourself and at least be able to see the difference. i loved it, and being a horror movie junkie, campfire tales was like dessert for me!

while driving in a dangerous zigzag manner on a lonely road in the night, the teenager cliff (jay r. ferguson) has a car accident with his friends lauren (christine taylor), alex (kim murphy) and eric (christopher masterson). while spending the cold night stranded in the woods around a campfire, they kill time telling ghost stories. in "the honeymoon", the couple rick (ron livingston) and valerie (jennifer macdonald) travels in their rv to las vegas in their honeymoon. rick takes a shortcut to visit the clayton caverns in the night, but the stranger cole (hawthorne james) advises them to leave the spot since dangerous creatures attack people in the full moon. in "people can lick too", on the eve of her twelfth birthday, amanda (alex mckenna) tells her internet friend jessica that she is alone at home. however, jessica is actually a psychopath. in "the locket", the biker scott (glenn quinn) is crossing the country on his motorcycle. when he has a problem with his bike, he finds an isolated house where the gorgeous dumb heather wallace (jacinda barrett) lives with her father. when the man returns from his herd, scott finds the truth about heather."campfire tales" presents three good horror tales, with monsters, psychopaths and ghosts and a surprising twist in the end. the weakest segment is "the hook", with eddie and jenny, but the other stories a great. the plot point is totally unexpected and gives a great conclusion to this above average horror movie. my vote is seven.title (brazul): "contos da meia-noite" ("midnight tales")

darling lili is fantastic! its by far one my favorite films! it certainly didn't deserve the poor reviews it received. julie andrews, playing the title role of lili smith (schmidt) is the best part of the whole movie. she is entrancing and spectacular! as julie andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far, i was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is. this movie is just...great (i'm running out of adjectives!), it's magnificent, marvellous, amazing, funny, terribly romantic, sad, and just an all-out thrill and its all thanks to dame julie andrews!and to her husband, director blake edwards. oh, yeah rock hudson was ok, too :)julie andrews is the beautiful and well-loved singer, lili smith. rock hudson portrays major larabee, who quickly falls for lili, and she with him. but their affair was not coincedental. there meeting was planned by the german government (i'm not sure if that's exactly what you'd call them, but you get the point), because the warm, happy, singing entertainer lili is actually a german spy. lili is told to seduce major larabee in order to get information of the new top secret opertaion (later know as "crepe suzette"). though lili is on a solemn mission, she falls in love with bill (major larabee), for real, making her original quest challenging. but lili pulls through and completes er task, after she finds out something that is not really true about bill. the ending will remain unsaid by me as it is wonderfully layed out. if anything, you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie, i most certainly did!!!!!!!!

a vehemently cynical, sarcastic and intense film, mocking and imitating the style of pulp fiction and stylized gangster films, thursday is an entertaining, off-putting and hilarious thrill-ride. an amazingly eclectic mix of over-the-top characters and bizarrely entertaining situations, this day-in-the-life of a gunman trying to go straight proves to be a worthy addition to the series of films that attempts to mimic the genius of tarantino's dark-humored masterpiece pulp fiction.nick (aaron eckhardt) stops by casey's (thomas jane) house to catch up on old times. casey was a former gunman for drug dealers who has since reformed, become an architect, married a successful businesswoman (paula marshall), and is now contemplating adopting a child. nick, who still has ties to the gangster underworld, leaves a briefcase full of drugs at casey's house while he borrows his car to run a few errands a.k.a. unfinished business. disgusted and angered by the introduction of drugs into his home, casey flushes them all down the kitchen sink. that's when, one at a time, nick's double-crossed accomplices, rapping rastafarian drug messengers, and crooked cops all come a-knocking for the unsuspecting casey, who is about to have one unbelievable thursday.the film opens with a hilarious sequence in a gas station in which nick is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee. after pondering which size cup to get, a fiasco breaks out with the cashier when he demands a free snackie cake and uses a $50 bill to pay. resulting in comically brilliant bloodshed, the situation goes from bad to worse when a cop intervenes and is caught in the most unusual of circumstances. this opening segment establishes the perfect mood for the rest of the film, which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters that seem self-aware of their own existence in this nonsensical gangster flick.the film is broken into segments based on various events and times during the course of one day. this effect is much like pulp fiction, which is a similarly given chapters, although thursday doesn't mess with chronological order except for the occasional flashback. also like tarantino, music magnificently introduces each scene and each character. oddly humorous creatures, such as the jamaican hit-man pizza delivery guy that raps over the phone and shares his hashish, and paulina porizkova's narcissistic dallas, who attempts to rape casey, add humor to each event regardless of how horrifying and unnerving some of the coincidences are. when mickey rourke's calmly spine-chilling crooked cop kasarov is introduced, the careful staging and intricate setup is fully assembled, and casey's sticky situation becomes even more daring and laudable.definitely a wannabe pulp fiction, with plenty of violence, witty dialogue and extremely creepy antagonists, thursday does some things right, but other attempts at homage may be going just far enough as to suggest rip-off. a flashback sequence that shows casey shooting up baddies and sporting a hairstyle that exactly matches john travolta's do in pulp fiction is easily one step too far.- mike massie, www.moviepulse.net

one good thing: this hidden treasure of a crime drama is incredibly entertaining from beginning to end. an example of low-budget film making at it's best, writer/director skip woods uses seemingly everything he could find (ex: lamborghini, super model, cow phone) and an ear for dialogue to add levels of satire to the plot and all of his camera set-ups.another good thing: this movie seems to be made for the dvd era, with several segments that comprise a larger story (similar to the work of tarantino and robert rodriguez's desperado). each "chapter" of the film features thomas jane's main character spending one day at home encountering quick and memorable performances by aaron eckhart, glen plummer, mickey rourke, michael jeter, james legros, and an unforgettable role by paulina porizkova.even another good thing: not exactly a "good" thing, but incredibly shocking and memorable... every person who sees this movie remembers one important scene. much as deliverance will always be remembered for it's awful rape of ned beatty, thursday will go down as the movie where a woman forcibly rapes an unwilling man. unforgettable.one bad thing: the title makes people think it is somehow related to (or derivative of) the "friday" series of films featuring ice cube.grade: a+

it resembles so much to movies like pulp fiction or reservoir dogs that is impossible to think that tarantino's films weren't a source of inspiration to this thursday. however for a low cost b-series movie it's not bad. the plot about gangsters is captivating and funny and it also has a bit of dark humor and sarcasm we can find in pulp fiction. the resources weren't many fore sure but the film is well produced. the acting also is good. i enjoyed the scene when the girl was sat on the sofa teasing the doctor... it was hot and funny at the same time! the soundtrack is nice too. i didn't hear too many songs but the ones i heard i liked. i score it 7/10.

the movie is a riot - hilariously funny yet graphically violent. just when you think you can't take any more it gives you more. great thiller. the cast is excellent and the plot is very convincing. the past does indeed catch up with our hero, but right(?) prevails.

when i watched this movie i had no idea what it was about, and i had never heard of it before. but i must say i was positively surprised. the first few minutes are almost the most funny of the whole movie. the store clerk from india is just too funny! anyways, the story isn´t really too much to talk about, but i think it´s ok. the acting on the other hand is quite good, and still the only actor i recognized was mickey rourke who wasn´t really in the movie until the ending. and the ending is where the turn-off is i think, it´s not bad but i don´t feel like it really ends. i feel like there should have been something more. a final battle in some way. i don´t know. all in all, this was a good movie and i recommend it to anyone into tarantino-type movies with loads of violence and dark, sinister humor! i rate it 7/10.

this film is hard to knock. it follows in the tradition of pulp fiction, yet succeeds further by stamping its own unique style. the cast is awesome, the script is great - and things like the odd (pulp fiction-esque) time-sequencing is done brilliantly. i particularly like how the images provided in flash back vary dramatically depending on who is telling the story at the time. when it is one of the indoctrinated criminals everything is flashy and cool, but when it is the hero's recollection everything is skanky and disgusting.this is an awesome film - and so i am extremely annoyed to find that i cant buy it anywhere!

it is a damn good movie,with some surprising twists,a good cast and a great script. only a couple of stupid bits,like the rasta hit-man scene (this guy's a professional?) but that has been commented on already. the fact i had only heard one guy at work mention it before, and did not have many opinions or reviews to go on, made it even more entertaining. this gets a higher score than maybe some people think it deserves, but i have to factor in the low budget and the good effort from the cast. it sickens me that some movies get made whose budget equals the gdp of a small country,with a hyped up release,good reviews,an oscar winning director and/or actors, and turn out to be so disappointing,with actors sleepwalking through their roles and uninspired directing,with predictable plot lines and a story with holes in it so big,sandra bullock could drive a bomb-loaded bus through it. (examples in my opinion are the terminal,castaway,matrix:revolutions) extra points are awarded for the wardrobe department choosing great clothes for the cast,especially paulina porizcova,who wears a rubber dress in one scene,and a jacket with "c*nt" on the back in large letters in another!a sex scene which shows off her tight ass and a good soundtrack are added bonuses! and please,enough with the tarantino comparisons,this did not remind me of a tarantino flick at all.... and tarantino borrows virtually every idea he has ever had from other movies! even if that is your opinion,are we saying once a certain film or book is written or directed one way,no-one can ever use the same ideas again? get real. this film has it's own style.

'thursday' is a good movie but we recognize too much from other movies in its genre and therefor it lacks originality. if you have seen 'goodfellas', 'reservoir dogs', 'pulp fiction' and a bunch of other movies that were inspired by that last one you have seen almost every part from 'thursday'. there is a scene that involves torturing that has even the same dialogue as in tarantino's 'reservoir dogs'.still, it is a good movie. because not every part is taken from the same movie the complete thing has some new ideas and some nice touches. the opening sequence to begin with, is quite impressive. we meet nick (aaron eckhart), dallas (paulina porizkova) and billy hill (james le gros). they get into a fight with a clerk in a gas station over a cup of coffee and it ends with the death of that clerk and the arrival of a cop. we've already glimpsed at a suitcase with a lot of money in it.then we meet casey (thomas jane) in houston. he is married to christine (paula marshall) but used to be working with nick. she doesn't know a thing. then nick gives him a call and says that he is coming. we learn that he has screwed his friends over and the problems are about to start.what happens exactly is not for me to reveal but we meet some other characters, all interested in the money or the drugs nick also had with him. casey has flushed those down the drain.very funny moments, a lot of blood, a very funny sub-plot involving actor michael jeter and some surprises (although if you really think about it you see them coming) this is a good movie with some very fine performances, nicely directed by skip woods.

ok,so this film is not very well known,and wasn't very well publicised.i discovered this fairly brutal gangster gone good movie by complete accident on one of skys millions of movie channels late on some boring evening,but i'm glad i did!the opening sequence to this film is fantastically comical in a very dark way.this in fact sets what i think is the general tone for the movie.i think a lot of critics and movie fans that have actually seen this film have been a bit unfair to just write it off as a lower budget gangster movie in the reservoir dogs vein.ok,so there are undeniable similarities between thursday and some other crime genre films that it has been compared to,but in all fairness,i think this film takes a much more darkly comic look at this type of film,and the end result is a engrossing,well made,funny,if not totally original film.tom jane is good in this,and deserves the recognition he will now hopefully get thanks to the the punisher.his performance as the bad guy gone good is realistic,funny and just cold enough to make you believe casey really was a bad ass before he reformed.thats another thing that makes this film stand out for me,the characters.in nicks gang you get the strangest trio of criminals ever assembled,a smooth,charismatic but very cold leader(nick),a trigger happy blood loving sexually predatory bitch of a woman(dallas)and a psychotic hill billy with brains with a penchant for torture(billy hill).throw in the most bizarre police detective ever seen on screen,beautifully over played by mickey rourke,and you've got a recipe for...well for thursday really.its at times darkly comic,sometimes brutal,sometimes unoriginal,but always engrossing and worth watching.8/10

this often maligned movie is a must for fans of blake edwards, julie andrews, henry mancini, or hollywood musicals. other writers have commented on the shifts in tone, the confusion of plot, etc., but the film has many things to recommend it. the score is one of henry mancini's best (and he has written many wonderful ones), several songs are sung to perfection by andrews, julie's performance is nuanced and she is decked out in some beautiful clothes, (she is at her absolutely loveliest here), the on-location shots are breath-taking, and there are some funny inspector clouseau-type sight gags to boot. rock hudson basically phoned in his performance, but he is passably good. a real curiosity item in that it was the last major film julie did for about 10 years and, in many ways, is a precursor to victor/victoria. it is lovely to look at and listen to. when will it be available on dvd??? when it is, i for one would like both versions--the longer and shorter, director's cut. since it was lampooned in s.o.b., they would make a great two-pack!

i had borrowed the three sarah movies from a friend, and had watched them while sick in bed during one weekend. i thoroughly enjoyed every one of them. i enjoyed how the last movie gave a glimpse of what caleb and his sister were like when they grew up. in addition, i liked the carry-through of the "billy-boy" song that first was heard during the credits of the first movie, the title "sarah, plain and tall." however, the one thing in winter's end that i didn't like was the youngest daughter. she was a very cute little girl, but she just had too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to the other kids, even compared to talkative but still good-natured caleb when he was younger.

i love sarah plain and tall:winters end. its such a good movie. it tells of the hardships of living on a farm.i live on a farm so i know what its like to have hardships.i love the setting in kansas. its such a beautiful place. my favorite country star is from kansas. i love the country in kansas its just so beautiful. i would love to live in kansas.sarah plain and tall:winters end i think is a love story. i love love stories they are so fun to watch. i like to watch them because it is nice to watch people fall in love. falling in love is not as hard as most people think. i've fallen in love once. sarah plain and tall: winters end is my favorite love story

jack palance,(john witting), was usually a bad guy in most of his films and in this film, he showed his great acting talents above and beyond my expectations. john witting unexpectedly returns to his son's farm after years and years of separation. christopher walken,(jacob), has a hard time trying to accept his father's appearance after he spent the night in the family barn. jacob's son and younger daughter greet their new grandpa and accept him just as he is, a very old man, at the end of his ropes. glenn close,(sarah witting), delves into the character of john witting and starts to bring out the truth about what happened to him during his years of absence from the family. this is a very warm and loving down to earth film about real events that happen in most families for generations to come and go.

sarah plain and tall's winters end was the best movie i have ever seen. the person in the story that i liked best had to be cassie played by emily osment. just because of her energy and how she speaks her mind. for example when anna calls from town cassie wants to answer and she says,"hello? anna guess what. grand father was lost but hes back now and he is not a good man!" i loved all of the sarah plain and tall movies for my rating i think sarah plain and tall was #3. skylark was #2. winters end was #1! if i could live in any family from the past it would have to be the witting family. i think there are so many good parts in this movie i can't name all of them. i think they picked the best and perfect actors to play all these people in the movie so if you ever want to watch a movie from the past i would highly highly highly recommend sarah plain and tall's winters end.

excellent story of lives that need repair....one of those rare films that i could watch with my 7 and 8 year old daughters... glenn close was excellent in the title role. it was also nice to see christopher walken in a more normal role.

what a joy to watch this family grow up and see the same children acting in this series eight years later. anna (lexi randall) is a beautiful young lady, working for a physician in town. she is in love with his son justin, who went away in the army and was injured in war. and the newest daughter of jacob and sarah, cassie, is an outspoken cutie, so transparently honest she often is embarrassing.on a cold winter day a stranger shows up at the farm. he is slow to reveal his identity. when they find out he is jacobs father, john witting, thought long ago dead, hard questions about the past are difficult to get answered.glenn close is magnificent as a loving mother, who wants only the best for all her family, and is constantly wrestling with the forces that tend to separate them. sarah talking to jacob said, "it's all so fragile, this life. anything can happen in the blink of an eye. i could have died in that blizzard. think of justin, and john. probably more ill than we know. time moves on. the moment passes, then it's too late. it's a shame, don't you think?"life lessons on honesty and forgiveness make this a meaningful evenings entertainment.

i suppose i like this film as well as any i know; it is not perfect, but under the title "the americanization of lily" this charming and memorable semi-musical satire might i suggest have been appreciated more, and still loved by those who recognized its special blake edwards'-produced spirit of gentleness, clever humor and solid narrative. the improbably but delightful story-line follows lili smith, a fringe-type spy for the germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; lili schmidt passing as smith is helping her uncle who is patriotic too, for germany but neither cruel nor political, merely opportunistic. lili's target is william larrabee, a charismatic u.s. squadron leader who can supply her valuable information. the plot thickens comes when lili falls in love with larrabee, has her eyes opened to the consequences of her playing spy, and sees the effects of combat on wounded men at a hospital and realizes what it might mean to his men whom she has met and likes. she gets jealous of a rival for larrabee's affections, then realizes she can no longer do what she has been doing and gives up the spy business. the logical end of the film comes when after the terrible wwi has ended, as she sings the theme song of the film, "wishing" in a darkened theater, one by one the members of larrabee's squadron appear, including her lover himself, indicating they have forgiven her and their former opponents; and even uncle kurt enthusiastically joins in the singing of "it's a long to tipperraree", to indicate all is well with the world again. this is an audacious and sometime brilliant story idea, written by director blake edwards and william peter blatty of "john goldfarb" fame; and it is a delightful narrative. larrabee's squadron, including an inebriate who keeps crashing and other lovable types populate this lively film; and the feel of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic, both in its scope and realization. credit must go to jack bear and donald brooks for their costume creations, reg allen and jack stevens for sets, fernando carrere for another beautiful production design, henry mancini for his sensitive and appropriate musical score, and to russell harlan for his shining cinematography. in the beautiful footage, the principal actors are julie andrews as lili, rock hudson as larrabee, keremy kemp outstanding as lili's uncle kurt, michael witney, lance percival as the inebriate pilot, gorgeous gloria paul as lili's stripteasing rival, and many other fine actors in smaller parts. it is hard to say enough nice things about the pace, or the cleverness of the just-this-side-of broad comedy; this element is introduced by edwards to leaven the horrors of actual warfare, to example the almost comic-opera approach with which men made war back in a more innocent-minded era of human civilization.. this comedy also helps prepare the way for lili's conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the german state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing. this is a rare "sense-of-life" film about lili's "americanization", her assertion of herself in the real world and then among others before tragedy can happen. it is haunting, i find, and beautiful in many ways. i consider it to be blake edwards'masterpiece of directing; and under the title "the americanization of lili" i believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film it is by every standard i know.

i guess this is the first movie that made me aware of the term "cult flick". it is totally a bad movie, but i can't help it, i like this movie. richard boone has made better and so has joan van arc, but if you are in to staying up late and watching movies that don't make you think to much this one is for you.

hercules the avenger is by far the best single entry in the muscleman genre i can recall. the charge against it made by critics - it is a cut and paste of two previous hercules films, with some added new material to make it appear fresh - misses the fact that this cut-and-paste approach solves one of the central problems of the sword-and-sandal movies. with most of these films, the middle third sags horribly - usually involving a sappy love story or arcane political intrigue or both (queen falls in love with hercules and her evil brother plots against them, etc.) it's often hard to hold on through this to watch the exciting finale. hercules the avenger cuts all that crap from the source films, and adds a rather brisk narrative of a hercules impersonator bullying his way into power. (it should be noted that this episode also functions as a distant but pointedly critical remark on the rise of fascism in italy.) this also sets up a fine final wrasslin' match between the real hercules and his impersonator.in a narrower focus, i might also add that further editing has improved individual scenes borrowed from the other films. for my money, the mutiny scene here is much better than it first appeared in hercules and the captive women, since it has been tightened with the reduction of several characters and their plot complications.there are also floppy monsters, creepy underworld atmospherics borrowed (literally) from mario bava, an entire city destroyed, and the usual amount of lovely babes in revealing gowns. since no one expects any of these films to compete with the seven samurai - or even with the magnificent seven - it seems a bit picky to hold the film's borrowing from other films against it.

eliza (elizabeth moorman) is a farm girl from the country coming to the city looking for love. she has met a man that has told her of an astrologist who will show her the stars. this is a journey of souls...eliza is put to the test, can she realize her true love when she sees him or not? tommy (tommy lee jones) is a construction worker trying to find himself in his native heritage. they show each other different ways of looking at things. all the while eliza is still looking for love and tommy is trying to protect the reservation that his grandmother lives on. this is a twisted story of looking beyond the obvious and finding beauty in the simple everyday things. the style is artsy and chock full of symbolism. the psychedelic camera styling might scare away the average moviegoer, but the deeper message and the interesting frames make this movie worth watching. it is a movie that explores the underworld of the weird, wretched and devastated individuals. this one strays from the path but certainly worth watching!

i can never fathom why people take time to review movies that they have not understood fully. i know people will read scathing reviews on these pages of this film, and it will keep them from seeking copies of this quite forgotten, late '20s style but 1932 movie, which should probably be referred to as "indecent," as that is the name on the main titles.myrna loy, best known as a comic actress in countless genteel roles, shows herself to be miscast in all of them. she was a true dramatic actress, something that i did not know before watching this film, which predates all of her famous roles. she is exciting and moving here, two things she never was opposite the graceful and refined william powell. i'm still rather in shock over how good she was.becky sharp (1935), the first three-strip technicolor feature, is more familiar but this one is far better artistically and an adaptation. it is also very poignant as an expression of a film style that was about to die. you cannot take my word for it, you must see it.

i love the thackeray novel on which this film is based. and while this modern version of becky sharp's story is a b film, the casting of loy, in her first top-billed role, is rather fascinating.before loy became mgm's reigning good girl in scores of genteel and comic roles, she was an actress. vanity fair was loy's follow-up film to emma, in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal housekeeper (marie dressler).loy's becky is much nastier than miriam hopkins' version 3 years later in becky sharp. loy's becky is very much a pre-code film character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways. it's the type of character that jean harlow or clara bow could easily have played, but becky here is still supposed to be of the genteel set. that's what makes her fallen character so tragic.in counterpoint to loy's grasping becky is the goody goody amelia (barbara kent) who is just not an interesting character. mary forbes is icily good as mrs. sedley. most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah: conway tearle as rawdon; walter byron as osborne; anthony bushell as dobbin. others are nearly dickensian is their quirkiness: billy bevan as joseph; lionel belmore as crawley; montagu love as the marquis; lilyan irene as polly the maid; elspeth dudgeon as the housekeeper.loy is front and center throughout. while the ending is rather shocking, she has several excellent scenes, such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another woman's winning roulette bet. the more loy's becky descends morally, the more beautiful she gets until she is finally "caught." bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by loy in a film that should be seen.

i've never read a good review for "vanity fair" and i can't understand why. for something that was "rushed through in ten days" it all comes off surprisingly well. though admittedly "becky sharp" is a better movie and miriam hopkins a better becky, there's nothing to stop this one from getting a solid 9/10. at times, myrna loy might seem just too cute and nice to be playing an utter bitch, but at other times she just has to squint her eyes and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees. meow! the move to a more modern setting did not work against "vanity fair" and the only thing that really causes some conflict is the casting. barbara kent (amelia) was under 5 feet in height, and few of the leading men were very tall either - this all coming together to make loy look like an absolute amazon woman!"vanity fair" is similar to "craig's wife" in that no matter how bad the main character is, you have to love her. and you know she deserves her comeuppance, and then some, but you still feel sorry for her when she gets it. though based on the same story as "becky sharp", this version had a different ending, which is interesting to see because most of the rest of the films were almost identical. for pleasure value, the ending of "becky sharp" is ultimately more enjoyable, although aesthetically, and from the flow of the story, there is no doubt that the ending of "vanity fair" is the better one, whether or not you actually like it.

this show was incredible, but too esoteric for most people. if you had never truly seen a european variety show in the 70's or 80's (or at least a mexican one) the entire show would probably be lost on you. if you had, this show was a dead on skewering satire of the phony spectacle and shallowness that these shows dive into at their worst. helmed by a chain-smoking suave wannabe with a pencil moustache and his ultra-glamorous and immasculating harridan of an ex-wife, "viva variety" is a variety show that tries to get off the ground every episode but always descends into in-fighting and acts gone very wrong. the hosts are joined by "johnny bluejeans", a dim witted side-kick who seems to have been named because blue jeans are a very popular product in his country and that means the kids will like him, which of course, they don't.the result was a hilarious spoof of variety shows in general. imagine the arguing that probably happened backstage during the last days of the "sonny & cher show". now imagine it's happening onstage in front of you and the stars are trying to keep their composure. now add cheesy acts and a euro-riche mentality (tuxedoes, gowns, booze, accents and smokes). now you have "viva variety".have you ever heard a musician whose music was pretty much written for other musicians? too conceptual? viva variety did this for comedians. way too esoteric for the standard american audience. it was funny as hell. and doomed.

viva variety was a unique hybrid program that was both a parody of and a tribute to the programs it represented. it was most directly a mock up of the classic 1970s favorite, "the sonny & cher show," with thomas lennon and kerri kenney playing a divorced show biz couple who were somehow forced to host this program together, the female of the pair towering over the male, and the constant barrage of "insult humor" the couple tossed at each other, plus sketch comedy bits and performances from what are most kindly described as "specialty" acts! the "hybrid" was the mix of fact and fantasy. of course, there was no "mr. and former mrs. laupin," and the program's announcer, johnny bluejeans, was likewise equally fictional. but all the acts that performed were certainly real, and some were even entertaining! but there were also some acts that would have clearly been better suited for the old chuck barris "gong show." the show itself was really more like an extended sketch from "sctv" (it was borne from the mtv series, "the state," after all), and some would suggest that it would have been better as a five minute bit in the mix of a program like that one, rather than a stand alone series. but "viva variety" certainly should get high marks for original concepts, and even though it was often more odd than funny, it was certainly worthwhile, especially when they road tripped to las vegas and brought in even glitzier acts to perform. it's unlikely we'll ever see anything like this on television again.

otto preminger's "porgy and bess" stands, to date, as a great american musical. i believe it is time bring this film out onto vhs and dvd for countless generations to view, admire, and absorb its wonderful music.

i had the great pleasure of recently viewing this beautifully filmed wide-screen adaption of the the 1943 stage revival (which unlike the original 1935 production) which included extensive spoken recitatives. this had been the fashion at the time, so to blame the film for an 16 year tradition. the film should be seen if only for sammy davis jrs brilliant catlike performance as sportin' life, creeping in and out of shadows. his seduction of dorothy dadridge's bess "there's a boat dat's leavin' soon for new york," is one of many highlights. nearly all of the principal music is intact and beautifully sung. it certainly never bores which the recent pbs and met versions did. it was a pleasure to see that time had not diminished the movie, and hopefully it will be made available in the near future for the generations that haven't had a chance to experience it.

i see it when i was 12 year old and i dream to see it again !what marvelous sammy davis jr singing "it ain't necessarily so !"

i found this movie to be one of the best for this time and era. the cast was very exceptional and most entertaining to all that saw it.i would like for my younger generation to have seen this movie,but i haven't been able to find or see the movie in the past.my first viewing was back in the early sixties and i have been looking for it every since.the movie showed me potential of how far we come go to become a gifted at a craft where we could only have meaningless roles to act as buffoons and servants. porky and bess showed some of the urban life of my neighborhood as i saw it in the time where i needed good solid male role models. the singing and acting had me skipping for days, playing the part of different characters in this excellent movie.

julie andrews plays a german spy who falls in love with an american pilot rock hudson, while on an assignment for germany.the songs are beautiful. the two are well-paired. julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays. a half-german, half-english girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in ww i, julie sings some endearing mancini songs. i loved the film. some will say it's a "chick-flick," but so what. it's wonderful. supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped. it may not be up to rock's performance in pillow talk, magnificent obsession, or giant.blake edwards shot the film in ireland and authentic ww i -type planes were used in the film. scenery for england and france is absolutely gorgeous.

robert mckimson's 'acrobatty bunny' is one of the director's finest shorts. although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of mckimson's dreadful 'big top bunny', 'acrobatty bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty. pitting bugs bunny against a ferocious lion, 'acrobatty bunny' is fresh and funny from the outset, not to mention extremely attractive to look at. there's a classic scene in which bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion. in a brilliant disney parody, he hollers "pinocchio" down the lion's throat! this brilliant opening is a sign of things to come. there are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lion's cage to begin with, followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of 'laugh clown laugh' which, as a child, i used to impersonate regularly! all this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name. i've never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but 'acrobatty bunny' breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst mckimson's best.

this is a classic movie that dramatizes the plight of a man who cannot adjust to changes taking place in society and feels more and more alienated, which leads to violence. joe is a worker, and he is dissatisfied and angry, and all he is needs is a pretext to lash out, which is what the story is about. alone, joe is quiet; together with someone else, he becomes lethal. and what makes the character of joe even more chilling is that he fully rationalizes his violence so that to him it's not only not bad, it's necessary. for joe projects his own violent tendencies onto those who he considers "the enemy" and therefore considers himself to be in a war, and in this movie, the "generation gap" is portrayed as a war. but it is a war in joe's mind only, because "the enemy" in this case is in his imagination. nobody wants to fight joe, but joe feels he must defend himself. although this movie was released in 1970, it's message is as relevant now as it was then as society continues to undergo major changes which lead to the kind of intense alienation that the movie effectively dramatizes.

though i saw this movie about 4 years ago long before i started commenting on imdb, i decided to review it now which is unusual for me since before now i often reviewed something just after seeing it. what can i say? well, the best performance is that of the late peter boyle as the title character who, after finding out about a man's killing the drug-dealing boyfriend of his daughter, wants to bond with him even though he's a madison avenue executive who has nothing in common with the very lower-class conservative joe. in fact, there are plenty of funny scenes of joe at this guy's party making smart alecky remarks there. oh, and it should be noted that the actress that plays the daughter who they're looking for after she disappeared from the hospital after overdosing on some drugs is none other than susan sarandon making her film debut! this was a pretty hard-hitting movie for the time it was made (late '60s-early '70s) and was compelling work from scripter norman wexler (later of saturday night fever) and director john g. avildsen (later to do save the tiger, rocky, and the karate kid). certainly the ending packs a wallop even today after all these years! highly recommended for anyone curious about the counterculture of that time. p.s. among the cultural artifacts seen here are a raggedy ann doll, a box of ritz crackers, a bottle of heinz ketchup, and, unique for the era, a nixon poster asking, "would you buy a used car from this man?"

new yorkers contemporaneous with this film will recall how reflective of its time it is and how well cast and crew captured america, new york city of that era.norman wexler's script delineates the different worlds the various sub groupings live in and avildsen's direction brings out phenomenal performances all around. peter boyle's prodigious talent is on display as never before nor since. clearly it is the best character portrayal the always likable dennis patrick ever accomplished.what i will always remember about joe is the feeling of having been in a virtual state of shock coming out of the theater. knowing that what the screen portrayed was seething under the surface in neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs of the city of new york.this film needs to be remembered.

i recall so many things about seeing this movie back during it's original theatrical release - the post woodstock afterglow of peace and love, along with the pre-watergate tension of fear and paranoia. it's hard to believe that it's thirty seven years later, and i can still remember the thoughts going through my head while watching the film with my best friend. like marveling at peter boyle's characterization of the ultimate redneck, sure to typecast him the rest of his career (oh, how wrong!), and how the counter culture jarred the sensibilities of most of the country. to this day, my buddy and i still use joe curran's line from my summary above when faced with a dilemma; curious how a simple line like that can stay with you for decades.it's curious to read comments about the film from others on this board, particularly the ones stating that the film has a dated quality and how over the top the characters were. still, if you were around during that time, the picture gives a pretty accurate portrayal of the polar opposites that existed back then, pretty much side by side as the events in the story reveal. if you really want dated, when was the last time you heard the words macy's and gimbel's in the same sentence, or a line like joe's - "come on, get with the pepsi generation". for historical perspective, you have that great nixon poster lingering in one of the background scenes - "would you buy a used car from this man?" with minor intricacies like those, director john avildsen captures many of the subtle but ever present hints of how life was four decades ago.today's viewing was only the second time i've seen the movie, and i have to admit i don't remember susan sarandon in one of the lead roles, but then again, this was her very first picture. the scenes of nudity and free love were something actually quite new and bold at the time, shocking in fact, as film makers began to experiment with their ability to push the envelope of propriety and convention. "joe" took a major leap in that regard, particularly since it was a 'mainstream' picture.with the passage of time, the thing that impresses me the most about peter boyle was how he overcame the stereotype of joe curran to appear in or star in some of my very favorite pieces of work. i mean, how do you go from "joe" to that hilarious rendition of 'puttin' on the ritz' in "young frankenstein"? and my absolute favorite episode of 'x-files' has boyle as clyde bruckman, in both a tender and tragic, funny and serious portrayal that turns the tables on scully and mulder more than once. and as a career capper, frank barone has to be one of the funniest characters in the history of television. even repeat episodes in syndication are funny as he-- whenever the elder barone lets loose with one of his observations. he is one actor that this viewer sorely misses already.

unusual film about a man who befriends his social opposite out of fear of blackmail. peter boyle makes this film with his foul mouthed boorish portrayal of a working class stiff "joe" in love with the past and fearful of the future and worried about the present. the first half hour of the show features the film debut of a young susan sarrandon as melissa compton, a weak willed rich girl who slums with her loser boyfriend, replete with a full nude scene. her boyfriend is the film's weak spot, a poorly portrayed drug addict and dealer who meets his demise following sarrandon's overdose. we meet boyle's joe in a bar as he spouts off and rants about minorities, crime, hippies and drugs, and it is easy to see that the later norman lear television character of archie bunker is based on a cleaned up version of joe. the comparison even carries over into joe's wife and personal life and pastimes. joe insinuates himself into the life of bill compton, melissa's father, and the two make an unlikely pair as they search for melissa who has run away from drug treatment and back to the drug addicts she calls friends. their search leads them to an "oar-gee" as joe calls it, a free love fest fueled by drugs a lot of nudity and surprisingly, uptight bill compton and ultra conservative joe both join in. they get robbed and this leads to a violent and murderous ending that foreshadows the stark and chilling ending to taxi driver six years later. joe is a funny film that on the surface at least, is anti violence and anti racist. yet the film's main character, joe, becomes the very instrument of the upheaval he fears when he enters and joins in the illegal and unbridled sexual excesses he rants against. so in that respect, the film falls short of being a powerful message and leaves you wondering what the final outcome really was all about.

after recently seeing, cry uncle, by the same director, i decided to seek this out and am i glad i did!? this is an extraordinarily good film. far, far better than it would seem likely given the ingredients. how many times have we had to suffer the embarrassment of someone playing a middle class dad mixing it with the flower children aagh! and yet here thanks to a perfect script it is made believable. not ideal, not good or bad but believable. peter boyle, as the working class, hippie and ni**er hater and dennis patrick as the uptight suit, play their respective parts immaculately and i can't remember ever seeing the two classes getting together like this without things getting sentimental. susan sarandon is effective as a hippie chick but doesn't have all that much to do in her first film. this is a truly, must see film capturing as it does that very short period in western and in particular us times when the counter culture was about to bust itself wide open.

warning: reading this entry after watching the movie! like 'easy rider' released a year before, 'joe' tries to illustrate what happens when the counterculture and mainstream (albeit right-wing) america meet: a violent end ensues. although this film is for the most part a slow-moving display of traditional "old-fashion" american morals versus the 60's "do-what-feels-good" lifestyle, it is also a commentary on upper-class vs. lower-middle class and their inability to meet in the middle as illustrated when the comptons meet the currans. boyle's joe represents a generation stuck in the 1940s and 50s where 'kill a commie for mommy (or jap or hippie for that matter) is okay so long as it helps and saves america. joe and wife mary jo are clearly the archetypes for archie bunker and dingbat wife, edith. this movie - which will forever be known for it's violent (but not bloody - no blood is seen at all) ending is uneven however. joe blasts (verbally) the hippie generation then (literally) lays down with them to infiltrate their numbers to locate compton's daughter - when clearly he should have been repulsed by the idea but forgoes the separatist idea for the sake of sex. when he is betrayed through thievery (read: trust of the older generation to the newer generation), he lashes out through an unrelenting chain of murder. perhaps it is due to the tarantinos of hollywood that the watcher expects blood-streaming death in the end scene, but the bloodless shootings long for any sort of impact or realism. 'joe' is not a great movie, but it is an interesting display of class and culture alienation and the animalistic underlying extremes to the generation gap.

i only voted excellent because this film took two snapshots of americana: one in 1970, and one for every year afterward. nothing's really changed.joe is actually a jerk, a big stupid slob who's mad at everybody else in the world for his own idiocy. this ain't really a spoiler, but the key to the film is the big, corporate "never does wrong" guy making friends with this semi-troglodyte joe, and he gets some kind of...validation from his bigotry and stupidity and sense of being wronged. yet, few would argue, that the dealer boyfriend did deserve to die. and those kids shouldn't have ripped joe and compton off. and joe and compton were actually getting into the hash and the young skin until they got ripped off. a simple film in many ways, except that in 1970 new york city was par to a battle zone thanks to nixon's care, and all of the money going to the war in vietnam. as i write this (2/25/2007) there is a "very long wait" on netflix for this film - which makes me happy because i think there are people out there who want to learn. this was a pretty good snapshot - not exact, a bit caricaturist - but actually pretty close to how it was back then. and the scary thing is - things haven't changed that much. sure, there's no more welfare, but that just means the wage-slavery has won out. amazing how millionaires will complain about not making enough money, then complain that $5.15 an hour is too much to pay their people.

i finally have seen the real reason why peter boyle became famous. it wasn't being the monster in "young frankenstein" or being cranky frank barone on "everybody loves raymond". for younger people who only know him from tv,give this film a try,it makes frank look like a saint."joe" is boyle in his finest acting role and as someone mentioned,most likely gave the inspiration for "archie bunker" on "all in the family". i think boyle even went back to "joe" a little to play frank. (i say this because i noticed the basement of both "joe" & frank barone look similar.)i knew nothing of this movie when i checked it out of the library,i just knew boyle and susan sarandon were featured. yes,susan does look great here and for a young actress a very good early role. a young hippie wanna be,who escapes her parents home and lives with,the ultimate lost in a drug induced haze hippie,who also sells as much as he buys.after a near-fatal over-dose on too many pills,she is hospitalized while her parents go to collect her things,her mother wont go into the smelly,run down apartment but her father does. while dad gathers up her things,her boyfriend comes home and the two exchange words and then the father does what we will later hear joe say he'd like to do to a hippie.joe is shooting his mouth off about how he hates different cultures/races,hippies and a laundry list of others. when he says,"i'd really like to kill one of them",the father (trying to look like he's kidding)says,"i just did". joe almost buys it but then takes it as funny. later,when the police are at the scene and the story is in the paper,joe realizes,he wasn't kidding. instead of nailing the rich guy for money through blackmail,he actually,kind of,does blackmail him. by just wanting him and his wife to "get to know" him and his wife. long story short their association is awkward but after sarandon gets wind of what her father has done,the bottom is at risk of falling out.how this all plays out in the end you'll have to watch for yourself. although it's over 35 years ago,the ending is something you wont expect. unless you've seen the film before of course. again,i recommend it mostly for those who haven't seen it.10 stars for boyle not just playing someone completely opposite his nature but for what will show others that he was more than just a tv and movie comedy actor. (end)

22. joe (drama, 1970) joe (peter boyle) is a racist factory worker who's known to hate "hippies and ni**ers". he meets bill, a businessman who has just murdered the lover of his drug addict young daughter jill (susan sarandon). jill runs away and joins a hippie commune at the outskirts of town. bill turns to joe for help. their search leads them through the seediest parts of town where both men's inner hatred and loath is furthered tested.critique: this was director john g. avildsen's first sleeper-turned smash hit (an amazing run which included: 'rocky', 'the karate kid', 'split-image', 'weekend at bernie's'). film is interesting enough in that it served to encapsulate the themes and ideas of the turbulent 60s (vietnam war, black power, women's lib etc.). it also has a good performance from peter boyle as joe, one of the cinema's first antiheroes. he's always been good at playing creepy, bossy heavies whose abstract ideas are enforced by his intimidating presence (he would play the frankenstein monster in mel brook's spoof young frankenstein). he reminds me of a little kid trapped in a big, dumb, awkward body. film has a weak script (the meeting of joe and bill, for instance, is a bit coincidental), but it has a particularly gruesome, post-taxi driver ending.quote: title song: "i saw a fella selling junk to children. he gets nervous every time i pass cause he knows that if i catch him i'm gonna kick his head and kick his fat a$$."

if archie bunker was armed, he may well have been "joe". however, "all in the family" would have had a rather short run because the censors would never have allowed it to run along the lines of this movie. joe is a working class guy who is a racist and a bigot, and has a big mouth, especially when he's drunk. one night he meets a man in a bar, bill, who is having a drink to soothe his frazzled nerves after accidentally killing his daughter's junkie boyfriend and he lets that slip to joe. what happens is that bill's daughter was living with the junkie, and she's hauled off to the hospital after an overdose, and he goes by the apartment to collect her things but doesn't expect that he'll actually run into the boyfriend, who comes in fresh from a big drug deal. in the struggle that ensues, the boyfriend is killed accidentally and bill doesn't want anyone really to know, of course. but he lets it slip to joe, and then when the newspapers and tv reports come out, joe sees them, puts 2 and 2 together, and suddenly this man is a hero in his eyes. he hooks up with him later and bill is of course concerned that joe is going to blackmail him, but not for money, he wants to hang out with him. which is, in a way, almost worse. now, bill's daughter escapes from the clinic she's in, and slips back home, and accidentally overhears what happened and then is on the run, and most of the rest of the movie consists of joe & bill infiltrating "the underground" to try to find her. this builds up to a rather shocking ending, which to me was totally unexpected and ends on just the right note, or wrong note, depending on your point of view. a sort of decent but dim view of life in the early 70's, mostly from a working class bigot's point of view, which makes it not for everyone, but it's not a bad film at all and it's a decent watch. 8 out of 10.

it is important to realise that eisenstein was a committed marxist film maker who held some very specific and particular theories about what film could achieve, and how.it is simply idle to compare alexander nevsky negatively with anything from a similar period in the us; this film comes from the oldest film school in the world, from another continent, from an entirely different approach to cinema.to appreciate this film a little more, try finding out about pudovkin's and kuleshov's theories of montage, for example, or read the wikipedia entry on marxist film theory. if you're feeling really bold, you might even investigate the triadic forms of hegelian dialectic.it follows that if you watch this film without some understanding of eisenstein's ideas and ideals, you probably won't get it. in alexander nevsky the main characters aren't playing themselves, they are meant to be distillations of their nation's character. nevsky and his generals are deliberately shown larger-than-life, because they represent stylised, heroic aspects of the entire russian people.the acting isn't wooden, it's meant to be slightly mannered. it represents a completely different school from the more naturalistic, narrative style which hollywood was rapidly adopting. eisenstein's films are especially designed *not* to be realistic. if anything seems somewhat "obvious", whether lighting or language or a pose struck by an actor, it's meant to be that way. eisenstein was one of the early proponents of film as an art form, not just as entertainment.if the editing sometimes seems to consist of a clash of images, well, that's the idea. shots are meant to contrast with each other, eisenstein's films contain and embody elements of a political/philosophical argument, namely marxist dialectic.so sit back, shout hurrah for russia and her folk-hero defenders, boo at the cowardly nobles and the teuton invaders, and enjoy the difference.

i believe anyone who enjoyed eisentein's ivan the terrible movies would enjoy this well crafted movie. this movie played out like "lord of the ring: return of the king", but without the special effect but as good and better drama.we have the german, who dressed like kkk, conquered novgorod of russia. the russian summoned nevsky to lead them to fight the german to save russia. nikolai cherkasov, who played ivan in the ivan the terrible films, was charismatic as nevsky. the first 10 min how he handled the passing by mongol was captivating.many of the scenes were beautiful even in black and white. the anticipation of war did not require any dialogue such as "how many enemy we will be killing", etc. except for a few speeches, the film can basically be played out as a silent film. the fighting scene can hold up to those of the civil war fighting scene of the birth of a nation.another strength of the movie is the great musical score, by sergei prokofiev. the music gave an epic feel to the movie in those scenes without dialogue.

this is being commented on only because serge prokofiev(1891-1953)may not of known at first just how powerful a score and how actually majestic these lyrics really are.if you read the lyrics to alexander nevsky op.78 there is nothing here that is less than a witness through the song to one of the most beautiful and moving scores in all of musical literature.this film with its accompanying score have a special place in the world and that may be just as true on the internet as anywhere.the composers own website which is underwritten by his estate provides for additional care given such a score as this score truly deserves.it is to me as deep as it is wide with such boldness that you wish to be the one,the one they called great novgorod!this is a song about alexander nevsky.yes,it happened on the river neva-on the river neva,on the wide waters.there we slew our foes'pick of fighting men-there pick of fighting men,the army of swedes.ah!how we fought,how we routed them!ah!smashed their ships of war to kindling!in the fight our blood was freely shed for our great land,our native russian land.hey!where the broadaxe swung was as an open street,through their ranks a lane where spears ran!we mowed down the invading swedes like feather-grass grown on desert soil.we shall never yield native russian land.they who march on russia shall be put to death!rise against the foe,russian land,arise,rise to arms,great novgorod!(the call to arms goes on)arise to arms,ye russian folk,in battle just,in the fight to death,arise,ye people free and brave,defend our fair native land!to living warriors high esteem,immortal fame to warriors slain!for native home,for russian soil,arise ye people,russian folk!in our great native russia no foe shall live.rise to arms,arise,native mother russia!no foe shall march across russian land,no foreign troops shall raid russia,unseen are the ways to russia.no foe shall ravage russian fields.(here dear reader we are asked to live forever with the following verse)titled"the field of the dead"-i shall go across the snow-clad field,i shall fly above the field of death.i shall search for valiant warriors,my betrothed,my stalwart youths.here lies one felled by a wild saber,there lies one impaled by an arrow.from their wounds blood fell like rain on our native soil,on our russian fields.he who fell for russia in noble death shall be blest by my kiss on his dead eyes;and to him,brave lad,who remained alive i shall be a true wife and a loving friend.i'll not be wed to a handsome man,earthly charm and beauty fast fade and die.i'll be wed to the man who's brave,give ye heed to this,brave warriors!(now to its conclusion with nevskys entry into pskov)in a great campaign russia went to war.russia put down the hostile troops.in our native land no foe shall live.foes who come shall be put to death!celebrate and sing,native mother russia!in our native land foe men shall not live.foes shall never see russian towns and fields;they who march on russia shall be put to death! in our russia great,in our native russia no foe shall live!celebrate and sing,native mother russia!all of russia came in triumph to the celebration.celebrate and rejoice,russian motherland!- it should be noted that prokofiev was under quite a bit of pressure from stalin, to if you will, make good.this musical score was really very much approved of by stalin.to me there is a unmistakable beauty in how we love this world and nevsky tells of a hero whose god like attributes provides for all participation in that love.a truly beautiful and furtive telling of the story of alexander nevsky.

this is one of those movies where you have to put to one side some of its obvious shortcomings (a result of the date and location of its production)and accentuate the positive. in many ways this is a truly superb film.forgive the parody in the one line summary, but the most serious shortcoming for an english speaker like me was the ghastly subtitles. the print i saw had 1982 soviet "film export" subtitles, which consistently used inverted grammar, presumably to give the impression of 13th century speech. the actual impact of this nonsense is to make it harder to follow the subtitles which means you spend less time looking at the images. given that the cinematographic imagery is this films great strength, this is a real issue.other imdb-niks have written plenty about the stalinist propaganda elements of this film (just in case the viewer doesn't notice them for him/herself). they have also written plenty about the battle on the ice scene, which is superb in my view. the love interest almost totally lacks subtlety and yet strangely..... almost totally lacks charm also. but it is good to cringe every now and then.i was familiar with the prokofiev music to this film long before seeing the film. the images and the music complement each other marvelously. and it is the images that will stick in the mind for a long time. bergman clearly learned a lot from these images - the imagery of his medieval pieces (e.g. the seventh seal, the virgin spring) building upon and enhancing eisenstein's ideas. this film was made in 1938 in the ussr. in that context it is a masterpiece, albeit a flawed one. for the modern viewer, i suggest that you go with the flow and enjoy the many treats on show.

(warning: spoilers! -- although it's hard to spoil this film by telling story details.)eisenstein's black and white propaganda film is not for everyone. it's very old and it's, er, clumsy. what makes it great for me is the soundtrack, not the original but the updated soundtrack. better still, the orchestral version prokofiev created (my favorite performance is by fritz reiner and the chicago symphony).the film is actually funny in places. it's reminiscent of the old "midsummer night's dream". some of the outdoor scenes are quite magnificent. some of the actors are also quite magnificent. (the actor who played nevsky could have been a superstar today. ditto for the warrior chick, vasilisa -- definitely a rocker.) this may be the world's best collection, on film, of pithy russian sayings (there are tons of them -- they make up the bulk of the spoken lines).the battle scenes actually look much more realistic than most high-budget hollywood flix. these guys are as clumsy with their fighting as real peasants would be. the weapons look nasty, so the actors were probably trying to avoid actually wounding one another.the actor playing the german "grand marshall" is trying *really* hard to look scary early in the film, but he looks like he was really a pussycat. after he's captured he looks *so* pathetic. (speaks volumes about the intended audience, da?)a really humorous touch is that the german army brings an *organ* with it, played by a character in a black robe. watch the russians bring this guy down *while* he's playing.after the battle is over and almost all of the germans are dead comes the best part of the film (and the music), the song sung to the dead soldiers who've died defending the motherland. this part is so sad it's almost an anti-war statement.ten times as many men as ladies have rated this film. wonder why?warning: joseph stalin liked this film. ironic -- he killed more russians than anybody. "those who come to russia carrying a sword will die by the sword".

alexander nevsky is nothing short of a grand film on a grand scale. the film opens a window to a world and culture most americans will never become acquainted with. and much has been said and written regarding the film's thinly veiled patriotism in the face of imminent war with the german nazis.by us standards the acting is a bit stilted. the screenplay is short on words and big on visuals and action. and while the action can become tiresome, the visuals are often stunning. direction is incredible.on another note, fans of ralph bakshi animation might notice that he stole a lot of his visuals for wizards directly from a copy of alexander nevsky.

this movie has to be seen for the music, which is actually a wonderful cantata composed by sergei prokofiev. obviously, the original soundtrack is not exactly hi-fi, but there are many excellent versions available in classical music selections. the cantata can be appreciated for itself, but having seen the movie helps.the story itself is fairly standard soviet wartime anti-german propaganda. an amusing anecdote is that stalin was later so eager to buy time by appeasing hitler at the onset of world war ii that eisenstein was seconded to a german movie for a short while, as penance.prince alexander nevsky (revered as a saint by the russian orthodox), having earned his nickname by defeating swedish raiders on the river neva, musters russian resistance against an invasion by the teutonic knights, and concludes his victory with a stern warning to other would-be invaders.an interesting scene: alexander sees a convoy of russians being taken as slaves by mongolian soldiers, and does nothing to stop this, as the teutonic knights are his priority. the historical alexander nevsky paid tribute to the mongol khans, as his father before him, while working to consolidate his realm's future independence.

went looking for this movie after i read tom clancy's "red storm rising" novel. timeless masterpiece about 13th century russians being invaded by the germans. movie was made in 1938, under orders from joseph stalin to warn soviets about hitler and germany. battle scenes are wonderfully done, showing that you don't need computer animation to make a great fight scene. probably sergei eisenstein's greatest work. also see 'battleship potemkin'. any history buff or poli-sci major should watch this movie. 10 out of 10.

this was eisenstein's first completed project in over ten years. the film takes place in the 13th century during an invasion of russian by germans (teutonic knights - i think). released in 1938 its a very loose parallel to russia's nearing involvement in wwii, and germany's advancement into eastern europe. there are some incredible scenes, most notable the battle near the end of the film, and there is a shocker when children are thrown into a pit of fire, but its not an easy watch. the film drags and isn't as consistently brilliant as "potemkin" or "ivan the terrible". sometimes eisenstein is better in clips. his brilliance is present, however, and its a "must see" for eisenstein fans and film historians. russian propaganda at its finest.

tom clancy uses "alesandr nevsky" in his book "red storm rising". in the book, nevksy was show in theatres across russia as a prelude to the soviet invasion of west germany. i felt i had to check it out. it was excellant! the cinematography was magnificent and storyline incredible. i do not regret watching this movie and added in to my collection.

(contains spoilers)russia in the 13th century. the opening shot shows the relics of the last invasion: moldering uniforms, human skulls and a horse's skeleton. prince alexander nevsky (nikolai cherkasov) chased the swedish army away and impressed the mongol ruler to such a degree that he proposes to promote him to the rank of captain. but nevsky replies: "die in your homeland but don't leave it". he intents to fish, build ships and trade. but he warns of a more dangerous enemy: nearer, meaner and no possibility to buy oneself out: germany. their objective is novgorod. they have already reached pskov: mothers and daughters suffer for their fathers and sons. the marauding occupation forces distribute the looty. rich merchants want to purchase their liberty (always a place for some anti-capitalist p. r.), but the "common people" are ready to fight. they want alexander as their leader. pskov is burned to the ground. the teutonic knights feel invincible and have just a smug smile for the russian women who witness helplessly how their fathers and sons are butchered. babies are thrown in the fire while high dignitaries of the church look on and remain idle. in novgorod: olga danilovna has two admirers: rich and staid gavrilo and tall and jolly vasili. she promises to marry the most valiant. vasili calls on alexander nevsky in perejaslav. the prince decides not to wait for the attack but to strike at once. even women put on a chain armor...the invaders want to bait the "russian bear", but nevsky's stratagem stands the test: lake peipus is his war zone : his men know the territory but the germans, who are heavier, will break through the ice...open your eyes and watch the most impressive battle scenes ever filmed. it's not just the multitude of extras (who were, i think, pressed in this patriotic exercise), but eisenstein's masterful management of such a large number of individuals: he displaces divisions like pieces on a chess board and nearly every shot resembles the composition of a painting by rembrandt or rubens (including horses in phantastic outfits). russia in winter looks intimidating in itself, but eisenstein's visual imagination is hors concours. heaps of corpses are plunged in cosmic light under an endless horizon. at nightfall, olga and other women search with torches for survivors. a devoted falcon sits on his master's dead body while a crow waits for the right moment to pick out the eyes of the deceased. eisenstein's direction and prokofiev's score make alexander nevsky the "rolls royce" among propaganda films. nevsky is, of course stalin's alter ego, and the russians are tall, good-looking, heroic, and they have a perfect hairdo. the germans are bearded savages and look like members of the ku-klux-klan. the actor who plays vasili gives a one-man-four-characters performance: first wavering, then heroic, youthful lover and comic relief. cherkasov's main duty is to look heroic. at the end, nevsky-stalin displays his generosity: he pardons the "little soldiers" and barters the knights for soap. only a bearded killer and a traitorous cleric are turned over to the mob. he does not forget a final warning: who comes with the sword will die by the sword...he kept his promise. 10/10

this film is one of the classics of cinema history. it was not made to please modern audiences, so some people nowadays may think it is creaky or stilted. i found it to be absorbing throughout. cherkassov has exactly the right presence to play alexander nevskyi, just as he did when he played ivan groznyi (ivan the terrible) several years later. the music was beautiful.my one complaint was the poor soundtrack that was quite garbled. although i only know a little russian, it would have been nice to be able to pick out more words rather than having to rely almost 100% on the subtitles. i was watching this on an old videotape from the library, though. perhaps by now a dvd version exists on which the sound has been enhanced. i would like to know whether the actors were using archaic russian or even old church slavonic when they were speaking. the subtitles were strangely worded, and it's hard for me to tell whether this was to reflect an older manner of speaking, or whether the subtitles were just somewhat poorly done.

eisenstein wasn't just one of the greatest soviet,russian, films'directors, but one of the great masters of the cinema, among griffith, murnau, ford, hitchcock, welles, and others. one of the greatest things in all his films was the edition, very personal, and in this movie is exceptional. this was his first sound movie and the use of the musical score by great russian composer serge prokofiev in the sequence of the battle is a perfect contrast between music and image. watching this film is like taking a class or lesson in cinema, something that no many film directors can afford. i never get tired of watch real classics like this film. i hope that in near future more people will recognize a great work of art.

watching some of the sequences (err, the entire 1/3 of the film devoted to the battle on the ice) in alexander nevsy, a film directed by the russian legend sergei m. eisenstein (co-directed by dmitri vasilyev in his only significant credit), made me realize how much must really go into directing, at least on a scale such as this. if i were a member of an awards group at the time of this film's release i probably would award eisenstein with the director's award of the year, posthumously. it is such a mad stroke of cinematic genius to pull off some of things that are pulled off in the film, though for someone like this director after coming off of his best work- battleship potemkin and october- it could have been something he scoffed at at first. but amid a film that is sometimes a little frustrating with how little grays come in to the black and white subject matter, it's still a marvel of celluloid almost 70 years later. lord of the rings fans, meet the films' grandfather, so to speak.to say that something is a propaganda piece already puts a connotation to it, and often a bad one. it is something that has a full-blown message to it, and a point of view. it's still a matter of hot debate (see the swarms of argument over moore's films for proof), about whether great art can come out of something that is point-blank meant to rouse the audience in a specific manner. in this particular case, the russians against the germans. at the time it was nearing ww2 and russia once again faced the 'german invaders', and it's interesting to note that eisenstein was actually commissioned to make this film, as a rallying call for the russians to never forget a crucial piece of their history. the end result comes out as being something that is actually slightly common from seeing battleship and october, however; if nothing else comes through those films it's that eisenstein is most concerned about how the image and the content can come together finitely for the viewer, that style can completely envelop the viewer without fail. on those terms alexander nevsky is fearless. but even with the whole idea of 'russia great, germans bad', there are some small moments where things are made a little less stringent, a little less strict to these ideals. for example, when we first see the germans in privka, they're not some faceless blob who are totally barbaric and have a blind conquering intent (not that they aren't out to take whatever they can). they have their own national pride going too, that it would be nothing less for them to go forward with whatever their christian-led masters tell them to. at the least, the evil of the picture has a face, however kept at a low minimum for the more prevalent side to kick in. there's also a brief scene, before the ice-scape battle, where the russian troupe has a joke that's being told and laughed about, and it adds a little extra depth where else there might be precious little. because more often than not in alexander nevsky, with its battle songs loaded with a pride in warfare, there aren't any complexities to characters, most notably nevsky himself (played in ultra-heroic fashion, only questioning near the start, by nikolai cherkasov) who perhaps has to be this way in eistenstein's intention of having him as the one infallible force to be reckoned with in the tale. after all, to be looking for naturalism in an eisenstein film is like trying to find non-kosher pig's feet at a deli.but the real reason to see the picture isn't the acting, anyhow, but for the look of the film, how it moves and takes in such an expansive environment that eisenstein lays out. on the epic scale it's just as ambitious as his 20's films, with a number of extras not just in the main battle scenes but also in the scenes in the cities, of the hundreds of people rolling on through. in fact, i'd say that any director working in hollywood or elsewhere thinking of doing some kind of huge epic, particularly war, would do very well to take a look at this film, even with just the sound off. it's even better if thought of as a silent film, with the visual strokes accentuated fantastically at times. one could spend a whole month analyzing the battle on the ice, how it starts with the german soldiers far away and then coming forward like bugs, and then how eisenstein inter-cuts between close-ups of the actors fighting and then to wide-shots and with sped-up editing. and, of course, one can't discount the power of the music as well, sergei prokofiev delivering one of the great rousing scores of any epic work. all the while the director's editing keeps our eyes moving along with this frantic action at breakneck speed. if this was just a short film, it would surely rank with the greats, much like the odessa stairs sequence.if i did find it a little less than totally magnificent, it would be because of the faults that do come in from a director who is much more suited to the silent medium than for sound. while i have yet to see ivan the terrible, my one negative criticism would be of his direction of actors, which is really as broad as can be, with the melodrama at such a high-pitch its staggering (the sub-plot of the two soldiers vying for the olga is the best example i can think of). but even this considered, alexander nevsky overall is too extraordinary to ignore, and ratchets up an engagement in the action and the film-making to a level that puts a benchmark for films even today to try and live up to. grade: a

i learned much from previous viewer reactions. is there one that does not mention 'propaganda'? too glib. 'perception is concept dependent'. i love fred astaire musicals, the great, great songs, & fred's peerless grace. but comrades, if you see idle, brainless, rich parasites dancing on the downtrodden & unemployed, that's a valid criticism of 'capitalist propaganda'. any movie is steeped in the values of its time & place, not to mention those who fund it  the pipers who call the tune. great art transcends all, as did 'nevsky', as did 'all quiet on the western front'. i confess. i saw it last 40 odd years ago. but the images are burned in my brain. it's the greatest battle scene ever likely to be filmed. and it makes you horrified to be thrilled. 'plastic ice' did someone say? that's real death you're watching. real extras died making this. 'real looking' is now special effects-defined it seems. likewise 'too long' - for an age of shrunken attention spans? mozart had 'too many notes'? propaganda, catholic church defamed? the vatican was still at it when they called on ancient favors to get the german christian democrat gov. to recognize croatia in the 1990s  remember the chaos & genocides? forget the props, the lighting of nevsky painted the medieval world  like a breughel. there's one in hampton court palace showing a massacre. crude dutch nationalist propaganda maybe, but it tears at the heart. stylized acting? so what's henry v (olivier movie)? naturalism? does anyone believe english medieval knight-killers talked like that? as said, the music of prokofiev is magnificent. only ken russell & eisenstein had the balls & genius to match sound & image at this 100 octane level. ok, you want the snaffle & bit. i'll risk the nervy thorobred every time. eisenstein did not copy wehrmacht helmets, rather, his model seems to have been those buckets worn by 'teutonic knights' in nazi pageants of the 1930s. eisenstein was a genius , but unlike hollywood directors, he had near unlimited (non-commercial) time & funding. modern russian directors are free from political shackles, but have no money. even kurasawa had to make a late (great) movie in communist russia. he was revered but unfunded in his own country (much like russell). how much propaganda is in the eye of the beholder? imagine sane people from another, peace-loving world. how would they react to nevsky? would the battle, or the grieving for the dead dominate their cognitions? if we didn't know about the gas chambers & ss, what about 'triumph of the will'? where can i get a nevsky dvd, cheap?

of so many excellent and so on in nevskiy, one particularly compact *zing* out of them all tickled me so thoroughly that it ends up being the definingly terrific moment of the movie for me.or at least the one that tends to drive hassling people to see the film, brandishing the disc in hand for emphasis.the existing vague abstract acknowledgement of the fairly simple and concrete guilt involved in the guilty pleasure of this may truly gel and prod me into paying the intellectual bill eventually.till then..the demise of the organist was so right on.

nevsky is one of the great epic war films. sure, others, such as birth of a nation and napoleon had come before, but this one is just as influential. the acting is stock, but anyone who knows the first thing about eisenstein would know that that was part of his theory of film. this film, unlike many of his silent works, is about the heroic individual as much as it is about the group. this reflects the stalinist philosophy that had risen to the fore by 1938. still, his film shows us the power that can be generated by people coming together to fight something they perceive as evil. nevsky is just one of many men. he is prince because he is strongest, but not because he is somehow different than the rest. the film's romantic angles provide more of a personal story than eisenstein had previously allowed. not all of the elements work and the film is probably a bit too long, but it still resonates.

eisenstein describes his collaboration with prokeviev as an equal partnership, where they worked together to match image and music, scene by scene. unfortunately, the sound recording was a disaster, so for once the devotion to authenticity in criterion dvd's backfires. fortunately, there is at least one restored version of the film on vhs (bmg classics) with an excellent re-recording of the music (by the st. petersburg philharmonic orchestra and chorus).it is interesting to compare this film with contemporary propaganda films in england, germany, and the united states. eisenstein's film was made in 1938, in response to the fear of a german invasion; and olivier's in 1943, when a german invasion of england was still expected. both films are stagey, but in different ways. olivier begins by showing a staged performance of the play in the globe theater by shakespeare's own company, then takes us out of the theater to a more cinematic (though still stylized) setting. eisenstein's film is cinematic from the beginning, but the dialog and speeches are still influenced by the melodramatic acting conventions of the old russian theater. this works very well for cerkassov's speeches as alexander, because part of his job as a prince and military leader was to play a role in public.in nazi germany, the first major propaganda film was leni riefenstahl's tedious triumph of the will, which recorded a huge political spectacle - massed crowds cheering hitler's ranting speeches. the propaganda in her masterpiece, the film of the 1936 berlin olympics, is much subtler, with its worship of the athletic male body carrying disturbing undertones of the aryan superiority myth. but wartime german propaganda films could also be subtle. karl ritter's urlaub auf ehrenwort (furlough on word of honor) is typical. it shows a young lieutenant letting the men in his company go on a 24-hour leave before returning to the wwi trenches (and almost certain death). against the advice of veterans, he accepts their word of honor to return, though he will be courtmartialed and shot if they don't. naturally, they all return, (though some of them berate themselves for it), presumably inspiring the audiences to similar displays of duty to their country.in the united states, one of the better wwii propaganda films was howard hawks' air force. in it, we follow the mismatched crew of a bomber as they bond to each other with the experience of battle, and overcome obstacles to continue their part in the war. typically for hawks' films, however, their real loyalty is more to each other than to their country.eisenstein has to reach far back in history to find any russian military triumphs. ironically, alexander (like the other russian princes) is descended from the vikings who sailed up the russian rivers to conquer and rule their own fiefdoms. so he is a conquerer repelling another would-be conquerer. physically, they are not that different (though the actors portraying the german princes were obviously chosen for their ugliness and smirking stupidity). but the real contrast is between the common soldiers. the russian peasants are as tall and strong as the nobles; whereas the german peasants who scuttle out of the shield wall to kill wounded russians are a foot shorter than their masters. there is some historical truth in this contrast. russian serfs in the middle ages were much better off than their european counterparts, because they could always escape into the wilderness and clear their own land.eisenstein's film also cleverly gives us our first sight of alexander as a fisherman. in the battle with the germans, he uses his fisherman's knowledge of the ice as well as his knowledge of their military tactics to defeat them. when gavrilo breaks the shield wall, they are forced to regroup and mass on the west side of the lake, where the ice is thinner.one of the other pleasures of eisenstein's film (which most audiences miss) is the historically accurate way that he portrays the politics of medieval russia. cities like pskov and novgorod owed their growing wealth and prominence largely to trade, which put the merchants into power, and sidelined the princes until their military expertise and feudal levies were needed to repel invaders. in the film, alexander is shown not only as a military leader, but also as a master politician, who knows how to wait for his time, and how to make the most of his popularity after the victory.

i've loved this movie since the first time i saw it lo these many years ago. i'm not sure how many times i've seen it, perhaps 10, perhaps 20. this last time i watched it i was struck by a detail that i hadn't noticed before.toward the end of the picture, the slain heroes are conveyed back to the town via sled. there are a couple of closeups of the dead men. the one that struck me most was a shot of the blond youth. all you see on the screen is his profile from head to hands. his hands are holding a flickering candle. the wind is blowing and his thick blond hair is dancing in the wind, in tune with the flicker of the candle flame. the contrast between death and the life he has lost is incredibly powerful. the moving hair and candle flame remind us of the life force that once inhabited his body.every time i revisit this film i see something new.

"from c. jay cox, the writer of the hit comedy 'sweet home alabama', comes a heartwarming and tender gay romantic drama that combines laughs, seduction, tears, and plenty of romance. the handsome aaron (steve sandvoss), a mormon missionary, travels door-to-door in los angeles spreading the word of his religion. christian (wes ramsey), a cute west hollywood party boy, goes from man-to-man without much commitment. opposites attract when aaron and christian meet, and sparks begin to fly."featuring two star-making performances from sandvoss and ramsey, the film also features a terrific supporting cast including mary kay place, joseph gordon-levitt, and international screen legend jacqueline bisset," according to the dvd sleeve description. not to mention some sweet vocalizations from rebekah jordan (as julie), the stock sympathetic roommate. debuting director cox turns his otherwise ordinary "latter days" into a enjoyable and touching drama, due to some story surprises and an engaging team.******* latter days (7/10/03) c. jay cox ~ steve sandvoss, wes ramsey, jacqueline bisset, joseph gordon-levitt

back in 1982 a little film called making love shocked audiences with its frank and open depiction of a romantic love story that just happened to be about two men.i have been waiting for years for a good, old-fashioned romance between two men; latter days is all that and more.yes, it is soapy, melodramatic, cliché-ridden, and quite corny. that is what makes it so wonderful. there is nothing like a good romantic movie, and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word.as to the issue of religion, sorry folks, but these things do happen and are happening to gay people even now. it is not just the mormon church that rejects its gay members. gay people in every religion have faced harsh judgment and rejection.i loved this movie. it has a perfect blend of a fantasy-romance grounded in the reality of the day-to-day lives of the characters. if i could give it more than ten stars i would. good love stories never go out of style; great love stories like latter days are unforgettable.it's about time!

without a doubt the most impressive recent gay oriented film i've seen. c. jay cox hit the nail on the head with this one. the way he handled the issues surrounding faith, family and sexuality were very well done. casting was perfect. wes ramsey did a fantastic job at pulling off the character of christian and steve sandvoss will knock your socks off in the role of aaron. both brought an incredible amount of realism to the roles and the impacts these issues have on young gay men. as a gay man who grew up in a very religious environment (though not mormon)the identification with aaron's character was phenomenal for me. strongly recommend this film to anyone, faithful or not, who is interested in how young gay men have to deal with family and friends in an oft times unfriendly world. by the way, the music in this film rocks! another great job by c. jay cox.

i was impressed by the story. it had the "typical" predatory gay male and the "typical" mormon missionary. but, they each also had friends and family who balanced their lives well. there are a number of characters, some nice and some not so nice, each with their own personality nuances. and, most reminded me of people in my own life.the story starts out with several humorous moments and slowly evolves into a heartwarming relationship film. the story progresses without obvious plot turns and never talks down to you. it makes you think a bit while waiting to see what happens. even when i thought i could foresee something coming, i was surprised by how it actually came about.not many movies make me laugh knowingly at real gay dialogue and then bring a tear to my eye when i feel the characters' pain. i watched the film on dvd, and couldn't bring myself to stop watching until it was over. (usually, i watch a film in pieces over a couple of days.) it's nice to see a film with gay characters that is uplifting, but not preachy. i highly recommend this film! and, not just for gay audiences. the relationships transcend sexuality.

latter days aspect ratio: 1.85:1sound format: stereotrouble flares when an la party boy (wes ramsey) falls in love with a handsome mormon missionary (steve sandvoss).a huge hit on the festival circuit and on limited theatrical release, this likable movie - the feature debut of screenwriter c. jay cox (sweet home alabama) - is an exercise in 'opposites attract', in which ramsey's shallow-minded character is changed forever after falling hard for vulnerable beauty sandvoss, who is constrained by the dictates of his religious convictions. here, the path of true love is paved with hardship, not least of which is the reaction of sandvoss' fellow mormons to his newfound sexuality, which results in his excommunication from the church and the wrath of his indignant parents (mary kay place has a small but devastating cameo as the boy's outraged mother). but cox's script focuses chiefly on ramsey's path to redemption, as his hedonistic lifestyle is thrown into disarray by sandvoss' influence, and by the responsibilities which emerge as a consequence of his developing maturity: he volunteers as an outreach participant, delivering food to aids patients living at home, leading to an unexpected friendship with former party boy erik palladino (tv's "er"), whose illness provides ramsey with a much-needed wake-up call.cox's script is laced with juicy one-liners and various pearls of wisdom (on mormonism: "your church doesn't like alcohol or homosexuals? well, i'm definitely not joining - i can't imagine heaven without both!"), and the characters are surprisingly complex and well-drawn. ramsey has the showier, sexier role (he's first seen doing something rude to a willing participant!), but it's sandvoss who has become something of a gay icon, with his sensitive portrayal of a sweet-natured innocent whose journey from darkness into light leads to a startling revelation about his place in the world around him. he and ramsey are well-matched, and their inevitable sex scene (brief but memorable) is followed by a compelling sequence in which ramsey describes a childhood trauma which has defined his life to date.filmed on hi-def video and transferred to 35mm for theatrical exhibition, the movie's meager budget places limitations on the scope and grandeur of cox's ambitions, though the characters and situations are strong enough to survive this minor drawback. jacqueline bisset shines as a worldly-wise restaurateur at the diner where ramsey waits tables for a living, and joseph gordon-levitt ("third rock from the sun") steals everyone's thunder as sandvoss' fellow mormon, opposed to his friend's relationship with ramsey on religious principle... but only on principle. though a little stilted in places, the movie aches with romantic longing, and deserves plaudits for its honesty and compassion. best seen with a crowd of like-minded viewers, preferably with a loved one by your side.

four holy young men from mormon country go to l.a. to preach the gospel to urban heathens. but, one of the young mormons is a repressed gay who "happens" to cross paths with a very "out" young l.a. party boy. (what would film plots be without coincidences?). these two, very different, young men become friends, and in the process, affect each other's outlook which, in turn, sets up an inevitable clash between gay and mormon cultures.that is the premise of "latter days", a 2003 film, written and directed by c.jay cox, himself a former mormon missionary. the film's story is, of course, highly relevant, especially in contemporary america. variations of this story need to be told, and retold, and retold, hopefully in future films ... because the underlying theme brings to light the hatefully superior attitude that christian fundamentalists too often display toward gays. by its nature, "latter days" is provocative, and i doubt that the film was well received in provo or pocatello, even though the script is intelligent, sensitive, and insightful.

the very first time i heard of latter days was when i was renting dvd's and i was interested as i am a member of the lds church. i found this movie very heartfelt and in several areas it made me cry. the reason for this is that too many years ago i knew a young man who went through what aaron (played by steve sandvoss)does in latter days, but unlike aaron this dear young man did not survive the ordeal. he ended up taking is life after his church, his friends, and his family disowned him because he was gay. there have been many people who do not think that the things that are shown in the movie really happen in this day and age, but the sorry and sad thing is they do. for those of you out their who are gay and young you need to see this movie and if you are a gay mormon you really need to see this movie. plus if you get the dvd there is help for you listed in the dvd. teenage suicide in the gay world is very disturbing and this movie touches it but that part is hidden to a degree. the acting and the music is excellent. this movie sold out every movie house that it showed but it only showed in major cities and had a very limited release, so for those who would like to see this movie i would recommend the dvd release. the only people that i know who did not like the movie are members of my own church and they did not see the movie because of the subject matter gays and the lds church. see the movie, experience the story, and feel the emotions that are showcased in this movie you i feel will not be disappointed.

first of all, i'd like to say i'm just an amateur in commenting movies and that english is not my native language, but that i felt a strong feeling compelling me to write about such movie; possibly as a way to thank and congratulate c. jay cox, the cast and the crew for such a brilliant production.yesterday i watched "latter days" for the first time.at first i thought it might be similar to the movie "priest", which i liked very much for showing a gay priest out of the closet. but "priest", maybe due to its restrict catholic ideological notions, didn't supply my spectator's needs by revealing a profound sad end."latter days", on the other hand, broke that concept (and some other ones as well, such as the mormon's principles); presenting a tender and cheerful story, leading it to a happy and emotive end, and yet arousing a feeling of god's blessing and hope. a great movie indeed!somehow "latter days" made me feel l.a. as a city of angels. i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes astoundingly beautiful gay love stories!

this was truly a deeply moving movie in every sense of the word. i myself was a mormon missionary and i know first hand the wanting to complete my mission but at the same time hiding the fact that i was gay. like the character aaron, i was sent home for being found out and excommunicated, but being the only mormon in a family of catholics wasn't as big a shame as it was for the lead character. this movie really took me back to those days and helped me to realize, years later, how fortunate i was to have a family that accepted me and understood what i was going through. i found myself applauding the end of a movie when aaron and christian find each other again by shear chance at lila's restaurant. i was truly moved to tears. i highly recommend this movie to all who read this review and also declare it a must buy.

i am a sociologist/anthropologist specializing in the field of symbolic interactionism, and i must say that this film exhibits high quality in the symbolic context throughout the entire film. to anyone who has not yet seen this, i recommend that you also read "man's search for ultimate meaning" by victor e. frankl. i think you will be able to draw some amazing correlations.that being said, i would like to say that despite the fact that the main characters are gay, this is not a story about being gay. this is a story about seeking out and finding meaning in life, despite the difficulties and challenges, the pain and terror that stand in your way. this is a story of seeking and finding balance and wholeness and happiness.

latter days is the best gay movie of the homosexual genre. most of the films entail sappy stories, one night stands, and let us not forget infamous baseball teams? latter days actually contains male affection beyond the kiss in the dark, and quite graphic material that made me wonder whether the film belonged at blockbuster or badpuppy.com. the films emotional journey is what sets it above the rest in the genre. not until this film had i seen a story of such intense passion and love, and the torture that it can bring. i think when people cry during movies they should be beaten, but i found myself sobbing throughout several scenes because of the realistic nature of the world in which we live. i suggest every gay male see this film, and if you have a boyfriend, thank him...

i may be a sentimentalist. but i found this movie truly moving. it was the first movie that reduced me to tears. and it did it more than once!! i recommend it to anyone both gay and str8. religious or not! supporting co-star jackie bisset stole the show, especially with her one liners. the nude scenes were superbly crafted as well, and all in were good taste. most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the mormon church to the lead character. it shocked me that this still goes on in the world. nevertheless i enjoyed this movie tremendously. this is definitely the best gay film since torch song trilogy. and much better than the other gay movie offering that year - the fluffer.

i love so much about this movie: the music, the cinematography, the acting, the story, and all the mormon clichés. just because they are clichés doesn't mean they aren't true! this is not perfect, it is a movie after all. though excommunications are held in well-lit rooms with nice big desks and chairs, it was totally appropriate to portray it as the dark, cold scene they did in this film. i also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop, smoking a cigarette. i thought that was so cool. i mean, i believe that angels do watch over us. what is one supposed to do while waiting? smoking is a way some people pass the time while waiting. i loved the irony cause mormons make such a deal about smoking. i saw this movie 7 times in theaters in salt lake, and cried every time! it blows me away. and i've watched it 3 times on video now and it still makes me cry every time. i would jump at the chance to see it again on a big screen. i hope the tower theatre in salt lake will bring it back regularly at general conference time, as a cult movie (pun intended, but no offense intended).

having grown up a mormon and grappled with the church's bigotry towards blacks (they were not allowed to hold the church's priesthood when i was a member) -- i wasn't aware of the organizations policy of excommunicating gay men and women until after i left the church in 1966 -- (i was 20.) i was stunned when i learned that friends who were gay were excommunicated even after serving on missions. latter days exposes the mormon's persecution of gay members. the film is long overdue. it does an excellent job of showing how the two lead males come to terms with one another, while managing to grow up and develop more fully as individuals. latter days has great heart, wonderful original music and an added touch of class from jacqueline bisset. the film brilliantly tells the story of an individual who leaves behind the confines of organized religion and reclaims his very soul.

i have nothing but good things to say about this tasteful and heartwarming film. i think that the effort of the film's director/writer is courageous as well as inspirational. i loved this film not only for the fantastic story (which needed to be told), but also for the way the actors delivered the story. this is not another shallow "gay movie" that depicts stereotypical characters in humorous situations. this was a memorable and flawless effort to show people that love truly knows no bounds, and love is still as beautiful and wonderful as it always was. another thing that touched my heart was how well i could relate to the emotion portrayed in this film surrounding the coming out of one of the main characters. we all have to go through similar situations living in the society that we live in and feeling that feeling of detachment from everything that is "right" and "normal". i give my most heartfelt praise for this fabulous and courageous story.

i have found this epic to be of an astonishing, striking, even heartbreaking beauty. some kind of monumentality in beauty and decorative richness, a magnificent dramatic movement and dynamism. the choreography herein is hugely enjoyable, the actors are thoroughly enjoyable. i have been a big fan of crouching tiger  as well, but this one was even better. they have kitano's ingenuity in delighting in what is pleasurable. this beauty affirming adventure cinema is an act of courage. when was the suspense so exquisite and genuine? and the art of showing huge crowds, gigantic armies . the film has something deeply satisfying, and a steadfast good taste. there is an enormous pleasure in making such a deliberately impressing and clean show .it's good beyond words. few, few adventure films ,let alone epics, gave me such an uninterrupted delight.fan can be monumental. is not monumental artbut is monumental fun,like leone's movies, like some '60s epics; also like the hobbits trilogy. it is largesized fun.

a very great movie.a big love story. lots of sword fighting. huge battle scenes. heros and villains. real history.few in the west know much chinese history. chin zchaundi founded china. the country is in fact named after him. some are familiar with the terra cotta army recently unearthed. this is a historical epic of how he ended the period of contending states and unified china. he founded a dynasty that only last 14 years but it was immediately replaced by the han dynasty that permanently defined chinese civilization ever since.chin (or the king of zheng as he was known before he founded the empire)was roughly contemporaneous with scipio, hannibal, and fabius in the west. the parallel roman world dominance (west and east worlds) was achieved without a single towering personality like chin. it would not be for another century before the west produced caesar - the nearest comparable western figure.chin is shown very sympathetically here in the beginning but he develops over the course of the film into a ruthless despot. history only records the ruthless despot part but the sympathetic beginning leaves room for real character development over the course of this long film. the famous story about the meeting with the assassin is as true as any two thousand year old anecdote can be. gong li is lovely. she is the emotional core of the story. it all makes for great movie making.

the story of pre-unified china must be a popular one. jet li's hero made the assassination of the king popular.this is another story made a few years earlier. it stars the incredibly beautiful li gon (memoirs of a geisha, 2046, miami vice) as the king's lover, who was sent to recruit an assassin so that the king could defeat him. she recruits fengyi zhang, but falls in love with him.no matter, he is not able to complete the mission anyway, as the king knew about him beforehand. i suspected he also knew, but went anyway.it was a beautiful story with massive military operations, and, of course, another chance to see li gong.

this movie is excellent ( i watched the french version ). there are many subplots (which usually detracts from the whole ), but they nicely unfold and concur to the "discovering of one's real self" main theme. in fact, the whole movie (besides his background ) is the journey to the discovery of one's ( or someone else's ) self. is the king really a "good peacenik monarch" trying to wage a "war to end all wars" or is he just a disturbed, blood thirsty hoodlum? is he a true king, after all? is the attendant to the queen mother just a lusty, career-driven, spineless sock puppet or rather a sharp thinking, bold individual? will the dame/concubine realize who the king truly is? what's between the king and the old chancellor? what's the secret everyone knows but won't tell? what's the true reason the assassin quit his "job"? subplots (something i'm not particularly fond of ) are handled well and keep one watching until the end. scenes are well crafted and cgi fits nicely in, without going overboard. suspense is properly maintained and actors are upto the task. there is a lot of brain-damaged smiling, but that is how one was supposed to behave at the king's court ( as the dame/concubine complains about ). realistic movie without superhero moments. this chinese movie really puts hollywood cardboard colossals ( gladiator etc ) to shame.

the pace of the film is ponderously slow in parts, but if you can tune into its languid speed and lengthy silences then it is a satisfying piece of courtly intrigue. the story of the first emperor of china, his childhood sweetheart and the personal cost of power. the film is very atmospheric, the extremely mannered and polite courtly ceremony and ritual contrasted with sudden brutal violence. filmed in a way that evokes shadows and cold spaces. battle scenes are rare and short, the focus is on the battle within the individual on what is right to do and whether the ends justify the means. the emperor's journey from idealistic peacemaker to ruthless tyrant is aiming to be subtle, but gives little background or convincing insight into the motivation of the emperor, indeed his actions and aims do not really change throughout, only gong li's attitudes to him are altered. the most interesting performances are gong li's and the titular assassin as they reassess when to fight, when to retreat, when to kill. the most expensive film ever made in china at the time, the emperor and the assassin does not rely on hysteric emotion or big battles, but rather a brooding atmosphere of menace and inevitability. gong li fans will be unsurprised to hear she is as stunningly beautiful as ever, giving an understated performance.

this movie is not for those expecting a martial-arts extravaganza. as for historical accuracy, i will leave that issue to those better informed on that subject. i thought the performances were wonderful. gong li never disappoints as the resourceful and (initially) loyal consort of the king of qin. fengyi zhang showed a lot of flexibility portraying a ruler descending into madness. he chose the "hannibal lector" route, rather than resorting to ranting. for me, the best performance was from zhiwen wang as the supersmooth marquis. the character came across as very oily, but in a subtle "sir humphrey appleby" - yes minister kind of way.the cinematography is the standout feature of this film. the scene when the marquis and his men stormed the palace was breathtaking. there are also a number of wonderful battle scenes. therefore, this film is highly recommended on the big screen.

another period piece for chen kiage... (can't remember him doing a modern film!)...good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises. none of the hk fighting scenes, or the hollywood type of heroes, but it is good because of it. the characters are strong, i really felt for them.understanding the mandarin definitely gives the english subtitles the edge. the film is 3 hours, but it didn't feel like it.

this story documenting the rise of china's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in chinese history.it's worth every penny. visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.) please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.

the movie invites comparisons to shakespeare. the mandarin is beautifully written and spoken, and the plot is intricate and intriguing. never has gong li looked better, never has the glory that is china been better represented on the screen. the balance between political turmoil and personal intrigue that gladiator hinted at but never really delivered is here in spades. simply incredible.

quite a production from the director telling the story of the qin emperor's ambitious plan to unite all kingdoms of china. some great characters, sets, costumes and scenes. however, i was not blown away by the film in terms of the actors ability (which was good i enjoyed the marquis the most) or its look (although the massing of troops was extremely impressive, if it was real man that is a lot of extras!).i have seen li gong in other movies and she is always great. good period piece i think, but not one to judge the true historical accuracy of it. good film and found the 2 1/2 + hours not a problem.rating 7 out of 10.

kaige succeeds in this beautifully done film. the pace matches the story, the direction is superb, and the casting/acting is perfect. the only draw back are one or two slight editing errors. i love film and i am a confessed stickler.

chen kaige gives us magnificent depth of atmosphere. yes, it's a 'period piece', but chen's artistic use of imagery makes it something more. the actors often behave like players using the stylized diction, postures and facial expressions of peking opera. all the actors in a scene play to the 'back wall' even when addressing each other. they are like spirits of the past enunciating with powerful clarity a story with urgent meaning for those in the present. combined with close attention to scale and masterful cinematography indoors and out, "jing ke ci qin wang" is a stunning tale told with great reverence in its own idiom that captivates completely.

this one is a very solid randolph scott western. he plays bat masterson and goes to liberal, kansas to clean up the town. he becomes good friends with robert ryan who played a very, straight up leading man role. it was not until after this that robert ryan began playing much darker roles. in fact, in 1947 randolph scott made one other movie which was not a western and never made anything but westerns after that until he retired in 1962. this movie has good pacing and builds up to the climax steadily. i can't say any more as it would give away the plot. be sure to see this one. 8/10

note the wide release date of aug 8, 1945 - about a week before japan surrendered in wwii, so there will probably be a message for us in "over 21". irene dunne (it happened one night, the 1939 version of love affair) is paula wharton, who goes to live on an army base while her newspaper editor husband is in training school. alexander knox ( the longest day) is her hubby max. look for charles coburn (monkey business, gentlemen prefer blondes) as the stuffy, commanding, newspaper boss. also look for cora witherspoon as mrs. gates, from the women, bank dick, libeled lady. war story written for the wives' point of view, which wasn't too common in those days. fun commentary on the shabby condition of the "married housing"; irene's wardrobe in this film certainly wasn't at all shabby.. since they never had to leave their little cottage, it appears the whole movie budget was spent on her always-exquisite dresses and hats.

during wwii, there were a bazillion movies created by hollywood and after seeing many of them they start to seem alike. however, over 21 is unique in so many ways, as it shows a side of the war you won't see in other films--making it well worth seeing, even if you have seen the bazillion other films! alexander knox plays the male lead, but the real lead of the film is irene dunne--who looks amazing for a 47 year-old lady (yes, i checked--she really was this old when she made the film). in over 21, the pair play husband and wife. he enlists in the military, much to the consternation of his father (charles coburn) and owner of the newspaper where knox is employed, and most of the film takes place when he is in officers candidate school. the film shows little of knox in the school but instead centers on dunne as she lives in nearby spartan housing for spouses. during this time, she (as the british say) keeps a 'stiff upper lip' and makes the best of it--even though she really isn't a housewife but a famous professional writer. occasionally she gets very brief visits from her harried husband but most of the time is spent doing housewife duties and keeping the meddling coburn at bay. eventually, she decides to stop the pesky coburn from phoning incessantly (he always complains that his paper won't survive without his son) by pretending to be knox--writing wonderful editorials that everyone just assumes were written by him.while there is nothing earth-shaking in this film, it's a very interesting slice of life move. additionally, the acting all around is very good. it's interesting that this film is a fictionalized reworking of the experienced of ruth gordon (a famous screenwriter) and her husband, garson kanin (also a famous screenwriter as well as director). when kanin joined the military during wwii, gordon soon wrote and starred in the play that became this film.by the way, i noticed that some of the reviewers really liked the speech towards the end of the film and were inspired by it. while it was very good, it was also very sad as all this hope for a better world following the war was short-lived.

over 21 the film version of the ruth gordon play which detailed her experiences trying to keep the marriage together with garson kanin after he'd gone in the service provides irene dunne with one of her better later roles on the big screen. it's also in keeping with what was then an upbeat spirit in america about how we would not screw up the peace as we did in the first world war and sow the seeds of yet another global conflict.the play ruth gordon wrote and starred in herself ran for 221 performances in 1944 on broadway and was confined simply to the bungalow that gordon and harvey stephens who was the male lead had on a training base. if you look on the broadway credits list it says that the production was 'staged' by george s. kaufman as opposed to being directed by him. i'm not sure of the distinction, but i can imagine that with a wit and will as strong as kaufman's it must have been an interesting period putting the production together before opening night.when columbia bought the screen rights, sidney buchman had to do some considerable script reconstruction to move the action beyond the bungalow. the film bears very little trace of its stage origins.alexander knox plays the husband and charles coburn the employer of both dunne and knox who are writers. knox has graduated to not only editor, but featured columnist. his words and thoughts help sell the paper and coburn is in a bind. but knox feels he has to get into the war, the seminal event of his time in order to speak authoritatively on the kind of post war world he wants. this was not an uncommon theme in those years. irene dunne has some good comic moments, the kind she used to have when she was appearing opposite cary grant. in fact garson kanin directed both of them in my favorite wife a few years earlier. coburn is his usual cantankerous old water buffalo of a boss who ultimately has a good heart.over 21 was an optimistic picture which sad to say wasn't accurate about what the allies and i mean all of them could bring to the peace conferences to create a better world. still hopefully a new generation will get it right.

it is well known that irene dunne could sing somewhat more than a little. and i think her talent as a comedienne can only be really understood once one has struggled through a sonata by haydn or a song by debussy and made a success of it. her instrument is her voice and her handling of it is pure musicianship. she could tackle any part. the only thing she couldn't do was to not make a success of it. this film is a perfect example. in it, she channels ruth gordon (because the play is the thing), is feminine, charming, willful and self-effacing, generous, protective and combative but never pretentious. she manages to stay as believable as alexander knox is in another difficult role he assumes with aplomb. the viewer gets to believe in what he is seeing and to care for it. it is refreshing to see a film that is both entertaining and intellectually challenging while pushing all the right patriotic buttons. i sincerely hope the entire dunne oeuvre makes it to dvd one day because it's really hard to keep a secret like that among just a few initiates.

a light, uplifting and engaging movie. watching irene dunne is a delight! as you watch her, she ceases to be irene dunne and becomes in every way paula wharton.i have enjoyed irene dunne in every movie that i have seen and that would be nearly all of them. what a shame that most of her movies need restoration so badly. i do hope irene dunne movie are restored before it is too late they are such treasures thank goodness this is not the case with over 21.it is a must see if you like superb acting and witty comedy with serious overtones. i agree with a previous comment on the speech "the world and apple pie" it was one of the many highlights of the movie. i read somewhere that irene dunne helped in writing that speech along with director vidor (irene dunne was a very good and charitable person in private life) and it certainly seems to show through in her movies!

the beautiful, charming, supremely versatile and talented irene dunne is one of the greatest 5 or 6 actresses of american cinema. in over 21 - as in all her films - she lights up the screen with a natural, yet glamorous presence. she is simultaneously authentic and human, and a charismatic, inspirational model. this role is quintessential irene dunne, full of pathos and wit and a little mischief. i love all of her films, and this film was a fantastic new discovery for me when tcm aired it last night. i hope they don't wait years to air it again.likewise, charles coburn is one of the greatest character actors in all of american filmdom. true, he often portrays variations on the same theme, but i never tire of watching his soft-hearted curmudgeons. here his character is the perfect foil for irene dunne, and he is portrayed perfectly by coburn. their conflicts in this film are absolutely fantastic. they never miss a beat. in addition, they represent the central conflict of the film and the moral conflict of irene dunne's husband, portrayed by alexander knox.i am not as familiar with knox's work. he was recognizable, but that was about all. however, cast with dunne and coburn, he holds his own. he delivers a fine, nuanced performance. his character has noble motives that are made accessible to us by knox's performance and never held over us like some holy grail. he is noble, but conflicted and doubts his ability to successfully complete ocs. his interaction with dunne, is always convincing, too. dunne supports him without being syrupy or becoming a martyr, and he responds in kind. their scenes are very well done.the film, itself, is a fantastic snapshot of a moment and a milieu not portrayed in other movies. i don't recall off the top of my head another movie that portrays america still fighting wwii, but with the end in sight and the focus on the establishment of the post-war world. not the usual wwii movie! that in itself is interesting; it is also essential to the plot and the movie's message. in contrast to other commentators, i thought that the climactic speech was okay, but not great. it was delivered very well by knox, but it was not as "tightly" written as the build-up led me to expect. i have heard better cinematic speeches addressing very similar themes. it served its purpose.for me, the greater value of the movie, was the depiction of the life of dunne and knox, as it reflected the typical ocs experience. the sense of community among the wives living on palmetto terrace seemed absolutely authentic - as did palmetto terrace, itself, despite the fact that it was obviously a sound stage set. the incredibly brief encounters between the wives and their ocs husbands. the rigors of the ocs candidates, mastering the difficult and complex material they had to learn. the shabby "base housing" - obviously hastily constructed. the tired and worn furnishings. the constant and harrowingly short deadlines - for returning to base, for learning lessons, for catching trains to subsequent "posts." tenants constantly running into their predecessors and successors in the base housing, as they were moving in and out. yes, i suspect this was a glimpse of a real wwii experience - clothed in some comedy, but very real at its core. i loved it, and i recommend it highly.

this little-known comedy from the hit play by ruth gordon is a delight. the script, based on the play, is spicy, rich, and completely undated. ditto the cast but i must underline the work of the leading lady,irene dunne. irene is simply superb - as usual - and lights up the screen with every frame she's in (and she's in it a lot, thank heaven). in addition, director vidor has given her some unusual close-ups that are mesmerizing. what a gal! i know of no other hollywood actress from any era who has her versatility and is so convincing in every film. why she remains so little known is a mystery. i have seen most of her films and this one was a surprise, even for a solid id fan like myself. see it, everyone!

a really good australian film .beautifully recreates the look and feel of sydney as it was in the 1950s. this movie greatly impressed me when i first saw it during it's initial cinema release and it still stands up very well. fine directing job by phil noyce, wonderful camera work , thoughtful lighting and some fine performances across the board. an absolute "must see" for any students of 70's australian cinema.one out of the box !

as a child growing up in the sydney of the 1950s, i can readily identify with the content of this fine film. each week i visited the wynyard newsreel cinema on george street to watch the cinesound (and usually 3 stooges) shorts. never has there been a better blending of b/w and colour in a film. faultless production values round off a never to be forgotten movie experience.

we went to the cinema expecting a biggish budget release and got an art-house movie. the movie was projected digitally onto about two thirds of the screen real estate with sloping edges classic of digital projection, and had a limited stereo soundtrack which was wasted on the cinema experience.the content of the film was the same old historical content we have all seen before, but heavily sanitized to prevent the audience being sick. live action scenes what little of them there were, were re-used constantly in classic documentary style, which became annoying after a while.i was somewhat amazed that only 4 people turned up to watch it, guess the rest knew something we didn't.i suspect the producers made the film to recognize the ninetieth anniversary of gallipoli. i have to question whether they should have bothered.seven out of ten for trying, and out of respect for the anzac's.

i have to say that i know the documentaries of mister örnek and so i knew that i will get a very well made piece of movie documentary. i was not disappointed. as a history nerd - i did saw hundreds of documentary and liked the different approach of this work.the director and his 17 consultants (historians, veteran families) tried to access the reality of the gallipoli through the letters of solders from both sides. so, the history is followed by british, australian and turkish soldiers.narrated is this docu by jeremy irons and sam neill - both boost the intensity and emotionality of this documentary by their great voices.i saw this film in a cinema in italy in dolby surround. i did buy the dvd last year and will wait again 3-7 years for the next work of this talented director and his very good documentaries.summary: well made. intense. history with emotions - wrapped in a war documentary with great narrators

in my opinion, the movie is an excellent example of the realities of war and a tribute to the soldiers of all nations who fought and bled into the soil gallipoli. the lack of violence in no way detracted from the magnitude of the tale in hand. it is honest, true and brave, just like the men that fought and died at the hellespont. the lack of brutal depictions of violence are just and proper. those men suffered enough for freedom, liberty and the right to self determination in a free and better world. they never wished to ever see such scene's again.that is the legacy of the event of gallipoli. to suffer scene's of gratuitous pyro-technics and blood and gore is best not shown for the maintenance of proper respect for the combatants of this crucible of nationhood.this film glories in the magnificence of men fighting for their lives,with honour, courage, dignity and irrepressible spirit and humour in the face of appalling adversity. this film is not interested in making a spectacle for fools to cheer over. the brutal outcomes that occoured from these personal combats of these men is not a thing that those that survived ever wished to see on a screen for entertainment. they saw enough of that at the time, and would much rather have never seen it at first, and never wished to review such scenes again on a screen in the name of "entertainment". the brutal horrors of the actualities of the vicious combat fought at gallipoli were scenes that haunted their waking and sleeping hours for the rest of their natural days. it was the painful internal scars they, the men of all those nations who fought, carried inside to their graves. they all fought,and many died in the face of it all and somehow they, those mighty hearted men, managed to laugh in the teeth of constant dread death because they would'nt insult their mates by not being prepared to die game beside them. that's australasian for brave, game is, but it applied to all combatants to a greater or lesser degree, but word from the boy's that fought was that johhny turk was as game, that is as brave, as you would ever wish for a soldier to be.anzac's and turks were fighting to establish their place on the world stage, and from 25/04/15 onwards, their respective claims for equality in nationhood were made known and undeniable to that world. the director has made a masterpiece that truly honours the spirit and memory of those soldiers and serves as a reminder to future generations of all ages, for children can be taken without fear of frightening them for the sake of visual "horror" and it's morbid and pointless appeal. and children should attend this movie so as to learn what happened at that sacred shore before they were born. so that they can remember. for it is the nature of men, that they soon forget.

there is an interesting split in the voting for this movie (at the moment at least). those who go expecting a documentary are impressed, or at least not disappointed. i anticipate that those giving the film 1 out of 10 are those who expected a war movie or a re-enaction of the invasion of gallipoli.so - if you want to see actors, gunfire and gore, this film will not suit you. if you want to see an independent documentary about gallipoli, without bias towards any one side (the only enemy in these events was the war itself) then you'll come away both impressed and sobered. i found it a very moving film, and even quite liked captain guy nightingale by the end.

i've seen this amusing little 'brit flick'many times. the only problem is its currently unavailable on video or dvd. i'ts certainly a contender for a dvd release. the much missed richard jordan plays 'pinky' an ex-pat american, whose just been released from prison,he finds himself a job as an electrician in a bank, it all goes well until he finds himself embroiled in a bank heist with his ex cronies, david niven plays the mastermind ivan, its an enjoyable little romp, hopefully studio canal or anchor bay, will come to the rescue. look out for john rhys davies before he struck it big with 'shogun' raiders of the lost ark 'lord of the rings' in a small role as a barrister,

david "master of debonair" niven plays the big boss (ivan) who preys upon the unfortunate richard jordan (pinky) by forcing the hapless ex-con to exploit his ill-found new position in a bank. elke sommer (miss pelham) most effectively provides the female interest, whom pinkie cannot simply cannot resist.it seems they were unable to decide on one name for this film so instead they used four .... makes sense ???sadly, this turn out to be one of niven's last roles.overall, this film is fun and well worth watching if you manage to catch one of its rare or late night tv screenings.

when pinky, a qualified electrician, is released from prison, his parole officer has found him a job working at a big city bank. when some of the crime underworld from his past learn of his position they plan to exploit it and rob the bank. pinky is at first horrified because he really wants to go straight, but when a twist of fate happens pinky begins to think one shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.also known as the mayfair bank caper {amongst others!}, this is a hugely enjoyable piece that is quintessential 1970s. london and all it's highly dubious fashions are lit up like a christmas tree in ralph thomas and guy elmes' cunningly crafty caper. if the viewer can accept david niven as an aged crime lord of some evility {it's not easy i can tell you}, then a nightingale sang in berkeley square could well surprise you. the actors aren't pulling up any trees for sure, but it's really not hurting the picture at all, it has an honest fun quality that is never less than entertaining. the score and soundtrack is perhaps guilty of over jollification during the dramatic criminal moments, but it's a minor complaint to leave me thinking this is an under seen british gem.richard jordan takes the lead role of pinky (obviously hoping to lure in american viewers}, 70s heart throb oliver tobias {a mass of hair} is in there to keep the ladies interested, whilst the blokes get the pleasurable sight of elke sommer and her delightful legs for company. moving along at a decent enough clip and containing a seriously rewarding finale, a nightingale sang in berkeley square deserves far better than the paltry 5.7 rating here on imdb, but just how many people have seen it i wonder?, hmm, go on give it a go if you the chance, it's good stuff. 7/10

a gem of a british caper-comedy. poor american schlub pinky green (richard jordan, playing another bad guy but this time an adorable one) gets out of a british jail and tries to go straight, but his maintenance man job in a bank is too attractive for his never-reformed criminal friends, headed up by a really nasty ivan (david niven in one of his last roles). pinky resists, but the lure of all that money is just too much for him. things unravel and reravel and it's all joyous to watch. jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career, but he never played the same one twice - this one is just too lovable to hate. niven never played a slicker bad guy, oil all over. two fine actors we've lost that i wish we had back.

just ingenious enough to be plausible and still a lot of fun, this is a pure slice of the 1970s (even the cops need haircuts badly!). shot in and around london, the plot of the american ex-con who tries going straight but finds himself sent as an electrician to a bank in mayfair, and then has the screws put on by crime lord david niven, and finds himself plotting the crime of the century is well-handled.i liked its simplicity and even innocence, it harks back to a time when caper films where just that, a caper, and violence wasn't a part of the deal.all in all you could do a lot worse than watch this: it has enough twists and turns to give it some oomph and a cast that obviously had fun making it.nicely made and watchable.

i remember seeing this film in the mid 80's thought it a well paced and well acted piece. i now work quite often in berkeley square and the had to get a copy of dvd to remind myself how little the area has changed, although my office is newish it just 30 seconds away from "the bank". even jack barclays car dealership is still there selling bentleys and rolls royces.it's look like the dvd is due a region 2 release soon. the region 1 copy i is very poor quality. let's hope they've cleaned it up.only the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court spoils what would otherwise be a great film but i guess is in line with the caper tag the film goes with.

delightful! it never pretends to be a masterpiece, but it's a mini-gem of late seventies british comedy. given that the producers wanted to sell it abroad, it stars an american (the late character actor richard jordan), but at least he isn't the usual dull hollywood hunk type. surrounding him is the cream of british character acting talent, led by a wonderfully waspish and superior david niven.niven's ivan the terrible naturally gets the best one liners and all the best reaction shots. he also manages to be surprisingly menacing and intimidatingly dangerous. the moment in the snooker club when he drops the charming facade and threatens richard jordan will come as a shock to those viewers who think of niven as being only a light drawing room comedy star. he is filled with genuine power and ruthlessness as we see all at once how ivan earned his nickname. all the more surprising given how ill niven was at the time. shortly after filming this production he lost his powers of speech to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (known as lou gehrig's disease). this is the last picture niven made where you can hear his own voice, being dubbed thereafter by the comic impressionist sid caesar.alongside him you can spot numerous familiar faces from seventies cinema and television. elke sommer (flashing her breasts in true seventies era politically incorrect bimbo mode), oliver tobias, michael angelis, brian croucher, davy kaye etc, etc. davy kaye gets one of the biggest laughs as he holds up a security guard caught making a phone call. "who you ringing?!....bloody dial-a-disc! you gormless git!" great shots of london street locations; making the film a period patina time capsule of red phone boxes with chunky round-dial manual handsets, black cabs driven by "cor blimey, gov!" cockneys, and ladies and gents modelling all manner of deeply dodgy late seventies retro leisure wear and hair styles. unlike the classic ealing comedies of an earlier era, the 'hero' is allowed to get away with his crime and escape to a life in the sun. how times had changed! the morality code by which crooks in films always had to be seen to be punished had long gone by the seventies, with anti-heroes like pinky green earning status through their cheeky anti-authoritarianism and determination to 'cock a snook' at a stuffy capitalist establishment of be-suited fat cat businessmen. we are encouraged to cheer as pinky makes off, unpunished and free as a bird with his ill gotten gains. compare that to the ending of the lavender hill mob!highly entertaining, quaintly dated in its fashions and attitudes, and the stuff of late night cult viewing. perfect to watch at midnight after the pubs have shut; if you're of a certain age, are feeling a touch nostalgic, and have always wanted to see david niven in a branch of mcdonalds, silently intimidating an american via the use of a retractable telescope!

i provided location services on the this film every sunday we would shoot in london's berkeley square. david niven ever the gentleman thoroughly enjoyed the role, sadly to be his last. we had a moment of panic when a trunk load of fake krugerrands (cast for the film..) tipped down a storm drain. imagine frantic crew opening all the drains to recover every last one. if you know and love london you'll love this comedy romp - also starts richard jordan who sadly died from a brain tumour. a good film, great crew ,superb cast. look for the current stars of coronation street then playing crowd scenes or extras.the car lot and ivan's retail enterprises were all shot in west london, chiswick the entire shopping parade and the american used car lot were dressed overnight, the car lot is still there as are the shops. a restaurant was suddenly turned into a funeral parlour. if you see the film on the listings make an effort to see it! by the way sally harrison the bank receptionist was married to the production designer tony curtis..april 2007 just thought i would add a few extra comments on locations:pub: just off berkeley square elke sommers cottage: in back road alongide twickenham film studios ivans used car lot: along chiswick high street and all shop locations near roundabout. workshops (converting armoured vans)factory on roundabout opposite fullers brewery jail (see workshops above) telephone box see elke sommers cottage ( it was the wooden studio prop box used in many films, look for the lighting cable at gound level and the wood hinges on the door!!! computer room honeywells near olympia graveyard - chiswick - grave just outside the boundary on common land bank interiors, ceiling void and strongroom :twickenham studiosand just to add david niven ever the gentleman, joked and mixed with the crew, extras and so on......niven would dine in the connaught hotel bu join the crew for coffee!

i recently bought this movie on dvd at a discount store for $5. although it is a no-frills dvd on the geneon label (just the movie that starts playing immediately - no menu, no special features) the picture and sound quality were excellent. the movie is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank robberies in history.richard jordan, who i must admit to not having heard of, plays the lead - pinky green. a charming young man who had spent too much of his few years in prison and now wanted to go straight but is not allowed to do so! he portrays an american in england. david niven plays the lead bad guy, also with the great charm for which he is famous. bad, but with scruples as when he refuses to deny pinky his "whack" for the job. whack, in england, apparently is the fair share of the take and not a bullet in the head as in american gangster films! all the supporting cast do an excellent job producing a very believable movie.what is perhaps best, to me, is that the whole movie is quite enjoyable and understandable (i frequently find myself lost in plot confusions and various characters) without any special effects. no blood. no violence. not even a single car chase! just a well written story, well acted, well directed and well photographed! if i had any complaints about the movie, i would question the music. what is bluegrass music doing in a bank heist story that takes place in england?

this movie is an almost forgotten gem from 1979 which although in essence a comedy it was based on one of the uk's biggest ever bank heists. in fact one of the titles that this film is known by includes "caper" therefore that in its self is an indication of the type of movie. a of a bunch of lovable rouges, who are not the violent or psychotic types, who with cheek an guile pull off the biggest job of their lives. to be honest i don't really know too much about the real crime and can't comment if it accurately depicted the events that unfolded or the characters involved.richard jordan handles himself very well playing pinky green and is very believable as an easy going small time american born crook who seems very comfortable with himself. i have to add that sometimes american actors struggle gel well with english actors in a british made film, the chemistry is not always there, however this is no problem for jordon who fits right in with his role.it's worth pointing out that jordan himself was probably one of the most underrated actors of the 70's and 80's and never really got the recognition he deserved. he seemed to get stuck in supporting roles and b movies, not a fair representation of his acting ability. he has played a corrupt cop in the friends of eddy coyle, a sadistic killer in the mean season. in the secret of my success he played a sort of comical gordon gehco character and also in the 1980's equalizer tv show he played a good guy. all of this displays the versatility of his acting skills while mixing with the likes of david niven, kurt russell, edward woodward and robert mitcham.in this movie he effortlessly plays his part as a small time crook with the eye for the ladies and you immediately take to his character and root for him from the beginning. you can't help liking green,   you see he really did want to go straight but once blackmailed it all seemed too much of an opportunity to pass up and in the end he relished the thought of all that money.david niven is the boss and calls the shots, the police inspector was brilliantly played by richard johnson who typically portrayed a smarmy but thorough london detective who clearly loves his job. the other supporting cast don't say too much but looking at them they were all very well known british character actors who often found themselves playing either villains or coppers(isn't that ironic). elkie sommers, oliver tobias do what they have to do and it's good to see gloria graham in a cameo role.to some viewers particularly americans it would seem ludicrous that somebody with greens record could land a maintenance job at of all things a bank and come and go when he pleases. in addition the stunt he pulled at the crown court after sentencing was not as far fetched as it might seem, back in the 1960's and 70's security was not as nearly as tight as it is now.as for the movie itself there are a couple of interesting observations. with small time crooks the haul here was too much. there have been other movies where this occurs too i.e. the brinks mat. it's not just the disposal or the hiding of the loot but with so many people involved somebody is going to be careless, is going to blab or just simply break once leaned on. in addition the authorities come down on very hard on local rouges when such huge robbery is carried out. also, they say there is no honor amongst thieves but ivan was adamant that pinky got his whack. you only had too look at his stare in the dock, if looks could kill, a look of total betrayal! how could he have dobbed them all in after taking care of him? you have to ask yourself a question why is it that crooks can be so stupid? did green really think that he could sweet talk his way out of suspicion a second time around? inspector watford was not at all fooled by his innocent looking face as well as a well constructed alibi, the whole caper reeked of inside job. in addition you have to wonder why they leave so many clues? a note pad with the safe numbers jotted down, travel brochures for overseas trips, still leaving his telescope around as well as unusual behavior on the day of the robbery which was out of character.with some decent but common sense police work insp watford quickly had the measure of green, picked him up and soon had him singing like a canary. it just shows how despite well thought out planning things can unravel very quickly, there is never a clean getaway for every body, some are always going to get nabbed. although it's worth pointing out that a lot of the money was never recovered.all in all an entertaining movie, interesting shots of london and england in the late 70's, well paced, with a great ending. i would highly recommend this particularly if you enjoy capers. ( note: i recently purchased a dvd of this but the transfer was obviously taken from a vhs tape and is of poor quality. therefore do not pay too much for it!)

i have seen this movie about 4 times and every time i am impressed with the second camera assistant's work. seems trivial but there is something very professional, knowledgeable and talented there. the movie as a whole suffers from other problems, as stated by other comments. the significance so the issues being approached are as relevant today as it was 40 years ago. the acting is a bit strained but the work of the second camera assistant is stellar! this person needs to get back into the business - perhaps directing? what is this person waiting for? i will be watching and waiting and cheering from the sidelines!- bob

please why not put this fantastic film on dvd,i have been searching just like the previous writer for years, whats the hold up, or show it on tv. its so underestimated its one of the most romantic and beautifully written books i have ever read, and believe i have read some.i seem to think it was read on radio 4, but i can't find that either. why not try and remake it even, i promise it will be top earner, people love those sorts of stories, so please either release it and take us out of our misery or remake it,although i doubt if it could be improved upon. has any one read gone to earth by the same author or seen the film with jennifer jones, this is superb, but not to the same extent may be.

superbly adapted to the screen and extremely faithful to mary webb's period novel, this film is a true masterpiece. aside from the exceptionally talented rising star, janet mcteer as the lead and one or two established actors, the film used mostly little known names. yet the drama was all the more convincing for that. the social and personal tension is almost tangible and i felt as if the cast were reacting each other's character as though they would have done in real life. i saw that one commentator asked if janet mcteer really had a hare-lip, a testimony to just how good was her characterisation. i saw this on tv when it was first shown, taped it, then later the tape was sadly lost. but it remains clear as anything in my mind. if you have any fondness at all for the social period, it's an absolute must see.

i'm so happy i recorded this on vhs tape when it was featured on master piece theatre. this is a movie i can watch again and again. like living in the early 1800's in england isn't hard enough, prue is born with a "hare lip" and is outcast from birth. the people in her village accept her somewhat but always fear that she is "from the devil's smithy" and are quick to turn on her. especially when a lot of bad luck befalls her family. she is strong and courageous but shies away from kester woodseaves, a traveling weaver who catches her eye. partly because she fears rejection and also because she thinks he is so virile that he should have a wife who is as lovely as a lily. kester is a modern man who does not believe in the superstitions of the time and he speaks his mind and follows his heart. the movie stays true to the original story by mary webb and is riveting from beginning to end.

when this was first aired on masterpiece theatre, it had a profound effect on me. it's beautifully filmed and acted. i immediately read the book by mary webb, and it remains one of my all time favorites. janet mcteer is wonderful as prue, and i fully expected her to become a regular on the british drama scene. i guess she chose to focus on the british stage instead. i was hoping that with the american success of janet mcteer years later(with tumbleweeds) this film would again become available to us. alas, it has not yet been released on dvd. if anyone out there is listening, please make this available again!

this is a charming movie starring everyone's favorite cartoon chipmunks. in this feature we follow the band of rodents on an unforgettable balloon race around the world. although there are lows, including an orphan penguin, all in all it's a great family film.

plot in a nutshell: dave seville, father figure & manager of the chipmunk brothers alvin, simon & theodore, has gone off to europe on a business trip, leaving the boys at home with miss miller as their watcher, much to the chagrin of alvin, who wanted to go to europe. while playing against his female counterpart, brittany, the leader of the chipettes, comprised of her younger sisters jeanette (the female counterpart of simon) and eleanor (the female counterpart of theodore) in a fierce arcade game of around the world in 30 days, they catch the attention of two evil foreign siblings who need to smuggle money & diamonds around the world, but need a way to do it that won't draw the attention of their arch enemy, jamal. the 2 evil siblings, claudia & klaus, overhear the banter between alvin & brittany and decide to use them as the delivery boys & girls for their loot (more claudia's idea than klaus's, the latter initially objects feeling that it's too dangerous for children). the 2 siblings make an offer to the boys & girls - travel via air balloons to 12 drop off points to leave dolls (which resemble the kids) that contain diamonds and/or money to indicate their arrival, with the promise that whoever wins the race will get an obscene amount of money. but as the two different set of talking animal siblings make their rounds, they are stalked by the henchmen of jamal - but who is jamal? is he friend or foe? overall: enjoyable, lighthearted farce based on the 1980s tv series version of alvin & the chipmunks. beautiful animation is a highlight, lacks the crude humor that keeps creeping into today's family films and engaging songs (boys & girls of rock & roll being a stand out). eagle eyed fans will probably notice that brittany's character design has been tweaked from the animated series, giving her a less round face while adding a seemingly permanent blush to cheeks (which jeanette & eleanor also display).keep an ear out for nancy cartwright, the voice of bart simpson.

i was -unlike most of the reviewers- not born in the 80's. i was born on may 14th 1994. despite this, my life was very much in the style of the 80's. when other kids had playstations, i was playing zelda on my nes etc. now, this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review. i, because of my 80's style early childhood, watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didn't see, and this movie was one of those, and one of the greatest too.it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville, simon seville, theodore seville and david seville. david, the chipmunk's adoptive father, is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe. his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack. while they are talking, alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world (even though, technically dave is only going to europe, so to alvin, apparently only america and europe qualify as ''the world''). david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller, much to the displeasure of the boys. soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller. later, at a local café the chipmunks are playing a game of ''around the world in 30 days'' against the chipettes(brittany, jeanette and eleanore). after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile, alvin get's in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world. two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and, needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world, decide to fool the children into delivering them for them. they set up a race around the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness (secretely filled with diamonds) at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team's likeness (secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds) to ''varify that they were there''. the winning team would then receive a 100.000 dollar reward. they do this because they believe that jamal (an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (however, this seems to be redundant, because on their travels, the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls, i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally.) and so begins a great adventure. this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it. it features great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention the kick-ass music (pardon my french :p). my favorite song is without a shred of doubt ''the girls and boys of rock and roll'' an amazing rock song that cannot be topped. it's also my favorite moment in the film. other notable songs include ''getting lucky''(kind of suggestive for a kid's film eh?) and ''my mother'' as well as ''wooly bully'' and ''off to see the world'' not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra. the scene with ''my mother'' still brings a tear to my eye. in relation to the song ''getting lucky'' i first didn't think anything of it, but when i grew older and learned about life, it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive. that song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties. this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian prince's men, when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film, it's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. anyway, a bit after that scene, the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home. the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband, ross bagdasarian jr. know the characters better than anyone. they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes. ross doing the voices for alvin and simon (as well as dave) and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore. speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses, nancy cartwright (the voice of bart simpson) makes an appearance in this movie. she plays the part of the arabian prince, a very small, but important role. the ending is of course, a happy one. the crooks have been caught, the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children, dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset, alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100.000 dollar reward for winning the race, which annoys dave until he finally yells ''alvin!'' and the screen fades to blackclassic ending, by the way. i hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven't seen this flick, give it a watch, it's worth the money. this nostalgic classic from the 80's gets a solid 10 out of 10. ''headin' for the top, don't you know! we never stop believing now''

the feature length cgi movie has just been released this year, but whilst it will provide kids a lot of entertainment, for die-hard alvin fanatics and followers who grew up with the 60s and 80s versions of the cartoon shows, the chipmunk adventure is probably the best alvin and the chipmunks based animated movie, ever.for starters, the animation is as ever terrific, the character designs are as they should be in the cartoons- unlike the motion picture film itself, it is just sheer fun to watch. there are no celeb voices, no cgi generated effects, just pure quality 2-d, hand drawn animation and the colours are fantastic- bright, bold and beautiful. the jokes and humour is typical chipmunk standard and the narrative is spot-on. in truth, the chipmunk adventure is everything the live action movie ought to have been, but isn't. alvin, simon and theodore compete with the chipettes, elenor, jeanette and britney in a hot air balloon contest and along the way, the kids encounter all manner of problems and dilemmas that they have to resolve in their own way. and no chipmunk movie is complete without the odd renditions of classic rock and pop anthems.the chipmunk adventure is for kids and adults alike-, which is another advantage over the cgi movie- as whereas, the 2007 version will gain a few new admirers, the 1987 movie will appeal to both young and older chipmunk fans. bagdarasian and karman provide the helium-like voices of the film's trio.overall, this film is a must for fans of the cartoon shows themselves- you will not be left disappointed. if you have seen the live action version, then you'll feel that this movie is a much better effort in contrast. if you haven't then you should go and see it still, or even still forget the jason lee movie and as an alternative, stick with this

if your a child of the 80's and have not seen this movie you have failed to be a true child of the 80's. how can you not love those great chipmunks (don't forget about the chippettes), lines, and songs. years later i can still sing every word to every song. the story line is great and much better then the films for kids today. it's just pure fun and worth the rent, even if your all grown up.

i have been an avid chipmunk fan since the late 70's - early 80's. when this movie came out, it was a must to see it. and after seeing it, i went right over and bought it! the movie is great, i love the animated action it brings, and the music is great (yes, i bought the soundtrack on cd...) a recommended video for everyone to watch and enjoy!

this movie is a classic. kids now will love it, and people like me, who were kids when it first came out, still watch it for its nostalgic value as well as for its humor and great story. it introduces kids to different cultures and inspires them to adventure. it's not just a cartoon, it's a masterpiece. i love it.

i think it is great one of my favourite films as a kid and who said there songs were unforgettable they were mint i can still remember them now word for word the film remains a favourite with my family and my younger cousins are now addicted to it too they even know the songs this film is great and a enjoyable film for kids it has a moral lesson so don't say its not good because it shows how lying gets you nowhere ill leave with a parting comment: this film is amazing love me xxx p.s i would like the soundtrack but i cant and yes the animation is good the jokes are humorous and the action never stops.this film will go down in children's film history and in my opinion one of the only remaining safe films to show children.

i loved this movie and i never knew it was this old it came out the day n year i was born in and now i am 19 now i still love this movie especially the songs like "my mother" and "boys and girls of rock n roll" and i remember as a kid i believe i was 5 n my sister was 6 and my cousin (boy) was 6 as well we used to pretend to be the characters in the movie i was eloner and janette and my sister was britany and my cousin was alvin simon and theodore those were good times and i miss it and having this movie reminds me of the good times since my cousin is old for this stuff and so am i and my sis we are not going to forget about the chipmunk and the chipmunk movie i still even remember the songs and the words off by heart even though i haven't seen this movie for 12 years but now starting to love it again alvin and the chipmunks and chipettes <3<3<3<3

this was one of the best movies you could find as a child. i lived with the chipmunk adventure from 4 years old to 8 years old. the story of this film was: dave's going on a business trip to europe and sticks the boys with miss miller. while playing an around the world in 80 days video game, two villains, klaus and claudia (brother and sister), round the chipmunks and chipettes into an adventure in which the kids must hot-air-balloon their way across the globe. what they're unaware of is that the "game" is really a diamond-smuggling ring. and when found at the airport by the villains, a chase ensues! and which ends in klaus and claudia off to jail and alvin, simon, theodore, brittany, jeanette, and eleanor safe with dave and miss miller. but i am warning you now, this is a musical and quite a damn good one at that. most people hate musicals, but i am not one of those people, i frigging love musicals like rocky horror, grease, sound of music, cats don't dance, and just about anything (except for my fair lady). if you see this, share with your kids (if you got any)!

when i first saw this movie i was only a little kid and i fell in love with it, they really don't make movies like this anymore,i just watch this again now slightly older and still love it. the humour is perfect and fits into the movie really well, all the gags are kind of childish but will make adults laugh as well,and in a kids movie is really very rare. the animation is amazing and to watch hand-drawn animation is a real breath of fresh air to all the computer animation we see today. the backgrounds are stunning and the coloring is amazing.the characters are just the kind of characters that you fall in love with the moment you start watching girls will think the chipmunks are adorable and guys will think the chipettes are really kinda sexy.the songs are fun to listen too and some just really make you wanna cry or get up and dance, its also fun to watch visual humor to go along with them. the voice acting is great no doubt even if most of the voice acting is high pitch, but an interesting thing popped up and it one of the songs from this movie but the slowed down to show the real voices behind them and its really kinda fun to watch. if you see this movie in a store or somewhere to rent i say check it out it's really worth seeing and is a perfect family movie its absolutely amazing, words can not express this movie.

awwww, i just love this movie to bits. me and my cousins enjoy this movie a lot and i am just such a huge fan!!! i hope they bring the tv series out on dvd soon. come to mention it, i have not see the tv show in a long time. such geart times! where i come from australia the chipmunk adventure is only known by people in their late teens and adult years which is kinda sad because the young kids don't know what there missing.the songs in this film are ace the ones i love the most boys/girls of rock n'roll, diamond dolls and the song that ls sure to make you want to cry my mother.this film is sure to excite both young and old get the chipmunk adventure today!!! 10 out of 10, such an excellent movie.

"the chipmunk adventure" is one of the greatest animated movies of the 1980's. alvin and the chipmunks have always been of some interest to me, since they were what really got me into rock and roll. neither one of the chipmunks has any bad traits. alvin's really the star and has all the cool looks. theodore is the lovable sensitive one. then there's simon (my personal favorite), the smart one who is often a party pooper. i also like the chipettes a lot. there's brittany, who, like alvin, is one who is always trying to be so popular. then there's eleanor, who, like theodore, is sweet, sensitive, and loves food. janette is the only chipette who is not much like her counterpart; she's very naive and really clumsy.in the chipmunks' very first full-length movie, david seville is going on a business trip to europe, and he's leaving the boys with miss miller while he's gone. while playing an arcade game, alvin loses against brittany and then says that if he had the money, he'd race brittany around the world for real. unbeknownest to the kids, a man named klaus furschtien and his sister, claudia, who have been trying to come up with a sneaky way to deliver diamonds around the world in exchange for cash, overheard this conversation and said that they'd let them race around the world for $100,000. alvin and brittany accept it and go on the race.this adventurous movie has a lot of great songs. "off to see the world" made for an appropriate theme song for the movie. then there is "getting lucky", one of my favorite songs in the movie. "my mother" is most likely the sappiest song in the movie, but it always makes me cry. "wooly bully" is the only cover song used in the movie (the rest were completely original). then, of course, there's "the boys and girls of rock and roll", which, in my opinion, has to be one of the greatest musical numbers in movie history.i used to watch this movie very often, until my recorded tape of it died. i still watch the movie, though. this is actually a fun movie for people who are about to go on a vacation to a foreign country for the first time. it'll give you an idea of what kind of stuff you'd expect out of world travel. definitely one of my childhood movies, and one that i'd recommend to 80's fans and alvin & the chipmunks fans.

although it is more of a kids movie, it still holds its own, especially when compared to the more recent assembly line animated films being made. the music is fantastic!! i don't care how old you are, you will still find yourself rockin to "girls of rock and roll" and diamond dolls." definatly a must for animation lovers.

i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other. i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago. this movie contained an all-star cast, and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before. this movie was kind of long in length, but i enjoyed every minute of it. it is a movie that you can sit down with your family and watch, though we would have to cover the kids eyes a few times due to the discretionary love scenes. overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale. lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.

the family happiness is crumbling when, the from the beginning rich father ward (michael ontkean), gets poor and cannot support the family any longer. then the mother faye (jaclyn smith) has to take the role as the breadwinner in the family and starts to work in order to support the family and at the same time, periodically alone, has to manage the family life. not always that good, but as good as she can. the family life hardly gets easier when the father learns that the son lionel (joe flanigan "stargate atlantis") is gay and is living together with his lover john (joel gretsch "the 4400") also an old family friend, resulting in that the father makes clear to lionel that he is no longer welcome in the family. lionel is the one who meant the most to his sister anne (leslie horan) during her up-bringing, since the family neglected her. anne cannot stand the fact that their father have cut the cords with lionel and therefore she run away from home. as this wasn't enough, the son greg (brian krause "charmed") enlists in the marines and is sent to war. the storyline in this film can on some occasions feel a bit thin, in spite of that it still has a lot of realism in it, which makes it well worth seeing. since this film illustrates many sensitive relations and situations, i would believe that it is best appreciated by a mature audience even though it wouldn't hurt for teenagers to see it and get something to think about before adulthood.

once a year in america, saturday morning would give way to new cartoons, usually sometime in america. just about the time school started.i guess this was to make not having school on saturdays that more bearable.one friday night before the premiere of the new saturday morning cartoons, a movie came on."at the earth's core" i had not a clue who cushing nor mcclure were. clearly they were not from the same country, so i couldn't grasp why they were traveling together.i do recall seeing the mechanism in the fire-breathing monster's mouth.what connects this movie for me is the opening with the molten metal and then suddenly we get the band playing as we see the factory.how do you end a movie like this? the music again, and two bewlidered cops as the drill appears behind them.whatever reason, i remember watching this movie more that friday night than i do any new cartoon that came on the following morning.that was definitely the late seventies.it would be during jurassic park mania, cicra '93, i believe, before i would see this movie again.yes, people in costumes. there was the fire-breather again.still loved the ending with the two cops.finally, it would be nearly another decade before i would send off for the movie on dvd.now i would just watch the beginning and intro.oh, i do love much of the movie. of all these sci fi jules verne, hg wells, erb movies, this one stands as my fave.what i note now is that one of the cops begins turning around a wee bit too soon, then turns back, then he and the other cop are synchronized as they turn inward once again to look behind themselves at the drill.perhaps for me, this movie stands as the best of the saturday morning shows, which is why i enjoy it so much.

i'm serious as well, i mean don't get me wrong, if you haven't got a bent for this type of z grade, creaky creature feature {why would you be watching is my first thought?} then it's a rating of about 3 to 4 out of 10 tops, but to me it's a special kind of nonsense that takes me back to a nice time in my childhood. you know the kind, the memories that never leave you. eagerly taking it all in with youthful wonderment as doug mcclure and peter cushing tunnel beneath the mantle to do battle with a host of creatures and sub-human species'. and guys,! now we are all grown up we can admire most seriously at the wonder of caroline munro and her heaving cleavage. no wonder my older brother was keen to take me to the cinema to see this one!.yes the effects are bad, men in suits, strings pinging parrot monsters around and exploding rubber frog like thingies amuse us greatly. and yes, cushing and a surprisingly pudgy mcclure act as if they have truly been mesmerised by the evil meyhas at the "core" of our film. but it matters not, zany and clunky and awash in glorious colour, at the earth's core is a throwback to a special pre-ilm time when kids like me queued around the block to see such joyous nonsense. 8/10

rugged david innes (solid doug mcclure) and doddery dr. abner perry (a delightfully dotty peter cushing) drill their way into the earth's core in their spiffy mole machine. the duo discover an ancient prehistoric world populated by dangerous gigantic beasts and human beings who are used as both food and slaves by evil telepathic pterodactyl men. director kevin conner, working from a blithely silly script by milton subotsky, maintains a constant brisk pace throughout and treats the exceptionally foolish premise with astonishing seriousness, thereby giving this picture a certain clunkily earnest quality that's amusing and endearing in equal measure. the lovably hokey (not so) special effects are quite (unintentionally) funny. the cheesy array of cut-price creatures in particular are positively sidesplitting: cruddy guys-in-obvious-shoddy-rubber-suits pterodactyl men, equally rinky-dink savage ape-man brutes, and a hilariously ludicrous fire-belching frog thing who blows up real good. one gut-busting highlight occurs when mcclure mixes it up with a fat and clumsy giant reptile. another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur clutching a doll in its slavering jaws. moreover, we also get some rousing rough'n'ready fisticuffs and an exciting climactic slave revolt. it's a total treat to see cushing gleefully ham it up in a rare broad comedic part and become an unlikely, but enthusiastic arrow-slinging action hero in the last third of the flick. the ever-luscious caroline munro looks positively yummy as the fetching princess dia, plus there are nice supporting turns by cy grant as gallant warrior ra and sean lynch as treacherous coward hoojah. mike vickers' neatly varied score alternates between jaunty orchestral music and wonky droning synthesizer stuff. alan hume's crisp cinematography adds a glossy sheen to the infectiously inane proceedings. a complete campy riot.

first of all, nothing will ever compare to the original movie, but for gosh sakes, they're not trying to. it is just one persons opinion about what could have happened after rhett left scarlett at tara. i for one thought it was a terrific movie and would like to add it to my gwtw collection. the scenery alone would make me want to watch the movie. just view this movie as an extension of the original and don't think they are trying to replace vivian leigh and clark cable and you will enjoy it a lot. they really captured the spoiled selfishness of scarlett in many of the scenes and you can see from the longing in the looks from rhett that he is clearly still in love with scarlett. the fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the movie is another plus even though some of them have only been seen on tv. i always wanted them to have other children after bonnie blue died in the movie and this satisfied my need perfectly. lore60

 it's common knowledge and has been said before: no one can ever play scarlett and rhett like vivien leigh and clark gable. joanne whalley kilmer (no longer kilmer having been divorced from ex-hubby val kilmer) plays her own scarlett and although this is a sequel and not a re-make (god-forbid!!!) she still cannot rise to the occasion (i.e. her voice sounds evil on several occasions, she's got brown eyes [scarlett in both novels had green eyes and even vivien leigh's eyes were green] and her vocal power was not up to the job either. scarlett is a southern belle; therefore she has an incredible talent for flirting (as she did in scarlett the novel and gwtw, of course) and to be a great flirt like scarlett is, you would most likely need a higher-pitched voice, like vivien leigh. i suppose i'm comparing kilmer to leigh a bit too much but when someone possesses a role so masterfully as leigh did with scarlett you simply can't help but to criticize any new prospective scarletts. timothy dalton should have had no accent whatsoever, due to the fact that both margaret mitchell's rhett and gable in the film had none. his acting has never been truly noteworthy (except, maybe his portrayal of the evil, conniving king phillip of france in the lion in winter) and he gives very little (if any) freshness or vitality to his rhett.  standouts in the cast are most notably tina kellagher (a born actress with plenty of authenticity in her deliverance) as the tragic victim mary boyle. and then of course there's sean bean as the cold, calculating and not to mention, almost demonically evil lord fenton, mary's nemesis and scarlett's eventual violator. one thing i could not forgive the writer for was the fact that scarlett is raped in this movie (a fact that never occurred in the novel; lord fenton is cold and of ill-repute among the irish in the book but he's nowhere near as heartless as his screen counterpart. another omission from the novel but readded for the film is the character of belle watling, played most horribly by ann-margret in a cameo role, which we all could have lived without, seeing as how the book was such a run-away bestseller without requiring any assistance from ms. watling. for a film by itself, scarlett is a very good one but not quite in that lofty of a place in terms of being gone with the winds sequel. another actress was highly necessary for scarlett as well as rhett.

i've always loved "gone with the wind" and have seen it numerous times. however, its ending left me not only "hanging," but depressed, with a hopeless feeling. finally, in "scarlett," ripley took us to a very plausible and satisfying end ("beginning") of the original story.it follows that someone of scarlett's obvious intelligence (as originally written) would eventually grow up. although, like most people, i fell in love with scarlett in gwtw, i tired of her constant insipid infantiilism to the point of exasperation, and i was disappointed that mitchell did not show scarlett using that obvious intelligence to even make an attempt to grow emotionally. thankfully, someone finally did. (after all, isn't that nagging immaturity that conflicted with her beauty and intelligence the very reason rhett finally gave up on her in the first place?) i think ripley did an excellent job of describing that long-overdue process, and whalley-kilmer did a superb job of portraying it. joanne w-k has all the fire, exuberance and intelligent sparkle as did vivian leigh, and she is certainly at least as, if not more, beautiful.there was, is, and always will be only one clark gable. however, if i had to pick an actor out of the thousands to which i've been exposed to portray him in his biography, it would definitely be timothy dalton. dalton possesses the same elegant charm that gable did, which is essential for rhett's character. i can't imagine anyone else who could come close.in my opinion, both joanne whalley-kilmer and timothy dalton were superbly cast and the only actors who could have possibly played scarlett and rhett. i think both their performances did justice to not only the late actors but also the spirit of their characters.i enjoyed the whole cast. julie harris was her usual delightful presence, and jean smart was an adorable kick! even ashley's character was nicely played by stephen collins, and the progression of his relationship with scarlett was totally believable.the story became a little convoluted in ireland, but so is life, after all, and i still found it entertaining.all in all, i thoroughly enjoyed the fruits of ripley's imagination. i wish i'd written it!

i didn't read the book "scarlett" and when i watched this mini series i enjoyed it very much and thought it didn't need to be compared to gwtw. the story may differ from the book, but who cares its a movie. even in the credits its based on the book, its not the book. the film is clearly under appreciated with the reviews that other people write but can't even spell the main characters names right. the acting in scarlett i thought was superb. joanne whalley and timothy dalton were excellent. they took the characters and gave them there touch. now as far as other people go by, they compare them to the great vivian leigh and clark gable. they obviously did fantastic, but the leads in this film are completely different people who have there own acting methods and shouldn't be pressured of what people have to say. if you wanted certain actors to do well then you should have directed the film, i'm sure that other actors would not do as well as these with the chemistry and cleverness they brought to these roles. the supporting cast stood out with there grandness, and jean smart steals the scenes that shes in with her comedy genius. the locations in the film were very beautiful and it was just grand to see scarlett go to all those places in the film as she causes trouble and other things. also the scene in which scarlett talks to her dad's grave it was very dramatic and i thought from then on that there were two great actresses who brought scarlett o'hara to life. not just vivian leigh but also joanne whalley.the film and the book may differ, but you must not take to heart that this is a sequel to one of the best films ever made otherwise you will think that this has to be like gone with the wind and you will not like this film. but this is an under rated classic that is unlike gwtw, its its own movie. also keep in mind that "tomorrow is another day"...

following on directly from the last episode of the previous series yes minister.jim hacker now finds himself inside number 10 downing street as prime minister of great britain, instead of a cabinet minister and a member of the government, he is now leading her majesty's government.all this after some scheming maneuvers by sir humphrey appleby after the previous prime minister resigned at the end of yes minister. sir humphrey appleby is now the head of the civil service.i thought that this series was better than the first series, or though it did not last as long as the first series unfortunately.

james hacker mp didn't expect that he would be the next prime minister. unlike in america, the party is elected in britain while we, americans, vote for candidates regardless of their party. despite the differences, paul eddington cbe's performance as minister turned prime minister almost overnight is helped by his senior adviser, sir humphrey, played by another knight, sir nigel hawthorne, and veteran actor derek fowlds also returns to the scene as well. now instead of pleasing some people, he has to please the nation rather than his constituency. now, he has a hard job to do even more difficult than before. now, he must approve the honors list and work with her majesty as well on a regular basis. hacker is not the hacking type. he is rather than the every man who we like and don't want to dislike and turn into a villain of sorts or a vicious dictator. now, we see the prime minister's point of view and all the pleasing that must go on as well as handle strikes.

hadnt heard a lot about this movie, except it being national award and oscar entry. its a marathi movie, n i cant make out apple from orange in marathi. but when i saw the movie playing on dd1 late sunday night, i just got glued. now i am no judge of cinematic techniques and acting skills. but i have watched a good number of movies, of various genres, and for an average viewer, i will highly recommend this movie. the feel is very earthy and realistic, though there are some melodramatic moments. watch it to feel human. lately haven't seen any movie, which touches heart, especially in hindi cinema. the crowning achievement of the movie is when the young kid returns home. the camera moves around to reveal the kid, wearing black glasses, having lost his eyes, the kid hears the other kids splashing in the water and starts clapping. i was awestruck. and the two hours i spent watching the movie - very much worth it :-)

it was very refreshing to watch this beautiful movie. the director maintained focus on the main subject without venturing into side plots (the doctor's family or stories of the other hospital patients), that are so typical of bollywood assembly-line products. he kept the narrative simple to comprehend and made sure all the actors are true to the characters that they are supposed to portray. the rustic ways of the grandfather in the clinic, the cold and unemotional behavior of the surgeon, the zeal of the social worker gave the movie a feel of genuineness. i am also glad that the director did not fall for the temptation of adding songs or special effects and reduce it to the level of anand or safar. a couple of scenes toward the end of the movie, such as the boy visiting other blind children and a blind worker's workplace and also the final scene where the boy claps at the sound of splashing and birds chirping are sure make your eyes misty.many bollywood players do not realize that oscar committee members value simplicity of the subject and genuineness and brevity of the movie more than the glitz and glamor. shwaas is certainly a better nomination than lagaan, which dealt with a subject that has already been beaten to death. no mpaa member is willingly going to suffer through 4 hours of jingoistic drama and a lot of song and dance.i look forward to more movies from director sandeep sawant in the future.

the fact that this film was shown at london's barbican suggests to me that the print must have been acceptable enough for such a showing. now the question is, why isn't this long lost and important film available in dvd (or even vhs)? a large number of persons in europe and the usa have for many years hoped to see this film, if for no other reason than the wonderful music written for it by sergei prokofiev. what does one have to do to get such a wonderful production as this available for a wider public, not just patrons to the barbican at london? having been a devoted listener to prokofiev's music for many years and aware of this film, please, someone 'out there' do the right thing and bring it out as a dvd.

there have been several books that have cited this as the earliest gay cinema. i don't really see this as all that gay in the homosexual sense but then seeing two men dancing in what has to be the worlds first movie musical does have its attraction. there have been several earlier comments about this film dismissing any homosexual overtones. as to those that are quick to dismiss this film as just being silly and an experiment done late at night after too many drinks... well i've heard that story before. this film is of interest as an oddity and if folks want to consider it the first gay film so be it. better this than the depressing 1919 anders als die andern.

this film is an eery, but interesting film. i will tell you why it is eery later in this review.the film is interesting because it was the first film to ever contain sound. no, it may not be a one hour and forty two minute film, no it may not contain great action scenes, but it is still a wonderful film to me. it sparked a whole knew revolution if you will, of sound movies. this can be a little eery to watch, knowing that everyone in that film are now dead, i can hear the voice of a man in the beginning who no longer walks the earth visible, and that the sound is cracky and broken.i recommend this video for everyone to watch. this created movies as we know it today!

this is a pretty interesting experiment to watch. it's the first ever, still existing attempt, to unite sight with sound. it features two men dancing to a violin player (possibly william k.l. dickson himself), who is standing next to an edison recording cylinder, that is capturing the sound.the sound and images were not linked together as one yet. and it wasn't until recently that the sound and image have been added technically together. it's probably the reason why people hesitate to call this movie the first ever sound picture.the movie is made by william k.l. dickson, a assistant to thomas edison himself who ordered him to come up with a way to unite pictures and sound. the answer he provided was the kinetophone, a kinetoscope (basicly a large wooden box with a peephole in it, so people could watch the moving images) with a cylinder phonograph inside of it, for the sound. this is the first, that we know off, surviving movie-experiments that feature this technique. all of the later movies using this same technique were shot as silent movies and sound effects were recorded later and separately. so the kinephone was not an attempt to synchronize sound and images but more an attempt to have images accompanied by sound. in some cases, people could even choose from three sound cylinders, featuring 3 different orchestral performances to accompany the images. only 45 kinetophones were ever made so you could hardly call the kinephone a success. also after this experiment, focus went off to other cinema techniques, mainly regarding movie-projectors.so the experiment itself obviously did not become a success, also since it took over 30 more years before the first movies with sound were made and commercially released. they just couldn't yet technically synchronize and put the sound and the images together yet at the time and even if they could and techniques would had been available, it would had been a very expensive job to do so. it therefor really isn't the most influential or historically important movies out of cinematic history but it's very interesting to watch, how people constantly tried to improve the quality and techniques of early cinema and movie-making.8/10

"empire strikes back" director irvin kershner's "never say never again," a remake of the 1965 james bond movie "thunderball," doesn't surpasses the terence young original, but this non-harry saltzman & albert r. broccoli film is well worth watching if you call yourself a 007 aficionado. nevertheless, despite its shortage of clever gadgets and the lack of a vibrant musical score, "never say never again" rates as an above-average, suspenseful doomsday thriller with top-flight performances by a seasoned cast including sean connery, kim basinger, klaus maria brandauer, max von sydow, barbara carrera, edward fox, bernie casey, alec mccowen, and rowan atkinson. the film bristles with surprises galore from the invigorating title credits sequence throughout its generally exciting but lengthy 134 minutes. unlike the franchise james bond sagas with their breath-taking moments of spectacle, "never say never again" provides few of these scenes because of its prohibitive budget. indeed, the film features only three gadgets: an explosive ball-point pen, a wristwatch with a laser, and a souped-up motorcycle. aside from the flavorful lani hall opening theme song, "ice station zebra" composer michel legrand's orchestral music score leaves much to be desired. legrand replicates none of those snappy, jazz cues that made john barry's music for the regular bond franchise so memorable. all in all, "never say never again" seems to fit more into the first two bond movies"dr. no" and "from russia with love"and "on her majesty's secret service" in terms of its more down to earth approach to the subject matter."never say never again" presents sean connery's james bond as an older 007 who has seen his day and has been taken off active service to teach. ironically, roger moore was a year older than connery and moore's bond movies treated 007 as an active, young guy. sean connery seems to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent and a number of changes take place in the lorenzo semple screenplay that emphasize bond's age. initially, connery had lobbied to play bond without a hairpiece, but mercifully wiser minds prevailed and connery sports a hairpiece. he looks tanned and fit and appears in better condition than he did twelve years earlier when he was rushed into "diamonds are forever" at the last moment to replace john gavin. connery had been working on another movie and had gained weight for the role that he was unable to remove in time for "diamonds are forever." at 52, connery still has a youthful vigor here despite the contrived demands of the script.the action unfolds with 007 single-handedly trying to rescue a kidnapped woman on a remote desert island. he dispatches several guards armed with machine guns and frees the woman, only to have her stab him with a knife in the side when he isn't looking. it seems that this entire sequence was an exercise designed by m (edward fox of "day of the jackal") to test bond's ability. the new m doesn't share his predecessor's use of field agents. m decides that bond needs to clean out his system of all 'free radicals' and has 007 packed off to shrublands. while at the country clinic, bond notices suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and gets noticed watching them. the nurse is none other than spectre assassin fatima blush (barbara carrera of "the island of dr. moreau") and she is in charge of making sure that nobody sees usaf officer jack petachi (gavan o'herlihy of "superman 3"). petachi is part of a spectre plan by millionaire businessman maximilian largo (klaus maria brandauer of "out of africa") to black the world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads. the villains implant a duplicate eyeball into captain petachi who has access to the highly sophisticated computers and can order the arming of weapons. after he steals the weapons for spectre, fatima blush runs him off the road by tossing her pet snake in his lap and then attaches an explosive to his wrecked car and blows him up. indeed, the first part of "never say never again," apart from the spectre planning conference, belong to fatima as she supervises petachi's stay at the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill bond, one at sea with sharks and later in a motel suite with an explosives device.eventually, bond meets the beautiful blond domino (kim basinger of "mother lode") and sneaks into largo's charity banquet at a monte carlo casino where the two face off in an elaborate video game called 'domination' to see who will rule the world. bond bests him and largo hates him doubly now because 007 is his only rival to domino and a thorn in his side that not even fatima seems to be able to remove. bond and fatima have it out after a motorcycle chase when he returns the favor and blows her up. their earlier encounter in the bahamas when she attached a device to lure a shark after him is pretty lame. like in the original "thunderball," the villains recover the hijacked nuclear warheads at sea, but just the warheads themselves.bond flies to the bahamas where he meets his diplomatic liaison, nigel small-fawcett (no lesser than rowan atkinson of "mr. bean" fame, who is worried that bond may kill somebody and ruin the island paradise. of course, nigel small-fawcett serves as the film's source of comic relief. the c.i.a. sends felix leiter (bernie casey of "guns of the magnificent seven") to back up bond. this is the first time that an african-american portrayed leiter. bond encounters his share of problems, involving saving domino from arab slavers, while leiter and he save the world. "never say never again" is a richly respectable james bond thriller with many neat touches, but it never generates the air of danger that the franchise bond films have. indeed, "never say never again" looks like a dignified masterpiece theatre take on 007.

yes, it's sean connery playing bond again, looking more alive and into his part than any time since the first time they made this film, in 1965 when it was called "thunderball". but the tongue is so firmly in cheek one wonders if connery isn't employing a few observed tricks from his friend and more humorous successor, roger moore.moore is my favorite bond, but connery makes a strong case for himself in this unusual outing. the only serious bond film not made under the aegis of the classic eon bond series, "never say never again" is an irreverent return to the well. soft on action, it's nevertheless strong on character and clever dialogue.bond, it's made clear right away, is a man in disfavor. no matter how many times he has saved the world, his new boss thinks little of his fat lifestyle. "too many free radicals, that's your problem...caused by eating too much red meat, white bread, too many martinis." "then i shall cut out the white bread, sir," bond smartly replies.an early fight sequence in a spa represents the movie's high point action-wise, with bond and an attacker fighting their way through a kitchen, a bedroom, and a laboratory before bond finally douses his opponent, ironically with no small help from those free radicals. humor is liberally applied in the film, rather more cleverly than most of moore's outings, though connery seems to be having more fun sending himself up as a result of moore's less egotistic example.was it because he was making a good chunk of the gross? or was it working for less stingy producers? whatever it is, the screenplay serves his laid-back style well, and the result is richer and more entertaining than connery's prior two eon bond outings, "you only live twice" and "diamonds are forever".the 1980s were not a good decade for bond, whether it was connery, moore, or timothy dalton. leg warmers, video games, and ugly sports cars are all in evidence, and the bianca jagger sunglasses klaus maria brandauer is seen wearing in his first scene do him no favors. forget first impressions. brandauer's role as the chief villain, maximilian largo, is one of the best in any bond film, with brandauer enjoyably playing up his character's menace and mania. at one point, he allows bond free roam of his situation room, with a martini to boot, and his dancing eyes and mad, engaging grin make for compelling company throughout.the best thing in this film, other than connery, are the bond girls, shot with more attention to personality than normal in bond films, a testament to cinematographer douglas slocombe and director irvin kirshner. barbara carrera was nominated for a golden globe for her role as the villainess fatima blush, every bit as crazy as largo and even nicer to look at. she doesn't last the whole movie; you almost need her gone in order to focus on the others.kim basinger's breasts and buttocks should have had their own agents for the screen time they get in this film, but i'm not complaining. basinger's a rare beauty who in this early role as largo's mistress mixes incredible hotitude with a childlike vulnerability that brings out the bond in me, and many others i suspect. (her lips and cheekbones are pretty sweet, too.)it's not a well-constructed film. it's a knockoff of a better bond movie with a sloppy storyline, a terrible score, and a flat ending. but it does have connery, proving his was the definitive take on cinema's definitive secret agent, even if he steals a page or two from my 007, mr. moore. the end result is entertaining enough, so i'm not complaining.

h.o.t.s. is one of those sexy 70's drive in movies that features many of playboys famous playmates from the 70's like sexy tall blonde susan kiger,pamela jean bryant,lisa london,kc winkler and the late sexy angela ames.and would you believe a post partridge family danny bonaduce?its the snobby girls verses the good girls(the hots girls)led by susan kiger.there's a couple of comedy relief gangsters,a runaway bear,a trained seal,misplaced bras,etc;etc;think animal house meets hooters.h.o.t.s. is an enjoyable little comedy with t& a no complaints here.i actually think that susan kiger was one of playboys sexiest playmates from the 70's.she did do a few more movies including deathscreams.if you like fun drive in movies you will no doubt enjoy h.o.t.s. 7 out of 10

h.o.t.s. is not for those that want hardcore porn. instead, this film is a precursor to many 80s era cult-classic college/frat films like revenge of the nerds and porky's and a post-cursor to the world-renown animal house. a good time if you dig a lot of big-titted 70s/80s playboy type chicks and cheezy slap-dick comedy - but nothing too notable if you wanna use it as whack-material...h.o.t.s. is an "unauthorized" sorority of sexy outcasts doing battle against the popular and trendy pi girls. this one has pranks, an aunt jemima-ish house keeper, and even an over-heated robot that makes it relatively fun viewing if boobies are your "thing"...well...i like tits as much (or probably more...) as the next guy - but with all the sleazy sh!t that i've seen, i couldn't help but wish for a few hardcore scenes to make this one truly worthwhile. i knew it wouldn't happen, but i still wish that h.o.t.s. had a bit more sex and a bit less cheeze. not quite as notable as nerds, porky's, or animal house, but worth a look for fans of those types of films...7/10p.s... and i forgot - this one has consummate douche-rag danny bonaduce in probably the best role of his career outside of his "reality show"...

of course, going into it, one would expect it to be a typical, stupid t&a flick, and it is. but it really does have some fairly well thought out humorous moments. given the era in which it was made, and the obvious exploitation aspect, it is still one of the better b comedies of the time.while watching this movie, you will see quite obviously the inspiration for many of the scenes in "revenge of the nerds", and numerous other films of the same genre. most of the acting is horrible, and way over the top, but that's exactly what i expect in a movie like this. what it lacks in the way of acting ability, it more than makes up for with its camp value and complete disregard for anything of merit.the amazing thing about this movie, is that there was obviously some money that went into it. films like this made today just don't have the same style. if you can turn your brain off, and turn your sense of humor up for an hour and a half, you will enjoy this flick. i dare anyone to not find at least something in this movie that they think is funny, if not hilarious.

i agree that this film achieved its goals perfectly. i saw it on showtime late at night as a teenager, and again in college. i thought it was funny. and there are boobs everywhere! it seems like in the late 70s and 80s there were loads of this type of film made, from r-rated films like "porkys" to soft-core "au pair girls"; it's a shame they seem to have fallen by the wayside in terms of popularity. the thing that made hots great was that, like the previous two films, it's a hell of a lot of fun. hots is like a girl-power version of "animal house", with the girls forming a sorority of sorts and engaging in campus bedlam. on a side note, whoever designed the "hooters" girls outfits must certainly have seen this film.

i watched this film with my family over a long thanksgiving holiday weekend. i am thankful that someone insisted that we watch it, though i didn't pay much attention until the end of the film when a head shearing seems promised, but, alas, doesn't happen.on the other hand, i watched this movie some years later and loved its liveliness, absurdity, sparkle, and just plain fun. i think that the film has a female tone. women are not exploited in it even though i am sure that someone might think that the movie is pure exploitation. i think the movie plays with tropes of the period.i keep thinking someone ought to remake it. and flesh out some of the implications in the original.

it is very hard to come up with new information about jfk jr. and this fine movie had very little of it, but it was a joy to watch. the casting was very good and the script, while somewhat like a documentary, was also good. my only complaint was that it wasn't long enough. perhaps a two-part movie could have told us more about his "pre-george" days and his relationships with his mother, sister, and other relatives. some of the material in the book, "american son," by richard blow would have enhanced the movie a lot. wtbs should be applauded for producing such an entertaining movie.

i liked the movie but it should have been longer. the actors did a great job. portia de rossi is a fabulous actress and kristoffer polaha is a hottie. he didn't look like john at 100% but he did favor him from a distance. i look forward to seeing more of him on the big screen. he didn't have john's charisma, but he definitely has a charm about himself. he has beautiful eyes and a great smile. he reminds me of my boyfriend alot. ms. bissett was just too breathy for me. she should have that asthma checked out. im not going to comment on the darryl hannah character. my mom always said, "if ya can't say anything nice, then shut the hell up!" so that's what im gonna do.molly

while i thought this was a good film about jfk jr it was a little hard to follow the timeline. it jumped around quite a bit without ever mentioning what year they were in. otherwise not great acting, and not really a great film, but it was nice to learn a little more about who jfk jr was.

with what they had. john and carolyn were very private so the writers had to put together what they could. i really liked portia de rossi as carolyn, but jacqueline bisset's voice grated on my nerves. she should have used her regular voice. i would have preferred that the whole movie focus on john and carolyn instead of rehashing stuff we already know about john.

about 12 minutes into the song, in the scene where daryl hannah and jfk jr are first embracing, there is a really pretty song playing...what is that song?! and, who is it sung by? it's a song that sounds very romantic and it is a female singer, piano playing, etc. i have tried everything in the world to look up the music on google and on itunes, etc., but it just doesn't come up, not even on lyrics websites. so, if you hear it i would sure love to know enough about it so that i can try to either go get the cd with that song on it, or find it in itunes. i don't know if my email will pulblish, i am new at this...but i will be looking back here.

i grew up with the abbott and costello movies, a. because my dad grew up with them and both our last names are abbott so we owe the deo a bit of respect, i didnt realize the flack this movie and others of theres gets. it was a really clasic due, it was funny cause abbott and costello were always the same characters, but it was sooo funny, now what i like about jack and the beanstalk is that even though the love story is totally boring and that one song the prince sings, omg , awefull, but i like the angle they took on the love, story, the couple has to get married cause one kingdom is running out of money, they meet in the jail cell and fall in love becaue they both pretend not to be royal and they end up being the couple, so happy ending, i dont think that was the orginal version, if it was they should have cut it out of this movie, but i think it was orginal and i love it. but watching it sucks, lol, also when the movie really kicks in with the giant + abbott and costello it is sooooo funny. when the giant is beating jack into the door and jack is screaming "open the door, open the door" that stuff is really funny. and that once joke where jack starts screaming prince, prince and all those dogs jump him. kinda cheezy but really orginal. i wish they would have al least tried to remaster it, though i got that africa screams\jack and the beanstalk, and i dont mind the quality cause when i had it on tape it was bad quality also so whatever i guess. the begining is mildly funny the middle is really really funny, and the end is not funny in the least, but i am 19 years old and when a movie made in 52 makes me laugh this hard, it rocks, this movie is really funny. i love their style. also the chapters suck. also the part where jack is climbing the beanstalk and they are all singing a song about what a dipstick jack is and that he will be killed, thats pretty funny

the duo of abbott and costello lives on in this version of a story-time classic. in "jack and the beanstalk", there's everything to see, music, magic, and comedy rolled into one. costello play plays jack after he listens to the story being told by a young boy one time. we know jack was a poor boy who sells his cow "dolly" for 5 magic beans. well, he plants those 5 beans, and they were indeed, magic. he climbs to the sky, sees a big castle there, and he would sing a song, unknown he would encounter the giant(buddy baer). not only him, he would dance with the woman who was also a giant. she would clobber jack with her elbows during the dance. that was funny! you got the playing harp who knows how to put the giant as ease. the goose who lays golden eggs. and my favorite, the way jack gets rid of the giant. he gets the ax, and started chopping down on the beanstalk. another funny is where the ax got stuck during the chop, and the final celebration happens when the people dance around the imprint where the giant fell. a lot of fun, and fun for the whole family as well. very recommended! 5 stars!

for us, an abbott and costello movie is something you have to be in the mood for. i'm very happy i recorded this -- my wife remembered it from when she was young, but i had never seen it. the family wanted to watch something not too serious before bed and this was selected.our daughter has watched many of the old movies with us -- always complaining in the beginning, but most often coming around. she mostly ignored this in the beginning, preferring to check her email, but she started enjoying herself -- many times laughing out loud to the zaniness.it's wonderful to think you can have a fun evening with a 55yr old. the mono-colour introduction that blends into the full-colour fairy tale. it's a fun twist of a story that everyone is familiar with, that includes a little song and a little dance, along with everything you expect lou and bud to delivery.watch it with your children and have a very fun evening!

so i guess that bud and lou just liked to mess with classic stories (although they did have some interesting results). in this case, they're baby-sitting a bad boy, and lou tries to read him "jack and the beanstalk" but falls asleep and dreams that he's jack and bud's the butcher, and they climb the beanstalk to rescue the prince and princess from the giant (buddy baer).i think that my favorite scene was when lou was trying to make the giant an omelet, and...well, i'll let you see what happens. as this was an abbott and costello movie, they did have a few unnecessary songs, but other than that, it was pretty funny. for other interpretations of the classic story, "bewitched" and "gilligan's island" both had episodes portraying it.

i wanted to see this movie because i am a very huge abbott and costello fan, and when i saw it, i liked it.this movie is funny, not hysterical, but funny. i mean i laughed at a lot of the funny parts and i just plain enjoyed it.though it is not of the best of the perfect straight man and the perfect buffoon, you should see this if you really love abbott and costello.out of all of the abbott and costello movies that i have seen, i can't say i've seen one that i hated. this is decent, funny, and entertaining. abbott and costello at least made some pretty decent movies in their later years.all in all, i liked this movie, it is not one of their best ones, but i liked it.7/10

i was a huge fan of asterix comics when i was a kid and watched every one. i never heard about this movie when it was released but i watched it with my kids last night. i remembered the comic well enough to know that a lot was added to the story for the film. some of the changes i thought were a bit corny (like the nephew's 'modern' dancing, and the viking chief's daughter - almost everything about her), but i found most it amusing enough. most importantly, seeing the reactions as my kids watched it, confirmed that the film pleased its target audience. as a family film it works better than other asterix titles i've seen. many of the names that weren't in the book i found had the same appeal as ones that were. overall, an enjoyable family film, regardless of whether you're an asterix fan or not.

after another raid in an empty village, the chief of the vikings timandahaf misunderstands the explanation of his adviser cryptograf that "fear gives wings to the dwellers" and believes that fear actually makes the villagers fly. they decide to chase the champion of fear in gaul to learn how to fly and make them invincible warriors. meanwhile, the nephew of vitalstatistix, justforkix, is sent from parisium to the gaulish village to become a man and asterix and obelix are assigned to train the youngster. the stupid son of cryptograf, olaf, listens to a conversation of the coward justforkix with asterix and obelix and kidnaps him. while returning to the viking village, justforkix meets abba, the daughter of timandahaf, and they fall in love for each other. but the machiavellian and ambitious cryptograf plan to marry his son olaf with abba and become powerful. in the end, asterix realizes that it is not fear that gives wings, it is love.when i was a teenager, asterix was my favorite comic book and i read all the goscinny and uderzo stories. this feature film shows all the original elements and humor of the comics in a delicious and wonderful animation. the romance of justforkix and the gorgeous abba is delightful and the situations asterix and obelix get involved are hilarious. my vote is ten.title (brazil): "astérix e os vikings" ("astérix and the vikings")

having been a faithful asterix fan all of my life, i have to say that "asterix and the vikings" is probably the most well done of all the asterix films. its got some very funny jokes in it and the animation is superb. as many people have pointed out, it doesn't really follow the plot of the comic ("asterix and the normans") very closely, but in many ways that's just as well, because that book stands out in my mind as one which poked a great deal of fun at the culture of the sixties, and much of it is very dated today.what really rubbed me the wrong way, though, is how they incorporated a disney-style plot into the film which took much of the focus away from asterix and obelix. we have a misunderstood boy who doesn't fit in, justforkix. we have a tom-boy girl who doesn't fit in because she wants to be treated as equal to men, abba. they meet and fall in love, but their love is threatened because boy is ashamed to be totally honest with girl, but in the end their love wins out. this has been the plot of so many disney (and, be fair, other studios too) films that its not funny and the plot was old twenty years ago. i mean, they even gave justforkix a whimsical animal sidekick.not only did i find this derivative and clichéd, but it really detracted from the story and left me dissatisfied.i think that it speaks volumes about how superb the rest of the movie was that i still think very highly of it, despite the way the plot got hijacked.

wow! it's even better than i expected! the best animated astérix movie ever! and it feels so good to hear roger carel doing the voice of astérix again! i surely recommend it to everyone who likes the comic books of astérix! but i suggest that you go to see the french version, cause it surely is the best and you hear the original cast! did you know that roger carel has played astérix for nearly forty years? i think he did a marvelous job! and the song from céline dion at the end fits rally good to the end credits! the music is good, the drawings are good, the actors are wonderful... in a word: a masterpiece! go to see it! you will not regret this!

... but i laughed. a lot.i saw 'astérix et les vikings' at a public screening during the world cup. the sound was lousy, it was too bright to see the screen properly - but i still enjoyed myself immensely. the names of some of the characters had me rolling on the floor: smsix, abba, vikea... all not very witty, but in good astérix tradition. some very good jokes, but also some that not everybody seemed to get.the only thing i didn't like were the voices of astérix and obélix, in the german version at least. the voice actors are very well-known around here, which was the only reason they were casted, really. they don't fit the characters at all.all in all, a good way to spend some time (and if it's free, like in my case, all the better) and to have a couple of laughs. 8 out of 10.

attending this film was an excuse to escape the work i had to do for my classes but it turned out to be one of my best experiences here in france. the film makes quick work of building multidimensional characters and has an excellently smooth storyline. the characters really did have the voices you would expect reading the graphic novels and the artistic talent exceeded my expectations the music was catchy and the comedy toying and lighthearted, almost a flinstoneish inclusion of modern items in playful manners. the film was attention grabbing, cute and action packed at the same time. a wonderful tale spun expertly. i'll be showing it to my french students.

since the last horrid astérix film and the fact that we only get the swiss german version in cinemas, here, i went to watch it with quite a bit of trepidation... unfounded, as i was happy to discover ^____^the film is funny and modern, has good gags, a good animation, an amusing character interaction, a good voice cast (note: i can only speak for the swiss german one!) except for the viking chief's daughter abba (her name is great, despite the not very inspired voice actress)...i especially liked the character justforkix (goudurix in french, grautvornix in german. he's the young man who is supposed to be put in shape...). he's a very amusing portrayal of a mollycoddled, urban teenager; but he's very likable, despite the teenage mannerisms... xd the interaction between astérix & obélix and their young charge is fantastic and thoroughly entertaining.it shouldn't be compared to the old films, since this one is quite different... which surprisingly doesn't make it bad. on the contrary. when they tried to modernize the last film (twelve years ago), they completely blew it. this film, however, proved that it can be done just fine... ^-^i came out of the theater cheerful... always a good sign ^_~

like so many other reviewers on here, my memories of this show are universally warm. in fact, so fond are said cherished memories, that i recently purchased the dvd box set in order to revisit that happy and carefree period of childhood, whereby i used to sit utterly mesmerised, as i watched the ongoing quest of monkey, pigsy, sandy, tripitaka and later yu lung a horse/dragon/man (you'll really need to watch it to understand), when the much loved show initially aired on bbc 2 on friday evenings, as i recall.well, i'm pleased to say that even after all these years and now viewing this with adult i.e. more cynical(!) eyes, the show has lost none of its inimitable charm.simply wonderful entertainment, from the magical characters and their comical interactions with one another to the perhaps not so special effects (which actually serve to heighten the fun) and of course, not forgetting the hugely memorable opening title sequence from the first season, the passing of time has not in any way, shape or form diminished any of monkey's spellbinding charm.as monkey himself would probably say, 'oi! you there! go out and grab yourself some nostalgic fun.'

easily one of the best shows ever made, & it just gets better with age.for me , one of the chief reasons for this was the english adaptation done by david weir.a japanese friend of mine once told me that the show in it's original language was more whimsical & less flat-out hilarious that the version we all know.the fact that the show resonates so strongly for its non-japanese fans is , i think, largely because of mr weir's inspired efforts & some winning voice-over work.well done, sir!

in fact, the nature of the whole series is irrepressibly funny! but not always funny... there are moments of extreme poignance as the deeper aspects of human emotion are touched on. over and again, the series comments on the frailties of human nature and the life long, or in this case eternal, struggle to overcome them. monkey is both smart and stupid at the same time, his arrogance and reliance on his own martial skills lead him into trouble in almost every episode. pigsy is just plain gross. sandy has a philosophical turn of mind. he has many of the wittiest lines. the english translation is a delight. "ignorance can always be improved upon," drawls sandy in his laid-back manner, "but you can't do anything to help stupidity!" "who are you?" the group of travellers are asked. "we three kings of orient are," says monkey. this is not just for children, it is a magical romp for anyone who can suspend reality

monkey is surely one of the best shows to have ever been shown on tv. i remember when i was a kid, i'd go to my grandma's house every saturday morning and i'd turn on the tv so i could watch monkey. i loved it. it had kickass action scenes, cool special effects, a great story, a fantastic theme song that was guaranteed to never leave your head and hilarious dubbing. but it is kind of weird that it's set in china and the actors are japanese and filmed in japan, but that is no stop towards making this tv show lovable.monkey is about the adventures of three people: pigsy (toshiyuki nishida), sandy (shirô kishibe) and of course, the unforgettable and most lovable character, monkey (masaaki sakai) who travel from china to india to get a bunch of holy scrolls in order to save the world.monkey is great fun and it's magic.

first off, the alien saves a little black boy as well as a mexican, despite what the imdb plot summary suggests. this film is the fulfillment of the purest of male fantsies, interracial rape. the main character in this film is a george michaelesque dope, who doesn't understand primal human urges like drug abuse and murder. in fact, every time he uses violence to solve a problem he has an internal conflict that physically hinders him. what a square. in any case, my favorite scene is when he writes the gang members a letter stating if they want the 500 bucks they get from the reading center for protection they must meet with him. at the meeting he is surrounded by countless chicano gangsters, but he keeps a cool head. in slow motion, he punches the wooden post of a stop sign that shatters upon contact. then, still in slow motion, points at the leader of the gang and says, "noooooooooooooooooooo, mooooooooooooore!" the gang members comply. cool, right? the beauty of this film shows through in these simple solutions to social problems like prostitution and gang violence.

alien warrior (or king of the streets) is one of those 80s gems you stumble across by mistake, then watch awestruck, marveling at how wonderfully silly and over the top it gets.a rather hunky alien arrives on earth (la to be exact) and stumbles into a world of drug dealers, gangs, and corrupt cops. he falls in love with the flaxen haired, beautiful teacher who only wants to help inner-city kids read more. he also manages to anger a coke-snorting drug kingpin who vows to destroy him.i fell in love with this film at first viewing... sure it's hokey, silly and low-budget. but you can tell the filmmakers had their heart in the right place, and damn if the thing doesn't work! i only pray it'll be on dvd soon.it's got a hot soundtrack, break-dancing, violence, nudity.... all with a positive, wholesome message! see it.

there is more to this movie than meets the eye. if you're looking for groundbreaking originality or easy comedy, you'll be disappointed. but for an entertaining 90 minutes, this is just fine.the cinematography is careful and precise. the sex scenes, which one comment decries as gratuitous, are anything but - every gesture contributes to the development of the characters.yes, some of the main characters are not exactly lovable human beings. but the movie makes an honest effort at showing their interactions in an honest light, without being sensationalistic (at least not for early 21st century urban standards). and there are many very amusing moments.

and a hard spot somewhere else. i haven't seen this movie since i was quite young, maybe 12 or 13, who knows. but what i do know is this is the movie that taught me how to masturbate. i kid you not. i have no idea if it is any good by any real standards of today, but for me, back then, it was everything.the only reason i feel comfortable writing this is because i'm sure no one will ever get around to reading it. i mean, really, who is going to look up this movie these days?i just discovered that i have not yet used up the ten line minimum for the amount of length i most take up in a review. i had no idea there was such a minimum length, but there i go, like a student trying to fill up a page in a journal, my ten lines. thank you very much.

why do i give this 1974 porn movie 7 points? because i watched it. and i found it hilarious! aliens, their weird spaceship, their weird helmets... my god, was that a sight. and all what these desperate alien women need is semen from the earth.and where do they look for it? in upper bavaria, germany. and that is where the main fun comes from: in europe (and more so in german-speaking countries), bavaria is seen as a traditional and backward region. and then the actors are so helpless with the alien women. well, there have been films about people being unable to deal with women like the "american pie" series.but what this film achieved is a true, funny weirdness. you constantly wonder how they came up with these crackpot ideas. but it was 1974, and looking back 35 years fills one with a kind of nostalgia. you've never seen a film like that.and if you don't mind seeing the casual pubic hairs and breasts, watch it once. it is a comedy essentially, not a porn flick.

if you are looking for an erotic masterpiece this isn't it. if you're looking for a comedic masterpiece this isn't it. if you're looking for something hardcore this isn't it.that being said if you are looking for an example of the fine art of european erotic comedy from the the early - mid 1970's this is it.i see many people complain about the quality please understand it was made in 1974. yes the women do not conform to the modern ideal of attractiveness. they are by no means ugly women but they do not have the same looks which are idealized in our silicone culture. yes the dubbing is not great but they are speaking german and anyone who speaks any german will realize it is pretty hard to dub over a word with 12 syllables.if you have seen the dvd prior to the latest release it is marketed with 2 covers of 80's and recently 90's adult stars. the film is an r film so those complaining about hardcore should have realized this, the film is edited from the original but it was also edited prior to its run in the drive-ins in the late 1970s.i first saw this film as a young man and judging by some comments there are many in the same boat who caught a glimpse on cinemax. many people become upset when later in life it doesn't live up to their previous memories. it's understandable considering the raunch and nudity packed into todays erotica.if you compare 2069 to a modern soft-core erotic comedy you may be disappointed. the film while outlandish is actually quite fluid and the jokes while generally innuendos and double meanings still hold up and can still garner a chuckle. if you compare it to a hardcore movie you will be further disappointed, compared to today you see very little.it is still one of the best examples along with bottoms up and the other cinderella of european erotic/comedic cinema of the 1970's.

don't be fooled: this isn't yet another tired example of the girls from outer space pretending to be the french ski team come to earth to collect as much sperm as possible genre, though the synopsis may suggest otherwise. this movie is a gem, an absolute jewel that has enriched my life from the moment i laid eyes upon it. hilarious, exhilarating, action-packed, and stunningly erotic, "ach jodel mir noch einen" is a euro-madcap tour-de-force, a grossly underrated bavarian classic.stop everything you are doing and run out to rent, or better yet, buy this movie immediately.

i will admit that this movie was awful, cheesy, sexist, badly dubbed, and poorly edited, but i loved it anyway. i first saw this movie when i was 14, and it has stuck with me ever since. fyi, this is very close to hard-core porn as i remember. it certainly got my juices flowing. this flick gives a whole new meaning to swedish erotica. it is a humourous take on human sexuality as seen by hot randy female aliens who are, i think, just looking for some spermatozoa for their dying race.

this truly is an australia cult classic. if you're one of the lucky ones to have seen it-- then you are very lucky. it has been released in most countries, but not in australia for some reason. i have a copy on dvd from the uk. not a great transfer, but i bought it, having seen it previously at a film festival. the directing is spot on and the performances rock! this is dark film scary film, but often times, very funny in parts. i urge you to see this film, there is a coolness about this you don't see in 99% of the typical aussie fare. the screenplay is very well crafted and sends you on a journey where you know it will end badly, but until the last ten minutes, you just can't pick how badly. great work from the four leads, especially lachy hulme. when its all said and done: great work on display!

my friend made me sit down and watch this film. this is out there material. "god the devil, heaven hell... and a restaurant thrown in for good measure.four guys and a prick. who dies? when and how?is that's the story. you'll never guess the ending for this one. a skillfully realized little gem of aussie cinema. hats of to the team that made this one.10 out of 10.

ok so some of the plot points might be a bit obvious but over all an interesting idea which works towards a tight ending. the acting is solid particularly lachy hulme who plays one of the central characters in this ensemble piece. he certainly has a screen presence and he is interesting to watch. it has a low budget feel which works for the sort of thriller/horror genre four jacks belongs to. the film doesn't try to take itself to seriously which adds to the overall charm. the character of phil(dave serrafin) has to be one of the most annoying character seen on screen since rupert pupkin/ king of comedy. worth adding to a weekend pile of dvds.

not many people have seen this film, and it is a shame because it is a work of art. the characters are brilliant, the dialogue is sensational and the use of themes leaves the audience wondering. i truly loved this film and can't wait to see more of matthew george's work.

this is an excellent film, full of complexity, themes and great dialogue. the characters are well drawn, with phil the biggest loser of all time.adam haddrick's character is the most vicious thing i've seen on screen since alec guinness's portrayal of adolf hitler in 'hitler: the last ten days.'i just wish they'd all got away with it. but without giving too much away, there are some situations you just cannot lie your way out of.

this movie was clearly an early attempt for a new director, but still succeeded in being original and entertaining as well as in some moments thought-provoking. however, i have to say the story would not have come across as well without the stellar performance of paul anthony as pip. he made the well written parts very believable and affecting, and the more weakly written parts much more bearable. also, i have to mention the performance by alan cumming. it was refreshing to see him in a part like this. he brought a weight to his role that provided a very grounding element to the film. as for paul anthony: who is this guy? why haven't i seen more of him? someone give him more roles, please!

i'm a 55-year-old fairly jaded gay white man. since i don't watch tv, i watch at least 250 films a year, most on dvd. i keep notes on all the films i see and rate them. since december 2003, i have seen only five films as great as eighteen. so, i've rated eighteen better than at least 700 other recent films. mr. bell is far too modest in his film commentary. eighteen is a great film. and, it also resulted in two "firsts" for me.i watched the film, the first time, and i was riveted throughout and weepy during the last half hour, something that's only happened to me three times before. (five minutes into the film i knew it was going to be very good.) when jason began reciting whitman, i lost it, and then... the kiss. well, that is one of film's great kisses, and that scene among filmdom's most poignant and unforgettable. when pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, i clapped. i cheered. i love happy endings. i wept.then i watched the trailer and the tla previews and thought, "okay, is this $800,000 or so indie really that great?" so, i immediately watched eighteen again, something that's only happened three times before. and, eighteen blew my socks off yet again, even more so. then i watched "the making of eighteen" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and mr. bell.so, i thought i'd watch eighteen again with the director's commentary. i have never before watched a film three times in one night. after the third time, at 3:00 am, i knew i had just experienced a great film; eighteen now ranks #10 on my top twenty films of all time. and, in the very small universe of great gay or gay-subtext film, there is brokeback mountain, eighteen, mulholland drive, and maurice.thank you mr. bell! eighteen is brilliant and fully-realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song. i can go on, but i won't gush too much more.this film should have received oscar nominations, certainly one for best picture. the performances, without exception, were all wonderful. ms. gill's lovely, sultry voice was a surprising epiphany. and sir ian mckellen? 'nuf said. awesome.eighteen is the reason i slog through over 200 mediocre to utterly horrendous films (some in the $150 million plus range) a year, to find that one treasure, that one exquisite, magical, unique and enchanting, perfect "faberge egg" enfolding an unforgettable heart.finally (i promise), my second "first" -- i've never before posted a commentary on any film i've seen.thank you again, mr. richard bell! breathtaking genius. give this man $100 million for his next film! he made $700,000 us into one of the top 50 films of all time. if i had the cash, i'd grant him $75,000 a year living expenses and match any funds raised for his next film. mr. bell is already a great director at 31-years old. can you imagine him at 45-years old?wise and witty, tender and brutal, poised, poignant, understated yet edgy, chilling and thrilling, mesmerizing, haunting, unforgettable: eighteen, the masterpiece.

charlie wilson's war is an excellent example of how films should be made. this movie is of the highest quality and is cast perfectly. tom hanks play the lead and delivers an exceptional performance. furthermore, tom hanks is complimented by the unparalleled acting ability of the incredible philip seymour hoffman. i have never seen him in a role that suits him so perfectly.the film is witty, intelligent and well written. julia roberts also stars in this film but is easily over-shadowed by the other two leads.i rated this film 10/10 and am pleased to recommend this film to anyone that is interested in quality cinema.

it's possible to have a good time with this film while, at the same time, regretting all that it isn't. in the 1980s, a raffish u.s. congressman (tom hanks) engineers support for afghan partisans resisting the soviet union.hanks is in breezy, hail-fellow-well-met form as roguish, politically incorrect charlie wilson, first glimpsed sharing a hot tub with three deeply available looking women. if only the film had the same air of insouciance; but apart from philip seymour hoffman's turn as a cynical cia agent, it tries to be perceived as patriotic too. aaron sorkin's trademark staccato dialogue serves its purpose, but the story is no more plausible than one of wilson's tall tales. and there's an oddly unspoken subtext: wilson's afghan pals later mutated into the taliban and other anti-western groups, leaving the world worse off than it was when these events occurred.

well we definitely did see and i and many other people were actually expecting worse. it did have some good parts too it that i was not expecting it still did fail in other areas though.first off the acting was above average. i love phillip seymour hoffman in this movie and i liked tom hanks. hoffman was the glue to this movie. if it were not for him this movie would have crumbled and hit rock bottom. his performance was by no means stunning but absolutely necessary. he gave a good witty, cynical performance in what most other actors could have easily made his character into a cliché. tom hanks really gave a nice loose performance and did not disappoint but he certainly did not impress. what i could not stand was that julia roberts was involved in this movie. she was as big of a miscast as i have ever seen. for one she is a bad actress, at least to me, she was to young for her character and was to phony even for the character she was playing.the directing was average to me. i'm not really a big fan of the recent mike nichols movies and i'm not exactly impressed by this one either. it was made with such a hollywoodish, cartoonish touch hat i could not stand. the worst part about it was that he tried make it be a really meaningful movie at the end. i love meaningful movies but not when a movie tries to rush a scene or two at the end and show something that tries to justify the rest of the garbage spread throughout the whole movie. that is something that mike nichols has seemed to have done a lot in his recent track record.the one impressive part of this movie was the writing. the dialog was put together very well and was able to let the story play out. the writing was what was able to really able to take this movie to an above average level. in so many scenes i found myself laughing in part by the writing.well that is some of what we saw at least. a lot of the scenery was good in the movie if you get what i mean but not a lot other than that. i did like that this movie did not glorify everything america had done. it is obvious that during this whole war in afghanistan the u.s. gave weapons to the people who are now against us. this movie kind of show we are too blame for that. it shows that what may seem good in the short term may turn into something horribly wrong in the future. this movie did have a good original message but it just did not deliver it right. overall though it was entertaining.

nice to see a comedy for grown ups. masterfully structured by aaron sorkin via mike nichols's own mastery. mr nichol's mastery is to present characters in all their shocking truth, from the sad and riveting richard burton and elizabeth taylor in "who's afraid of virginia woolf" to the sad and riveting julia roberts, clive owen, jude law and natalie portman in "closer". in "charlie wilson's war" the shocking truth is outside the characters and the sad and riveting tom hanks, julia roberts, philip seymour hoffman and amy adams are at the service of something else, it's personal only to a point. hanks has to bury his brilliance in single malts and julia roberts throws parties and introduces characters with blatant straightforwardness. amy adams witnesses and exist as a character, witnessing. an insurmountable task that miss adams manages to surmount, beautifully. it is philip seymour hoffman's gus with a t, however, that monopolized my attention. his character may not be a first but it is a first the way that hoffman presented him to us. someone who survives the disregard with which he's treated by the absolute conviction that he's smarter than all of them put together. hoffman is superb. the pacing of the tale helps enormously not to fall in a myriad of useless questions. a sharp, short, smart, sad comedy and when was the last time i was able to say that?

aaron sorking raises the same questions as shakespeare did or does. how could they possibly know so much about the inner workings of palace life. here like in the west wing, sorkin opens surprising doors that are hardly a shock but seem ton confirm our worst fears. everything is so casual and at the same time so directly responsible for so many people's lives. a puffy tom hanks tells us one way or another that things can be manipulated with semi pure intentions but without weighing the consequences and julia roberts in a blond southern hairdo reminds us of the powers harbored in the sidelines. the subject is serious but the treatment is light, intelligent but light. philip seymour hoffman, as the invisible middle man, steals every scene he is in, just like charles laughton did in every movie he was in.the dialogue is fast but not fast enough for us not to catch up and discover that this is not an ordinary comedy. the seemingly casual pace filled with strokes of wit and provocation grants another badge of honor in the mike nichol's collection.

françois villon was a real-life poet and rogue who lived in paris in the 15th century. however, most of what is portrayed in this historical film is actually fiction--from a play created at the beginning of the 20th century. whereas in the film he met and became friends with louis xi, in reality he died in his 30s and was never involved in all the intrigues like he was in this film. in reality, he wrote some lovely verse and was frequently on the wrong side of the law--not the combination of a patriot and robin hood-like character like he is in the film. provided you know that the film is nearly 100% fiction, then it's well worth seeing--just don't assume it's a good history lesson.in the beloved rogue, villon is played with wild abandon by john barrymore. i was also pretty excited to see that his three friends were all played by very familiar faces. angelo rossitto, who was the plucky dwarf, played in tons of films over the years and had a very long career. slim summerville was a character actor known for adding a touch of comedy to films. mack swain is best known as the silent film foil in many of chaplin's short films and played his partner in the gold rush. all four of these men did a nice job and have no complaints---even with barrymore's rather over-the-top treatment that was rather reminiscent of a douglas fairbanks performance. however, the performance i had a serious problem with was conrad veidt as king louis xi. to call this "unsubtle" would be a gross understatement. he played the role like a high schooler who thought he was supposed to be the stereotypical richard iii--skulking about and acting like a demoniacal caricature. while veidt was wonderful in many, many films (both silent and sound) but here he is just ridiculous.as for the story, it's full of lusty adventure and action--like a swashbuckling film minus the sailing ships. the sets worked out well for all this, as they'd been used the previous year for the hunchback of notre dame. both films were set around the same time period.overall, it's one of the last great silent films. there's a lot to like and the film is a lovely combination of romance, comedy and action. well worth seeing, though it loses a couple of points for veidt's overacting as well as the way the film plays fast and loose with history.by the way, this film was also made twice as if i were king (1920 and 1938) and apparently these two films are closest to the original play. however, in total, six films have been about villon and tell, more or less, variations on the same tale!

most of the silent films i've seen have been serious in nature, so it was fun to see one with a comic touch. the setting and some of the scenes for "the beloved rogue" were reminiscent of 1923's "the hunchback of notre dame" relative to the paris street scenes and the celebration of the 'king of fools'. john barrymore portrays france's greatest poet francois villon in a characterization that ranges quite broadly from virtual slapstick to romantically tender; that 'water into wine' bit early in the picture was rather amusing.it seems that times never change, and it's interesting to see the movie make a cogent observation nearly a century ago - paris has it's fool to reign for one night, while everywhere else has one all the time. how true.the appearance of conrad veidt in the film was a little surprising for this viewer, i've only seen him as major strasser in "casablanca", oddly one of his very last movies. as king louis xi, he's a monarch obsessed with astrology, crafty but suspicious, and it was a bit unnerving to see how closely he resembled brad dourif's wormtounge character from the final chapter of the 'lord of the rings' trilogy. not exactly exuding the confidence a king of france might be expected to bear. which is why the ascendancy of burgundy's duke (lawson butt) seemed all the more plausible, until villon rises to the occasion to put one over on both rulers.i found it interesting that the use of inter-title cards was exceedingly spare, used only when absolutely necessary to advance the story. without them though, one would have missed a curious nugget. it seems villon carried out his exile from paris at the hostel of the lame flea! the print i viewed was of exceptional quality, the very first film presented in a one hundred action and suspense movie dvd set from mill creek entertainment, that's saying something for a film that's now eighty years old. it's great that movies from the silent era are now finding a wider distribution in this type of commercial format, making them accessible to an entirely new generation of movie lovers.one question - did it seem like conrad veidt's king louis picked his nose on purpose, or as an inadvertent gesture that simply remained safe from the cutting room?

the beloved rogue is a wonderful period piece. it portrays 145th century paris in grand hollywood fashion, yet offering a bleaker side to existence there as it would be experienced by the poor. and the snow. it's constantly swirling about, adding to the severity of the setting -- brilliant! the setting is enhanced by the odd cast of characters, including beggars, cripples and dwarfs.a brilliant performance is turned in by john barrymore, outdone only by the magnificent conrad veidt, who portrays a degenerate, dissolute louis xi to perfection. and yes, veidt picks his nose on purpose, pushing his portrayal to wonderfully wry limits.

and nothing wrong in that! heartily endorse the comments of boblipton and snow leopard.i'm thrilled to find this movie is available on us dvd - i've only ever seen it through once - i persuaded the goethe institute here in london to show it in their conrad veidt season some years ago - and long to see it again.barrymore is resplendent when engaged, as in this movie, possibly because of the prick of having a renowned german actor as a foil. and veidt is such a wonderful scene stealer (doesn't he pick his nose at one point?) this is one of the seminal films to connect 'dr jekyll' with '20th century', 'grand hotel' or 'midnight'; and 'the cabinet of dr caligari' or 'the student of prague' with 'the spy in bladk', 'contraband' and 'casablanca'.see it!

superb silent version of the story of francois villon. although remade in the thirties as if i were king, with frank lloyd directing, preston sturges scripting and ronald colman starring, this version is even better. barrymore, with a cohort of comedians, plays the comic fool and the wine-depressed villon with a verve that colman could not match. the photography is startling in its beauty and innovation and the supporting cast, particularly conrad veidt in his american premiere, the incredibly beautiful marceline day, and the supporting comics, slim summerville and hank mann, steal every scene they are in.it is a shame that barrymore did so few first-rate comedies. among his sound films, only his lead in twentieth century and his supporting role in midnight can compare to this, and those stand up only because of his superb voice. in this silent movie, barrymore must tell his tale without benefit of words, and he does so, alternately hilariously unrecognizable as the king of the fools and tenderly as villon in love. he even gets to leap around in the swashbuckling style of fairbanks, most convincingly. he also lets his supporting cast have their share of glory, capering in this ensemble work like any talented comic of the era.finally, a brief word about alan crosland, a director known today only for directing the first talking feature, the jazz singer in the same year this was released. crosland was a careful, innovative, delightfully original director, and it is a shame that more of his works are not known. perhaps this movie, far more interesting as a movie than his best-known work, will be your introduction to his other talents. if so, you could do far worse.

i loved this show but then i don't remember ever not loving anything he did, starting with "americanization of emily". a town sheriff who keeps trying to steal the town blind and ride off to mexico, gotta love it. like everything he does it has a tongue in cheek flavor that brands it as a garner product. james plays the same character in lots of his shows and movies but somehow it never gets stale.p.s. re: killing off the main characterif i remember right the "good" brother was killed off and replaced with the "evil" twin in an effort to increase the ratings i.e.; make it more like every other western on tv at the time. i think this show was too far ahead of its time and i still miss it. tv without a jimmy g show is missing something.

this show was a really good one in many ways, although certainly an atypical western with the hero (?) riding around on a motorcycle rather than a horse, due to the 1914 setting, very "late" for a western, which tend usually to be set between 1866 and 1890. i remember some controversy about its cancellation at the time but didn't really watch it during its time on nbc. when i came to see it and love it was a decade later when i was in the army stationed in germany and it was shown every week from the beginning on armed forces television. by then, margot kidder was famous as lois lane but i'll also always think of her as nichols' girlfriend. in a lot of ways, nichols was a lot like maverick; both were much more attracted to getting rich with little effort than they were fighting. it was in the little tv magazine that they distributed at the px (not really an authorized edition of "tv guide" but made to resemble it as closely as possible without getting into copyright trouble) that i first learned the real story behind the cancellation. i really wonder what the next season with the more violent twin would have been like if they had really made it as planned. of course, by the time this show was made the "western era" of tv had been in decline for around a decade; someday i hope to be able to write that the "reality era" has been in decline for that long! while "gunsmoke" and "bonanza" were still running, they were both nearing their ends and it had been years since a new western had really caught on; i think that this trend did a lot to hold "nichols" back, and was the main reason that nbc executives doubted that it would ever find a large audience but to me, a good western, unlike a show set in contemporary times, is somewhat timeless, as are other "period" shows; changing fashions and the like do nothing to make them look any more "dated" than they were supposed to be, and i think that watching this show, 10 years after it was produced, is really what brought this point home to me. also, this show is an early pairing of garner and stuart margolin, who is really one of the all-time great sidekicks, and not just in westerns.

this is probably one of those films too many commented but undiscovered... this is probably one masterpiece of spanish cinema like some buñuel's masters-piece. "15 days with you" could be the better "now and them" re-visitation from others films of long-time ago: could be "midnight cowboy" but could be also "les amants du pont-neuf" or a realistic and non-spot-look (but most realistic) "trainspotting". this hard story has place to humour, love and obviously dramatic sense. in the new social spanish cinema this little diamond could be the resurrection of the italian neo realism mixed whit the best ken loach films.probably the better film i discover in the last 10 years.

i had heard interesting critics on this movie. i believed it was a love story but i wasn't sure what was the plot about. so, when i finally saw it, i found myself in the middle of a love relationship between the ex-con isabel (isabel ampudia) and the junkie rufo (sebastián haro). so, a love story but not probably what i was expecting.the movie is focused on isabel, as she struggles to get back into society. she doesn't want to return back to her neighborhood and she finds herself without a home or anywhere to go. so, while she just experiences those first hours of freedom after being released from jail she came across rufo, an old acquittance of her which while she was in had become a junkie and lives on the streets. not having where to go, and without money or feasible source of income, she decides to join rufo on his residence: a covered area on a lonely street.the story by itself is moving. it explains how the, impossible, relationship between isabel and rufo gets deeper until the the almost final twist of the movie.definitely, the movie is worth watching. sebastián haro is splendid in his role of the junkie. a person being able of both being an innocent and tender giving person and a ruthless street scum. just depending whom deals him with. i believe his role.on the other hand, i don't quite believe the role of isabel ampudia. although the movie tries to show the bitterness inside her through several scenes, she is not capable to make me believe it. she is in a way too sweet and too honest for which might be expected of somebody on the same situation.the movie tries to show a love on a desperate situation. it is a enjoyable movie. but the feeling i get when the movie ends is that isabel, with the way of thinking and acting she has, would never have arrived to that situation. her role, partly because of the script, partly because of the acting is difficult to believe.i specially like the ending, and because of it i have raised my rating one or two points. i liked its bittersweetness and the fact of showing that sometimes, survival instinct is above other more spiritual considerations as love.summarizing, an interesting movie, but it lacked some punch to be a total "must see".

the worst movie ever?? hardly!!! this is one of the best animated movies i have ever seen! it has appearances from all the great characters from the animated tv series rainbow brite. very safe for small children and the colors capture their attention like no other! there is an evil princess trying to steal the diamond planet spectra, which would in turn cause all life on earth to cease. this tells the tale of how rainbow brite and her new friend krys are able to stop the princess' evil plot and restore life and color back to earth. it's proof that kids can make a difference! rainbow brite will live on forever.

here's what you have to remember about this movie.... it's a kids movie!!!!! i don't know about the rest of you but i'm an 80s child. i was obsessed with rainbow brite. so, naturally i love this movie. but if you watch the other rainbow brite movies this one is by far the best. but, like i said, it's a kids movie. you have to judge it as a kids movie. it doesn't matter to kids if the acting, animation or script is fantastic or even good. all they care about is what happens to the characters. if the good guy (or girl) wins then it's a great movie. if not, then it's bad. you all know what i mean. you were all kids once.

rainbow brite and the star stealer is not for people who were born before 1980 or after 1989. most of those people would not appreciate the great things that are 80's cartoons. the fact that rainbow brite was made into a movie is a guilty pleasure for many of us who remember watching the tv show as a child. granted, much of the dialogue is quite amusing and silly, and the plot is nonexistant to pointless, but it's a very cool movie none the less.

i found this movie on one of my old videos, after "godzilla vs. the sea monster" (which should instantly give you an idea of it's tone) and i hadn't seen it in a while so i decided to watch it. i didn't remember much about rainbow brite except i used to like the cartoon and that it was cute. most people feel that way about her. you probably do to.well, when the movie started, i wondered if it was the right one! it didn't fit the mold of rainbow brite as i remembered her. but it turns out she kicks butt! this has to be the strangest animated movie ever! i can't believe these characters were so popular (the series isn't much different) while being so bizzare. as soon as i watched this movie again, it became one of my favorites.i really don't want to give too much away. just know that if you see the movie in the video store, rent it and watch it. no questions asked. you will get a kick out of it. especially the outrageous princess character. and the robotic horse. and the hypnotized sprites. if you can't tell by know, this is an 80's cartoon that is really an undiscovered "head" movie in disguise! have fun!

i wasn't even born when this series was released in the usa. it took about another decade before british tv networks laid hold of it.in fact, i was fortunate enough to see the very first episode, in which the lone ranger was one of a posse who ran into an ambush and got slaughtered. tlr was the only survivor. although badly wounded, he was saved by a passing indian called tonto. i believe he took to wearing a mask in order to hide his true identity for fear of reprisal. but instead he made himself all the more recognisable. dunno if he wore it in his sleep.this was saturday teatime staple. the fanfare bugles of william tell's overture presaged a dash to the telly, food still in hand. though it very quickly became repetitive, predictable hokum. nobody ever unmasked him. nobody ever landed a punch, nobody ever out-shot him. he was a little too good, and just a little too camp in his dress for most kids. poor tonto, on the other hand, became his aunt sally. he was always getting slugged and tied-up and kidnapped and stuff.and what did he keep calling the lone ranger? 'king savvy' was the general consensus where i lived. it seemed to imply 'the big know-all' in indian-speak. but is sounded like something else, as if mr silverheels had a speech defect. 'kemosabe'; what the hell's that? a later, and less well-merchandised duo called 'the range rider' and 'dick west' eventually won my vote. this featured a naked-faced jock mahoney who got beat-up pretty thoroughly in each episode and was altogether less camp, less super, and more believable.still; even today i can't hear william tell's overture without expecting the gallop of hooves and a hearty hi-oh silver.devine daftness.

bullets may not have bounced off his chest, but the lone ranger was every bit the symbolic icon to me as my other boyhood hero - superman. he represented truth, justice and the american way in a classic tv western setting, living by the principle that he would never use his gun to kill, while scouring the american southwest with his faithful indian companion tonto to bring every single outlaw to justice. the advent of tv provided the perfect opportunity for a post war generation to find it's ideal in an enigmatic masked man who stood for law and order, while providing unparalleled entertainment for five seasons spanning almost eight years.today i had the opportunity to view for the first time the complete three part origin episodes start to finish without the standard opening and closing sequences to interrupt the continuity of the story. for fans of the ranger, this is the grand daddy of all western sagas, telling as it does how texas ranger john reid survived the ambush by the butch cavendish gang, and how he was nursed back to health by an indian friend from his childhood. tonto (jay silverheels) declares his companion a 'trusty scout', and names him kemo-sabe. i've read various interpretations of the origin of the term kemo-sabe, but i'm satisfied with tonto's explanation. reading too much into it just detracts from the story, just like the english translation of 'tonto' from spanish, which i won't reveal, because it's just better not to know if you can help it.i thought it quite clever how the origin story created the mystique of the lone ranger, like the sixth grave that created the illusion that all the rangers died in the box canyon ambush. you never see the face of the man who becomes the lone ranger, as it's always turned away or obscured to hide his real identity. even the origin of silver is handled brilliantly; the voice of the story's narrator describing the wild stallion's sterling qualities. would that relate, say, to sterling..., silver? i got the biggest kick out of that.of course with the passage of time, watching the lone ranger episodes today offers a view of how unsophisticated the show was beyond the origin story. some of them are almost embarrassingly goofy, particularly when it comes to a lone ranger showdown when he shoots into the middle of a crowd of bad guys to knock a gun out of it's owner's hand. and how about that little wave he gives to tonto whenever they're about to ambush the bad guys - it's always the same gesture, but tonto always knows what it means in different circumstances. then you have the episodes where clayton moore takes off the ranger mask to don a different disguise to impersonate another character in service to the story. he even went under cover once as an actor portraying president abraham lincoln to uncover a villain, top hat and all!few fans that i come across ever know that actor john hart replaced clayton moore for the 1952/53 season in a contract dispute that moore had with the show's producers. if you ever saw that "happy days" episode where fonzie idolizes his boyhood hero, you'll notice it was john hart listed in the credits. it's difficult actually, to tell if you're watching a hart episode or not, the key is to listen to the voice; moore's is so distinctive that it's a dead giveaway.if you ever get the chance to sample some of the final season color episodes, you're in for a treat. the renditions i've seen on vhs are absolutely gorgeous, although i don't know if commercial prints are available. most of the black and white episodes around have been re-packaged by any number of distributors in different configurations, so getting your hands on those should be no problem. the must see of course is the three part origin, and if you don't watch anything else, this gives you all the flavor and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the west's most famous heroes. hi-yo silver, awaaaay!

the 221 episodes of "the lone ranger" were originally broadcast on abc from 1949 to 1957; and then for many years they played in local syndication. for most of the original broadcast years the series was abc's most watched piece of programming. the new dvd set from pop flix contains the first 16 episodes (15 sept-29 dec 1949) and for some reason unknown to me episode 22 from the fifth season, for a total of 17 episodes (the same 17 available on last year's mill creek entertainment release so these are probably in the public domain). these sets pretty much render "the legend of the lone ranger" movie superfluous as all three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the movie are included in these releases. the early episodes hark back to radio as there is considerably more voice-over narration used as an introduction and to introduce key plot moments. the series itself was pure kiddie western with clear-cut good and evil distinctions and no romance. the title character (played by clayton moore) started out texas ranger john reid. the first three episodes provide the background for his transformation to lone ranger status, his partnering with the indian tonto (jay silverheels), and the taming of his horse "silver". there is an unambiguous code of positive morality infusing each episode. the lone ranger is totally good but he adopts the guise of evil. while a masked man in the west was normally feared by the good citizens and an indian was distrusted, the lone ranger is feared by those who would do evil. one persistent theme is that when the lone ranger and tonto first encounter an average citizen they are greeted with suspicion, and by the end of the episode the citizen has been convinced of their value. the trademark ending was a secondary character asking the question: "who was that masked man?". to really enjoy the series you must accept it for the simplistic morality tale it was intended to be. if you don't take it seriously and keep wishing for some self-reflexive campy parody elements you will only get frustrated. then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

someone once defined what is the definition of an intellectual as being: "a person who can listen to "the william tell overture" without thinking of the lone ranger!" in this, we heartily concur! it surely would be a tall order to accomplish this, and one that leopold stokowski, arturo toscanini or .leonard bernstein would all find nigh well impossible to do.and in this there is no disgrace. the radio series and the television series, along with some movie serials, feature films, syndicated newspaper comic strip and comic books, all did their part to make "the masked man of the plains and his faithful indian companion, tonto" a deeply seeded element of our collective psyche and of our literary folklore.as with most legends, it all started gradually, first with a series of radio plays, written for local use in detroit over radio station wxyz. the creator was one george w. trendle and the principal writer on the series was mr. trendle's brother-in-law, mr. fran striker. the year was 1933 when the ranger first rode out to "the plains of the early western united states!" the lone ranger, tonto and the radio series all successfully guided depression era americans through the mid and late '30's up to and through world war ii. but the post-war era found the country in the midst of a super-nova explosion of invention and technology. there had been a new communications medium standing ready in the wings, but unable to go forth until both ve day and vj day had been achieved. once these were accomplished and the world and america was ready to settle down to both peace and prosperity. the "new technology" was, of course was television! and we would surely need something else than "roller derby" and "wrestling from marigold arena" to fill up the broadcast hours. and while at first, the time that a tv station had anything on, except that portrait of that mohican chief (test pattern, schultz!) very soon and with post haste, the networks began tapping their existing natural resources, their existing programming! virtually all would be ripe for adaptation to the tv screen.so, the folks over at lone ranger, incorporated were very interested when producers jack chertok, harry poppe, sherman harris and jack wrather all approached them with a deal to put the masked man and tonto on the television waves, as well as the radio.immediately they went to work and gave us the first season, which made use of the considerable back log of radio dramas, all potentially adaptable to tv dramas. they cast clayton moore, a fine supporting actor in many a feature film, and with about a dozen years experience. he also had done some work in serials over at republic pictures' "thrill factory", which would be invaluable experience in doing "the lone ranger". cast as his "faithful indian companion" and partner in bringing justice to various parts of the frontier, we had sheer perfection in character-supporting actor, jay silverheels.** we must mention that there was that rift in about '53, when clayton moore walked and was replaced with john hart. after a season or so, mr. moore was back in-having been missed so much! now, back to our story!! the first years of filming gave the episodes a look and a sound all of their own. they made good use of off screen narrator, which gave these shows a feel of authenticity and an individual, stand-out one of a kind series. the actors employed were all veterans of the movies of the late silent era thru the 1930's and 1940's. a lot of them had been just about exclusively "cowboy movie" players. a good example of these is the casting of glenn strange (bartender sam on "gunsmoke") as the vicious, murderous gang leader, butch cavandish. and it was the cavendish gang's massacre of the texas rangers that led to the origin of john reid (thought to have been slain with the other texas rangers) as the "lone ranger".in addition to the old timers in the cast, you will find a lot of new and up and coming talent (then) in the cast. we see people like phyllis coates, dwayne hickman, denver pyle and others in the cast from week to week. all of this, along with an always calling for fair-play, justice and peace in a western world.the last couple of seasons brought some big changes. first was the use of colour filming. that made no difference as a colour tv set was still a long way off for our household. the second was a new set of musical themes and queues. (other than rossini's finale from "u no wutt!") the new music was never a big deal to us, as we preferred the "old radio" stock stuff.with this series and two feature films done during this period, the lone ranger (warner brothers, 1956) and the lone ranger and the lost city of gold (united artists, 1958), the character has been permanently and indelibly impressed in our identity as a people, we americans!

iam not sure if discussing the television series is exactly where the comments should be drawn to,however it is on the television where the the lone ranger really made a name for himself.iam not even referring to the original radio broadcasts of this masked rider of the plains,iam though referring to a point where in a little boy, about 9 or 10 years old,i was to see the movie,"the lone ranger"and never forgot it.i can recall that i was on a line or we were moving toward the paramount theater-the theater was located in the theater district,if i remember correctly.it was directly across,going east to west from the building that has the ball that drops on new years eve-this is of course if anybody doesn't know, new york city.high above the street on the roof tops there was a time and maybe even still today huge billboards would advertise what was being shown and so on.it was at that point in time that i looked up and was never more impressed as i was when i looked at that billboard to see the lone ranger across the roof tops-it was great-it made an impression and was never forgotten.that day we went to see the lone ranger-it was the story of how the lone ranger was born-the terrible ambush that the texas rangers rode into and the subsequent rebirth of one of its fallen heroes.it was in this film we learn that the lone ranger will not shoot to kill but to injure so as to let the law be the judge.that type of thinking is so worthwhile that we might be good to learn something from history.this is where we learn that tonto discovers the fallen ranger and upon seeing the symbol of the boyhood friendship that the lone ranger established years earlier when he as a younger person came to the aide of a injured young person in tonto-for the aide given, tonto gave to his faithful friend, a symbol of his thanks which now was part of a necklace that tonto recognized.tonto said,"you are kemosabe".the lone ranger said,"kemo-sabe,that is familiar?then tonto tells the story of this "trusty scout"(the meaning of kemosabe)i think the lone ranger is one of the true heroes of the silver screen and one of the great heroes of television.it should also be stated that these very respected individuals clayton moore and jay silverheels sought to live there lives according to the legend of the lone ranger-it may very well be that there is an inspiring story in the story of the lone ranger and his faithful companion tonto.i myself was so pleased by the ability to find and buy the dvds, that i stayed up all a saturday morning and watched the many episodes now available.long live the lone ranger and his faithful companion tonto-hi-ho silver-

this is a very funny movie. there is a self deprecating, iconoclastic tone to the movie that is very appealing. the characters are interesting. the movie flows very well and holds your interest throughout the 1 hour, 50 minutes duration of the film. the film quality is not of the highest hollywood standards; however the original film was supposed to be made in the genre of a gritty punk-rock style. the documentary about the attempt to make the film and the subsequent betrayal of the film makers is very well detailed and easy to follow. the original film makers themselves become the main characters in the documentary version of the movie. the interviews of the film makers and the actors has been assembled in a highly entertaining story that illustrates the struggles involved in making the original film, the eventual failure of the original project and the phoenix-like rising from the ashes that evolved into this documentary film. in my mind the documentary (a texas tale of treason) is a much more interesting and entertaining film than the original film (waldos hawiian vacation) would have ever been. two thumbs up for a job well done.

this film proves you don't need a hollywood budget to make something fun to watch. what stuck with me is how the crew from different locations was able to pull together with no promises of riches to make something just because they believed in it. i think anybody who makes low budget movies can relate to certain scenes such as actors who just can't get that one line, being bothered by the police, and having most of the crew disappear after the first week. nobody got paid for this which says a lot for the people who had to travel cross country and for the long hours spent editing. after watching stuie sell his personal property, use his own money, and trash his house to make the movie i am a bit curious how close his wife may have come to leaving. good job to all.

the book "the railway children" is a children's book published in 1906 by edith nesbit, an early british socialist who had very strong views about the importance of family values for the upbringing of children, and the story it told was presumably intended to be contemporary. somewhat surprisingly, it seems to retain a significant appeal for today's children a hundred years later.a film adaptation of an edwardian classic children's story with the principal roles those of the children, does not sound very exciting to most film-goers in this day and age. but a really great performance by jenny agutter who (near the start of her long and distinguished acting career) played the part of the oldest girl roberta (bobby), combined with remarkable work by the script-writer and director lionel jeffries and outstanding photography by arthur ibbetson, have made this a film that is still not to be missed, and one which most of its viewers find quite memorable. it is remarkable that this book, set in the year 1905, was filmed five times between 1951 and 2000, (four of them by the bbc for british television), and all of these versions are not only still greatly admired but also very highly regarded (something that user comments on this database will confirm), even though this may seem almost inconceivable for a nostalgic period story designed to appeal primarily to children. since i have not seen the four bbc tv versions, these comments relate exclusively to the 1970 film version produced for showing in cinemas. unlike most films of children's books, 'the railway children' may appeal more to adults than to children. the structure of family life has changed so much in the last century that many children may feel totally lost by the way in which it is depicted in the film, whereas many older adults may find it has a considerable nostalgic appeal. perhaps compensating for this, the children featured in the film are full of life and vitality, whilst the adult characters although well rounded tend to mostly be 'stuffed shirts'. the story is a mature one, which deals with love, support and encouragement, it is not only timeless but capable of appealing to all ages. it can fairly be described as sentimental and more than a little idealised, but it is never in any way mawkish, and that rarely justified adjective 'uplifting' fits it like a glove.spoiler ahead.the film starts with its upper middle class edwardian family celebrating christmas in a comfortable and fairly spacious london home when two unexpected visitors call and take father (who is a senior government officer) away with them. mother has to move to a very small cottage alongside the railway in a remote part of yorkshire and the children gradually build a new life mainly associated with the railway and the few trains that pass. this life proves quite eventful in small ways and the elder daughter bobby grows up rapidly as she takes over more responsibilities from her mother. at one point she averts an accident to the train when her sharp eyes spot that a landslide has created a natural hazard. father's story is never given much emphasis, but he is never forgotten and it gradually becomes apparent that he is incarcerated and suspected of treason. finally these suspicions are cleared up (we are not told how or why) and he reappears unexpectedly at the local station to rejoin his family.for many years this film was not available in any home video format in north america, but anchor bay created a dvd from it three years ago, so they clearly recognised that this quite simple film has not yet lost its appeal. for anyone who has not got one already, i would very strongly recommend rushing out to buy a copy of this dvd whilst it is still available - you would be most unlikely to be disappointed unless you have become totally cynical, or your minimum requirements for a film include buckets of blood and/or intense sex scenes.

perhaps once in a generation a film comes along that is perfection. for me, "the railway children" is that film - a timeless classic that was directed and performed most beautifully. it depicts all that is worthwhile in humanity and climaxes in the conquest of love and faith over cruel injustice. every performance is a gem, though bobbie stands out and, like judy garland as dorothy before her, jenny agutter makes it impossible for us to imagine anyone else in the role.the world is all the better for this film and the children of today would be much the better for watching it.of course, like so many young men of my generation, i fell hopelessly in love with jenny agutter and her hold was as strong when i had the great good fortune to meet her a few days ago - the bewitching smile and voice like dripping honey were still there to send me weak at the knees as they first did all those years ago!

...apparently bernard cribbins ad libbed nearly all of his lines. if you can sit through the 'daddy! oh my daddy" bit without blubbing then you really need to get in touch with your inner child (trust me. i'm a 41 year old bloke).

this is a film that i love above all others. i try to revisit the main film locations in oakworth and oxenhope whenever i can, which help to re-establish those magical qualities that this film seems to embody so uniquely - recalling a gentler and more mannered age, with its unspoken assertions that people really do matter, that family life is not just another disposable, and that life really is worth living (though sometimes, we may doubt that). in short, a film that soon brings tears to my eyes, helped perhaps by the deeply evocative music - some tunes are jaunty (like the perks' tune, played on a trombone, sometimes with spoons), the stirring melody when the family first set off for yorkshire not knowing what lies ahead, and the haunting little tune played on a solo clarinet (or is it an oboe?) that precedes sudden child-felt changes in fortune.this is as much a film for adults as for children, appealing to the eternal child in us all - a key that effortlessly reactivates those deep and apparently long-lost values and feelings buried inside us, which are normally swept aside by the demands of modern everyday life. this is a film about basic human goodness and decency in which we the viewers are left to make of it what we will, and there are welcome touches of humour sometimes added for good measure, such as the arrival of the aunt or, on a more earthy level, the bedroom scene on perks' birthday - "all right bert - as it's your birthday!" i must know every scene, every line of this film, and yet so great is the magic that each time i watch, it is like i am opening a box of delights for the first time, savouring each moment - sometimes humorous, sometimes....well, very different. as peter says in the film: "it's perfect - more perfect than you know". and so it is!!!

the railway children is perhaps my favorite film of all time simply for the brilliant acting of the cast,the warm,humane interaction of the 3 children and the people they encounter living near the railway in the beautiful english countryside. jenny augutter is especially believable in her role as 'bobbie' the older sibling of her sister phyllis and brother peter.the adventures they discover and relationships formed in their new home and surrounding area are very real and fascinating.the scenery is lovely,the trains a part of britain's vast history and the soundtrack is very moving. this heartwarming film never fails to bring tears to my eyes,each and every time as well as makes me homesick.i often wonder if i should have been born in that era as i think i would have fitted in just fine as people treated each other with such chivalry and decency.in short i consider this film somewhat of a masterpiece and a must see for anyone who considers themselves a 'sensitive or caring type'.edith nesbit wrote this story around the beginning of the 1900's and what a wonderful story it is.more kids today need to read this or see the film instead of playing violent video games.if we had more films of this nature ,the world would become a better place.

this almost perfect cinematic rendition of edith nesbit's popular children's novel follows the lives of roberta (bobbie), phyllis, and peter, and their mother, after their father is unfairly accused of treason and sent to prison. they go to live in an almost uninhabitable house in the country which stands near a railway line  mum writes stories to make enough money for food and candles, while the children spend much of their time around the railway station and, specifically, waving to one particular train to 'send their love to father'.always an involving and clever novel, the characters are here brought to life under the perceptive direction of lionel jeffries (better known as a fine character actor). jenny agutter plays bobbie, while sally thomsett and gary warren are her sister and brother. their mother is dinah sheridan, while the other memorable characters are played by bernard cribbins (perks the railway-man) and william mervyn (the old gentleman on the train).'the railway children' is gentle entertainment from another age, but does its job beautifully. as we watch bobbie grow up with the worries of an absent parent jostling against her own needs both to be alone and to have fun, we can only rejoice when events come together at the close of the picture. throughout we have a sense of time and place  be it from the steam trains, the university paper chase, or the red flannelette petticoats worn by the girls (and used to avert disaster!).

this wonderful film has never failed to move me. the colour, convincing cast, and stunning scenery all make big contributions. this production, unlike the later remake by carlton, is more impressionistic, and presented more from the children's own perspective. it focusses on certain episodes from e. nesbit's charming story rather than trying to make a somewhat more documentary "warts-and-all" style that carlton adopts. above all, the superb musical score of the late johnny douglas underpins the story throughout, adding extra emotional depth. the net result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively present the poignant story of "the railway children".one uncomfortable factor for the viewer to ponder throughout this film is how things have changed since those times - and in many ways, for the worse! yes, maybe many of us no longer have to use outside toilets and travel in horse-drawn carts, but what about the quality of life in general? consider the foul-mouthed celebrities who now "grace" our tv screens. their language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable. consider, too, the fragile "here today, gone tomorrow" aspects of so many of today's "partnerships" plus all the single mothers - whatever happened to that institution called "marriage", when people accepted each others' flaws but still remained together, loving their children? these details add extra piquancy when watching this marvellous film.i hope that, as generations pass, children will still be able to enjoy this film. not to mention certain adults!

i avoided this film as a boy because i thought it would be boringno fights or shooting, cops, robbers, cowboys or indians. it was definitely not a cool film to like. so i didn't see trc until i was in my twenties and found it one of the most beautiful, captivating films i have seen. all the actors deliver the characterisations perfectly and each emotion is drawn from the viewer scene by scene. the filming and direction are deceptively simple but feel so natural and drew me completely into the story. my two favourite scenes are bobbie's birthday party and the scene on the station platform near the end, directed and edited to perfection. the quality and phrasing of jenny agutter's voice when she calls: 'daddy! my daddy!' wrenches emotion from the viewer. tears are welling in my eyes as i think of it.this adaptation isn't just a movie it is a piece of precious art, as well as being the perfect example of what all film makers should be striving to achievecreation of an emotional experience.

this covers just about every area of the creative process, and goes through the three stages chronologically, with the main focus squarely placed on the production. there are documentaries that go into more detail, and cover the other two groups better. this consists of artwork, behind-the-scenes footage, clips of the movie, and many interviews. with a running time that comes in at just over two hours the audience is entitled to a lot of information, given that this is nearly the same length that the film itself is. it could be argued that a lot of the time is spent on the people, with the craft and the result of their collaborative efforts coming in second. this is well-done, with tight editing. it gets into the technology some, and reveals how certain effects were achieved. this spends a lot of time on the physical training, in preparation for the fighting and such. you do get nice candid shots of the people, crew and actors alike. the ultimate matrix 10-disc set of this also holds nearly three hours of music, in a simple system, with individual track selection and a play all function, about 38 minutes worth of bts material in addition to the title itself, in various featurettes. the original release, however, has several very brief extras, including clips of the making of the sequels, a preview of the animatrix and yuen wo ping's blocking tapes(a complete run-through of a couple of the biggest martial arts sequences, with stunt performers and almost the exact cinematography, with the same shots and angles of those bits in the finished silver screen effort). the language is quite strong, but rather infrequent, nearly non-existent. i recommend either version of this to anyone who enjoys the concept, and/or wants to know about how they put the first one together. 7/10

long trailer? whoever said that has got to be joking. this has got to be one of the most in depth behind the scenes or making of documentary ever made. how can it be a trailer when several minutes are spent telling the audience how the movie was conceptualized and then brought to the studios? this documentary also spends lots and lots of time detailing how stunts were done and the new technologies created to achieve them. then it shows us how woo ping's team came up with the fight scenes along with blocking tapes that pretty much put to shame the actual scenes with the actors. there is stuff mentioned about matrix reloaded, but there's hardly anything really. if you are a real fan of the matrix, you have to see this documentary. the original documentary in the dvd is good, but incomplete compared to this one. for instance, it never explained why keanu wore a neck brace in the original documentary, but that is explained in revisited. the revisited dvd also shows carrie ann moss spraining her ankle during the lobby scene and being really distraught because she feels like she's letting the crew down. and that's just the tip of the iceberg. so ignore that "just a long trailer" review and go check it out for yourself. you won't regret it. casual matrix fans need not apply...

i am salivating for the sequels. i needed something to keep me from going insane with tension, anxiety (what if it isn't as good?!), and constant lack of information. i needed something to calm me a little, something to pass the time, other than, of course, the matrix. this was just the thing. i found it informative (like the part about keanu's neck...) and some of it was funny. i pitied carrie-anne soooo much when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys. i found only one problem with it. given that 95% of the people there were as a matter of fact male, they just kinda let their mouths run wild, and there was language in it. it's not near as bad as the shawshank redemption's cussing runs, but that one scene were keanu is describing a bad day, plug your ears if you are little. >it was entertaining and was just what i needed. it is what all matrix fans who are going nuts need to keep them quiet. they mention a tiny bit about the sequels, and someone almost gives something away, but he catches himself in time (shoot!). it gives you almost no spoilers, but it is great to have if you are a matrix head like me. there is no spoon.

i've been a huge fan of the cky videos, jackass, and viva la bam for a long time. they've had a great run and i expected my laughter to end, eventually. but, it hasn't yet. this movie kept my mouth open the entire time. i'm still laughing, randomly. i went to the theater with low expectations, thinking it wasn't going to be better than the first. oh, how incredibly wrong i was.there were many great moments in the movie. if you're squeamish, don't like randomly placed raw humor, or if you disliked the first movie, you probably won't like this. but, with that said, i almost wet my pants from laughing so hard. it had all kinds of different pranks, masochistic humor, toilet humor, puking, laughing, some great falls and massive damage done to all of the cast. ryan dunn even branded bam's rear end with an image that will be stuck there for a long time. i'm sure you can only imagine how raw this movie is.no pain, no gain? right? this movie has already done well, causing theaters all over america to laugh so hard, they'll be wishing it could last longer. i know i did. this movie did not feel short, at all, especially with the credits continuing the footage. but, i still wish it could've gone on forever. now, let's just wait and see when they release jackass number 3! overall, an excellent film, if you can get past the male nudity and a few sickening images. keep your kids out of this film. they don't need to see this, at least until they are older. support the crew and buy this when it comes out on dvd! i know i will.

my sister, a friend and i went to see this film for my birthday on the 24th of september. we had all seen the first "jackass" movie a while back, and we all enjoyed it. we were really looking forward to number two.we were not disappointed.from start to finish i was laughing hysterically. it is equal parts shocking and amusing, however, and is definitely not for those with weak stomaches. it is obscene, but it is also groundbreaking american cinema... well, perhaps that's a bit too much praise for a movie where men intentionally get their scrotum's stuck to ice sculptures, but it is groundbreaking in that it shows us obscenities whether we like it or not, things that no other "decent" american movie released nation-wide would dare show us.there was only one scene in particular that i felt was unnecessarily obscene, and it involved a horse - i'll not elaborate.i laughed, i nearly gagged, and i came damn-close to crying (out of a physical reaction to viewing a scene involving a leech and an eyeball, not sadness). in my humble opinion, "jackass: number two" is the film of '06.does that make me a jackass? perhaps. but if it does, i could really care less.

this movie is just about as good as the first jackass, but with slightly more disgusting skits. i wouldn't say this was as good as the first, but it came very close. jackass fans will not be disappointed, but if you didn't like the first movie, you will hate this one. there are scenes that will be seen as jackass classics (the elderly suits with "additions", the "cab ride", and many others), and those that you will wish you never watched (eating crap, drinking semen, etc...) overall this movie was a good watch, and i am glad i got to see it. i'm sure this movie will not have the best rating due to critics that rate it (i sat in the press section and most of the older viewers seemed disgusted), but don't let that stop you from enjoying it.

like the first one,the team of jackass are back to try to kill themselves with whatever manner they see fit.either,it's fitting yourself in a tractor tyre and rolling down a slope.or getting yourself deliberately smashed by a bull.or something even worse.the first one was crazy,and that's how you can describe it.it was also really hard laughing film.but this one is completely nuts.it's got even more dangerous stunts,and even harder laughs.so,i think watching dumb idiots getting themselves killed is gonna be the funniest thing this week.so,before borat comes out,i shall laugh my a** out.

johnny knoxville and the boys of jackass go over the top for "jackass number two." at a press screening, the laughter was so loud and raucous it was hard to hear all the dialog. the stunts are over the top and the pranks are funnier and more outrageous than ever before.all of the guys put their limbs on the line to make a great film, and they succeeded. if you like this genre, you'll love this film. if not, don't bother.some of the funniest bits are the pranks the guys play on themselves, and they have no regard for what happens to them. they'll do anything to make a stunt work. many critics panned johnny knoxville for a less active role in the first film, but not to worry, he is front and center in number two, and they have enough footage in the can to be half way through a number threee.this is a must see for fans of this type of humor.chris sansone, entertainment editor, fort bend herald

just got out of an advance screening, and wow was this movie hilarious. possibly better than the first one, but at least its equal. if you don't like jackass, or really unnecessary amounts of male nudity(way more than in the first) then stay far, far away. but if you dig the whole jackass thing, then this movie will not disappoint. toro totter is the greatest invention ever. ok. so my review wasn't long enough... all else i have to say is poor, poor dunn, they really kick the crap out of him in this. so if you enjoy masochistic humor, and prolific male nudity, and by far the most disgusting female nudity ever (john waters is involved, need i say more?) then this movie will keep you in stitches for it entirety. i never stopped laughing, and actually came out drenched in sweat.

johnny knoxville has gone insane.in the first jackass he delighted in practical jokes more so than the physical stuff  his opening car rental gag and the later bit involving an air horn on a golf course were more akin to some type of extreme candid camera  but in jackass: number two he's really off his rocker.beginning with a sequence where he is chased through a living room by a bull, or later when he rides a rocket (a stunt which almost cost him his life due to an unexpected explosion from the side of the rocket), and especially when he stands willfully in front of a defense mechanism and takes a spray of pellets to the stomach, knoxville is a madman. in the first film bam margera and steve-o  notorious party animals  were the daring ones, but you know it's pretty bad when you see knoxville enticing them to do a stunt.this is essentially a series of stunts pulled off by guys consumed by testosterone, constantly trying to one-up each other. it will eventually end in death for one of the cast members  in jackass 2 steve-o nearly loses a leg to a shark, knoxville (as aforementioned) is nearly impaled with an explosion from a rocket, and so on and so forth. jackass 3 has already been confirmed owing to the success of 2, and frankly i can't imagine any stunt out-performing the bull run in the opening scene of this film  that's incredible footage. it's almost unbelievable, and i wondered whether it had been faked, but apparently it was 100% genuine. (which is actually kind of frightening.) and in terms of extremes jackass 2 far outdoes its predecessor  it also feels more cinematic than the first film, with less of the cheesy titles preceding stunts that were made famous on the original mtv television show.unfortunately, the boys were given too much freedom here, and a good number of the gags are simply lame exercises in crudity  i can enjoy the occasional poop gag, but watching a man relieve himself on a miniature toilet, or see steve-o take beer up the butt (yes, honestly), gets grating after a while. even the frat boys in the screening i attended  who were enthusiastic when wee man took a playing card up the rear and got zapped by a rigged chair  were disgusted by some of the scenes in this film. it's not a matter of getting away with as much as possible  it's a matter of saying, "is this even entertaining or funny?" many times, sadly, it really isn't.but for every lame stunt involving fecal matter and farting on people's faces, there are some brilliant hidden-camera bits. wacky director spike jonze ("adaptation") dresses up as an old woman and hits the streets naked, with sagging breasts and no shame. and my personal favorite skit involved knoxville as an irresponsible old man, out for lunch with his grandson, letting him drink alcohol and smoke and swear and insult people. that's classic comedy taken to new extremes with the liberties of an r-rating. it's a shame they had to ruin all the great stuff  including a final segment involving an elaborate terrorist prank  with poop jokes along the way.still, there's enough sheer spirit and craziness in this film to merit a viewing, and it's really taken the concept of extremity in cinema to new heights.

it's what you expect. it induces laughter, cringing, and dry-heaving, not necessarily in that order. it's over-the-top. you will see things that you may never be able to erase from your mind's eye. " jackass number two" is better than the first; the actors definitely took more risks while filming this movie. there are many stunts which could have killed the actors, especially johnny knoxville. the treatment of animals was suspect, but other than that, the movie achieved what is was made to achieve. if you like the preview, see the movie. if you don't, steer clear! 8 out of 10

this film tops the previous incarnation by a mile, taking everything to the next level. as always the jackass guys are purely unbelievable, and i personally laughed harder in that theatre than i have in a long time. like the first jackass, this isn't so much a movie as an eighty minute long string of stunts and pranks. it is pure circus entertainment taken to the highest level. essentially these guys are clowns, debasing themselves for the amusement of others. and its great. the shenanigans are so low, outrageous, and often disgusting that they transcend into a higher form of entertainment.you can't rate this along other movies, its in a class of its own. and it shines. go and enjoy it for the pure spectacle that it is.

yes. bam cried a couple times and so did englund. and most probably you will too. the whole cast is back in action and knoxville has stepped up to become the true leader of this gang of messed-up retards (i mean this in the best possible way). i first thought, maybe bam or steve-o were the main go-to guys....nope, the main man is now johnny. don't get me wrong, everybody, and i mean everybody is great in this flick! right from the get-go you're laughing, and believe you me, don't plan on resting that smile of yours. i personally think the movie definitely has better moments than the first. you know when you go into a theater, and you kind of don't want to have high expectations for it.....well, this movie blows all expectations away. if you love jackass, you can go into this with gigantic expectations. no matter what you'll laugh your ass off. if you're not laughing, the reason is most likely someone has a gun in your face telling you if you laugh you die or maybe you are embarrassed about the sound of your laugh or the highest probability is that you were eating jack sh!t for breakfast and jack left town. all i have to say is, prepare yourself to have a sore face after the movie. :)

where do i begin? i sat down ready to laugh a bit and i was blown away! this movie is just perfect, it's indescribable. jackass number two in all honesty was grosser, more obscene, funnier and more entertaining than the first. this was just what i needed tonight.there are so many scenes in this movie that will make you say "oh my! no way!" or "ouch!". perfectly mastered and set up, each event and scene were coordinated way before and therefore made it even more perfect. i loved every minute of it! i'm just going to say that there was even a scene where it was necessary to censor particular footage in order to prevent an nc-17 rating! it was so hilarious that they had to put it in anyway! amazingly good.9/10. incredibly funny, do not miss out!

the sequel is exactly what you will expect it to be. and it is good enough that everyone who would have wanted to watch this should leave it happy.this is not a movie that will win an academy award. but it does take what made the jackass tv show and original movie a success, and it turns it up a notch. it is funnier, more brutal, and more disgusting than the original. and i loved every minute of it.the original had a few notorious stunts, and there is at least one stunt that this movie will be remembered for. you will wince, cringe, look away, and laugh very, very hard.in any event, you probably do not need to read this review, or any others, to know if you will like this movie, unless you have never heard of jackass.

this movie blew me away - i have only seen two episodes of the show, never saw the first movie, but went to a pre-screening where johnny knoxville himself introduced the movie, telling us to 'turn off our sense of moral judgment for an hour and a half.' he was right. as a movie, this would probably rate a 2, given it has zero plot, no structure besides randomness, and very little production value. however, that isn't the point. everyone in our theatre was laughing and gasping the whole way through - not only were some of the stunts creative (see trailer if you need to know but they hid some of the best (or worst depending on how you want to look at it)), but some of the stuff they did took us completely by surprise. these guys do some stuff that won't make it into your newspaper reviews (and probably can't even be published here), involving lots of things below the belt. however, almost 3/4 of the stunts are fantastically hysterical (even if morally condemnable, but remember knoxville's statement), and if you are in the right mindset this movie is hysterical to watch. only about 20 minutes of this movie could have actually been shown on tv, so consider yourself warned of what you're getting into - some stuff is disgusting, but instead of being repulsed by it you end up laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all. as a person who thought jackass the tv show was an over-hyped fad with only a few funny sketches and lots of unnecessary pain, the amount of fun i had at this movie has made me realize that having no boundaries is the best environment for these guys to work in. it's a lot of fun and should be a great comedic fix until the borat movie comes out. with this movie, you may think you know what you're getting, but these guys are a few steps ahead of you - i guarantee you'll be surprised by the 3rd sketch. so enjoy, and don't worry: you won't want to perform almost any of their stuff at home.

changi has a delightfully fresh script, acted superbly by both young and old actors alike. john doyle has done an excellent job bringing humour to a tragic true story, keeping a sometimes sad story fun and engrossing, particularly to those of us not familiar with the events of south east asia during ww2.john doyle's parallel story line successfully bridges the gap between past and present, allowing the audience insight into the long-term effect war had on the prisoners and their family's lives as well as providing the basis for an excellent narrative which nicely rounds out the tales, both individual and collective. doyle deserves praise for this effort. we have in the past been delighted by his abundant and quick-witted humour as evidenced in his long running collaboration with greg pickhaver as `roy & h.g.'as the series is approaching half way, we are looking forward to how the story develops with anticipation.

this would have to be by far the greatest series i have ever seen. i vividly watched every sunday night and purchased the box set as soon as it was available. this is a timeless play written by a fantastic australian that people of all ages could relate to, whether they are australian or not, however for those of us that are australian it truly brings across the typical australian icon. a must see 10/10

somehow, changi lost out in the afi awards to my brother jack. the latter, a high-quality adaptation of george johnston's immortal novel, was outstanding - but, in my opinion, not as good as changi. i have heard that many critics dismissed changi as being irrelevant, unimportant, historically inaccurate or even disrespectful. who and where are these critics? changi is outstanding. more than that. brilliant. it's not supposed to be a documentary - certainly i can forgive the actual changi survivors (or indeed any survivors of a pow camp) for being disappointed with the production - but to the rest of us, changi represents the remarkable power of mateship in times of extreme adversity. it contains a part of the australian culture that appears to be diminishing as times become easier and less challenging, but which we should never forget: australians were respected worldwide after gallipoli and ww2 for their comradery and sense of humour. rating: 96/100. see also: gallipoli; paradise road; the last bullet; the sugar factory.

as soon as i saw the ad for "changi" on the history channel, i knew i'd love it. it captured the anzac spirit fantastically - you would die if you didn't have mates around you. the characters of "changi" were strong and each brought something different into the story, and the japanese soldiers weren't criticised, but were depicted as normal soldiers doing what they thought was right, just as the australians were doing. direction, screenplay, acting and setting were all done wonderfully, with a clear easy-to-follow plot. humour was the soldiers' key to survival, and it was great to see a mini-series about war actually have some sort of humour in it, which is usually difficult to do without offending people. from what i've read about soldiers in changi pow camp, this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years those australian, british, new zealand, american and dutch men spent there. i would recommend this series to anyone, whether you are interested in war or not. 10/10.

i've heard a few comments, particularly from prisoners of war, that changi is not historically accurate, and that it is disappointing. perhaps it is for those who actually had to live through this stuff, and much worse. but for the rest of us, who really have no idea of how prisoners were treated by the japanese during world war ii, changi is a remarkable introduction. but changi isn't a war documentary - if it had have been, then the historical accuracy aspect would have been paramount. it is a miniseries drama, with fictional characters and fictional situations (though based loosely on actual events i've heard and read about) - and at the centre of the story is the ideal of mateship. this group of young australian soldiers, taken prisoner by the japanese and held in appalling conditions for years, became mates through adversity and the strength of their friendships continued throughout their lives after the war. it is also a cultural study of the differences between the japanese of the time and the western world, with its music, games and entertainment: in part 5, when it is becoming clear that japan will lose the war after germany has surrendered in europe, the japanese prison camp colonel insists that his country must study the culture of their prisoners - in order to defeat a people, one must defeat their culture - and to do this, one must understand it. all in all, australia continues its rich tradition of producing exceptional television miniseries, and is an unrivalled world leader in this regard: vyeing for the afi award with changi is my brother jack, the adaptation of george johnston's novel, and also a worthy winner. miniseries in recent years include day of the roses (the story of the investigation into the glanville train crash), kings in grass castles (the adaptation of mary durack's historical account of her pioneering ancestors), kangaroo palace (about a group of friends from a country town in australia who travel to london and change and grow apart), and the (somewhat disappointing) adaptation of bryce courtenay's powerful novel, the potato factory. less recently: nancy cato's sweeping saga of life on the murray - all the rivers run; cusack & james' brilliant novel about postwar life in sydney - come in spinner; colleen mccullough's outstanding pioneering saga - the thorn birds; the river kings; ruth park's novel the harp in the south; bodyline; eureka stockade; anzacs; etc..., etc... (of course, there have been some not-so-good productions - for instance, moby dick, do or die, on the beach, thorn birds: the missing years; etc...) generally, though, if an australian miniseries comes your way, make sure you see it - and this goes double for changi, a superbly directed masterpiece. rating: 9/10.

this has got to be one of australia's best productions. i completely disagree with the comments made by 'raminour101'.this series shows the depth of australian mateship and the lengths they went to to help each other out. episode five 'eddies birthday' is a great example of this and it really captures the australian spirit.the music used throughout the series only emphasised the situation that the men were faced with, their longing for home and their loved ones. the numerous amusing renditions of the road to gundagai captures the spirit of the men and the fact that they never forgot home, and that it was little elements such as the singing of a song that took them home for a short while.as for the comment about it being racist towards japanese people, the only thing to be said is that you can't change what happened. the japanese did treat the australians very poorly in changi and to represent it as otherwise would be very misleading indeed. the comment about the screenplay being in accurate is also false. these six stories that are told in the series are composed from real p.o.w experiences.the actors were superb; the best being in my opinion, matthew newton. his performance as david in the first episode was gut wrenching. from being a city boy, to being another nameless face to his captors. we see him change dramatically in the first episode because of his violent attack in the jungle, and in further episodes we can see how that one event has changed him, he is more aware of what is really going on and is always one of the first to help out the other members of the secret nine.stephen curry also deserves a mention. his performance in 'eddie's birthday' is amazing, going from the larrikin of the group, to being sick, weak and unable to take care of himself. the displays of mateship in this episode touch you on an emotional level and make you proud to be australian.i study wwii at university level and have found this series, if not physically truthful, spiritually truthful, as it captures the true spirit of what it was to be an australian soldier.well done to john doyle for capturing the spirit of changi.

here we have a miniseries, which revels in in its flaws, and doesn't make us cringe because of them...it is excellent story-telling, which fuses black comedy, mateship (in a positive way), the pathetic waste of war, without the sheer unadulterated manipulation of a con-job like life is beautiful...it is an entertainment, not the meaning of life...and showcases the talents of actors both young and old...give it a go and tell us what you think...

having had a great grandfather be captured and sent to changi during world war two i was hesitant to watch this when it was first screened on tv. my great grandfather kept a diary whilst he was in captivity and when he died over there his mates bought it back and i have been lucky enough to read it and feel i have at least some idea of what changi was really like, first hand.this is a fantastic recount of what happened to those poor blokes who were sent to changi prison and shows what hardship and cruelty they witnessed in order to protect their country. it is a terrific story of mateship, commitment and aussie spirit, that never going to give up attitude. it is worth watching if you like australian history or anything to do with world war two.i enjoyed this mini very much and give it 10 out of 10.

my family and i enjoy this show and find it a fair thumb nail sketch of what the people went through.my own father spent some time in changi before going onto the thailand-burma railway in "f" force. much as been said about the treatment the pow's received, i will just say that my father was 6 foot 1 inch and 196 lbs when singapore fell, at the end of the war he was 5 foot 11 inches tall and 91 lbs.no show could truly convey what the pow's went through, but this comes closer than most.as the ex pow's say, "if you didn't have mates you didn't survive." this show succeeds in getting this message across.

of all the actresses in film today, kristin scott thomas would be my choice if i had to select one for stranding on a desert island.i could watch her simply, say, sitting in a chair for a couple of hours. so it's difficult for me to be objective completely with respect to one of her films.however, i did enjoy this movie and its story, per se, more than that indicated by the average ranking among the many persons previously commenting on this site.harrison ford is not one of the actors, though, whose performances i enjoy most. but he's one of a handful who have reached the level of moving from 7 figures to 8 per film, so who am i to argue?ford though is often droll in his acting style, and sometimes seems to be in serious need of an antacid and a shot of caffeine - and "random hearts" is in this grouping.his obsession in probing the losses, which both he and thomas have endured with regard to their linked spouses, is understandable, given his profession as a detective - but not to the level presented here. although not far, it crossed the line into the "annoying" category. however, most of the scenes after he and thomas became involved were interesting and well-played.this film could have been a 9*, but i'd lower it a couple of levels, based upon ford's overall performance, and and another, because it contained a bit more of the extraneous sub-plot elements than seemed required.

from the late sydney pollack comes a grown up love story about human nature,pain,passion and betrayal. police sergeant dutch van den broeck(harrison ford)is devastated when he learns his beloved wife has been killed in a plane crash,he's even more upset to learn of her affair with the husband of a famous congresswoman kay chandler(kristen scott thomas).he arranges to meet her and see if she knew or like he had no idea.they start to befriend each other then out of their mutual pain and distress begin an intense affair(which could be seen as healing for them both).however will the memories of the dead and pressures from their respective jobs drive them apart and cause more harm than good or can they escape the past?well you'll have to watch random hearts and find out.a moving and well acted film with a great cast.

random hearts is a very well directed, well scripted and perfectly cast actors for the primary roles. i found it to be so intense, that you have to stop and wonder in almost every scene harrison and kristin are together, how their characters deal with this horrible situation they find themselves in. very talented acting from both of them. a lot of people i believe who did not appreciate the movie for what it was, did not get the point of the movie or could not even fathom a situation like theirs.(please skip this next part if you have not seen the movie yet)i loved the ending, which was a great surprise which tied the whole movie. it was relieving to see how these two good persons can come out actually happier in the end.

i must be getting old because i was riveted to this movie from the first time i saw it. i'm watching it again right now on hbo. it's a very simple film about 2 people that fall in love after they found out that there spouses were having an affair. plot is very thin, but the actors acted very well in this movie. in the mix of kristen scott thomas running for congress and harrison ford being an internal affairs cop, these two meet, under unfortunate circumstances and fall in love. i love the soundtrack. perfect fit. one thing i can't figure out, this movie had a budget of $68 million dollars. were was it spent? the plane crash or harrison ford's salary?

random hearts snuck up on me. criticized for the implausibility of a) the premise and b) the pairing of an ia cop and a congresswoman, as well as for its slowness, the film felt just fine to me , and even ended up being surprisingly absorbing. i found my interest engaged as the film cut back and forth between ford's and thomas's lives as they first found out about, and dealt in very different ways in very different environments with, their spouses' deaths and the subsequent revelation that they were involved with other people. it could happen; two people's philandering spouses could be on the same plane, the plane could go down, the survivors could be brought together by the aftermath. so what if it's improbable? improbable is not the same as far-fetched. so..what if it did happen? why not speculate? ford's and thomas's performances are believable and nuanced. instead of finding their coupling implausible (opposite sides of the tracks--give me a break) i felt it driven by a grief and betrayal neither party knew how to deal with. the script does not bring them together too soon or too easily, and the end of the film does not resolve their relationship conventionally, either. where i find it unsatisfying is when the dialogue brings up interesting wrinkles in or insights into the ramifications of the situation, personal and professional, but never seems to pursue any of them very far. and if you make the mistake of thinking about it too hard, harrison ford does seem about 10 years too old for the part.for five and a half bucks at wal-mart, with full length director commentary and behind-the-scenes featurette, the dvd is well worth owning. i don't think i would pay $20 for it on a bet, but my wife might. ok, ten...

i admit i have been a fan of harrison ford for many, many years now so it didn't surprise me that i enjoyed his performance here. but i also enjoyed the way the storyline developed and thought the casting was well done. i don't know whether i "buy into" kristin scott thomas as a congresswoman but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman. i took notice of her in the first mission impossible. although her part was small she stuck out on the screen.here her and ford play people whose spouses are killed in an airplane crash. they are seated together and this is where the plot takes off. apparently ford, a police detective in wash d.c., discovers that his wife was having an affair. he further discovers that the affair was with the husband of a new england congresswoman.the story takes on many subplots as ford and thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their marriages, the uncovering of deceipt, and the pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one.i think the movie is worthwhile either renting or catching on cable.

true, there are some goofs, for the one who wants to find them. they're not important, though.the primary feature of this film is watching veteran expert actors do their craft. kristin scott thomas is beautiful and plays well the part of a strong woman, but one who has been hurt. same for harrison ford, who, for the ladies, is just as beau as kristin is belle for us guys.their hurt at the hands of their adulterous spouses brings them together in an awkward manner, but one in which they find support in each other. how they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity within on th screen is why these are such sought performers. the viewer cannot help but feel what they feel, nor can one help wanting to cheer them when they're together.yes, there are several action scenes involving angry corrupt cops, but they only spice it up a little, and are not a significant part of the movie.for the lover of music, dave grusin provides a superb jazz based background, featuring trumpeter terrence blanchard. like the actors, grusin shows why he is one of the most sought musical consultants in the movie business. blanchard shows why he's one the premiere trumpeters on the scene.not a movie for the lovers of guts, blood, and gore. but for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside, watch a beautiful english actress with big expressive blue eyes who can act, like harrison ford, to the endless soothing accompaniment courtesy of dave grusin and terrence blanchard, this is a move to watch with someone you love. preferably in bed.i thought it deserved at least an 8.

as a fan of history, mythology, and fantasy "mystic knights" show pulled me in from the get-go. it has semi-decent scripting, the costumes are fantastic (there are exceptions), it has pretty good acting, and the heroes and villains all play well off each other.scripts--half a script is pretty great, the other half falls flat, but its all mixed together, meaning many episodes turn out so-so. also, some of the key players are repeatedly being given dead lines (king conchobar and angus for instance) they need to be given something... more. i'm not sure what but the writers should be able to come up with something. acting--apart from some over acting by villagers (horrid lines they end up putting too much effort into), casting did extremely well in choosing their leads and so on. everyone, good and bad, works well together! costumes/weapons--the everyday clothes that everyone wears are spectacular! mystic knight armor that falls short are deirdre's and garrett's. a chainmail bikini would probably have better protection in her case... and wouldn't look as plastic; his looks like bunch of snap-it-together pieces of brown plastic, when it should look bronze. ivar's trident looks like it was bought at a discount store and while garretts weapons look cool, they also look plastic.recently "mystic knights" has taken on too many "power rangers" traits, if you watch the show, you'll know what i mean. as the series progresses, though, it should find its niche and perfect its style. overall, it is a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy (most of my friends and i watch it and we're all 20+). the plot thickens and twists, though it gets a bit juvenile in places, and everything just keeps getting more interesting. it might be of some interest to fans of the movie "willow" or the t.v. series "the adventures of sinbad". a lot of adventure, a dab of mystery, a dash of romance, a sprinkling of forces at nature... check it out! (my score: 7/10)

this show is a show that is great for adults and children to sit down together and watch. the stories are a little slow for adults but they are still good. there are lots of children in my family, boys and girls, and it is hard to get them all to agree on what to watch, but they always agree with each other when they want to watch the mystic knights. it is a wonderful show and i hope that they will continue to keep making it. all of the kids in my family and myself think that vincent walsh is the best of them all. we have seen that he has done lots of other work and think that he is doing a great job. we wish all of the actors, actresses, writers, directors, and producers the best of luck and would just like to say keep up the good work.

years ago, i didn't love and respect the films of jimmy cagney nearly as much as i do now. i noticed that many of cagney's films done with warner brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and his acting style was far from subtle. however, the more i watched these films, the more i found i was hooked despite these aspects. in fact, i now kind of like and expect them! fans of old time hollywood films probably understand what i am saying--teens and other young whippersnappers don't! well, when it comes to entertainment, the mayor of hell never lets up from start to finish. while the idea of a shady character like cagney played taking over running a reform school is ridiculous, and while all the changes he made also seemed far-fetched, it all somehow worked out and delivered solid entertainment.the gang of tough thugs were pre-dead end kids and instead of the likes of leo gorcey, huntz hall and billy hallop, similar roles are played here by frankie darrow and farina. yes, i did say "farina". this black actor was already famous for his roles in the our gang comedies and was, believe it or not, one of the highest paid child actors in hollywood. all he needed to give up in return was be named an insipid name and act like a nice stereotypical "negro". here, he actually was pretty good and the usual black stereotypes are a bit more subdued than usual. however, some will cringe at the very funny but horribly offensive court scene involving farina and his dad, fred 'snowflake' toones. with awful names like "farina" and "snowflake", don't say i didn't warn you.apart from this small complaint and a plot that is tough to believe, the film is exceptional and fun. the kids do a great job, as does cagney and dudley digges in a truly despicable but exciting role as the evil warden. also, as an added plus, you get to see perennial warner stock actor allen jenkins in his first role for the studio.

when i first heard that the subject matter for checking out was a self orchestrated suicide party, my first thought was how morbid, tasteless and then a comedy on top of that. i was skeptical. but i was dead wrong. i totally loved it. the cast, the funny one liners and especially the surprise ending. suicide is a delicate issue, but it was handled very well. comical yes, but tender where it needed to be. checking out also deals with other common issues that i believe a lot of families can relate with and it does with tact and humor. i highly recommend checking out. a must see. i look forward to its release to the public.

peter is top notch, he is acting, and looking great. feels like watching a live play, great camera works, and i was sad it was over. can not wait until it is on the big screen. super cast, this could be a big hit. i like the way the kids interact as sister and two brothers, really made me think of my own brothers going through a situation like what peter, the happy father who thinks he will end his life after a big party... the colors and sets were delightful to the eyes, helps so much to draw you into the film/play... i was so happy to see peter not be colombo, this guy could always act, and now this is a movie that gives him that range. i recommend you take your family to this movie. perhaps the teenagers will not get much from this, no guns, fast cars, dumb lines, stupid fart jokes... but your adult kids will love it. good show for a night with them. jason

peter falk shines as 90 year old morris applebaum, the patriarch who has decided it's time to "check out" after holding a final, blow-out bash. his three children, lauran san giacomo, david paymer and judge reinhold are notified/invited by letter and immediately arrive on his doorstep to deal with their eccentric father. there is a great father/daughter chemistry with laura san giacomo, whose character happens to undergo the most growth from the ordeal. it's a well rounded example of your average, dysfunctional family and their memories, pains, growth and ignorance/tolerance of each others' lives. the musical score is one you'll enjoy and the one liners are well timed and hilarious. although i found the actual "checking out" party a let down, the rest of the film is sure to make you laugh, cry and leave the theater with a smile on your face. move over "big fat greek wedding"....the "big fat jewish suicide" has arrived.

a wonderful story that should be seen by all families. the story, acting, and production values are all first rate. i highly recommend "checking out!"peter falk is marvelous as an aging actor who wants to decide when he will die, so he can continue to know how things will end and not be "a member of the audience." his three children rush to new york to confront him and try to change his mind. there are, of course unresolved family issues to be addressed, and the script and actors handle them well and with great humor. the story is about a jewish family, but it could easily be about any other family. well, maybe not a wasp family. the siblings have issues with each other and also with their father. i loved the writing and directing, as well as the acting. all in all, a humorous and touching film.

i just saw this film at the phoenix film festival today and loved it. the synopsis was listed in our program as "an old shakespearean actor invites his three children to his suicide party". i wasn't sure if i was going to see it because when i read about it i liked the idea of a "suicide party" it sounded very interesting to me, but "old shakespearean actor" had me worried that the film would be kind of dry and boring. but i decided to give it a try. i am glad that i did. it was not dry and boring in the least, that dialogue was great, funny in a clever way, but not pretentious and difficult to understand. peter falk was terrific in this role, he stole the show. i also was pleasantly surprised by laura san giacomo's performance, usually she bugs me, but i enjoyed watching her in this film very much. i think judge reinhold's part could have been done better by another actor, at times he seemed kind of cheesy and it looked like acting, not like you were just watching this character. but the movie was so good i was able to forgive one actor's awkwardness. i would recommend this film to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public. who knew suicide could be so hilarious?

i too was fortunate enough to see "checking out" with peter falk at the phoenix film festival. this is an extremely sweet character driven film that leaves the audience enthralled in the applebaum's plight in life. more than funny, each character in the family contributes priceless comic relief that not only spurs laughter but inspires a few joyful tears as well. peter falk was born to play this role. he plays a 90ish "young" father of three who brings his adult children together in what could possibly be one of the most important times in his and their lives. the 2 day journey that the applebaum family takes though the delightful backdrop of new york (with carefully selected characters), not only leaves the audience wanting more, but nourishes ones own sense of family. "checking out" is a must see film, not only for all those who cherish family, but also all those who don't!!! my thanks to the director who took the chance to bring this gift to its audience. robin sly, scottsdale, arizona

i just saw "checking out" at the philadelphia film festival. what a terrific combination of a heartwarming storyline and a great cast. director jeff hare has done an outstanding job of inviting the audience into the disjointed, yet hilarious world of morris applebaum and family. the family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy the crazy antics yet feel the real pain and concern they have for one another.typically i am not a peter falk fan, but he is morris applebaum and plays the role with great humor and humanity.i hope that everyone gets to see this wonderful movie and enjoy it as i did.hats off to the director, cast, and crew for a job well done!

the timing of this film being released could not be better, particularly in light of all the turmoil in this world today. the film is a heartwarming, endearing and witty a piece. if you have siblings and still have parents alive, this will hit home well for the viewer. if you've lost your parents, then it will touch you deeply. the laughs come frequently, the ensemble cast works very well together and are believable. this film is intelligently written and the lines that come from each of the actors make the viewer laugh out loud frequently. there are moments that will bring tears to your eyes as well. i would recommend this film to anyone who respects the importantce of family and can follow an intelligent film.

morris and reva applebaum had been the toast of broadway in its heyday. at ninety, morris is a widower. he summons his sons--the psychotherapist and the bmw car dealer--and his daughter, the television writer/producer--to attend a party in his honor, after which he will euthanize himself. literal-minded creatures that they are, they take what he says at face value. he leads them, his grandchildren, and some others including an african-american-jewish psychiatrist reminiscent of godfrey cambridge, on a merry chase through manhattan as they try to stop him or dissuade him.the comedy totally works. the performances are excellent. peter falk is in top form. this film does more than deserve an audience: it deserves popular success.

'checking out' is an extraordinary film that towers above most film production. its refreshing, witty humor is never an excuse to remain superficial. to the contrary, the film explores multifarious facets of the human spirit and human relations. its warm approach promotes tolerance and acceptance of diversity and recognition of that which unites all people. the characters are charming and amusing, reflecting those idiosyncrasies that we can all laugh about in ourselves. the quick dialog and witty banter will keep you on your toes, and you may find yourself trying to contain your own laughter, as you won't want to miss a single phrase! you'll probably want to see it in the cinema and then again (over several more times) on video, and each time you will discover something new. after each viewing, you are sure to feel warm and uplifted.

"checking out" is a very witty and honest portrayal of a bizarre family that happens to be jewish. judaism plays virtually no role in the film, but american jewish culture & behavior gets thoroughly sent up... it a loving way. i wish the movie dealt with the religious perspective on the topics it explores, because i think that would have been interesting. i've never been a columbo fan so i wasn't familiar with peter falk - he's a lot of fun to watch. it's great to see judge reinhold, laura san giacomo & david paymer again - why don't they work more? they're all hilarious. the script is terrific with a lot of memorable one-liners i'll be sure to use with my own family. watch for gavin mcleod (captain stubing!) as the doorman.

i was fortunate enough to catch this film at the phoenix film festival and i must say that i very much enjoyed it. when i asked the director if he had attended film school i was very much impressed that he had not. films like these don't come from people without talent. to get a start in commercials and then produce a heart felt family comedy like this shows real range. i'll certainly be keeping an eye on what he does next. as a good indie movie should, the film is very character driven. as apposed to your average hollywood movie, which are mostly plot driven. the film centers on a jewish family in new york, the applebaum's, who have all been invited back for their fathers "suicide" party. the film is stock full of witty, quick, jabbing, dialogue. the fact the small jewish family is obsessed with being jewish and anyone who is jewish grounds the unrealistic situation of a "suicide" party in reality. director jeff hare does a wonderful job at pulling the characters out of the actors and bringing them to life on screen. the production design brings the sets to life with lots of attention paid to small details making the setting feel like a home that's been lived in for 40 years. the editing keeps up with the dialogue in such a way that it makes you sit on your seat wondering who's going to stab who with the next witty phrase or punch line. and when appropriate the film slows down to let the audience dive a little deeper into the meanings and motivations hidden inside these lovable characters. if you're a fan of woody allen or films like "as good as it gets" go see this film.

at the 2005 phoenix film festival, it was no secret which film ranked at the top of everyone's viewing list. checking out (2004)brought crowds of film lovers to scottsdale's harkins cine-capri. festival attendees who waited in line for hours, were turned away at the door, despite the two-theater screening capacity.checking out (2004) is a beautifully-made moving picture; an inspiring comedy for a wide-range of audiences to enjoy. the director, jeff hare, blends traditional film technique with a new twist of creativity, capturing peter falk at his greatest and most sentimental moments (usually shown in intimate close-up shots) on the silver screen.with its uplifting mix of witty humor and narrative plot development, checking out (2004) is a landmark independent film, well-deserving of your attention.

it was a rare treat to see "checking out". i was touched by the characters, laughed a lot at the wonderful script, and was deeply moved by the genuine emotions magnificently portrayed by this ensemble cast and especially by peter falk. in fact, one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children where he tells of his experience of his life, his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life going forward is so profoundly real that it is at the highest level of the best academy award-winning performances. he is a consummate actor who out-did himself in this film. the screenwriter offers a combination of literary knowledge, timing, a gift for dialogue and hilarious situations that had me laughing out loud in the theater. i highly recommend "checking out" to everyone wanting to enjoy quality storytelling superbly acted.

this wonderfully witty comedy-drama wowed the crowd at the philadelphia film festival, whipping them into wild applause at its conclusion. buttressed by adept performances by a nuanced cast, sturdy execution by director jeff hare, a brisk pace, and one of peter falk's best performances in years, the film emerges as a loving homage to the highs and woes of family life.falk excels as jewish ninetysomething morris applebaum, a wildly eccentric shakespearean thespian who decides to end his life, but not before rounding up his three grown children and throwing a "big fat jewish suicide party." the film brims with indelible delights. there's morris's "tushy room"; laura san giacomo's passionate rendering of morris's cynical daughter; rapid-fire comedic dialogue that recalls the work of neil simon and woody allen; the wry timing of david paymer, who plays morris's tightly wound psychotherapist son; and morris's patented egg creams (but be careful, drinking them too fast will cause a nasty brain freeze). it's all enveloped in a feel-good, intimate atmosphere set in new york city.director jeff hare proves to be a master craftsman, drawing out memorable performances from his cast and lending the film a mirthful humanity. i was fortunate to see an earlier film by hare: the dark and powerful "perfect little man," starring neal mcdonough ("minority report") as a los angeles man spiraling into madness. the visceral grit of "perfect" and the nostalgic breeze of "checking out" are a testament to hare's eclecticism and wide-ranging talent. i'm looking forward to checking out his future work.i heard "checking out" lacks a distributor at this point. some wise company would do well to pick up this crowd-pleasing gem, for it's a potential box-office titan in the vein of "my big fat greek wedding." most nobly, it would give people around the world a chance to experience the joys of this movie.

sometimes a movie is so bad it's kind of good. this movie was made in germany and is dubbed in english, so you have to get past that. the acting also was stilted and forced, other than what was done by the real rats, who imo did an excellent job of acting the part. snaps to the rat wrangler. anyway, the mayor of the city has decided to cut costs and the local garbage collectors go on strike as a result, thus leaving large piles of trash everywhere. this storyline has been used before, not to mention has happened in real life (too often unfortunately) and the audience is not in for any surprises. but this is fine. we know what's going to happen and when, and sometimes an audience needs a movie where a lot of brain cells are not necessary to follow along. we have our hero, down to the chiseled face and body, the semi-hero(s), and of course our heroine, who happens to be the doctor, but only still in training, though it is she who discovers what really is going on when so many people end up sick and dying, and not just from a rat bite. of course the villain must die (okay, all the villains, meaning the rats), and the ending scene is one of those that reminds the audience that a sequel is in the works. this is one of those movies that you just sit back and enjoy for what it is and what it is not.

this movie was recently shown subtitled not dubbed, on australia's special broadcasting service. i thought i read here that there is sometimes an assumption that *revenge of the rats* is a sequel. in fact, the rats are getting revenge for something that is done within this movie, or in human history. there is no prequel as far as i know.now, let's get the pied piper of hamelin out of the way. perhaps this tale crossed my mind when i was watching the film, but that's all. there was the use of the word "coffers" at the end of the movie. a dazed mayor tries to justify her actions by saying "the coffers were empty". "coffers" isn't a word you hear around much these days, unless you read folk tales to your children, as i do. since seeing *revenge of the rats*, i've read two versions of the pied piper of hamelin. now i see the comparison. a metaphorical fat but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford, to get rid of the rats. this is about as far as i can follow the analogy. the children are not led to a door in a mountain, with one lame boy left behind to tell of a land of winged horses and fountains, where it is always spring and everyone is always happy.there's a lot that is quite mainstream about this movie. the romance and the resolution especially. the female characters have potentially powerful roles in society but are really quite impotent. where this film is quite rebellious (as compared with american cinema) is that it is anti-authoritarian. the helicopter pilot is sacked by the mayor for "doing good". the mayor and local government are portrayed as corrupt and pandering to big money. finally, it is left to one doctor in frankfurt to solve an epidemic of a fatal and contagious disease. apparently there is no national infectious diseases authority to co-ordinate things or send in back-up.i'm not a horror aficionado, so any horror i do see is usually mingled with humour. right from the rat in the blood bank you can see this is going to have the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers; the huge number of rats is impressive and the horror fans seem to be satisfied too.
