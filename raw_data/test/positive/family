this the the final feature film that michelangelo antonioni directed, with the help of wim wenders, and adapts from his short story collection "that bowling alley on the tiber". beyond the clouds contain 4 short stories with familiar themes that we've come to be accustomed to from his earlier works, and sums up those themes in vignettes which are weaved together via wenders' directed scenes involving john malkovich's the director character. however, most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth that we're used to from an antonioni movie, while malkovich's narration of supposed depth rattled on with unclear diction that sounded a tad pretentious and out of place.nonetheless, all four stories seem to touch on chance encounters, and extremely quick romances that played out more like lust at first sight, perhaps due to the lack of time (since they're short stories anyway) to allow for a more layered approach to carefully define and craft the characters as we know from a typical antonioni movie. and the obsessive approach here is for the characters to disrobe to showcase a lack of deeper connection sacrificed for the immediate satisfaction of the flesh. maybe this is the point to want to bring across with an observation of the more modern relationship?the first story, story of a love affair that never existed, tells the romance between silvano (kim rossi stuart) and carmen (ines sastre), who meet when one asks the other for directions to a hotel, and later meet at a cafe. it's as if fate is playing games on them when they meet, but part and meet again much later, but like the games people play, it's almost like a l'avventura or a la notte with the lack of communication, and of the expectations from the man.john malkovich's director character takes central role in the next short, who exhibited some really lecherous looks toward a girl working at a shop, played by sophie marceau. she is deeply disturbed and made to feel uncomfortable, but somehow plucked up the courage to approach him, and in what i thought was to scare him off, tells him her background that she murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times. but in a flash these two are off toward bedroom gymnastics.the next short, don't look for me, is the longest of the lot, with peter weller playing a cheating husband who has to choose between his mistress (chiara caselli) or his wife, played by fanny ardant. perhaps the more star studded of the lot, with jean reno also stepping in for a coda at the end of it, which sort of expands the little universe in which this short exists. but unfortunately reno's involvement also got relegated to some stifle of laughter as it goes into the implausible domain with laser quick romantic tanglements. there was a key element adapted from l'eclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel too, while the introductory tale about the story of souls was quite interesting. if there's a negative theme here this short wants to play upon, it'll be the duplicity of man.in between this short and the next was a small scene which reunited our couple from la notte, marcello mastroianni and jeanne moreau, where the former was painting a landscape which was reminiscent of that in red desert. finally, we have the final shot this body of dirt, with vincent perez as a young man going after a girl (irene jacob) whom he just met, and falling in love with her, only to realize that it is a love that is too late. it's a relatively talkie piece, just like the first story, with the characters engaging in conversation while walking the streets of the city they're in, which sort of brings to mind richard linklater's before sunrise.while on the whole the movie may have succeeded as individual pieces, they never quite measure up as a combined effort given the "excuse" to link them up was a film director's exploration of possible stories and a look for inspiration for his next film.

even though the story is light, the movie flows so beautifully and its visual so tranquil and poetic that it could almost carry the whole movie.the film consists of four interconnected stories, all about different aspect of attraction between man and/or woman and how it frequently is ethereal. their true desire seems to be always something that they cannot hold onto, it will flow out like a handful of sand.i thought the most intriguing story was the last one where the more unattainable the woman was, the more the man desires her. it parallels her deep love for god, who is infinitely out of reach, but never closer to her heart.a very good movie. 7/10

i saw this film for the first time last night. i have been thinking about it all night and this morning. i cannot say that it was my favorite film, at least not yet. i need to see it again. the cinematography is stunning. each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a film that has wim wenders's name attached to it.it is always tempting to see de chirico in any picture of rows of orders vanishing into the gloom, but in this case the analogy fits. in many ways the figure of malkovich walking through the fog and wind of ferarra echoes the shadow of the off-canvas statue that haunts milan in the major works of the italo-greek painter. he is slightly menacing, a presence who watches and, in his capacity as a film director, exerts influence on the entire story. the dedicated wenders fan cannot help but think a little bit of damiel and cassiel wandering through the streets of berlin, watching all but not directly interacting with the inhabitants. and, following the himmel uber berlin metaphor, the angel (or in this case malkovich the director) gets to interact with one of the stories. at this point i have to bow out of taking this line of criticism too far. i need to see the movie again. i am fairly sure that this is the thread that will bring malkovich's monologue together. perhaps his musings and pontifications are pretentious, empty dialog that sound good but cannot possibly be parsed into real communication. maybe that is the whole point of it. no one can make that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until having done his homework.we must be careful when throwing around the word "pretentious." it is easy to write off anything that smacks of the intellect as pretension, but that leads to a terrifying mental state, one in which the only conversation seen as genuine, earthy or authentic is the most banal. when we shun all discussions of philosophy, god, existence, meaning and all that brain candy, we are setting our culture up to die a slow, stupid and ugly death. perhaps this is the warning that wenders and antonioni are giving us. it certainly is not the only theme of the film, but i think that it cannot be ignored.the other (and most obvious) leitmotif is that of satisfaction. there is a lot here on that, and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif would well exceed the 1000 word limit for this review.my advice is to see the film. but i offer a caveat: it is not an autonomous film (at least i don't think so yet). some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the zeitgeist before approaching the film. par-dela les nuages is one of those films.

i was stunned by this film. i have been renting antonioni's films/rediscovering them, and this film showed me the climax and fruits of his 50 years of directing. what an eye for setting, color, and detail! i have never seen such visual beauty and poetry filmed before. i had to stop after the first story and hold back the tears. yes, beauty moves me, like it moved keats to write ode on a grecian urn. this movie is made for the mature, emotionally and intellectually, audience. those hoping to see physical action and soap opera will be disappointed. i will have to see this film several times before i can truly appreciate it and judge it. this film should be required viewing for all cinematographers and directors.possibly a truly great film, on the order of kurosawa's dreams.

beyond the clouds is in many ways the weirdest film i have ever seen. not for its cult appeal, gore, or even for its ideas, but because of the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema. beyond the clouds was directed by michelangelo antonioni, one of italy's most famous directors. however, if you gave this film only a quick watch-over, passively i mean, it would seem one of those melodramatic and often pointless romances. this movie deserves great attention, to the point of embracing all its cheese. by cheese i don't mean a slice, but a whole brick of cheddar! the music seems like it's from some italian porno, the story and dialogue like they are from a corny japanese soap, and the metaphors are so obvious you want to smack yourself on the head.but once you get passed all this, you are engaged in an existential work of art. the cheese feeds into the subtle filming and draws our attention, perfectly, to what needs to be known. the basic plot is of four chapters, unrelated, and all about love. what we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said, people cannot communicate to each other. instead they can only communicate through each other. i suppose that's why the dialogue and plot is so cheesy, because the conversations are overly irrational with lack of causality and people's reaction overly melodramatic.i left that film thinking to myself; maybe all life is one big melodrama. we judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful. i hate, because i have reason. but what does the hated think? maybe they think that my hate is stupid and arbitrary. in other words, melodramatic.so melodrama is actually an existential function. a corny romance is simply human interaction put under a magnifying glass, allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we do.this is a great film, i recommend it to all!

i'm not really sure what to make of this movie, especially after seeing a great film like la notte. unfortunately i saw this in german during an antonioni film festival at the frankfurt film museum, so i didn't get to hear malkovich's great voice. he is supposed to tie together four stories about couples in italy. however, as good an actor as he is, malkovich cannot rescue the most ridiculous of the four stories portrayed here: a woman who comes up to him at a waterside cafe near a shop she owns and blurts out about how she killed her father nearby. then the two of them go home, have sex, and he leaves. it seems as if antonioni lost the subtlety had in earlier films (like the passenger) when dealing with sex and replaced it with blatant nudity.however nonsensical the storyline is, the film features two things that make it watchable: eye and ear candy. the actors and actresses are all beautiful people, and the cinematography is marvelous - scenes in old italian cities contrasting with a bit in a tall apartment building overlooking a city (reminiscent of la notte).the ear candy, however, is what really makes the film worth watching. u2 and brian eno collaborated on "your blue room" and "beach sequence," both of which set the mood perfectly in the film. the songs are available on "passengers: original soundtracks 1."

i was stunned by this film. afterwards, i didn't even want to see any films for a long time- any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison.for many, it may be the worst of antonioni- very slow, without an engaging conventional story line, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions- and the worst of wenders- verbose, confused transcendentalism. it is composed of short distinct episodes linked by wenders' typical meandering hero's stream of consciousness, so it doesn't produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema.but for fans, the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film. wenders and antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things.

this is a special film if you know the context. antonioni, in his eighties, had been crippled by a stroke. mute and half paralyzed, his friends -- who incidentally are the best the film world has -- arranged for him to 'direct' a last significant film. the idea is that he can conjure a story into being by just looking at it. so we have a film: about a director who conjures stories by simple observation. and the matter of the (four) stories is about how the visual imagination defines love.the film emerges by giving us the tools to bring it into being through our own imagination. the result is pure movie-world: every person (except the director) is lovely in aspect or movement. some of these women are ultralovely, and they exist in a dreamy misty world of sensual encounter. there is no nuance, no hint that anything exists but what we see; no desire is at work other than what we create.i know of no other film that so successfully manipulates our own visual yearning to have us create the world we see. he understands something about not touching. no one understands van morrison visually like he does. morrison's celtic space music is predicated on precisely the same notion: the sensual touch that implies but doesn't physically touch.antonioni's redhead wife appears, appropriately as the shopkeeper and she also directs a lackluster 'making of' film that is on the dvd.ted's evaluation -- 3 of 4: worth watching.

i first saw the movie a couple of years ago and was totally and utterly impressed but its sensuality. it is one of the most touching films i have ever seen, though it might appear a little bit pretentious and artificial - too much beautiful, if you will. anyway, one thing is for sure - the camera man has done a great job - each picture deserves to be cut off the film and displayed as a separate peace of art, comparable to the chirico's or bernard buffet's paintings.the music forms a perfect background for the story, especially u2's one played between the first and the second novels at the beach scene. as for the casting - i cannot be objective since i like sophie marceau and jean renaue very much and cannot add more to the praising comments of others.however, the very fact that many people (critics and those sophisticated in cinema) criticized the movie made me watch it with a more critical eye for the second time. no doubt, the setting is splendid and the casting is gorgeous. but this is somehow not enough to make a comprehensive and cohesive film. the second novel (when sophie marceau tells her story to malcovic is somehow superficial and does not tell much about the motivations of the people involved - was it only about shooting a beautiful and sensual love scene with the naked marceau or what?). apparently, it does not add anything to the idea of the movie and even the husky voice of malcovic is being unable to link it to the main plot.other stories are more justified and are really beautifully shot, which indulges many of the logic fallacies within them. the scene when jean reneau is overlooking the city through the huge window of his apartment on the top of the high building is absolutely incredible. the feeling of moist air and fine haze, which is being spread by the first "ferrera" scene can literally be sensed through the screen. no doubt, antonioni is a great master of shades and semi-shades. my favorite novel is the last one - the most romantic, deep and meaningful - i guess that it the most antonioni-like one in the whole movie - almost a parable.probably, the overall positive impression from the movie is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small ghotic italian town, with its winding narrow streets and crooked pavements, fountains with the l'eau potable and monumental cathedrals... it was laconic but really touching.i hope that my impressions and comments on the movie, however chaotic they are would motivate somebody to spend an evening watching it (it works better with the home theater, having somebody caring by your side, than in the movie theater). enjoy.i beg your pardon for the imperfect english and any possible misspellings

here's another antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or dvd. i saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time (even in metropolitan movie capital l.a.!)for a couple of weeks and then disappeared (art house audiences seem to have opted for their own special territory, where older favorites like antonioni and resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosities).at first i was disappointed, thought the pace to be unbearably boring, and that the man had lost a chance (for years antonioni had found it difficult to find financing)at an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his canon; but knowing antonioni for what he was and how i had at first reacted to blow-up and the passenger, i refused to pass judgment until i had seen the film again. i went back the next day and i should not have been surprised that the film kept pulling me in, making me aware of things i had thought about and lost track of throughout my life, driving home, in a contemporary setting, points exposed for the first time some forty years ago in 'l'aventurra,' forming an environment of subtle moods so characteristcally and fascinatingly alienated in tone (and quite comedic actually) that i couldn't get enough. the scene with malkovich sitting on the fancy colored swings on the windswept beach, with the weather so beautifully silver skied, and the eno/u2 track in the background flowing through at just its rhythm, had been my favorite; it still was, but now the whole film was just as great! what a strange phenomenon, the complex simplicity or the invisible complex which antonioni's eye alone seems to be able to pick up and communicate. the odd thing is, though it does look at first glance like a softcore porno of some kind and it does feature plenty of sex and the maddeningly gorgeous sophie marceau and plently of other international stars to distract you, this film is unmistakably antonioni's to its core, but you will not sense to what a profound extent, until you have seen it a few times and got used to its rhythm. for example, it is quite a funny film with a deep sense of humor, something i did not notice at first, but was turned on to by another critic, and noticed to much delight on further viewings (4 before they pulled it and would've gone back for more). if this film had been promoted right and people guided to a certain extent as to how to approach it, i have no doubt it would have succeeded on the art house circuit like most of antonioni's '60s films. but the '60s are no more and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen where half its beauty will be lost even in a letterboxed dvd version (if and when it's released). i urge all film nuts general or esoteric to see 'beyond the clouds' and add a piece of magic to the tragic.

beyond the clouds is a hauntingly beautiful, elegiac work of art. the overall softness of the light that this movie is bathed in, makes you want to touch the screen. the autumnal mood conjured up could only been achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience. or, to put it another way, an old man. i know of no other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal mood with such ravishing quality as beyond the clouds. nearly all the people in this film are beautiful, unless your idea of a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blond bimbo, that is. the dialogue doesn't really matter too much, not that there is much of it anyway, and as for storylines, forget it. some films exist just as visual experiences, this is one of them. don't bother if you want "simple entertainment",this not for you. i could enthuse about the visual perfection of this movie for days, but i won't. if you are at all interested in cinematography, photography, film direction etc., watch this film.

like a lot of horror fans out there that went looking for the next great scare flick, we plundered the asian horror market for whatever we could get our hands on, leaving no dark haired ghost lady unturned. we had good reason to do so, the asian market had spawned such terrifying wonders as ringu, dark waters, juon - the grudge, and a tale of two sisters. by the time takashi miike started ripping the mick out of the genre with one missed call in 2003, the market seemed to be drying up, leaving it open for mockery and derision, despite the continued hollywood remake machine working full steam ahead. now, don't get me wrong, there were still plenty of good asian horrors being made, the likes of marebito and shutter, to mention but two, will stand as minor genre classics some day. but the lank haired ghost lady had definitely had her feed at the party, and was time to take that success-drunk tramp home to bed! then along comes a film like noroi - the curse. a film that is smart enough to pay subtle homage to it's roots, yet throws the rulebook out the window whilst doing it. what i'm about to describe in terms of plot will probably make you think there is nothing new here at all. the film is a documentary about one of japan's top paranormal investigators as he receives stories and tip offs on ghostly goings on. he starts investigating the claims by a woman that she regularly hears a baby crying in the house next door, yet there is no baby there, apart from a middle aged woman and her son. these two disappear sharpish when the reporter pokes his nose around, but strange other coincidences start popping up. a psychic young girl, a mentally ill clairvoyant, a pretty young actress who had a strange vision, a lot of dead pigeons, and a very sinister demon by the name of kagutaba, leading to a truly terrifying showdown in a small historical town...to say any more on the plot might ruin the fun a bit. the film is shot in 'faux documentary' fashion, and incorporates footage from tv shows and news reports, and the labels via subtitles lets you know where you are in terms of the time line. the film has drawn more than a few comparisons to the blair witch project, but apart from the shooting format and the creepy trip through the woods late at night, the comparison ends there really.what is refreshing about noroi is how it doesn't pander to modern horror audiences. if you are expecting croaky ghost ladies to pop out of the attic, look elsewhere. the film's strength lies in it's slow, gradual build up of terror, a terror so profound that it will stick with you for days after watching it. the climax is pretty damned freaky, but just when you think the film is over, you get treated to the 'real' ending when the credits start to roll, and sweet holy f*ck, is it a killer. in terms of acting, it is mostly convincing. you get some 'comedy' relief from the crazy, tin foil covered clairvoyant, but that soon dries up half way through the film. the film also has a slightly 'nastier' feel than a lot of asian ghost horror, as there is a violent streak to some of the events too.overall, noroi is one to watch on your own, late at night. not since my first viewing of ringu ten years ago have i been so delightfully creeped out watching a horror film. it is one that will itch away at you until it is too late, then it is under your skin. just let yourself go to this one completely. and not a lank haired ghost lady in sight?? no wonder it has barely been released outside of japan, let alone had an american remake lined up yet. check this one out if you can, essential viewing in my books!

another hand-held horror means another divisive movie that fans should still seek out and make up their own minds about.imagine a cross between the blair witch project and the grudge and you're close to the overall content of this movie. it's another videotaped horror but this time most of it is edited together in readiness for a video doc that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappeared.i certainly had a feeling of dread while watching this movie (does anyone do dreadful better than our asian friends?) but the creepy moments, the genuinely creepy moments, were sadly a bit fewer and farther between than i had hoped. i also felt that i was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent "revelations" appeared throughout so i certainly can't recommend this as highly as [*rec].having said that, it would be remiss of me not to highly recommend any film that goes on at length about ectoplasmic worms, contains at least two subtly spooky ghost moments and made sure that i had to put the lights back on for a while when the sun went down.check it out if you have been enjoying some of the other hand-held genre releases of late. and the finale is a hair-raising doozy.see this if you like: the last broadcast, pulse, angel heart.

a documentary filmmaker explores seemingly unrelated paranormal incidents connected by the legend of an ancient demon called the "kagutaba."from the looks of it, the film looks like one of those camcorder movies that have been popular these last few months, even one that's going to be released next week (paranormal activity)! however, unlike movies like cloverfield, rec, and blair witch, where most of those movies are in complete chaos and mayhem with all of the shakiness, this one is basically shown in a traditional documentary style. it has tv excerpts and interviews and the scares are very subtle, well, excluding the last 20 minutes where we go into the chaos effect and where the fear factor is raised up tremendously.and it works. the film is very engrossing and it makes you think. yes, you heard me right: it makes you think. you have to pay attention to those unrelated details given throughout the film and the payoff is great when, in course of the film, these things start to intertwine one another. the film is also very slow moving, which, in this case, is a good thing. we, as the audience, get to absorb the details shown on screen, however subtle or blatant they are.above all, it's a frightening little film. i'm a person who is scared of ghosts and the paranormal more than killers who slashes away teenage victims so yes, the film gave me some nightmares. there are some images in here that are really disturbing to watch, including one closer in the end where it makes you go "what am i looking at?!" well, it's better left unanswered. there are around ten reoccurring characters in here, all of which gave authentic performances in their roles.the only thing i don't like about the film is the ending because most questions are left unanswered. the question "that's it?" went though my mind. it left a bad taste in my mouth. however, the rest of the film is just engrossing and really frightening. don't see this alone in the dark because you'll regret that choice. also, i can see in a couple of years that hollywood would remake this film. that will be interesting.

i, for one, absolutely loved this movie.it is not a "typical asian horror" where you would see a gruesome looking ghost (usually a woman) that is going around scaring people. you barely see any ghosts for a majority of the film, but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and characters is genius. this is not the movie for you if you're into gore (e.g. saw, hostel) or "surprise scares" where stuff pops out at you (hollywood horror, slasher films), but this movie has an underlying "creepy" factor throughout the entire movie which i loved. noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror amongst the ridiculous remakes and unoriginal crap being released by hollywood in today's society.please don't let the documentary-style of filming turn you off (why should it?!). it is far superior to the blair witch project because, for one, the acting in noroi is brilliant and it really makes you really feel like you're watching something you're not supposed to be seeing.noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies i have ever seen. only a few films have made it into my top 5 horror; and this movie holds a solid #1 spot on my list.

being a great fan of horror, especially asian horror, i have seen tons of movies, but this one is outstanding. why? it does have a plot (which is unfortunately quite rare among horror movies). the actors did a good job. it feels like a real documentary film (even if it's not). it does not get boring for a moment. the director cleverly combines the plot with the acts of a certain japanese magic cult (perhaps this cult never existed, but still, it's believable). it reminded me of the similarly great movie "forbidden siren".to me the one and only annoying thing about the movie was the character hori, the psychic, but this is subjective.i recommend this movie to all fans of quality horror.9 out of 10.

i can't praise this film enough. it had a lot of that hand-held, first-person shaking camera which i love (and some hate, because it makes them sick), like rec, cloverfield and blair witch project.it is a long movie for its kind, but i didn't even notice because the film was so interesting. by just showing the footage from a paranormal reporter's work the movie keeps up the pace, making it a real-time experience for the viewer.while i would never call this film the "scariest horror ever made", i'd have to say it's certainly one of the best i've seen. the fear factor here is constructed by details in the images, camera glitches, events linked to one another which lend a very mysterious and haunting tone to the movie. the horror is more in what is not shown, but left to our imaginations. the ending is perfect, and be warned that you might have nightmares afterwards. a second viewing is highly recommended, though.watch this one alone in the dark, don't expect anything and you'll have fun.

noroi follows a documentary filmmaker, masafumi kobayashi, as he slowly uncovers something mysterious and evil that's leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake. after interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud baby's cries coming from the house next door (where there is no baby), kobayashi heads over to talk to the neighbor. he's greeted with hostility by the unhinged, disheveled woman (maria takagi) who answers the door (and promptly slams it in his face) and gets a peek at her 6-year-old son through a window. strangely, both the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit (leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on their back porch), and the woman who first complained about the noises, as well as her daughter, are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after that. this piques kobayashi's interest and he sets out on a quest to find out what's going on. he soon uncovers that those with psychic abilities and extra-sensory perception seem to be tuning into something sinister, unexplainable and possibly even apocalyptic. well-known 10-year-old clairvoyant, and tv celebrity, kana (rio kanno) seems to think we may all be doomed, but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help. another female psychic/actress (marika matsumoto) becomes involved, as does mr. nori, a mentally unstable kook/psychic who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks people are being eaten by what he refers to "ectoplasmic worms." clues eventually lead back to the site of a small village that's now covered by a lake, and the legend of an ancient demon known as kagutaba...unlike many other hand-held horror flicks, this one depends just as much on the plot as it does reactionary first-person scares. thankfully there's something of a storyline here, a very interesting and intricate one at that, so it doesn't rely on glimpses of horrific things through spastic camera-work every once in awhile to keep your interest. the way masafumi travels around following leads in search of the truth - with well placed jolts along the way - reminded me somewhat of the omen in its pacing. the film also doesn't entirely consist of footage shot by the documentarian, but weaves in news reports and television variety shows as if what we're watching is an already completed documentary. that helps to break up some of the monotony usually associated with films shot in this particular style. the performances are good enough not to harm any of the realism of the 'actual' footage either. overall, it's a well-made horror film, with lots of plot shifts, some suspense and quite a few genuinely creepy moments, that's well worth checking out. my only real gripe is that it could have used a little trimming here and there and seems to go on a bit too long. otherwise, pretty good stuff.

this review contains some small, yet significant, spoilers.---i just finished watching my copy of noroi......and it was great! this might sound cheesy, but several times during the film i forgot it wasn't real xd the acting is convincing, although the acting from masafumi kobayashi (playing himself, i think...) seems a bit hokey at times. marika matsumoto (yuka in takashi shimizu's rinne) seemed to change levels of believability throughout the movie: sometimes she's really good, then the next moment she's really cheesy (especially at the end's exorcism and subsequent re-possession.a character that was ridiculous at first was mr. hori, a man covered in tinfoil believing "ectoplasmic worms" are coming to eat everyone. he provides unintentional comic relief at the beginning (acting like the stereotypical alien abduction-type victim) but near the end has some really creepy scenes.the plot was very interesting and really kept me wondering how everything tied together. there are some things that aren't really explained (like a mass suicide in a tokyo park and where the reincarnated kagutaba-boy came from) but everything else turned out fine. the ending has got to be one of the most unnerving, if not the scariest, sequences i've ever had the pleasure to witness.all in all, noroi is a very fun way to spend 2 hours and the new hong kong r3 dvd provides great picture and sound (most importantly the english subtitles- engrish free!) for a great j-horror experience. i highly recommend picking it up.

never posted anything here before, but after watching noroi i just felt that i had to write down my thoughts about it.firstly do not compare this to blair witch, this movie deserves far better than that! simply put, noroi is (probably) one of the best horror movies i have ever seen (and i have seen a lot!).i really liked how the movie presents itself not as a standard horror flick, but as a documentary filmed by a reporter (i think?) named kobayashi and his cameraman. without spoiling to much about the plot, i can say it that it starts with kobayashi doing research on a series of seemingly unrelated events, that turns out to be connected to something far more darker and sinister.while the story might not be that original in itself, what really hooked me with noroi was the incredibly eerie atmosphere. if you're looking for cheap scares and seat-jumping scenes this movie might not be for you. this movie is all about the mood it presents, with haunting images and a general feeling of foreboding suspense. the documentary style filming just makes it farm more believable.this is also helped a lot by the acting which is superb, although not perfect for the general part of the movie! far better than in most other movies in this type of genre.well enough ranting from me, i highly recommend noroi to everyone, it is suspenseful, creepy, well acted and the first movie that has scared me in ages.

anyone familiar with horror films knows that most of them are not scary at all. some people enjoy gorefests with subpar story lines and character development. i personally enjoy horror films that focus on atmosphere and interesting concepts (e.g., a tale of two sisters, kairo, etc.). whatever the type of horror film one personally likes, there are only a select few that really scare you. noroi is one of them.this is a documentary-style movie, which means that the entire film is a compilation of video clips that are linked by the legend of a demonic entity named kagutaba. the premise is that a journalist filmed his own footage by interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with kagutaba, then compiled footage from other sources that link with his research. what results is a relentlessly chilling experience that feels very real and very disturbing, despite the fact that the story itself is fake.some have compared noroi with the blair witch project, but the only similarity is the documentary style. one obvious difference between the films is that noroi scares the viewer by linking events to one another using different sources. for example, the journalist records the exterior of a house that he is researching and sees something strange on the porch. later in the film, a clip from another character's home video introduces that very same strange occurrence. the viewer's memory links the two incidents and chills start running down their spine. another example involves a television show with a child psychic who answers every single question correctly except for one. in fact, her answer is so wrong that the viewer may wonder what the filmmakers were thinking. later on, however, that wrong answer turns out to be linked to an extremely disturbing event. this is intelligent film-making indeed.another difference between noroi and blair witch is that noroi provides not one, but two very long finales, the second of which is placed a minute after the credits start to roll and is the single greatest scare scene in the history of horror cinema. i do not say such things lightly. it totally wrecked me in a wonderous way.other aspects of film-making are well done. the legend and ritualistic background of kagutaba are very interesting and most of the actors did a good job. the only over-the-top performance comes from a guy who's supposed to be crazy anyway, so that's expected. the cinematography is intentionally gritty because all of the footage is supposed to represent videos shot on camcorders. japanese films are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were awesome. in some cases they create an other-worldly feel (e.g., the static interference or the first finale) but in other cases they are alarmingly realistic (e.g., the second finale).when all is said and done, noroi goes down as the scariest film i've ever seen. i would go so far as to say that there is no film in existence that provides such sheer terror from beginning to end like noroi does. see it now.

www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html an excellent tv series that should be captured on dvd. this was a show i rarely missed. i found a petition to bring it back on dvd. i recall one show where this obese lady wore a pair of glasses that let her food talk to her. needless to say she could not eat her friends so she starved to death. another episode had an accountant visiting an underground sewer & subway security branch. the accountant wanted to shut down the funding for the project. as it turns out the security branch was underfunded to fight the cannibalistic creatures that lived in the dark. www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html

one reasons why they call the 80's, "the awesome 80's" is quality television. shows like the wonder years, war of the worlds (the series), v, amazing stories, and many more have always left an impression to each "fortunate" one of us that in time will always find a way to reawaken itself. to top that, here comes monsters! a series quite unique of its own, and a theme fully dedicate to - monsters. may it be the good, the bad, and the morbid.if you're a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror films then this one is absolutely for you. provided you can find this rare gem. even the newer generations will be in awe with some of the episode with its grittiness, it's indiscriminating use of gore effects or its story telling power and simplicity. i guarantee, because i'm 23 :).be sure not to miss this!although, it's a show seemingly forgotten by the modern world, it will always be with those who can always remember...

i think that it's great how chiller picked up this series and showing it for this generation. film making has come such a long way especially with the special effects and for one to be able to watch archived shows that they never knew existed, they will certainly be able to see the progress compared to now. monsters is neither lame nor spectacular but it is entertaining. it takes creativity for the types of story lines they came up with and each generation seems to have it's own horror series. this particular series was not as horrifying as the friday the 13th, the series, nor as adult oriented as the freddy's nightmares..it was something that an entire family could watch and still get a laugh and a fright at the same time. i am happy the chiller channel shows it in their line-up, i am just about caught up on the episodes i missed when i was growing up.

this was one of the best half-hour horror/suspense/fantasy shows of the eighties, without a doubt. granted the show had a barely capable cast with every single episode, and it stank as far as production values (i.e. the sets) went, but darn it i have to give it some credit for being gutsy with the plots. i mean the plot of each episode was edgy enough that even i, a hardened horror movie, shock-film, and 70's grind-house buff got a little sickened and creeped out. great show, just great, regardless of what the other reviewers have said here. my favorite episode was called "bug house", yeah that was the title i think? anyhow it still gives me the willies every time i think about it to this day, almost 20 years after it first premiered. other shows like "tales from the darkside", "the outer limits" and (of course) "the twilight zone" were definitely better production values-wise, but in my opinion they ain't got a thing as far as plot lines go when compared to this sick little show! it definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon that was, "tales from the crypt".

this show has to be my favorite out of all the 80's horror tv shows. like tales from the darkside, also from the same creators, this show is a rare gem. if you agree with me, please sign this petition i started, to get the word out for monsters and get it out on dvd. here is the petition address: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html some of my favorite episodes would have to be glim glim, and rain dance. i also loved the opening intro with the monster family. that used to creep me out! one of the things i would have to ask the dvd creators to include would be the organ sound heard right before where the commercial break would be. i don't know if any of you remember that part but that's one of the main things that brings back memories to me. i mean, come on! war of the worlds the tv series already has been released on dvd, so i say monsters, and also tales from the darkside, and friday the 13th the series should be released too! we the fans need to speak our minds! we need this awesome show on dvd so please spread the word!!!

this picture is an interesting saga of the struggle of pioneers led by daniel boone in the wilderness of cumberland gap while being threatened by hostile indians. a treacherous frenchman is the cause of all the trouble between the settlers and the red men while boone tries to convince the indians that the pioneers only want to build homes and live in peace. the film has a certain appeal because it is not a polished production but there are good action scenes, although somewhat violent for its time. the cast is comprised of b actors but they are all good, especially lon chaney as the indian chief. bruce bennett is okay as boone but is a bit too clean cut and soft spoken to be believable as a frontiersman. the dialogue is rather trite but the scenery lends itself to the realism of the kentucky backwoods.

i was enchanted by niami's debut. i hope that we'll soon see more of his work. i was lucky enough to catch the film during its brief nyc run and it struck me as a worthy successor to such downtown 80s flicks as desperately seeking susan and after hours, but with a gentle european whimsey that made it fresh and fun. a strong ensemble cast playing mostly against type was a pleasure. and i thought the complexly inter-threaded plots were just right. sandra bernhard puts in her best performance since king of comedy, while peter stormare is hilarious, and ling bai touching. see it.

despite its new york setting & new york characters, 'summer in the city' is not an american movie, it is better than that. what is most unusual is the mixing of styles and genres. director niami's shows a deft touch in combining comedy with tragedy, pathos with drama.the secret of niami's success appears to be a smorgasboard of great characters - each could have their own film built around them - and then filling them out with beautifully realized performances from one of the most wonderfully eclectic casts one would struggle to find in the same country let alone in the same movie, ranging from bai ling to ornella muti, robert burke to peter stormare who here reveals that he has a lot more in him than the bad guy stereotypes he plays in hollywood pictures. even sandra bernhard is funny here !an added bonus, cream on the substantial cake, is john cale's soundtrack.

this film did a wonderful job of capturing nyc stereotypes at there best. if you want a simple, cute story however, you won't find it here. the related tales are woven together in a manner that does an excellent job of capturing the close-knit yet contrastingly anonymous lifestyle that is manhattan. a perfect watch for those who enjoy and can laugh at new york life in its most natural state.

i saw this in a theatre back in 1982. i expected a stupid t&a movie. that's not what i got.it's basically about three teenage boys trying to have sex. we get the expected sex jokes and scenes--but, for once, they're actually pretty funny!yeah, they're stupid but i enjoyed them anyways. also, there was a surprising amount of male nudity.then the movie, about halfway through, takes a sudden dramatic turn as one of the boys (winningly played by lawrence monoson) falls in love with a girl. then the jokes stop and things get very dark. i'm not going to give away what happens but i was very surprised at the sudden turn in events. the movie brings up some very important subjects and treats them realistically and with intelligence. and it has a real heart-breaking ending.i'm giving this a 10 because this is probably one of the best teen sex comedy/dramas ever made. it mixes fantasy and realism together and works! what more can you ask for? also it has a great soundtrack.

feels like an impressionistic film; if there is such a thing.the story is well told, very poetic. the characters well developed and well acted by the interpreters (or interpreted by the actors :)).the film delights in its own sumptuous emotions at times and works well, unless you hate such emotion in movies - not so in my case.it's a very humanistic film.the landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own right.well done.a good classic for any good film collection.

the movie begins almost achingly slowly, a "romance" (yawn) that seems to ramble off course (all part of the plan...) then, roughly one hour into this solemn movie is the feast. it's worth paying attention to that first hour. the feast is still solemn, but humorous. suddenly, the withdrawn and slightly petty characters come to life, and everyone (you and the characters) leave feeling enriched by the experience.women will love this. christians of all sorts will enjoy the profound faith demonstrated by the characters. not my favorite movie of all time - no dinosaurs or laser beams, after all - but definitely a movie i am happy to have seen. not to be missed.jim

simply one of the greatest films ever made. worthy of sitting alongside such european masterworks as the rules of the game, grand illusion, nostalghia, andrei roublev, 8 1/2, wings of desire, viridiana, the night of the shooting stars, la strada, ordet,the passion of joan of arc, the four hundred blows and madame de... both a blessing...and an almost perfect work of art.

there is no need for me to repeat the synopsis rendered by glenn. the black and white rendition is even more powerful in portraying the bleakness of country village life at that time. the deep measure of friendship shown by babette toward the two elderly sisters touches the heart strings. the supporting cast is excellent and their performances superb, it would not be fair to single out any one character since the entire story depends on the cast as a whole. i cannot put my finger exactly on why i rate this movie so highly since i am not a professional critic; individual viewers may or may not agree with my rating since enjoyment of this type of movie is always in the eye of the beholder.

this film offers many delights and surprises. when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from "don giovanni" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film. the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch. you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.babette is an artist whose medium is food. perhaps no other art form allows the artist to share her creations so directly.the main theme of this movie, the potential that the sharing of food has to transform how people see each other and how they see the world, is much the same as the theme of "chololat," but "babette's feast" does not hit you over the head with its message. the townspeople are conservative puritans, but not exaggeratedly oppressive. you come to understand and respect them and ultimately to appreciate their humanity. many issues are raised for you to reflect on: the nature of art, the contemplation of paths taken and paths not taken, the relationship between the spiritual and the physical, the effect of environment on behavior, the taking of life to give life, among others.the only disappointment for me was general loewenhielm's speech delivered at the climax of the meal. i expected deep heartfelt observations, but i got some vague mystical ramblings. the speech had such a minimal impact that i hardly remember it.but this understated film leaves a lasting impression. the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop. you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.

this is one of the finest movies i have ever seen....the stark scenery...the isolation...the ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religion...a backdrop for some wordliness and sophistication...the acting is completely natural...but for me as a"foodie' the best is the actual choosing and preparation of the feast..i have spent time in paris and know the cuisine well...whether or not the cafe anglais really exists i don't know but i do know of similar establishments and babette's menu and choice of wines are authentic...and of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellows them back to friendship is the only ending there could be..this is a 10 out of 10 film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it

sometimes it is difficult to watch films with subtitles (in this case danish) but the watching is worth it. as the story progresses, the reasoning for the choice of two sisters, to take care of their father, is questionable but their society is different. their choice leaves them alone until a french woman comes. there may be a question on why the french woman came to their place to stay and this is never fully developed. the feast which happens later as a result of unexpected funds from france is a source of unusual pleasure to all who attend and something they have not experienced before. it provides a fitting thank you for the kindnesses given to the guest. filmed with a dark aura and the display of poverty, it is a beautiful experience for the viewer.

when i first heard of this movie, i was mildly interested. the plot seemed like an opportunity for hilarity and bam margera as an actor and director seemed like something that might be good. when i found out the movie starred ryan dunn, i was even further interested (i was a fan of homewrecker when it was on... yeah, i'm that lame). however, i didn't have much faith in it being to good. when i sat down to watch it, i was afraid i was wasting my time.but even just five minutes it it became apparent that i'd been wrong.i thought that the comedy of this film was delightfully idiotic, and definitely not suited for all kinds of people. the acting was rather good, much better than my expectations. i thought that it was rather easy to relate to ryan's character, which gave the movie a center that was believable. this is key in a movie as outrageous as this (and is probably why i was not a fan of borat).the movie is not suitable at all for younger people, duh, and will definitely create more than it's fair share of awkward turtles if watched with parents. but it's a good one for you and your buddies on a movie night.

i didn't know what to expect from this. i always considered bam margera and the cky crew a team of knuckle heads devoted to to doing stupid things for entertainment. i didn't know that they could act. but everyone who acted in this movie pulled off good performances. the hilarity of the 'aaaaagh!' scene mixes in with ryan dunn's depression and his revenge against his ex-girlfriend perfectly. at times the movie some scenes seem pointless but at the same time they're funny. i recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh but this film may not appeal to those that prefer detailed story lines and a series of twists and turns.

i have seen this movie, just once, and i'm looking forward to see it again and again. dear david (from beligium), why did you bother to write a comment on this movie? i only think we can think about you (after reading you comment), is that you're provably a non-sexual person (like erika in the movie), and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up. i guess you are a bit old, and sexual expression is not part of your "visage". the cannes film festival is by far the best movie festival, and i'm is my pleasure to say, that this film was awarded with: best actress, best actor and grand prix. isabelle huppert is magnificent, as always, who would do this movie like her? one of her best performances ever. the music is fantastic, and once more michael haneke puts reality in the big screen. it's like a dogma95 kind of movie, because of the topic. try to see it.

i actually found out about favela rising via the imdb website. i have a particular interest in afro-brazilian culture and films. favela rising is one of those gems that gives a new meaning to human transformation. beautifully documented and filmed by jeff zimbalist and matt mochary its the story anderson sa, a former rio de janeiro drug trafficker who after the deaths of family members and friends becomes a christ-like, malcolm x, and ghandi all rolled into one. sa formed afroreggae, a grassroots cultural movement that uses afro-brazilian hiphop, capoeira(afro-brazilian martial arts)drumming, and other artforms to transform the hopeless and most times angry youth into vibrant, viable, caring community loving individuals.a few years ago i remember going to a screening of city of god (cidade de deus) and walked out of the theatre completely numb. the images were grim yet stunning and you couldn't take your eyes off the screen. i remember how hopeless some situations were in the favelas and how decadent the society was due to the governments neglect. how drug trafficking was a way of life, how indifferent the citizens of the slums were because death was an every day occurrence. like city of god anderson sa talks about how the people of the favelas were also desensitized. he talks about the police corruption, and how the communities were so immobilized by drugs and gangs that you couldn't visit family members in other favelas you had to meet in a neutral location. unlike city of god anderson sa's grassroots movement afroreggae provides solutions to the anger, the hopelessness.there was one part in the documentary where anderson, in the spirit of a preacher approached some youth and asked them to join afroreggae. these jaded youth were so scarred by everyday survival and violence. their role models were drug dealers and this is what they aspired to be. anderson told then that drug dealers don't live very long. there was reluctance of course but five months later he was able to get some of the youth to join afroreggae.the visuals in favela rising are beyond amazing. its clear to me that jeff zimbalist and matt mochary are not only great story tellers but visual artist as well. this is a must see documentary! there are some really magical and transforming moments in this documentary. i don't want to spoil them for you. i want you see it for yourself. please tell your friends, academics, youth counselors, family members about this wonderful film. it will make you care about the world and our children.i would give it eleven stars!

i just love this movie and i have my tv programed to record it when it comes on again on nov. 2nd. it is a really nice love story with a twist. the song that is played at the end of the movie is one you would not think would be a big hit but it is a song that stays in your head and i am now trying to find that song so i can hear it and play it. i really have no style of the shows i see or the songs i like to hear and there for makes me pretty open to seeing things new with an open mind. i would like to say there is some parts in this movie that is not meant for the whole family to watch. this movie does show skin. it is kinda like a lifetime movie for women, about women. i say watch the movie and you may just like it as much as i did.

although this was a low budget film and clearly last minute, it holds a certain charm that is difficult to pinpoint. i tend to believe it is the scriptwriter- grant morris (see dead dog), who, despite the warped plot line injected a fantastic slice of humour, sorely missing in many of today's box office hits. definitely a must see for a sunday afternoon laughfest. speaking as a true single girl, and very sceptical this film did not inspire me particularly, but did ignite a small flame of hope for a lovelife. not my lovelife, so much as my slightly crazy neighbour's lovelife who lets her hamster sleep in her bed with her. she may find someone.

just as ted kramer (dustin hoffman) is about to get a break in his professional life his frustrated wife joanna (meryl streep) finally gets up the courage to leave him, leaving ted to care for their five year old son (justin henry). being a single parent proves to be quite the chore for ted, and he suffers professionally but also learns there's much more to life than a career as he continues to bond with, and really get to know, his own son. but then joanna returns and intends to get her son back, which leads to a cruel custody trial.kramer vs. kramer is a superbly well written and magnificently acted human drama that will only leave the most cold-hearted a viewer untouched. hoffman's growing relationship with his son is so well portrayed and the film never takes an easy way out. it always feels very real and thanks to the film's low-key approach it makes even more of an impact and can easily work upon multiple viewings, the film's dramatic impact does not lessen.easily recommended; 10 out of 10.

what can i say about kramer vs. kramer? on the surface it's rather simple but underneath it deals with emotions greater than life itself. it delivers many fantastic moments, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. you sympathize with the characters and you care about them. many films fail at this, kramer vs. kramer is a success.i think everyone would agree the acting is superb. once you watch kramer vs. kramer, for some time the acting in most other films starts to feel plastic and unemotional. the actors seem to get along well with their roles and the characters really live on the screen. there's some beautiful chemistry between them. i think the best performance in the film comes from the young justin henry. he's different from any other child actor i've ever seen. he's amazingly natural.also, there's some kind of neurotic beauty in meryl streep. and dustin hoffman delivers one of the best performances of his career! the story is very well written. it's simple but complicated at the same time. the concept is the simple part, the feelings associated is the complicated part of it.if you haven't seen this film yet, you're definitely missing out! see it now!

this is a phenomenal movie. truly one of the best movies i have ever watched. i am a serious critic and it takes much to stir me, but this movie had all the right combinations for "stirring". the passion of the actors,without the overacting, the aching for all the characters involved, the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce, all make this a must see movie, despite the fact that it is 1970s. this is definitely not an "old movie", but a classic/vintage movie. i hope you engage with it as i did when you consider how volatile relationships of all kinds can be, when you also consider how deep pain associated with love can be and how the hardest decisions to make will always be the most painful, but once they are made the pain will subside, but only gradually. this movie certainly demonstrates that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving certainly is not synonymous with lost/lack of love. the 'crafting' of this movie certainly emanates from a place deep within someone's heart and mind.

i have seen this film on 3 different occasions.on the first occasion,i was bowled over by this film.it appeared as a very kind film to me.i hated this film as a sentimental garbage on my second viewing.however my third viewing reasserted my belief that it is a good film.there is a lot of emotional power in this film especially scenes of emotional confrontation between mr kramer and madam kramer.there are some scenes in which meryl streep appears a cruel person despite the fact that she is a beauty in real life.dustin hoffman appears as a lost hero unable to grapple with the recent task of his child's custody.there was even a controversy on the sets of this film.according to the master cameraman nestor almendros there was a shot in which he just escaped getting hurt as the character of mr.kramer,in order to show the intensity of his anger,decides to break a glass hard.luckily nothing happened to nestor.kramer versus kramer shows the destruction of a family structure.it also tells how family must be maintained if there are kids involved.

this is probably the best cinematic depiction of life in a manhattan ad agency: the pressure to perform; client and agency demands; the parties; the creativity; the money; the cool surface with powerful corporate undercurrents. toss in parenthood for dustin hoffman. the movie is textured and deep. it follows his internal relationship as he tries to understand and live with what's going on; his relationship with meryl streep (and her friend, who becomes his friend), and his the relationship with his son. while meryl streep was great, did she set the record for least screen time to win an oscar? she sure can deliver when she is on, though.

moving beyond words is this heart breaking story of a divorce which results in a tragic custody battle over a seven year old boy.one of "kramer v. kramer's" great strengths is its screenwriter director robert benton, who has marvellously adapted avery corman's novel to the big screen. he keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic, while delivering all the drama straight from the heart. his talent for telling emotional tales like this was to prove itself again with "places in the heart", where he showed, as in "kramer v. kramer", that he has a natural ability for working with children.the picture's other strong point is the splendid acting which deservedly received four of the film's nine academy award nominations, two of them walking away winners. one of those was dustin hoffman (best actor), who is superb as frustrated business man ted kramer, a man who has forgotten that his wife is a person. as said wife joanne, meryl streep claimed the supporting actress oscar for a strong, sensitive portrayal of a woman who had lost herself in eight years of marriage. also nominated was jane alexander for her fantastic turn as the kramer's good friend margaret. final word in the acting stakes must go to young justin henry, whose incredibly moving performance will find you choking back tears again and again, and a thoroughly deserved oscar nomination came his way.brilliant also is nestor almendros' cinematography and jerry greenberg's timely editing, while musically henry purcell's classical piece is used to effect.truly this is a touching story of how a father and son come to depend on each other when their wife and mother leaves. they grow together, come to know each other and form an entirely new and wonderful relationship. ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new outlook on life, and slowly comes to realise why joanne had to go.certainly if nothing else, "kramer v. kramer" demonstrates that nobody wins when it comes to a custody battle over a young child, especially not the child himself.saturday, june 10, 1995 - t.v.strong drama from avery corman's novel about the heartache of a custody battle between estranged parents who both feel they have the child's best interests at heart. aside from a superb screenplay and amazingly controlled direction, both from robert benton, it's the superlative cast that make this picture such a winner.hoffman is brilliant as ted kramer, the man torn between his toppling career and the son whom he desperately wants to keep. excellent too is streep as the woman lost in eight years of marriage who had to get out before she faded to nothing as a person. in support of these two is a very strong jane alexander as mutual friend margaret, an outstanding justin henry as the boy caught in the middle, and a top cast of extras.this highly emotional, heart rending drama more than deserved it's 1979 academy awards for best film, best actor (hoffman) and best supporting actress (streep).wednesday, february 28, 1996 - t.v.

ever since `midnight cowboy' i have been on the lookout for films with dustin hoffman and have mostly not been disappointed. ever since `kramer vs kramer' i have been on the lookout for films with meryl streep and have mostly not been disappointed. she gave a superb performance, really one of her best, in `sophie's decision' and i lapped her up in `out of africa'. that these two actors came together over 20 years ago for `kramer vs kramer' was definitely a very good idea: the result is an excellent character drama with a theme which is still very relevant in today's society.on divorcing everyone has a pretty bad time, though the kids seem to suffer most..beautifully handled by robert benton in some original directing presenting some memorable scenes: even the passageway takes on character and should be included in the cast! and as for the breakfast scene with billy (justin henry), just simply magnificent. just how do you get an eight-year-old to act? benton managed it, and of course with hoffman there seemed to be good electricity: the result is certainly engaging, endearing, and convincing. justin henry's performance must rank among the best 5 or 6 kids' performances of all time. the best thing, once again, was the naturalness, there was no going over the top, so frequent these days.this film came up again on the small screen the other night, though i have had it in my video collection for years: it is still worth watching and paying attention to everything. around 7½ out of 10.

life was going great for new york city advertising artist ted kramer. he had a great job and a loving wife. no, actually, his wife wasn't so loving, for when ted returned home late from work that night his wife, joanna, had a suit case packed and was heading out the door. he tried to stop her, but she just got into the elevator and out of ted's life. well, now in addition to his job he's now got to mind the house as well as their 6-year-old son, billy; ted assured his boss that his wife's leaving would not affect his job performance in any way. it did however affect his performance as a father. he blew up when billy spilled punch on his client artwork! well, some time later ted and billy receive a letter from joanna, and it was obvious from her letter that she wasn't coming back. ted was distraught. well, he was late coming home from work on billy's birthday, which made billy sore at him. ted was late to work one day and his boss yelled at him because he had missed a very important client meeting. when he got home, he yelled at billy for sneaking ice cream during dinner. then later he truthfully told billy that the break-up between he and joanna may have been his fault, not billy's; ted invited a good friend, phyllis bernard over that night, and well, billy got his first look at a naked woman. when ted took billy to the park the following day, he fell off the jungle gym and landed face-first onto his toy plane. ted literally ran him to the hospital where they had to administer stitches. after that, life began taking a downward spiral for ted. then one day out of the blue he received a phone call from none other than joanna! they met in a corner café. at first they have a pleasant conversation but then joanna informs him that she has returned to collect her son and take him with her. ted would have none of it and stormed out. well life got even worse for ted when his boss, jim o'connor, took him out to lunch and abruptly fired him. not only that but joanna was choosing to sue for custody of billy, and without a job, ted didn't stand a chance in hell for winning. he hired himself a lawyer, john shaunessy, who charged a pretty penny: $15,000 exact change. and that's if they win. ted was also able to find a new job. it was actually a step down from what he used to do with a considerable cut in salary but he accepted with great determination. finally the court date, january 9, 1980, arrived. judge atkins presiding. joanna took the stand and shaunessy proceeded to question her about why she left ted and about her other relationships and how they were failures. the next day, ted took the stand and joanna's lawyer really grilled him like a cheeseburger. ted's good friend margaret took the stand as well and she really didn't help matters. well, the judge took some time to think it over and sure enough, one day shaunessy informs ted that he lost. joanna got sole custody of billy. how typical! always ruling in favor of the mother. well, ted and billy were just devastated about parting ways. they had a tearful goodbye when suddenly joanna stopped by. she and ted have a little talk and well, rather than just give away the ending, let me assure everybody that everything turns out alright for everybody!this was a very good movie. dustin hoffman was very good. he earned that academy award. i've also seen him in hook, meet the fockers and rain man, which he also won an oscar for. meryl streep was good. she also got an oscar. justin henry was good too, so where was his nomination? i guess the academy had a rule against giving oscars to children, but the rule was lifted when haley joel osment came along. this movie has great drama, light comedy, and is very subtle. it does a good job of holding your attention. i was watching rain man on tcm the other night then this came on after and i just couldn't help but watch. and that's what you should do. if you like dustin hoffman or meryl streep or movies of this genre, then i recommend kramer vs. kramer! a gripping film about the pangs of two divorced parents fighting over their child. i liked ted's little speech about ruling in favor of mothers all the time. what was it about sex that makes a good parents? actually, that's how they have the child. but seriously, he's right. why always rule in favor of the mother because she's a woman? also in the cast, george coe, howard duff, who passed away in 1990, and howland chamberlain who passed away in 1984. watch for an up-and-coming jobeth williams in the nudity in the hallway scene. anyway, see kramer vs. kramer today!!! good movie!!-

good drama movie about a child custody case with great performances by all the actors.a good example of what an excellent script can do to propel a simple story to a much higher quality.the screenplay was just average though and this is what kept the movie from the list of the all time best dramas.still,the great acting makes this movie a good one to see if you are a fan of court dramas or a big fan of the lead actors.the movie really should have been a tad longer though for more excellence but that would really be nitpicking......

the child actor certainly deserves a lot of credit. it was a pretty weak field for best picture that year. i think "apocalypse now" should have taken it, but the academy probably felt it was too violent and strange, plus vietnam was still too recent. meryl streep was tremendous, as always, playing a very unlikeable character. i don't usually compliment directors, but i really liked that bit with the elevator doors. grade: b

i remember going to drive inn with my parent and sister. i was in grade 5, and still a kid, and the drive closed down 4 years later, but the film still lingers in my memory. an adult movie, which a kid finds entertaining. that is a mark of excellence. hoffman is one of hollywoods better actors, and this film proves it. i like the billy put down the ice cream scene, and i remember the sctv version in there film i factory myself. remember joe flairty crying. please email me if you like the sctv skit. not a bad film at all, it is a story about a father, and his son. touching and intertaining, i love the part where hoffman talks about killroy, and how the streets change. worth a second watch. 7/10

if you asked me to pick the best acted movies ever made, this movie would be on a short list along with 1951's streetcar named desire. i imagine i'll discover some others that qualify, but kramer vs kramer is an outstanding exercise in naturalism. so its a very satisfying experience on that level: just watching the marvelous, probing performances of dustin hoffman, meryl streep and the child justin henry in particular. one of the best child performances ever.but i also find it very satisfying to watch, because its such a thoroughly involving story - it always makes me forget my own problems. it has such excellent narrative drive. once you stick kramer vs kramer on, and alice kramer leaves ted to juggle work and their young son, telling him nothing more than she has to discover herself - you keep watching to know that everything turns out okay for them. and even once you know how things do turn out, each moment of the ride just rings so brilliantly true that its a joy to watch it happen again and again.make no mistake - kramer vs kramer is not light entertainment: its a very realistic portrayal of the effects of divorce on everyone involved.10/10.for one of the best scripts (born out of conversations between benton and hoffman, who was going through a divorce at the time) ever written, executed and performed beautifully and faultlessly. not to mention what a great, involving story it is. put simply, a perfect film.

i thought this film was quite good and quite entertaining for a film heavy on emotion. i agree with what another user wrote about the script being sympathetic to the three main characters. i think that this is what what made the film good. it didn't villainies either mr. or mrs. kramer and it was refreshing, i think, to see two people essentially work the issue out on their own and eventually do the best thing for billy. and, although it was a little strange, i actually liked the music in this film as well. for some reason the music seemed appropriate for the journey that the three main characters embarked upon. this movie flowed quite well and didn't doodle, like some emotionally heavy films tend to do. it dealt with a serious situation but didn't take itself too seriously. it simply told the story in a straight forward way and it worked quite well.

normally, movies stay out of the realm of "domestic drama," and for good reason: who wants to intentionally seek entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them have to deal with in real life? divorce hurts an incredible percentage of american families of all classes and custody battles are ugly and necessary parts of it. that's not escapism -- the number one reason the average person turns to movies -- that's sad reality. normally, divorce or custody is simply part of a greater story and affects the way we understand it or relate to its characters. "kramer vs. kramer" focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why that makes it so troubling. that's a challenge for both this film and its audience: turn something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us not feel spiteful as the mirror is held up to our face. writer/director robert benton definitely achieves both and in impressive fashion in adapting this novel by avery corman.the story, as one would expect, is quite simple: big business advertising man ted kramer (dustin hoffman) comes home to find his wife joanna (meryl streep) is leaving him and their 7-year-old son billy (justin henry). ted then must quickly learn to be an active father in the boys' life and as soon as he does, joanna brings a custody suit upon him.to make an oscar-winning drama about something so generic and particularly dialogue- heavy first takes tremendous acting talent. you don't get much better than hoffman and streep. hoffman is in his prime in this role: his first oscar win after three other notable nominations. he creates a thorough character, one whose self-centered and quick-tempered ways clearly change as he learns to be a better father and the sole care-giver. streep wins her first oscar in only the second major role of her career as a woman who doesn't get much screen time but must communicate both inner torment at her decision to leave as well as renewed sense of identity when she returns to take custody. streep does so effortlessly. the young boy, justin henry, who at his age was the youngest competitive category nominee in academy awards history, plays the embodiment of all 7-year-old children exceptionally well.benton's writing and direction takes these performances to the level where we see deeper into this family's troubles than we do our own and thus reconsider our thoughts about love and raising a family. benton's previous notable credits ("bonnie & clyde" and "superman") wouldn't indicate a strong command of family drama, but the man can flat out write. numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they depict. the first morning that joanna is gone and ted make's billy french toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent going into this movie in a scene that happens in americans' kitchens every morning.you'll rarely see a story as straightforward as "kramer vs. kramer" done better. there aren't any surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen. the film then has to rely on its talents and they are all sure-fire, delivering a new understanding of a subject that's so familiar.

certainly when i saw this movie at hbo, i was bit erratic in following the plot, but it catches my attention when seeing dustin hoffman in it. honestly i'm not enthralled watching old movies, but then in the long run it changes my point of view. seeing this stirring film made me experience once again couching at my seat not noticing my tears suddenly roll down my cheek, and then after, let loose a heavy sigh in realizing the impact of what i've just witness. kramer vs kramer was indeed one of the best classical drama movies i've witnessed for a long time that even i, myself couldn't imagine how it touched me. the story was strongly emotional, but is not saturated with such. the characters weren't unrealistic for their roles; they possess qualities that make viewers like them whatever position they have in the film, like the role of meryl streep, she was a mother who honestly concede her mistakes at the past but then she's confident to stand up her emotional motives to get what she desires in a fair and square battle. dustin hoffman was way too outstanding, i can't even fathom how this guy could play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role which is completely different, then performed it well. even though i have already seen the movies a lot of times, when i seat back and lounge at my home scanning worth movies to peer and buy a time for it, catching a glimpse for kramer vs kramer will make my experience another worthwhile moment.

kramer vs. kramer is a near-heartening drama about shocking, drastic augmentations of the two subjects of a failed married couple. meryl streep, in the throes of her trademark maternal sensitivity, plays an unhappy stay-at-home mother who feels confined to such a role and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her inattentive husband, in a fantastic performance by dustin hoffman, to find another role for herself. hoffman is dumbstruck, having absolutely no idea what to do with himself, having taken so much for granted that he doesn't know the first thing about getting his son to school in the morning.hoffman seamlessly characterizes this husband as such a juicy load of setbacks. he is restless, relentless and impatient, but even though the positive side to those three adjectives should include just the opposite, he is unremittingly fixated on whatever he turns his head to. he's been focused on his career in advertising, and when he is left to raise his son billy all by himself, chaos ushers in immediately. he's the one throwing temper tantrums and quitting angrily halfway through an activity. after awhile, as he befriends his neighbor and joanna's former friend, played by sexy jane alexander, hoffman cools his jets enough to understand why his wife left. in the meantime, his boundless energy redirects towards raising billy and he loses his job.the custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey circumstance. even if the ending is a little unmotivated, subjectified for the audience, the last line and the last shot still have that witty screen writing touch that seemed to diminish after the magical 1970s.

i've seen many dustin hoffman's movies like straw dogs or rain man and i liked them, but his characters are much to often calm or even shy persons. i expected him to be in this movie the same as he was in straw dogs, but i saw a totally different person. he was much more energetic in this film and kinda reminded me of al pacino in serpico. the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end. i liked the way dustin hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son. this movie is also revealing. personally, i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.

kramer vs. kramer is the story of a marital breakup and the consequences of same. they can be devastating to the partners and even more so to a minor child which in this case is played by justin henry.what i really did like about kramer vs. kramer, it's greatest strength as a film is the way that parents dustin hoffman and meryl streep are presented to the audience as whole people with many sides to their nature. though the film is slanted in hoffman's direction and more about his relationship with his son, he's not presented as any kind of saint, nor is streep a completely black villain. hoffman's a career oriented man in the advertising game. he's pretty much ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations, still it's a big shock to him when streep says the love's no longer there and she wants out. she also wants out of being a mother, at least for a while.hoffman and henry make do the best they can. the pressure of being both parents causes hoffman to lose his job and he has to take a lower paying one in another agency. at that point after over a year, streep decides she wants custody.both parents make compelling witnesses and state their case beautifully, but in these situations, the tie is always broken in favor of the mother.dustin hoffman and meryl streep won their first of two oscars respectively for this film, her in the supporting actress category. i'm not sure how these things are decided, streep does get less screen time than hoffman if that's the determining factor. the film does focus on hoffman's relationship with his son and his evolving realization that he has his share of the blame for the marriage failure. as for meryl it's a hob's choice for her as it is for many women, to balance a career and motherhood. the conflict in her psyche registers for all to see on the screen.dustin hoffman may have won that oscar partly for the same reason that spencer tracy picked up his first, by performing the impossible task of not letting a scene stealing child steal the film. children with their lack of inhibitions are natural actors and henry is great because he comes over as a real kid, not a hollywood kid. i wonder if hoffman saw captains courageous and saw how spencer tracy dealt with freddie bartholomew. dustin could have done a lot worse than channel spencer tracy in his performance.kramer vs. kramer also won oscars for best picture, best director for robert benton and best adapted screenplay. it's an intelligent and compelling drama about adults falling out of love and trying to deal as best they can with it for themselves and their child. don't miss it if ever broadcast.

absolutely nothing. the movies that are great in this world are not recognized unless they are filled with gunshots, explosions, and death. this movie is filled with a man talking about showing you a more complex character than has been seen in many movies.when a movie is incredibly fast paced but stays mostly in one location it has to be the work of a genius. surprisingly enough, it is, this movie is directed by oliver stone and therefore is one of the best directed films of our time.this movie's screenplay was co-written by oliver stone and eric bogosian (barry champlain, main character.). with oliver stone's help, the screenplay was created as a seamless, rolling script which keeps you interested the entire time if you have any amount of intelligence. if you have an open mind about any subjects, and the wit to comprehend others, then this movie is something which you should find some way to watch, immediately.

barry champlain is a radio phone-in talk-show host in dallas, whose no-holds-barred ideas on a plethora of social issues disturb and offend many of his callers and listeners. is barry a media messiah in search of truth, or a social misfit out to assault his audience ?this is an intense, provocative character piece about a man with almost no redeeming features who at the same time seems to be onto some really profound philosophy. though co-written and directed by stone, this is really bogosian's piece all the way and he gives an astonishingly hard-edged and penetrating performance from which there is no escape. barry is at times one of the most loathsome characters imaginable, spewing bilious misanthropy at everyone around him, particularly those who care about him. but at the same time he is also strangely empathetic, hypnotic, sage, even lovable. bogosian's hawkish features burn into the frame, with his green eyes constantly darting around as if permanently seeking an answer to some riddle. the movie is essentially an angry, self-righteous rant against all the bigotry, injustice and banality in the world, culminating in a wild three-and-a-half-minute rotating single shot of barry delivering the ultimate i-hate-everything speech, but boy does it pack a punch. the support cast are great, particularly greene as the ex-wife and baldwin as the boss. robert richardson's keen photography manages to keep the single radio studio set looking interesting and there's a tense score by stewart copeland, with a moving coda featuring that endearing phone-music piece, telephone and rubber band by the penguin cafe orchestra. if you're unfamiliar with bogosian, check out his amazing talent in this flick - like his contemporaries, bill hicks and denis leary, he's someone who rarely appears in the mainstream media, purely because his writing is so out there. i find stone's movies variable; i don't much care for his big successes, but when he is more ordered and objective, as with this (or salvador and nixon), he is much more incisive and arresting. a great primal scream of a picture, based on a play by bogosian, inspired by the true story of alan berg, a denver radio talk show host who was murdered by neo-nazis in 1984.

alright, the first time i seen "talk radio" was in a video store for only $2.00 on vhs believe it or not, and i looked at it and i thought it might be about howard stern, because i just looked at it for about thirty seconds, then just didn't see it again. then i went to another store about a month later and i found "talk radio" on dvd for only $5.00. so i see it was directed by oliver stone, and i picked it up. so after the film was over i was speechless. i have never seen such a film like this. here's the main plot, then i'll tell ya what i thought of it.it is about a dallas talk radio host barry champlain, a jewish radio host who talks about whatever other people bring up and he interupts, and is taking everything seriously. now, a network wants to put his show live everywhere in the u.s. so barry's show gets a lot of interesting phone callers like chet (a neo-natzi), kent (a rock n roll drugged kid), john (rapist), and others. now some of the callers sound like the same actor/actresses. but still i think it fits okay.now what i love a lot about this film is the dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station. the dark music in the background fits very nicely too. it has a flashback scene in the film also how he started with radio, which i think they did good on. but the great thing about the film is ending. i was surprised by it, and it kind of makes you feel paranoid a little about the phone callers off the air and everything about it is wonderful. it also tells you how to say the right things to people over a big city like dallas. one of oliver stone's underrated/weakest films mentioned, but i think it's his best in my opinion.but definitely get this film if you like films with paranoia-feel like films with a dark atmosphere with sinister music in the background. i still watch this film a lot of the times now when i'm bored, as matter fact i watched it tonight. yeah, if ya wanna really get the sinister feel to the film, watch it at nightime with the lights off. i may sound crazy, but it makes the film better!another thing i forgot to mention is that the reason i don't think the film did so well was maybe in my point of view because of the title. 'talk radio.' it doesn't sound very tricky or anything, it's kind of plain. a better title like the book "talked to death" or maybe "the abusive radio host" or something catchy and not plain "talk radio". or maybe because of universal pictures? oliver stone usually didn't do universal i don't think. paramount might have been a good company. i don't know, something about this film didn't do so well, but i love it."sticks and stones can break your bones, but words can cause permanent damage."

talk radio is of course, probably not the most well known of stone's films, but don't let that put you off, this film is ripe for discovery, i defy anyone not to be entranced by it. along with the best performance of 80's cinema by eric bogosian, for me (along with jfk)this remains stone's finest moment. stone doesn't seem to comment much on it these days and didn't do a director's commentary on dvd like all his other films. stone has nothing to be ashamed of, most directors would kill to get a shot @ a film like this.the claustrophobia of the studio is intense and the opinions of champlain are still very crucial arguments for today. the "legalise all drugs" speech is powerful and you might find yourself agreeing with him.in my opinion the film is about freedom of speech and how sometimes people don't like hearing things they don't agree with.the speeches and conversations with the listeners are very compelling, even disturbing, a chill ran down my spine when a crazed man calls champlain saying he has to rape again because the city drives him crazy is totally shocking.the tension is sometimes unbearable with a scene when heavy metaller kent becomes unhinged, of course champlain does himself no favours by ridiculing him. champlain(or should i say bogosian) is fearless in film and performance, totally mesmerising, a shame th@ bogosians other big role was the villain in under siege 2(dear god!!)one scene th@ didn't ring true was when barry's boss dan(alec baldwin) gets him to calm down, barry doesn't seem to be the kind of person who shuts up and does as he's told, it seemed a bit contrived and clichéd.the scenes outside the studio are criticised for being too formulaic, it's true because stone is trying to make the film more cinematic and allow the viewer to see champlains beginnings but it doesn't entirely work. it is a brilliantly cinematic film with extreme close-ups, deep focus, extremely fast cuts a fantastic 360 set which is used for the final breathtaking monologue. must see cinema, it makes it rare because it was ignored @the time but is now receiving attention again which it so richly deserves. a classic th@ should be studied by generations of film students. 10 out of 10 for inventive use of "bad to the bone" before t2, brilliant supporting cast including john c mcginley(dr cox from scrubs) as the sleazy stu, leslie hope(24)as champlains girlfriend, john pankow and alec baldwin as the suits and micheal wincott who plays three roles( a very underrated actor), the tension between the listeners and champlain which is very heart-racing @ times and of course kudos to the stars bogosian and stone for such a fantastic piece of cinema. enjoy!

probably one of his lesser known films, it suffers from the same lack of exposure as salvador in that its actually one of his best.written by and starring eric bogosian, talk radio tells the story of an opinionated radio phone-in host who upsets the wrong kind of listener. the film is important, and has much to say on the issues of free speech and just how free it should be, and you can easily tell that it started life as a stage play. know what you're getting into before you sit down to watch it and you'll be fine.there isn't much to the acting really as bogosian pretty much steals the film, he wrote and is given licence to rant, i couldn't take my eyes off him and that was part of the fascination many of the listeners had; the people who hated him wouldn't turn off in-case they missed something.not for everyone, but a very good drama and overall a very good film.

beautiful, emotional, and subtle. i watch this movie at an art center with a smaller screen in a film room with 95% of senior citizens. i wish bigger cinema like lowes around here would show it. great cinematography by wong and christopher doyle. since i understand cantonese, it's a lot easier for me to understand the movie. as simple as the story goes, many english speaking viewers didn't get the whole story. three old ladies next to me keep yapping and have no clues about the movie.spoiler; they were surprise when i mention that mr. chow did sleep with mrs chen and they have a son. she went to singapore trying to tell him but didn't.spoilerthe mandarin translation of the movie title actually means flowery like moment or memory. the phrase usually used to describe beautiful and wonderful memory that was inpermanance and short. the whole movie pretty much fit the title. not to mention the flowery "cheung sam".my favorite scene was definately the street corner in the alley. it looks so beautiful, the sun shining on the old and faded wall, at night in the dark, in the rain, truely a poetic moment. i felt a strong sense of intimacy of their relationship seeing them standing against the wall and talk quietly. i felt a terrible heartache when mr chow was rehearsing his departing moment, and mrs chen cried on his shoulder.... bravo wong kar-wai!as much as i like this one, chungking express still top my favorite. however, i'll give this one a 10 as well. as a point of reference, cthd only got 7.if you love art, you will love this movie. don't miss it.

this film is wonderful film for students of film. in mainstream american film it is common to see stylistic techniques used to draw the audience into the movie. in this film, the director uses stylistic techniques to push the story forward.this is a love story that offers no sex. to be honest, i can't even recall the characters kissing. rather, the plot focuses on the emotional ties between the two characters.i would not recommend this film for everybody. it is not very accessible. it is very slow moving and the subtle. it is a difficult film and mostly not entertaining.i would reccoment this film to people who want to see something different. it is a piece of art. the soundtrack is most beautiful and visually, every frame is a photograph. and most beautiful of all, it's not visually stimulating for the sake of being visually stimulating. every frame illustrates a little bit more of the story...

spoiler alert!!!you can listen to wong kar-wai's movies like a radio play: invisible vibrations between the characters, the rooms where they stay in, the rhythm that presses them ahead, attraction and dislike - the whole spectrum of the atmosphere is played back by the sound track. the dialogue is mostly completely unimportant.the narration is similar to a childish amorous look at a beautiful woman and a sad man whose sorrows are noticeable, but helpless. "in the mood for love" is told from a child perspective, but the child never appears as a narrator. the aesthetic of the film is developed by an extreme light and color dramaturgy, harsh cuts, an unattached, almost documentary camera and a complex, unobtrusive sound.the genius use of nat king cole's "perhaps, perhaps, perhaps", whose mysterious power grows the more often it is repeated and the melancholic waltz helps in the graceful choreography of the two protagonists. maggie cheung in her beautiful dresses is brilliant, the perfect vis-à-vis to the handsome, stylish tony leung. the audience assumes a romance between them, but wong just sees sad resignation. the two potential lovers are revolving around each other like satellites, knowing that they never will share the same orbit. you wish that they will find each other. they won't and the emotional power of their non-love-sex-relationship makes the movie immensely fascinating.it is about broken luck and unspoken love. in all of wong's films these are the leitmotives. love, whether it comes too early or it comes too late to take the one and not the other person. the yearning of the characters that is never satisfied, their loneliness, the mourning, and the luck that they experience when it is too late.

in hong kong, 1962, the editor chow mo-wan (tony leung chiu wai) and his wife, and the secretary su li-zhen chan (maggie cheung) and her husband simultaneously move to an old building. each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. their wife and husband stay most of the time away from home, and chow and li-zhen have the same habits: they like kung-fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant nearby the building. their close contact becomes friendship and a sort of platonic and repressed love. later they realize that their mates are having an affair, chow falls in love with li-zhen, but her shyness and probably repressed condition of married woman keeps her love in a platonic level. 'in the mood for love' is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. the film had not had a screenplay, and the actors were never sure about what they would be shooting. later, the director edited his story based on the footages. when chow moves to singapore, there is a gap of many years in the story until 1966, when its conclusion is intentionally open and not well defined, leaving questions such as who is the boy with li-zhen. my vote is eight.title (brazil): 'amor à flor da pele' ('love on the surface of the skin')

beautiful film set in 1962 hong kong about a man (mr. chow) and woman (mrs. chan) who become close friends when they suspect their spouses are having an affair. stylistically, the film is also beautiful. wong kar-wai uses a lot of slow motion and close-ups on parts of the body (feet, hands, waist). the film itself has a reticence and properness that suggests its time period. it's sexy without showing everything. wong kar-wai also doesn't allow the audience to see what the spouses look like, suggesting that mr. chow and mrs. chan should be together. smoking is even made to look elegant with close-ups of the curls of smoke. a really lovely film. just prepare yourself for the ending.

warning: spoiler,spoiler,spoiler!!!!this is written for filmgoers who may have walked away from "mood for love" perplexed and confused about paths the main characters choose in life. from reading other comments and reviews it seems that many viewers and critics missed some very important details which may have prevented them from enjoying this delightful tease of a movie.we are so use to seeing blatant sex in narrations that we forget that there was a time when filmakers would suggest the "dirty deed" by simply showing the slack-mouthed couples ride off in a sleigh or haywagon only to return into the next scene with a bulging gut or a fat toddler stuck to the hip..."meet your child".the director chose the same nostalgic approach in telling the story of mr chow and mrs chan. last warning...spoiler spoiler spoilermr chow fools mrs chan into showing her real emotions when they rehearse his departure forever. next scene: mrs chan leans her head on mr chow in the taxi and says "i do not want to go home tonight". translation: "let's do it"why then did the couple just not do the modern thing of dumping their cheating spouses,get a divorce,raise their love child and live happily ever after? the answer is that this whole story takes place in hong kong during the sixties. a bastard would live in a bleak life of shame if he were the child of an adulteress;whereas,a "legitimate" child could live a tragic but noble/honest life if his mother chose to raise him away from his cheating "father"-the invisible mr chan. in short,mr chow and mrs chan sacrifices their relationship for the future of their child.that is why mr chow,upon learning that mrs chan lives alone with a little boy gives a knowing smile and ends his dreams of making mrs chan his mrs chow. he then,also realizes why mrs chan went to all the way to singapore to be with him,only to reconsiders at the last momment and leave..,choosing to never see him again.(but not before taking some unnamed keepsake) mr chow lives with this wonderful secret with no one to tell. no one,except for a crumbling temple wall and of course we the viewer,...but only if we listen carefuly.

set in 1962 hong kong (in turbulent times, as we are informed), this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between a two married people tied to their traditions manages to recall the essence of old hollywood in scene after scene of lush colors, evocative yet restrained sensuality (as opposed of the requisite sexuality and occasional nude scenes which has become part of the norm of a romance in film), and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication. it's not hard to see the influence of marguerite duras here, since she is known for minimalism in storytelling as well as describing powerful drama using the art of verbal and non-verbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of re-enacting scenes that could eventually take place in both the characters' lives. from hiroshima mon amour to moderato cantabile, her pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of mr. chow (tony leung) and mrs. su li-zhen (maggie cheung) to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which was lost in reaffirming this relationship.the plot even resembles something that duras could have written: mr. chow and mrs. su li-zhen, neighbors in a tenement apartment while both being fairly successful professionals, begin to discover in the most banal of ways that their spouses are cheating on them, and they discover quite naturally, it's with each other. the question is, should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners? every scene plays with the notion that at any moment they will give in to each other, and at one point, it is suggested that eventually they do though as intrusive as the camera is in detailing to us their encounters (which seem to occur on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of cheung's dresses), we never see it. and just as not seeing either of their spouses heightens their own love story, not seeing them carry through with their attraction makes the eventual separation even the more bitter because at every moment we want for something to happen -- some catalyst -- and the only one which comes is when leung reveals to her that he loves her, followed by his quietly brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband, which implies that neither will he. it also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do: from a western point of view, a consummation of their romance into a more solid, lasting affair would have been possible especially in the 60s, but as it's hong kong, cultural values are markedly different.performances here are of the high order: it's very easy to play a torrid love affair, but to continually play a repressed, platonic relationship that is brimming with desire only barely suggested is hard and makes all the sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual. cheung and leung smolder and their blighted chemistry lingers long after the credits have rolled.

when a stranger calls is actually a pretty good movie. i had never saw the original and so when i watched this i thought it was unique. when when a stranger calls was advertised on the television the trailer gave away the ending. well, i never saw the trailer so when i saw this film i was surprised at how good it turned out to be. i walked by it one day and decided i'd buy it and now i'm lucky i did, because i thought it was a very pleasing movie that is a nice little film to own. it is getting a lot of unfair treatment, and if you're interested in this movie at all, don't listen to all the negativity. camille belle is not as bad of an actress as everyone makes her out to be, and she did a great job in this movie, so all you haters get over yourselves, lighten up, and actually try to enjoy this movie for what it is; a fun, teeny bopper, popcorn flick. if you haven't seen it please do for it is a lot more enjoyable than a lot of the other slashers being made recently...

don't listen to most of these people. ill give you a better review of this movie which me and my friend love! its about jill johnson, played by camilla belle, who babysits at the mendrakis' house and someone breaks in. if you're wondering how he got in the house, he went through the garage most likely. so anyway, don't listen to, "the worst acting". it has amazing acting. with a great story. i think that there are 2 benefits that jill has. 1. shes a fast runner and is on the track team. 2.she got out alive! lol.it is a cool movie and quite scary. check it out, you will be happy with this masterpiece. don't listen to the other people on the site. its very good. trust me, i am good at reviewing movies. i'm a future movie critic. i totally want to buy this movie. and you will too when you see it. it is amazingly awesome.

i don't watch very many 'horror' movies, but one night i sat down and watched this with my cousins. now, we're teenagers, so we tend to make fun of a lot of things, but honestly, the acting here really wasn't very good, especially at the beginning. one line that stood out was when scarlett says to jill and tiffany, "this is so... high school!" while the next scene shows jill walking past a sign with their high school name on it... many parts at the beginning reminded me of a corny, badly-written, badly-acted lizzie mcguire episode. however, as the story progressed, and the cast moved on to just about only jill most of the time, i was able to appreciate the movie more. camilla belle did really well in this movie, and i think that the other actors and actresses ruined the movie for her. and i must admit, this was one of the scariest movies i've ever seen. well, no, there weren't big monsters and white faces appearing in dark corners and possessed dolls, but the thing that made this movie scarier than ones containing those things is that it really could happen. and this movie really reminded me of what really is scary... we all know we're not likely to stumble upon the living dead any time in our lives, but the idea of having a murderer inside the house you're babysitting at could really happen. the only flaw with this movie is that it's one of the most cliché movies i've ever seen. it has everything in it that any horror movie has ever had- turning the keys and the car starts, shadows in the corner, turning the corners of the stairs with suspense, turning around and seeing a dead body, ending a fatal scene quickly with waking up from a dream, etc. at the suspenseful scenes, it was very predictable, but overall, i would give it a 7/10. it's definitely worth seeing.by the way, this is my first review, so i don't know if any of those things were spoilers.. but just to be safe...

while i read all of the complaints about this movie before i saw it, i still had interest from the preview. i don't know if it was because i was expecting a bomb or what, but i really enjoyed the movie. the i was not very frightened at all until the second half of the movie, but even then it wasn't very bad at all. i think that most of the scenes and false alarms were realistic, if a little too coincidental, but it was necessary to move the story along. i think that the house and surrounding area is the perfect setting for this type of movie, it is beautiful and huge, but then the same qualities that are attractive become scary. i also think that the light arrangement worked extremely well because not only did they turn on upon entry, but there was no way to keep them on, so the house stayed dark outside of the small section jill was in.speaking of jill, i thought her part was acted pretty well, at first it wasn't as believable, but after a few phone calls it was fine. in fact the scenes where she is frightened are acted perfectly. and, finally, someone got the fire poker right. i can't tell you how many times when i hear a noise at my house i grab the fire poker, and it was a nice touch for her to do the same, even though she idiotically forgets it when she needs it most.in regards to the plot holes, the movie is not perfect but almost every hole can be explained, and part of the mystery is how he got in..exactly, how long was he watching her? how did he get out to kill her friend? and when exactly did the gardener die? overall, i enjoyed it and i was surprised how quickly it went. it kept my attention, and i wanted to see how it ended, although the ending was very brief and left a bad taste in my mouth. my only complaint, other than the ending, was the lack of character development. they could have added ten minutes with her and her friends or something to make us feel bad for her situation more, to give us a taste of her personality and to give us foreshadowing to how she will handle the situation(for example, the scene where she debates whether to go back for the kids, it looks like some scene is missing at the beginning that talked about her only caring about herself or something).

im a big horror fan and i quite enjoyed this remake. with all these horror remakes floating about i think this is one of the better attempts.i watched it with my two little sisters and i think it made it even better as they were quite scared. also with the shouting at the screen "dont do that!", "not that way!", etc. i thought there were some good little jumpy moments and it built the tension well.camilla belle is absolutely stunning in the lead role and a very good actress - so she holds your attention well. overall a decent film.

i liked this movie. i'm not a big horror movie buff so i couldn't comment on similarities between this and other movies of this genre, but i found this movie quite captivating. the story line, albeit a little obvious, had some genuinely scary/tense moments and the acting (particually of the lead female role) wasn't bad in anywayoverall i'm a little surprised at the low rating this movie has gotten. i watch a lot of movies (working in a video store tends to help) and this really isn't as bad as people seem to think. i do have some criticism though. the final call from the cop was terrible, almost overacted, the dead girl in the bathroom looked liked she was having a little sleep (probably from the amount of tequila she mentioned she drank) and the children's reaction to what was happening instilled in me the hope that they were ultimately killed hope this helps some people

after the success of "muppet babies" warner brothers chalked up "tiny toons". but instead of making bugs bunny, daffy duck and all the rest of the looney toon gang kids, they created new animal characters who were kids with their own distinct personalities but personalities that nonetheless mirrored their predecessors. the leads included buster & babs bunny (no relation, which became their running gag or catch phrase), plucky duck, hampton pig, dizzy devil, shirley 'the' loon, elmira, montana max, furball, sweety, the rats and assorted animals of perfecto prep, and the original looney toons cast themselves. the "tiny toons" lived in acme acres and attended acme looniversity, where the looney toon gang worked as teachers who served as mentors to the younger generation the ins and out of comedy.during the show's run, various pot shots were taken at the bush sr. administration, pop culture, and coupled with various other gags and spoofs.buster & babs, arguably the show's main characters, as mentioned above, were similar to bugs bunny in some respects, but they also had their own differing personality ticks and comic styles, namely, babs' tendency to impersonate anyone and everyone, while buster, capable of being a great goof himself, usually played straight man (or straight rabbit) to babs' antics. plucky duck was a virtual copy of daffy duck (not screwball daffy but egomaniac daffy), with nearly as big an ego as daffy and just as much of an obsession with upstaging the buster & babs as daffy had with upstaging bugs, though he usually fell flat on his face in his attempts, yet he remained strangely endearing through out. hampton was an even more shy version of porky pig, and he had the thankless job of playing porky to plucky's daffy. shirley, the blond duck gal, was a new age valley girl type whom plucky would go in and out of phases of mocking or vying for her affections. dizzy was the purple version of the tasmanian devil. furball was the silent sylvester and sweety was the pink tweetie bird. there was also the purple female skunk who longed for a boyfriend and the pint sized versions of wile coyote and the road runner. evil was defined in the form of montana max, a rich kid who was always out to make a buck or make people's lives miserable. there was also elmira, a deranged animal lover whom everyone feared. and then there was godo dodo, an odd thing-a-ma-gig creature who had no clearly designated species except that he was from "wacky land" or something like that.pop culture references included batman (quite frequently actually), michael jackson, vanilla ice, dances with wolves, indiana jones, star trek, supergirl, fast food joints, the ten commandments, the twilight zones, saturday night live and even the simpsons, among others.not only funny, but it also managed to be warm and touching, something it's successor "animaniacs" never quite attained. also followed by "taz-mania".

ok, the show was a little uneven, but i still loved it. i found the main two bunnies annoying, but hamton & plucky were always amusing.i really want the baby plucky episodes on dvd (or even vhs). please release those!specifically the "potty years" episode aired on 11/22/91; the "going up" episode aired on 9/17/92 and the "minister golf" episode in 11/92.they are the funniest bits of the whole series and even over a decade later we still reference these bits!(i have nothing more to say, please reduce the minimum to something like 5 lines and rewards us for brevity!)

they just don't make cartoons like they used to. this one had wit, great characters, and the greatest ensemble of voice over artists ever assembled for a daytime cartoon show. this still remains as one of the highest rated daytime cartoon shows, and one of the most honored, winning several emmy awards.

it's now 2005 and 15+ years since this cartoon first aired. i haven't actually watched it seriously or closely in about 10 years. now that i'm an adult in my 30s i can look back with a serious eye as i watch the episodes again.in concept, the cartoon is partly an homage to the classic looney tunes but also its own original show. there are a few episodes that are structured like the old cartoons. for example, there is a singer that attacks buster and so he exacts revenge on this singer's concert -exactly like the old bugs bunny cartoon. the ensuing cartoon is similar to looney tunes, just in a different era. if you look at the old looney tunes, they did an awful lot of stuff exactly like tiny toons did. the old looney tunes made a lot of social commentary and parody. there were celebrity impersonations. there were a lot of corny period jokes, slang, and dialog. the comedy was surreal and wacky. you can say this exactly for tiny toons as well. the comedy styling is 'spiritually' the same. most definitely a throwback to the classics which hadn't been done well (if at all) in cartoons in the decades prior to this show. we recognize the cultural references in tiny toons and we can roll our eyes when something we don't like comes up. but the reason we don't think looney tunes are corny is because we weren't alive back in the 40s. also, looney tunes was original back in those days but today cartoons are rehashed over and over. so it's easy to perceive tiny toons in an unfair light due to our exposure to current events and our overexposure to cartoons in general.there certainly are differences in many respects - the timing, the delivery, and obviously the duration of the shows. they are two different styles from two different periods, being done under two very different circumstances - looney tunes being made for adults in theaters and tiny toons being made for kids watching tv. even so, they did a good job making an original show with original gags and still paying homage to and patterning after the comedy stylings of the old looney tunes.since tiny toons had a lot more time to play with, they had some genuine moments of great animated inspiration. you only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, the baby plucky toilet episode.. there are so many more. for example, one of the best comedy dialog exchanges ever animated is in thirteensomething when babs and buster are on the phone in a split screen, hoping each misses the other. the miscommunication is spectacular. notably, the character development in this episode and in several others (usually the ones penned by deanna oliver or sherri stoner) is rather good. the female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual considering the opposite is usually true for cartoons of that period.this was the first modern cartoon that had lots of both pop culture-referential and self-referential humor. this was way ahead of its time. tiny toons really opened up a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in the cartoons today, instead of doing the boring old crap we endured as 80s kids. yes, i loved transformers and thundercats, but tiny toons totally jumped away from all that. it was a breath of fresh air. bakshi's new adventures of mighty mouse may have been a precursor, but tiny toons made this surreal style of comedy cartoon writing a real success.as a kid i totally overlooked some jokes. for example, one episode is an homage to the marx brothers that i completely ignored as a teen. now i have a newfound respect for it. there are so many inspired gags that i never noticed that are genuinely brilliant. it's that kind of comedy that makes me think of looney tunes and family guy. i never noticed that kind of comedy as a kid. i've been thinking this for most episodes i watched recently.you'd notice these kinds of things if you actually watched the show. unlike some other reviewers here who i know are unfairly judging it, i've seen all the episodes and have thought about them thoroughly, exposed both as a kid and as an adult.you can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too. i'm not talking about just the main characters, but the side characters were done really well and creatively too. but back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. tress macneille had, in my opinion, her best performances in this cartoon. she hasn't been the same since. rob paulsen also did some incredible stuff here, too.this is all not to say the show didn't have some bad episodes. it had plenty. it had a lot of mediocre ones, too. but by far it certainly had a lot of genuinely funny episodes. especially back when it first aired it was actually funny to watch.out of 10 i give the show an 8.5 - and kudos for pushing the envelope and breaking down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons.

the true story of a spanish paraplegic, ramón sampedro, who fought for decades for the right to be euthenized. this film, along with the best picture winner of the same year, million dollar baby, caused a stir that year with their depictions of disabled persons desiring death. both advocates for the disabled and (unfortunately for the disability advocates) conservative pro-life groups protested both films, and their oscar nominations. the nominations also came during the entire terry schiavo debacle, just to put it all in some historical perspective. the protests, especially from the disability groups, against million dollar baby make some sense  the film clearly depicted, without wavering, the life of a paraplegic as worthless. the film's central character, maggie fitzgerald, becomes a paraplegic, doesn't seem to get any counseling whatsoever, no help whatsoever, and immediately wants to die. the film is, honestly, pretty dumb and uncomplex. the sea inside, based on the true story, is certainly a lot more thoughtful on the subject. it most likely got railroaded into the same category as million dollar baby without its protesters having even seen it, an incredibly common phenomenon. the film does give time to many different sides of the argument. and it immediately declares that the wish to die is that of the protagonist and the protagonist alone. it is guilty of a couple of crimes, though, and i'd still understand why disability groups could have a problem with it. first and foremost, there's the protagonist's meeting with a paraplegic bishop. i don't look kindly on the way he's depicted. his orally operated wheelchair is depicted as absurd, and there's almost a comic sequence where his effeminate, boy-toy servants are dragging him, in his chair, up the stairs. he can't even reach the room in which ramón is located, and one of the boy-toys is forced to carry the conversation between them. i had to think, gee, maybe if ramón lived in a slightly more wheelchair-accessible household, he wouldn't spend his entire life in bed, and might find life more fulfilling (who knows how closely the film depicts the reality). director amenábar (the others) also includes some laughable scenes that try to make this film about suicide more life-affirming, like a cross-cut sequence where ramón looks thoughtful and his lawyer's baby is born. but besides a few ugly moments, the film is very good. it hurts that someone may want to die when they have the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others. however, in the end, our lives do belong to us. shouldn't we have the right to choose? the film's strongest asset is its supporting characters, and the actors who play them. it depicts how ramón's fight and decisions affect those around him with a beautiful precision. the family members in particular are great, and ramón's final departure from them is absolutely heartbreaking, and had me in tears. my favorite performance in the film comes from lola dueñas, whom i also felt gave the best, or at least certainly most undervalued, performance in almodóvar's volver last year.

the sea inside a film by alejandro amenabar.almodovar has always single handed the flag for spanish cinema for years now, out of nowhere came amenabar reinventing genres and injecting some new blood to the otherwise malfunctioning spanish industry, now in a big gamble he switches from psychological terror to social drama, well the big ones would be, are audiences ready to embrace the swing and more important can he hold the flag? this is the story of ramon sampedro, a sailor that in his twenties was paralyzed from the neck down in an accident at the sea and his fight with the spanish government for the right to end his life. the story has the traces of an afternoon made for tv melodrama and the only way this is going to work is through words and honest performances and they both come in spades. mateo gil and amenabar co-write in a way where the audience is not meant to be lead blind to a death end but they are encouraged to make up their own minds in the process and that is a brilliant stroke, this is not a movie pro death but a movie in favour of the ultimate illusions of our time liberty. there is a few laughs spare a long the way, like when the church comes home in a wheel chair to deconstruct sampedro beliefs but is mostly a valley of tears through out, punches coming from all fronts even when you think you are safe his father that to that point didn't make any sense comes up with the most moving line of the entire movie. it is a heartbreaking experience specially when sampedro seems more full of life than most the people wandering the streets and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life even those who are helping him to die but when you strip a man of his dreams the film is almost exclusively built on close ups bringing a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic with sampedro. that's for the actors a huge challenge that must construct their whole performances with their eyes and the eyes don't lie. bardem was not granted his second oscar nomination, probably in favour of eastwood, but in my opinion he was the only one who could have shadowed jammie fox. this role reminds me of the great gregory peck in to kill a mockingbird where the acting looked effortless and i reckon bardem has reached that status where the line of what is acting and what is real has become completely blur. i was never fond of his early work but since almodovar's live flesh he is on a roll, los lunes al sol, the dancer upstairs and the oscar nominated before the night falls made him an international star and although he and banderas come from the same almodovar background is fascinating to see how different paths they took and how bardem has now become a real reference for spanish cinema in the whole world. a golden globe, 14 goyas, jury prize at venice and probably an oscar with permission from the chorus boys, amenabar directs, co-write, edits and puts music to a high caliber drama, he has pull it off what about some science fiction now? whose life is it anyway?****.

in spain, the former sailor ramón sampedro (javier bardem) has been quadriplegic for twenty-eight years and is fighting in court for his right of practicing euthanasia through an association that defends the freedom of choice and leaded by his friend géne (clara segura). ramón is introduced to the lawyer that is defending his cause, julia (belén rueda), who has a degenerative fatal disease; and meets rosa (lola dueñas), a lonely worker that has been abused by men. their relationship changes the behavior and viewpoint of life of rosa and julia.the chilean alejandro amenábar is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary directors. his filmography released in brazil is composed by excellent and original movies: "abre los ojos", "tesis", "the others" and "mar adentro". javier bardem is probably the best actor in spain in the present days. their association produced this sensitive drama about a very polemic theme, the right of committing euthanasia. this drama is never corny or depressive, since the screenplay uses humor as a relieve valve in the most dramatic situations. the performances of the cast are perfect, with characters having and defending different positions regarding this unpleasant theme. the dialogs and lines are very solid and intelligent. i noted in imdb plot outline that this movie is based on the real-life story of ramón sampedro. unfortunately, neither the movie nor the dvd gives this important information. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "mar adentro" ("sea inside")

alejandro amenabar, the young and talented spanish director, clearly shows us he is a serious film maker. anyone doubting it, should have a look at his latest film "the sea inside". this is a movie that has been rewarded with numerous accolades, not only in spain, but throughout the world, wherever this wonderful movie has been shown.if you have not seen the film, perhaps you would like to stop here.ramon sampedro is a man confined to bed. being quadriplegic, he depends on the kindness of strangers for everything. since his accident, ramon only thinks in one thing alone: how to end his life! this is the moral issue at the center of the story, based on the real ramon sampedro's life.mr. amenabar tells the story from ramon's point of view. there is nothing here that is false or manipulative on his part. after all, he relies on facts that were well known in his country as this case became a "cause celebre" in favor of euthanasia, a theme that no one in that country wanted to deal with in spain.with its background of being a predominantly roman catholic country, spain has evolved into one of the most democratic societies in europe, a distinction that is more notable because of its long years dominated by a dictator. yet, in spite of the advances in that society, the idea of taking one's own life, is something not clearly understood by the majority of its citizens, who still considered this subject as something that could not be done in their country.ramon sampedro was a man that loved life. he lived an intense life as a young man when he enlisted as a sailor to discover the world. having no money, this was the only way for him to see other lands, experience other cultures. ramon's love affair with the sea, is something that people in galicia learn to love from their childhood. imagine how that same friendly sea is the one that takes away ramon's life, as he knew it! in a second, ramon goes from a vibrant young man into a vegetable!ramon's family is shattered by the experience. suddenly they must leave everything aside to take care of him at home. his brother and sister-in-law, are stoic people that deal with the situation as a matter of fact. their lives become something of an afterthought, because ramon's life comes first. they tend to the sick man without protesting, or blaming ramon for the sacrifices they must make to keep him alive.that is why, in their minds, the sampedros can't comprehend ramon's wishes to end it all. haven't they given up having a normal life to take care of him? this moral issue weighs heavily on these uncomplicated and simple people because in their minds, they are doing what came naturally.the second subject of the movie is the legal issue of the euthanasia and the well meaning people that suddenly enter ramon's life in their desire to help him put an end to his suffering. there's julia, the lawyer who is herself handicapped and suffers from a rare malady. there is rosa, the fish cannery worker who becomes infatuated with ramon. javier bardem, makes a brilliant ramon sampedro. his transformation is total. we don't doubt from one moment he is no one else but the paralyzed man on that bed. mr. bardem can only use his face in order to convey all the emotions trapped inside ramon. mr. bardem makes this man real. this is perhaps javier bardem's best role of his career. he surpasses his own award winning performance as reynaldo arenas, the late cuban poet he portrayed in "before night falls". in the supporting roles, belen rueda, makes an impressive appearance as julia, the woman fighting her own physical problems. lola duenas is also effective as rosa, the kindred soul that loves ramon deeply. celso bugallo, as ramon's brother shows a man at a crossroads of his own life. mabel rivera makes a compassionate manuela, the sister-in-law that never asks anything of life, but tends to ramon without questioning why she has to do it, at all.mr. amenabar also has composed the haunting music score for the film. he is a man that never cease to surprise. one wonders what his next project will be, but one wishes him success in whatever he might decide to do in the future.

i had the privilege to watch mar adentro last friday, and i am still shocked by its beauty, the powerful work of every single actor and actress and amenabar's unbelievable ability to narrate the story of ramón sampedro, who was well known in spain for asking for a legal euthanasia, lost the court cause, and eventually died in front of a camera drinking a glass with poison, freezing all our hearts with his determination not to go on living forever immobilized because of an accident. before watching the movie i was already mesmerized by the strong symbology in its title, which i would translate as "into the sea" and not as some suggest "out to sea", and which is taken from an original poem written by the man this story is about. then i watched the movie. oh my friends. this is cinema with a capital c. the narration flows to take you to the heart of every single character: sampedro, reincarnated in a bardem that you forget from the very beginning, is in the center as a man full of sense of humour and full of hope, and his hope is to die, because for him, the life he is living is not worthy to be lived. the rest of the characters but one dance around him and respect his decision because they see him as a human independent being (forgetting he depends on the others for everything), even though they do love him so much. and this is what the movie is about: love. you can feel it, you can breathe it in the skin of every character. you witness the growing of the feeling within three women who meet him in the movie: gené, the member of the association that defend his right to die with dignity, his friend, her story in the movie is the hope for us the lucky ones that can live a normal life in this world; rosa, the woman who meets a good man in the middle of her list of broken relationships and pain in the hands of all the men who used her and despised her; julia, the woman who shares a tragic destiny with ramón, and eventually acts in a way we cannot but only understand.however, before meeting these women ramón knew what was love like, because you cannot meet him without loving him, and he is deeply loved by his abnegated family: four characters unique in their humbleness and bravery, each with their own thoughts about his decision, each thought respectable in its own way, because the terrible thing about this story is that nobody is to blame for what happened. that, sadly, life sometimes is that terrible. from this familiar quartet i specially liked mabel rivera's work as ramón's sister in law, manuela: a terrific performance.i would like to draw attention to three episodes that are for me the best climax points i have seen in a long time, and if you haven't seen the movie don't read this, pass over this paragraph and read again from the next one starting "mar adentro", let the movie show its secrets to you. the episodes i loved were: 3. the best love scene i have seen in a movie, when i really felt love invading the screen, is when ramón dreams awake that he is flying to meet julia in the beach and they kiss each other. 2. gené speaking by phone with ramón, the day before he is going to do it, and he tells her it is better they say goodbye at that very moment, not to put her in trouble with the authorities. and then she knows it is the last time they are going to talk, and she has fought for his right to die... but she does not want to lose him, because she loves him as a true friend, and even though she is respecting his decision at all cost. 1. the best. a young ramón in the beach, looking at his girlfriend under the sun, jumping to the water from the rocks to a sea that is retreating. we see the crash, we hear his voice recalling what happened and claiming he should have died that very moment. the face of bardem, face downward, shown to us from the bottom. and the hand of a friend who pulls him from the forehead and brings him back to a life that will be a hell for him in the next 30 years. there are many others, like the impressive ending, in spite of the fact that in spain we know too well what ramon did.mar adentro did not deceive me, amenabar never does, but this time he has to thank the actors that took part in the project, and who maybe took it personally, because this is not just a movie, it is an elegy to a man who died alone when he was asking to die "legally", which meant for him, as bardem pointed out, dying with the people he loved and who loved him around.

this story about a man's 28 year struggle for a death that would liberate him from his already dead body becomes a masterpiece to be remembered,thanks to a team of artists in a state of grace. directed, written,edited and scored by alejandro amenabar, it touches you from the very first images, and doesn't leave your eyes and your heart to rest until the last credits, thanks to alejandro and a group of wonderful actors and actresses at their best. bardem is an acting animal:one of those few comedians that can make a masterpiece from almost any character, the supporting actresses are great in their roles and the story is told with such a sensibility that one laughs and cries in the same minute, as we used to do with the great old masterpieces. the year's best film in all senses. 10 / 10

this small, quiet, harmonious movie grows into a masterpiece on human dignity. it is intelligently structured, filled with meaningful little details and important side-plots. it tells a story of one man with great humanity without positioning itself politically, but fostering life as a precious right (not an obligation) and underlining individual's right to choose. it enjoys the richness of different landscapes (mental and physical) and languages (important detail). outstanding acting by each of the actors, especially unbelievable javier bardem. his screen-presence has such a force that you forget that this is fiction. the movie has a wonderful rhythm, it is beautifully shot and outstandingly directed. it takes real talent to make a movie on such a difficult theme with understanding, humour and heart. six stars out of five.

director and co-writer alejandro amenabar didn't make things easy for viewers of his taut, a bit overlong but very disturbing story, accurately based on a spanish man's struggle to obtain assisted suicide. "mar adentro" ("the sea inside") is gripping and its impact far exceeds the time spent in the theater.with the award-winning canadian movie, "the barbarian invasions," folks got to see a family along with a coterie of devoted friends address the wish of a beloved albeit irascible man to end his life. in that movie, the center of attention suffered from progressive, incurable cancer and his descent into a terminal stage was fast. emotional as the scenes were, death was inevitable - the question was how gentle could it be made through solicited intervention.ramon sampedro (brilliantly played by javier bardem) is a different story. for well over two decades he's been a quadriplegic because of a diving accident. (very sharp viewers may detect a terrible irony as to why he ended in that condition because of his improvident dive.) once a world traveler and lover of beautiful women, he now lies trapped in an immobile body, his every need attended to by a truly devoted family who willingly surrender much of their privacy and time to sustain their beloved relation.rosa (lola duenas), a single mom of two small boys, enters the sampedro household out of what might have been mere curiosity to learn about the paralyzed man's plight but she becomes both an emotionally supportive centerpiece for ramon as well as an amusing but occasionally aggravating presence. a nice performance by duenas.the problem, of course, is that sampedro isn't sick in the normal sense. he may well live for decades more with proper care. so his softly but persistently voiced desire to end his life with "dignity" creates a moral dilemma for friends and relatives who, not surprisingly, react from different ethical and religious perspectives.ramon is the poster quad of a group dedicated to changing spain's laws concerning assisted suicide. "death with dignity" is their watchword. gene (clara segura) is a sensitive activist who enlists the aid of pro bono publico counsel, julia (belen rueda). julia has her own health issues which carry an indefinite but catastrophic prognosis. happily married to a devoted spouse, she bonds emotionally with her client.what follows is an acutely sensitive interplay of values and emotions. ramon lives with his brother and wife, their technophile teenage son, not the intellectual ramon is, and his aged dad who can't stop grieving over his son's cataclysmic descent into absolute helplessness.the moral and legal issues are played out through excellent acting and short vignettes including a courtroom scene in which formalism triumphs over any judicial interpretation that might take into account ramon's feelings and views. it may be spain but the issues are alive in most countries, including the u.s.especially amusing is a shouted, first floor to bedroom, debate between ramon with a drop-in, lecturing jesuit priest, also a quadriplegic but one whose hidebound dogma casually masks the absence of a soul.special kudos to mabel rivera, ramon's sister-in-law-manuela, for a wrenchingly authentic portrayal of a strong woman who holds the family together. and the same compliment fulsomely extends to belen rueda, julia, who segues from objective advocate to close friend to a woman hurtling towards a dark fate.the director imposes no value judgments allowing each character full range to express his or her feelings effectively and, at times, movingly. like "dead man walking," this movie can support any view about its deadly subject.no one can stop a person from committing suicide if he/she is determined but the universal tragedy of the world's ramons is that without assistance, life in a body in which only the heart beats and only the head can move is a sentence no court could pronounce on the most depraved of criminals.the cinematography is well-matched to the story and the beautiful galician scenes are an intended contrast to the limited views the once globe-trotting ramon experiences from his special bed.9/10

greetings again from the darkness. director alejandro amenabar creates life against all odds in this based on a true story version of one man's struggle to control his destiny. the great javier bardem is fascinating to watch in his role as ramon. his eyes and head movements leave little doubt what is going on in his mind. the dream and fantasy sequences are not overused so prove very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants. rather than force us to answer the euthanasia question, the real question posed is , what is love? at every turn we see people in love, looking for love or dying to be loved. the script is tight and keeps the film moving despite being filmed mostly in one room. the supporting cast is wonderful and we truly feel their pain and how each family member deals with ramon's decision. this is a gem and deserves to be seen.

many more eloquent reviews than this have described the quite spectacular acting, casting and styling of this film. it appears that the only negative reviews focus on a perceived imbalance in the film's handling of the core moral question (euthanasia).this film is, bar the final scenes, meticulous in stressing ramon's belief that he's not making some grand point but merely that, for him, a life devoid of dignity is a life not worth living. we, as viewers, see an enormous amount of dignity in his life - we see family and friends and culture and, but for its physical limitations, a life fully lived. central to the tragedy of this film is that there is really only one person who thinks that ramon's life is not worth living - and that is him.to watch this film and say that the only counter argument comes from the visit of a bumbling priest is a nonsense. the priest's visit is pure farce, a direct assault on the simplicity of the spanish catholic church's response to the issue of euthanasia. however, the sister's parting words to the priest momentarily expose the powerful 'pro-life' sentiments quietly underpinning the entire film. we are constantly encouraged to see the hope and the beauty of a life lived with love. as the film progresses, we may gradually be encouraged to understand ramon's reasoning but we are never reconciled to his decision. i do not remember a film which moved me and provoked me as much as this.

if you go to the cinema to be entertained, amused, so as to fill up your time, do not go out of your way to watch this film.if you go to the cinema to appreciate the depths of human-kind, the feelings of real people, to explore the characteriology of personalities, if you go to the cinema to absorb magnificent photography, be sure to put this film very high on your list, preferably in first place. the experience is profoundly rewarding, causing the intelligent viewer to make diverse reflexions over the meaning of life itself. with 'mar adentro' alejandro amenábar has surpassed the best he has done to date, and even redeemed certain deviations in his earlier films which smacked a little of being aimed at hollywood. this is not the case with this visual poem put to music: hollywood could never get anywhere near the effect of this tinglingly inspired human - and humane - story.in no way should one interpret 'mar adentro' as an apologia for euthanasia; this story, based on the real life of the galician fisherman ramón sampedro, is a cry from the bottom of the heart for life and love, a reaching out for human compassion, for understanding emotions. sampedro was an articulate and intelligent man who after a diving accident off the rocks of the galician coast as a young man was condemned to live the next 27 years in bed. 'condenado a vivir' (2001) (tv) was the first version of this man's life on which i have already commented. however, amenábar has succeeded remarkably at portraying this man, with his permanent enigmatic smile and witty sense of humour, in an equally articulate and intelligent way.and javier bardem rose to the occasion, met the challenge head-on, complete with a galician accent, producing an electrifying, compelling, enthralling performance, such that the actor and the fisherman become fused into being the same person on screen. here, indeed, is an occasion to doff your cap, and softly mutter 'chapeau'. bardem is driven on in his task by a magnificent cast, especially belén rueda, lola dueñas, mabel rivera, celso bugallo (los lunes al sol) (qv) and clara segura, galician and catalan accents taking prominent part. amenábar produces wonderful dialogues as these six rotate among themselves one-on-one, or in groups, with excellent chemistry, thus demonstrating that this young chilean-born spanish director is an artist who knows what he is at and how to get his results; his global concept of the film includes his own music, interspersed with pieces by beethoven and puccini on sampedro's record-player.whilst viewing 'mar adentro', i found myself a couple of times comparing him and this film with stephen daldry and his masterpiece 'the hours' (qv). i refer to the way in which the dialogues work with tenseness and passion and that careful sense of timing in each scene.javier aguirresarobe's photography is superb as usual. as i have mentioned elsewhere on imdb, he does not simply film the events and scenes - he captures even the feelings and the atmosphere of the moment, deftly catches that look in the eyes, light and shadows, such that his work behind the camera is at once another player in the story. a superb artist.'mar adentro' is another landmark in the history of spanish cinematography, among the best five or six works of art produced here in the last 25 years. this film places itself alongside such cinematographic art as 'el sur' (qv), 'los santos inocentes' (qv), 'el abuelo' (qv), 'la lengua de las mariposas' (qv), 'las ratas' (qv), 'a los que aman' (qv), and i think i must add 'te doy mis ojos' (qv).superbly orchestrated story of a real man, and those who loved him around his bedside: not to be missed.

the greatest effort plus the finest cast ever assembled in a movie by the director tim robbins and susan sarandon and sean penn on the front row. someone said that this movie is good because directed and written by tim robbins but i convince you that sean penn and susan sarandon had give me a truly superb performance that i cried my heart out. their acting is so real! no doubt about it that this movie is rated 4 and 3/4 out of 5!

i read the book before seeing the movie, and the film is one of the best adaptations out there. very true and faithful to the book. sean penn and sarandon are amazing. robbins is a talented filmaker and i wish he would add more to his repetoire. he made the film very haunting and intentionally slow-paced to add depth. an especially brilliant bit of filmaking was the reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end.

i really enjoyed this movie. it challenged my emotions and beliefs, making it a true piece of artwork in my book. the acting was unsurpassed. i would never watch this movie with anyone i could not cry around, i don't think i cry harder to any movies, maybe because it makes me look at myself, i dunno. it is a must see.

one of the best ever. direction, fotography, a thrilling and dramatic history, wonderful soundtrack and, most of all, the incredible credibility of susan sarandon and sean penn, the best and most underestimated "under-40 generation" actor. after seeing this movie i guess if there's anyone who couldn't have any doubt about giving death to another man, in spite of the ugly things he could have done?

i must have seen this movie about four or five times already, and it gets better with each viewing. suffice it to say: this is the best film i've ever seen. and i think i've seen a lot.but i've always wondered why this film got so shunned in some reviews or ratings. for example, take the imdb top 250. why does it rank only at #216 (as of today)? surely, the answer's not in the film itself (because that is nothing but flawless), but in its reception. the film caused controversy in its portrayal of compassion for a convicted murderer and its anti-death penalty attitude. and so, obviously, the more conservative-minded user probably didn't like the film (as you can see from some of the other comments). so dead man walking gets a ranking that's nothing but ridiculous in relation to its quality. those people didn't understand what the film wanted to say, and maybe they didn't want to understand, being pro death penalty. so now i get it: it's all political. you're pro death penalty- you don't like (and therefore don't want to hear) what the film has to say.i'm truly sorry there are still so many people out there who simply tune out when a new perspective questions their beliefs.mr. robbins, your movie's issue split people's opinions. some reconsidered their point-of-view, some simply didn't listen, but you made a very important point. your movie will probably never show up on any "top 100 movies of all time"-list, but it'll be remembered, long after films like braveheart or babe or apollo 13 (all of which were unjustly preferred over your film at the oscars 1996) are forgotten. congratulations, mr. robbins, and thank you for this important piece of filmmaking.

how do you know if a movie is good or not? it is the impact it has on you that makes the difference. "dead man walking" upset me a great deal. i watched it twice. i don't know if i will be strong enough to watch it again. no, i did not feel good at all after watching it, but the film was as successful as it can be.robbins did a great job in incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic. he avoided making an argument that could easily be seen as biased or subjective. i hope that many people get to see "dead man walking". i believe that anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty so enthusiastically should see the movie.i don't know what else it could take to finally convince everyone that this relic from ancient times does not have a place in modern society anymore.the movie itself does not make an argument for or against death penalty. it describes reality. the reality is the best argument against the death penalty.a 10/10 for great performances, good filmmaking, and for the most important film made in yearsthank you, tim robbins!

it was very sensitive very deep. it's my favorite all the time you can't see movie more deeper than this incredible movie. susan sarandon made her role as matured mind actress, and she realized her role. she deserved the award. she convinced me with for being a nun. the music was very impressive and sensitive. really i liked this deep masterpiece.

"dead man walking" is one of the most powerful movies i have ever seen. i find it hard to believe that anyone, after having seen the movie, could feel indifferent about the film or its message. tim robbins does not try to impose his ideas and beliefs on the viewers, but manages to make a film that are in most ways sympathetic to both views on the death penalty -- whether it is right to murder a murderer or not. i have always known where i stand in this question, even as a child, and this movie -- despite the fact that it does not really take any sides -- made me even surer in my conviction that it can never be right to murder *anyone*.sean penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of matthew poncelet, his nomination for an academy award was very well-deserved. even if nicolas cage does a great job in "leaving las vegas", i would have been happier if penn had won the award. susan sarandon is also brilliant and she deserved the academy award she won. and tim robbins certainly deserves the vote i have given this film: 9/10!

"dead man walking" is a piece of incredible filmmaking. all the acting is top-notch and realistic, and the script examines the issue of the death penalty from both sides, paying equal homage to both. above all, this is a deeply moving story of redemption, of death with dignity and loss of ego. any film that deals this courageously and maturely with such incredibly difficult subject matter deserves a rating of 10/10. thank you, tim robbins!

in a world in which debatable and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly, this powerful 1995 film takes on one at the top of that list; moreover, it does it objectively and realistically, and with a sensibility and sensitivity that makes it a truly great film by anyone's measuring stick. and to add some irony to it all, even the subject matter of this film has been widely misunderstood, as it is wrongly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; it is not. at the heart of `dead man walking,' directed by tim robbins, is a subject that in reality is possibly the most misunderstood of all, and with good reason, because it just may be the hardest thing there is for a human being to really-- and truly-- understand. and it is what this film is actually all about: forgiveness. real forgiveness; not excusing a heinous crime or the perpetrator thereof-- not saying that what's happened is okay-- but finding the strength to go on, and to do so by choosing life.	director/screenwriter tim robbins has crafted and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by sister helen prejean, in which she discusses her involvement with the death-row inmates to whom over the years she has ministered her faith in god. as chronicled in the film, what for her was to become a lifelong pursuit of not only justice, but human dignity, began with a simple letter from a death-row inmate at the louisiana state prison at angola. sentenced to death for rape and murder, matthew poncelet (sean penn) was reaching out to anyone who would listen, when his letter ended up in the hands of sister prejean (susan sarandon), who soon found herself venturing into a territory of which she had absolutely no knowledge or experience. and robbins has successfully captured sister prejean's emotional and turbulent journey succinctly, while managing to keep it devoid of any maudlin sentimentality, which makes it not only real, credible and believable, but makes it a poignant and thoroughly emotionally involving experience for the audience. through the medium of the cinema, what was once a personal, significant emotional experience for sister prejean, becomes one for everyone who sees this film, as well.	for her soul-stirring, impassioned portrayal of sister prejean, susan sarandon deservedly won the oscar for best actress. sensitive and fraught with emotional depth, her performance is incredibly touching and real, especially in the way in which she conveys sister prejean's underlying natural fragility and vulnerability, which she adamantly tempered with the toughness she needed to carry on with her endeavors on behalf of poncelet (and in reality, a total of five since she began). whatever your point of view regarding the matters examined in this film, sister prejean is without question an individual of heroic proportions, which sarandon exquisitely personifies here; and she does it without resorting to any superfluous melodramatics, but rather by keeping it real, by subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a very believable expression of characterization. it's an extraordinary performance, arguably the best of sarandon's brilliant career. 	turning in a career-best performance, as well, is sean penn, who was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of poncelet (he lost out to nicolas cage, who won for his performance in `leaving las vegas). perfect for the part in every way, penn has quite simply never been better, before or since. he effectively presents poncelet as a real person, rather than as an overblown caricature of a monster capable of perpetrating the crimes depicted here. not that it makes poncelet any less despicable; just the opposite, in fact. it makes it genuinely disconcerting to be faced with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next door to you could be capable of such things. and that's the strength of penn's performance-- it's so disturbingly real, presented with depth and nuance; you have but to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul. a terrific performance, and -- as good as cage was in `vegas'-- penn should have received the oscar for it.	in another stand-out performance, raymond j. barry is memorable in a supporting role as earl delacroix, father of one of poncelet's victims. with limited screen time, he nevertheless develops his character in such a way that enables you to empathize with him, as well as with sister prejean, as it is through him that we are given some insight into just how complex and seemingly tenuous her position is, at least on the surface. barry presents delacroix in such a way that gives the necessary balance and perspective to the story, which is ultimately extremely effective and helps to underscore the message of the film.	the supporting cast includes r. lee emery (clyde percy), celia weston (mary beth percy), lois smith (helen's mother), scott wilson (chaplin farley), roberta maxwell (lucille poncelet), margo martindale (sister colleen) and jack black (craig poncelet). it is doubtful that this film will change anyone's mind one way or another about the death penalty, but that was never the intention; what was intended, was to make a thought-provoking, emotionally involving film, which is exactly what robbins has accomplished with `dead man walking.' regardless of your personal point of view, this film will have an impact, and hopefully will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness. for, as we see through the character of earl delacroix, true forgiveness is not something one merely decides to do, but is a task that can become a lifetime's work. and it's possibly one of the hardest things in life to effectively accomplish; and you come away from this film with an appreciation for individuals like sister prejean, who has selflessly dedicated her life to helping those in need, and to filmmakers like robbins and sarandon for bringing her to life for millions of people who otherwise would never have known her. i rate this one 10/10. 

'it's easy to kill a monster, but it's hard to kill a human being.'set in st. thomas housing project and angola prison in new orleans, "dead man walking" is the true story of helen prejean (susan sarandon), a louisiana nun sister who befriended matthew poncelet (sean penn), a murderer and a rapist bound for a lethal injection machine for killing a teenage couple sister helen agrees to help the convict and to remain with him till the endan act never before attempted by a woman at their first meeting, poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both of the kids and pleads her help for a new trial in order to convince the pardon board hearing to spare his life the film challenges the audience to actually give some thought to the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives voice to angry bereaved parents whose kids were shot, stabbed, raped, and left in the woods to die alone as poncelet's execution looms closer and closer, his character is seen deceptively complex, harboring doubts about the rightness of what they were doing to him in one moment, we hear him sensitive asking for a lie detector test to let his mother know that he is innocent, in another we see him furious playing the victim, blaming the government, drugs, blacks, the kids for being there poncelet never understood that he has robbed the percys and the delacroixs so much, giving them nothing but sorrow they are never going to see their children again, never going to hold them, to love them, to laugh with them in the scenes leading up to his execution, the death-row inmate drops his terrible facade and reveals his identity luckily both sarandon and penn are here exceptionalcarrying out successfully an exquisite, tangible harmony of souls when sarandon was looking at penn, she was projecting compassionate eyes brimming with tears she asks him to visualize her as he dies ''i want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of love''in that moment, we truly believed that she'll be the face of love for him

i regard this loving, and sensitively written story, to be one of the screen's true masterpieces. after having seen this film, originally on the silver screen with my mother, in los angeles, california when it first came out, many years passed before i would have the opportunity to experience it again. the beauty, quiet simplistic elegance and tranquility of the film to me, set it aside from many, many others of its kind. yes, tears still come to my eyes when i see it, and hear the refrain of that once in a lifetime song. perhaps still, today my number one all-time most beloved film. i would hope, this classic love story will be enjoyed, and appreciated, by our future generations.

age cannot tarnish the beauty of this east-west love story for me. ignoring the famous and lovely title song and its lyrics, what we have is a dramatized biography of two remarkable people caught in a moment of counter-currents involving social conformity, bigotry, war, doubt, and the need for immense courage. with hong kong as the backdrop, this movie tells the story of a eurasian doctor and a u.s. journalist who meet and fall in love during the korean war. as mark elliott, william holden is intelligent, breezy and a bit weak; jennifer jones is perhaps well-nigh-perfect as dr. han suyin, by turns doubt-torn and ecstatic, eager and hesitant. others in the large cast include torin thatcher, isobel elsom, murray matheson, virginia gregg, richard loo, soo yong, philip ahn, jorja curtright and donna martell; many of hollywood's best oriental actors played smaller uncredited parts also. the script by john patrick followed han's exquisite novel closely; the direction by henry king was solid as always. the thrust of the storyline is how unwilling han was to fall in love with elliott, with her busy and demanding schedule as a doctor and her doubts about their future; and how unafraid he was, despite the intolerance and interference they faced as their affair became known. the film is unarguably physically busy, interesting and often beautiful also. the hill to which the lovers go to be apart, the lovely bay where they swim are set against an already busy and crowded business city, large social events, and teeming streets, hospital corridors, and traffic-filled arteries. with cinematography by leon shamroy, ben nye's makeup and helen turpin's hairstyles, the great work by set decorators, sound and lighting, art department and all concerned, this has to be one of the most memorable productions set in a major non-u.s. city of all time, and one of the most difficult to capture on film. yet what one remembers most here is the lovers, thankfully not extremely young, facing the odds against them and assessing exactly what they are--then going ahead as if love mattered and those conditions which are set up as barriers to love do not., the climax of the affair is mark's going back to war; thereafter han receives his letters, even after she knows he is has been killed; they seem messages from a better wold. a world where hope is all that matters, courage is the price of admittance to that world, and it is always summer on a high and windy hill set apart and above a zone where beauty and individual desires can be victimized, made subject to ill-fortune or brushed aside by militant forces of evil. truly, love is a many-splendored thing, dr. han says; and this movie stands as one of that doctrine's shining proofs, lucent as a pearl, timeless as a chinese proverb and lovely as polished jade set against a rough background.

"love is a many-splendored thing" is set in hong kong in 1949-50, and tells the story of the relationship between mark elliott, a white american journalist, and han suyin, a half-chinese half-european doctor. this story of a mixed-race love affair was quite a daring theme for the fifties, and, as it often did, hollywood tried to soften the blow by casting a white actress as the supposedly non-caucasian woman who falls in love with a white man, something that would be regarded as politically incorrect today but was quite acceptable then.. (think, for example, of the casting of ava gardner in "show boat" or natalie wood in "west side story") the setting of the story in a british colony was also perhaps a way of exploring racial issues in a way that would cause less controversy in america. suyin loses her job in a hong kong hospital because her british superiors take exception to the fact that she is dating a white man, whom she is unable to marry because his estranged wife will not grant him a divorce. as was sometimes the case, european colonialism was made the whipping-boy for some of america's own failings. imagine the furore that would have been unleashed had a similar film been made about a black or mixed-race woman doctor in a hospital in alabama.besides racial issues, the film also raises questions of international politics, referring to both the communist seizure of power in china and the outbreak of the korean war. han suyin was a real person and a well-known author of the period; in reality she tended to support mao's communist regime, but here she is shown as firmly anti-communist. this is not, however, primarily an "issue" movie about either racialism or politics, but rather a romance, a good example of what would have been known at the time as a "woman's picture". such films, although mostly made by male directors, were mostly aimed at female audiences. they dealt with love and romance- often unhappy romance- from the woman's point of view, and had a strong female character in the leading role. the genre often provided roles for actresses older than the heroines of standard romances. earlier examples were normally in monochrome, but by the fifties they generally, as here, used lush, sumptuous colour.although a chinese or eurasian actress would have been more convincing in the role, jennifer jones, does a very good job as suyin. i found william holden, as mark, rather uncharismatic, but this does not matter much as suyin is very much the dominant figure. she is screen much more than mark, and the film examines her family and professional life much more than it does his. although jennifer was still strikingly beautiful, she was in her mid-thirties, rather older than most romantic heroines of films of this period. holden was about the same age, unusually for the fifties when "boy-meets-girl" often meant "older man meets girl".the film is not particularly profound, but is well-made with some attractive photography, particularly of hong kong itself, reflecting the growing trend in the fifties for shooting on location rather than on studio sets. seldom can hong kong have looked so beautiful; the view from a hill overlooking the city takes on a special meaning, as this is where suyin and mark go for their romantic assignments. the overall mood is one of poignant, doomed romance, a mood heightened by the atmospheric photography and the musical score, including one of the most memorable movie themes ever written. 7/10

this is the kind of film that might give you a nightmare, besides that it's a lot of fun.hardware wars is the only good spoof on star wars, other films like spaceballs have failed. this is the only good spoof film i have ever seen, it doesn't rip-off star wars, it makes fun of it, and that's what spoofs are supposed to be.

this ranks as my favorite movie of all time. it's the best spoof of a science fiction movie ever; the fact that it was a sendup of star wars just made it all the better.i love slapstick. think of this as the marx brothers or the three stooges meet star wars. the writing is hilarious. the effects are a hoot. the free association that goes on guarantees all sorts of things coming out of left field. (i almost wet my pants when the wookie monster accosted the princess.)space balls was a much longer movie, but only had about 15 minutes of good material in it, and i felt sort of ripped off afterwards, like buying a burger that turned out to be mostly filler. hardware wars, despite being only about 15 minutes long, would be worth paying a feature price, imo.

hardware wars is a hilarious, 12 minute short film parody of the original star wars movie which was released just a few months after star wars in 1977. this film uses household appliances as space ships and star wars look-a-like actors to send you rolling around on the floor in uncontrollable fits of laughter. this film has won many awards at film festivals and was the film which inspired mel brooks to write his star wars parody movie called "spaceballs".this is my favorite parody film and i recommend it to anyone who is familiar with star wars and has a good sense of humor.

talk about your classics! ernie fossilus (the foss from here on out) came up with a cute and creative trailer totally spoofing star wars. this gem is so jammed packed with tributes and gags i laugh every time! not only that, when star wars did a re-issue with new special effects, hardware wars did the same! talk about a spoof that just won't die! there's a reason george lucas calls this his favorite parody. he was so impressed, he even hired the foss to work on "return of the jedi" (don't believe me, check his entry in imdb!)this has to be the first, and in my opinion, the best parody ever done. i think the special edition was a bit overdone, but on reflection, i think it's perfect for the modern day re-release of star wars, and goes to prove that sometimes, it's wrong to mess with perfection.yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's well worth your time.you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss $3 goodbye! well, maybe 15 for the dvd, but you'll be real happy you did.

fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid. this short parody is at least as much a part of the star wars saga as phantom menace, and far more entertaining, if you ask me. hardware wars was the first in a long line of sw spoofs which form their own subgenre these days. i hate to describe it too much-it's so short that the premise is just about the whole thing. suffice it to say that many of the most popular and familiar aspects of star wars have fun poked at them. household appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners portray spaceships and robots, the princess anne-droid character wears actual bread rolls on her head instead of the famous coils of braided hair, and fluke starbucker is even more of a dork than his original, if that's possible. ernie fosselius is one crazy son-of-a-buck-he's also the source of porklips now, the apocalypse now spoof.

this early warner brothers talkie "son of the gods" (1930) deals with the racial intolerance that anglo-saxon americans show towards the chinese. chinese-americans are treated like second-class citizens, and whites hold them in nothing but contempt.prolific scenarist bradley king based her screenplay on rex beach's novel about a young, impressionable chinaman, sam lee (richard barthelmess of "only angels have wings"), who experiences racial prejudice first-hand when the girls that his college chums bring along for a party reveal their racist sentiments about sam once they learn about his heritage. sam goes to his father, lee ying (e. alyn warren of "gone with the wind"), who is a wealthy chinaman with offices not only in new york city but also in san francisco. sam feels deeply wounded by the racial slurs and he wants to leave new york and go where he cannot be hurt by americans. his patient father warns him that racism is a fact of everyday life and the only solution to racism is tolerance. sam has yet to learn this lesson. he refuses to take any more money from his father and catches a ship to london, england, peeling potatoes while he is on board.during the trip, he encounters a british playwright, bathurst (claude king of "arrowsmith"), who needs some help writing a play about the chinese. sam and he strike up a friendship and sam furnishes him with cultural information about asians. while they are relaxing in france, sam meets a beautiful young woman, allana wagner (constance bennett of "two-faced woman"), who falls madly in love with him. it seems that allana and her wealthy father are vacationing in the same motel. everybody at the motel knows about sam being a chinaman with the exception of allana. sensitive about his racial heritage, sam holds allana at arm's length until she convinces him that nothing could change her mind about him. they fall madly in love together. allana's father drops the bomb on her when he reveals that sam is a chinaman and all the memories of living in san francisco and dealing with coolies floods allana's mind. she storms into the dining room at the motel and publicly flogs sam with a riding crop in front of a room filled with on-lookers.of course, sam is terribly devastated by this reversal of events. he thought that allana loved him but she didn't. about this time, sam's father lee ying falls tragically ill and ying's secretary of sorts, eileen (mildred van dorn of "iron man") sends sam a telegram about ying's illness. predictably, sam rushes home to new york to be at his father's side. since his public humiliation, sam has vowed to show no kindness to anglo-saxon americans; eileen is an irish-catholic and probably one of his few white friends. lee ying dies and sam assumes control of the business and he practices his anti-white racism, until he learns that he was an anglo-saxon foundling that a san francisco cop on the beat gave to lee ying and his wife to bring up. the cop forgot about it until two white busy-bodied social worker types wanted to take sam away from the yings. sam learns this revelation about the same time that allana comes to new york and falls ill. during her illness, she utters his name repeatedly in her sleep and her devoted father goes to see sam and requests that sam visit her in order to help her recover. unbeknownst to allana, sam does visit her and she improves, but she has no memory of his visit, merely a hazy notion. eventually, allana learns the truth about sam not being a chinaman and they marry and live happily ever after.this socially conscientious warner brothers/first national pictures release contends frankly and unflinchingly with the race issue for the first hour or thereabouts before the revelation that sam has no chinese blood running in his veins catches both him as well as the audience by surprise. the reconciliation between allana and sam stretches credibility, despite their self-professed undying love for each other. however, in the name of a happy ending that would erase all the negativity that came before it, they wind up in each other's arms.the capitulation on the race issue with the revelation that sam isn't chinese damages some of the film's moral power. incredibly, "son of the gods" is a pre-code film that almost seems prudish; for example, sam is an american, not chinese! constance bennett gives a wonderful performance as a petulant beautify and she holds your attention when she whips sam with her riding crop. claude king is good as bathurst, and e. alyn warren is convincing as lee ying. interestingly, warren made a career out of portraying asian characters. richard barthelmess is flawless as sam; he delivers a highly nuanced performance. despite its age, "son of the gods" is a son of a good movie!

i loved this movie - the actors were wonderful and suited their roles. the story itself was great (and true, the setting was perfect and the message about human response to the war, danger and risk was exceptional. the person who wrote the music score also did the music for life is beautiful (another favourite of mine)- his comment was apparently that "...this was not a like an english movie, it was like an italian movie." i think he's right! callum blue is perfect for the part of eric newby. i recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch a story that is true and morally uplifting as well as a beautiful love story.

i have just watched this movie for the first time today, and just loved it...yes it is simple in it's storyline, the sweetest love story,and how any female could not fall in love with callum blue beats me...the scenery in italy was as you would expect, beautiful, the baddies lost in the end,and for the two lovebirds to be reunited at the end, was wonderful, but that scene where a certain italian was sweeping away the confetti after eric and wanda's wedding, perfection!.have a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie, yes, better have a tissue ready and be enthralled, i know i was and hope to get it on dvd real soon. all the actors played their parts perfectly, this was a ww2 film you could believe in as it was so realistic, and without going over the top as in other films...

"in love and war" is a simple feel-good tv-film, and should be viewed as such.(possible spoiler)it is the story of a wwii british soldier, newby, captured with his commando by the italians and imprisoned in a former orphanage. as the italians surrender to the allies, the commando is freed, and attempts to flee. however, the germans arrive and the commando is captured again. only newby, injured, remains at large. the rest of the film recounts how he is hidden and protected by the partisans, and his survival.(end of spoiler)based on a true story, "in love and war" is a refreshingly straightforward film. half comedy, half romance, the story is simple and unambiguous. the 'atmosfera' is warm and sunny, and the various stereotypes (the desperately unorganized or romantic italians, the serious stern-looking germans and the phlegmatic and pragmatic british), although unoriginal, are still humorous. nicola piovani's musical score also adds to the mediterranean flavour.although it is far from being a "tea with mussolini" or a "la vita e bella", "in love and war" is a sweet simple film that will put a smile, and maybe even a little tan, on your face.

this delightful, well written film is based on a new york stage play bearing the same title where sir aubrey (knighted sir charles aubrey smith in 1944) originated the role he plays in the film. here, in 1931, we see him in the early part of his acting renaissance in the very early era of "talkies" and in the character role that he would make his own until his death in 1948 after finishing his last performance in little women which released in 1949.this engaging play is about an elderly british aristocrat who locates his illegitimate children and introduces himself to them, having brought them to his manor in england.marion davies plays his daughter-by-error and it's a tour de force for her. she is all at once endearing, impatient, shallow, enchanting, wise and compassionate while creating an indelible and beguiling character that remains well ensconced in the memory.the 26 year old ray milland appears here in a small but prominent role having already appeared in seven other pictures then only in films for a bit more than two years.the film should be enjoyed as a representative of 1931 hollywood factory production of course and as such is not flawless. however, it's a charming pleasure from first scene to the last.

this is one of the better marion davies talkies - and one of the few to allow her to exhibit her skill as a physical comedian which was so endearing in her silent films. ok, so she does a clunky tap number, but even ruby keeler's dancing from the era does not hold up for younger generations. the problem here is the script. the story falls into unbelievable melodrama in the last reel. it's quite stagey, and is obviously adapted from a play... but not well enough. still, there is some snappy dialogue and slapstick throughout. worth a look.

toplines this ok comedy about an aging father (c. aubrey smith) who decides to gather his grown children from around the world. davies is working as a chorus girl in new york when she gets the news that "daddy" wants her. hmmmm, sounds familiar. davies' considerable talents as a comedienne save this otherwise so-so comedy as she upsets the staid british countryside with her brazen american personality. not as sharp as some other davies comedies, but still worth a look. ray milland plays her long-lost "brother." doris lloyd, elizabeth murray, and halliwell hobbes are all fun, too.

this 1931 comedy gets better with every viewing because of the comedic talents of marion davies and a terrific performance by c. aubrey smith. smith plays a gruff old man who gathers his grown children (from his younger days as a rake) in his declining years. one is american (davies), one english (ray milland who looks about 18), and one italian (nina quartero). there are some surprises as the plot moves along with ralph forbes(was has no appeal at all) falling for davies.davies and smith are just wonderful together and very touching. davies also gets to do a few dances and make a few "big" entrances. and of course davies is just gorgeous.halliwell hobbes, doris lloyd, elizabeth murray, guinn williams, edgar norton, and david torrence co-star. had they given out supporting oscar awards in 1931, smith might well have been nominated. he's just excellent in this this gem.

a grumpy old baronet, happily unmarried, decides to send for his three grown-up illegitimate children and provide them a home at his manor. to his surprise, he finds himself bonding with his uninhibited american daughter. can he find satisfaction in his new role as the bachelor father?this 1931 film, in which he gives a robust performance, marked the arrival at mgm of elderly sir c. aubrey smith, very soon to be one of hollywood's most valuable character actors. with his great hooked nose & beetling brows, sir aubrey looked every inch the part of the duke or general or statesman he would play so often. the acknowledged leader of the british community in hollywood, sir aubrey would also champion the game of criquet in southern california. he would remain very much in demand in studios all over town, right up to his death in 1948.the film's top-billed star is marion davies. best remembered today as the mistress of media mogul william randolph hearst & the chatelaine of hearst castle, the most fabulous residence on the west coast, she was actually a very talented & pretty comedienne. for a few years, hearst attempted to make her the queen of mgm (with her own production company & a huge bungalow-dressing room) but the studio already had several other queens - dressler, garbo, shearer, crawford - and he eventually moved her to warner bros. here miss davies gets a chance to joke & clown and her scenes with sir aubrey are entertaining.her love interest is played by ralph forbes, a handsome young british actor who was just starting to find good films (the trail of 98) as the silent days ended. he had all the qualities for major stardom, but sadly it was not to be. celebrity would come to ray milland, here making one of his first screen appearances. halliwell hobbes & doris lloyd also appear to advantage.

i think this show is awesome!!! i love it, and i love fabian (not in a romantic kind of way) but if i was there i would totally support fabian like haley did, and the other girls, yeah!! i mean if they're rood why don't you want to fight them back!! fabian is the only who have guts to confront people and say what he thinks, not just stay and suck it!!! fabian 100%!!!!! i love haley too, because shes like a normal girl who doesn't want to be with cows and bugs and grass everywhere, and sleep in a warm bed with servants, i mean, if you have the chance and the money why wouldn't you do that!!! and fabian too, fabian brought pizza and just like 2 or 3 people said thanks, i mean he spend money!!

this film for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the bloc-buster violent thriller/mystery/murder movies that abound. it is about real people making the best of their lives. they just happen to be indian and the main characters are in law enforcement. the realistic acting and the great scenery more than make up for the slightly implausible plot. the sound track is by bc smith, who also did the soundtrack for coyote waits, and is great. adam beach plays a tribal policeman who is a little bit accident prone and wes studi is the stoic consummately professional detective. there are many other fine either supporting or cameo roles by graham greene, tantoo cardinal, etc. we have also seen coyote waits, another adaptation of a hillerman novel, and we greatly enjoyed it too.

i hope robert redford continues to make more films like this. hillerman's books are wonderful, and as a young child raised in the southwest his stories hit home! adam beach is a highly under rated and under used actor. wake up hollywood, not everyone thinks that your mel gibson's are cool! many movie goer's today want to see films that make you think. i have seen all of the redford/hillerman series. they are thoughtful, scenic and have great plots. i'm hoping that if enough people write to robert redford he may decide to make a few more! thank you adam beach and tony hillerman for great entertainment! if anyone get's a chance to read tony hillerman's latest book do so! it's great. i also recommend traveling through arizona, new mexico, utah and colorado. stop at every view site and feel the setting of hillerman's books. amazing experience.

joe (wes) & jim (adam) re-acquaint us with the beauty, isolation (psychological as well as physical) and utter terror of "murder most fowl" in the navaho southwest. characterizations, settings and plot continually build .. . even if at times the personal asides leave us wanting "more" .. . with some interesting alternative choices as to "who done it?" flashbacks (e.g. peter fonda . .. good to see him) provide clues but they don't go where you might think. comic asides (e.g. the preacher) are mild and appropriate. where "skinwalkers" and "coyote waits" start to drag .. . "thief" engages the clutch and four-wheels you around the next corner, never quite sure what's there. disagree with joe leaphorn's manic comment to jim chee to "slow down" for the potholes. wrong ... there are no potholes in the plot, just tracks to follow. on to the next episode! great photography (as always), appealing characters and more to explore!

i caught this movie the other night on one of the movie channels and i haven't laughed that hard in a long time. this movie was so funny i went out and bought the very next day. i love this type of comedy. it just seemed so real in the way the actors react to the different situations here. i was rollin. i had never even heard of it and just started watching because of the title "seeing other people". the title caused me to give it a shot and i'm glad i did. i laughed so hard that it hurt. now it's part of my collection. i definitely recommend it to all those that enjoy smart-ass type of comedy. i will be watching this one over and over.

"seeing other people" is a daring romantic comedy about a couple named ed and alice (jay mohr and julianne nicholson) who are engaged and plan to be wed soon. they live together but are both having doubts about their relationship. alice realizes she's had so few sexual relationships in the past, she might just be marrying ed because she's never felt anything else. so they agree to begin fooling around with other people for a while to test their own relationship.the movie balances a prescient question - by focusing too much on the "what if?" aspects of life, can it in fact do the opposite and only make you feel more constrained? when ed begins having sex with a college girl he begins to become addicted and almost forget about alice - when he realizes this, it scares him.i hadn't heard anything about this film in advance but i enjoyed it. it's not extremely well-made and definitely has that purposefully low-budget indie feel to it - but it's a lot better than most romantic comedies out there in the mainstream today.check it out if you get a chance.

i loved this movie. it's a lot of laughs. the acting is good and the writing is really sharp. i'd rather see a hundred movies like this than three lord of the rings repeating and repeating themselves.it's a low budget affair and seems to be shot on dv but looks good and jay mohr and julianne nicholson are great together. why do you have a ten line minimum? i'm not a critic, just a patron.i doubt very much that quentin tarantino could write a picture this funny without filling it with masturbatory gratuitous violence. this movie should be seen on more screens than just one. i laughed from beginning to end. >

i was hugely impressed with this movie, if for nothing else than for the comedy. it might not be the edgiest, wittiest humor at all times, but i found it appropriate to every scene.the flow of the film is certainly a bit jumbled, almost confusing sometimes, but that is how the characters feel. sometimes, we're watching a bit of slapstick and other scenes revolve around a decisive discourse on relationships. this might be a bit frustrating to certain viewers, but it brought me closer to the characters' dilemmas of irregular chaos.the acting is great from everyone. i'm a huge andy richter fan, but i wasn't head over heels for his part like everyone else seems to be. he did very well, but julianne nicholson and lauren graham stole the show for me, both in their respective ways. jay mohr performs as expected, if you've seen him in other films. i've always liked him.overall, the movie is very funny and offers some nice foundations for a few types of relationships. when it comes to relationship questions and problems, some films try to surprise. there's nothing surprising about the conclusions offered here, but it's entertaining to watch them be revealed throughout the film.

i paid attention and enjoyed the very rich expressions capability of the main actress, julianne nicholson. i don't have words to describe how much have i been enchanted. all the actors and actresses played well. especially i noticed the solid good character who has been consistent in foreseeing the future - andy richter who played carl. i think that the idea to show a variety of friends and relatives with different opinions, and the several consulting meetings, is like the real world. jay mohr who played ed, the future husband, also played very real behavior. but, i want to emphasize again the point of very rich expressions repertoire which julianne nicholson is capable of and does so naturally, was overwhelming for me. indeed, the subject which this movie handles seems to me as very important and touches strongly meaningful thoughts of many people. i've seen this movie several times and have not been bored. it raises again and again in my thoughts.

i happened into the den this morning during the scene where ed was engaged in the 3-way and thought my wife was catching up on some early morning porn! much to my surprise it grabbed my attention and i rewound it and we started watching it at 4:30 in the morning! what a very entertaining, rich, funny and well developed plot line and script. we both thoroughly enjoyed it, my wife so much that she shared the experience with her girlfriends at work! going on to recommend it and say what a "kick" she got out of it. i am in my late 40's and she in her early 50's. i think this movie would have appeal to both young and old. an unexpected, very enjoyable surprise. nice work! thanks! two thumbs up!

plot: ed and alice are engaged. they live together and are living the dull life. he has slept around before meeting alice. she has a lot less experience. she decides she needs to sleep around before marrying. he very reluctantly agrees they should both see other people for a while. at first he is not really into it. his wild days are behind him and he is simply content. until one day alice comes back and tells him she made out with some random guy; who of course starts to fall for her. of course this is a bad idea which causes extreme strain on the relationship.good movie. you can see the train wreck coming but still good.worth a rental.

well, the movie did turn out a lot better than i expected. it's not boring and it's not unoriginal. it's really not a silly romantic comedy. the situations the characters put themselves in are very unusual, of course, we're still talking about a movie, but the main characters are indeed plausible. donald is, of course, an exaggeration, but he's just a pawn in the movie, a means to prove something. the ending isn't one of those ridiculously happy, always the same, moral containing pieces of crap you can usually see in movies of the genre. i genuinely liked it and i'm hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies. it's worth a watch. besides, it's better directed than other movies, the story line always stands up, the characters themselves stand up. and they do not experience this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them like a holly god given artifact, yada, yada. at the end of it all you actually see yourself going through it all, the movie makes you feel something, you may even learn a thing or two. it's not the usual hope-producing, tissue moistening idiocy. it's a good movie, not a consolation prize for teary women around the world.

[warning: contains spoilers]written by husband and wife wally wolodarsky (who also directed) and maya forbes, this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memory.jay mohr takes a break from playing smarmy weasels to be the nice guy faced with the fact his fiancée wants to bed other people and he's allowed to do so, too. julianne nicholson, who was so good in "tully," plays spunky and vulnerable with great gusto. too bad she doesn't get the recognition she deserves. good supporting performances help immensely, too. lauren graham, who made last year's "bad santa" memorable, plays the jaded, cynical sister to perfection, bryan cranston (the dad on tv's "malcolm in the middle") gets a few funny, raunchy moments, and andy richter plays a genial guy who falls for a single mother - helen slater in a credible, albeit familiar, role as a mousy woman.what surprised me most about "seeing other people" was how funny it is. there are some genuine laughs here. ed's first attempt at meaningless sex gets some great lines, and there's a ménage a trois that elicits one of the most truthful reactions from a man as the male fantasy gets tweaked.the film's premise isn't unusual, but i liked that it was alice (nicholson) who thought of it, much to the chagrin of ed (mohr). given the genre, you know that no matter how good her intentions are, alice's plan is doomed. we see how the couple works through this strange situation. initially, alice and ed are turned on by the idea, but then the human element sets it.i appreciated forbes and wolodarsky not turning this into a cheap sex romp. yes, there's sex and nudity, but there also are real emotions at work here. the "other people" alice and ed befriend don't want to be the objects of casual sex; they have feelings, too. in one case, too many feelings.granted, some scenes run one joke too many, the richter-slater subplot isn't necessary and alice does something truly uncharacteristic. but that's forgivable because mohr and nicholson generate such tremendous intimacy and honesty - check out the scenes where ed rummages through alice's underwear drawer or his reaction to her announcement about ending the experiment - that no matter how much we might enjoy their little game, we root for this couple to succeed.unfortunately, this film got little, if any, publicity and a limited release. hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often veer on the unfunny, turgid and unsurprising, would do well to learn from this intelligent and funny film.

i just want to say that this movie was excellent .i loved it from the beginning until the end. the acting was great .the director did an amazing job and i would like to see it again.jennifer tilly did a very good performance , the guy that interpreted his father (manny) was another great actor but i can not recall his name .i can't wait for el padrino ii.damian chapa looks so good and i think he is one of the most talented actors out there. there is pleanty of latin actors that do a great job like it is shown in this film!rent it!!! rent it !!! rent it !!!

i am finally seeing the el padrino movie, from what i can see it is an incredible film, and lots of action damian chapa is good director, but i must admit i love his acting the best.also i saw the behind the scenes it was edited by some lady named kinga, she needs to go back to school and learn how to edit.however the film el padrino is a pure 10 action epic. why cant most people who direct put together films that keep you wondering what the plot is? i am so happy to see someone i know to be a real great actor become a great director also.i am one of those people who love to see artists make it.b.s.

this film was one that i have waited to see for some time. i was glad to find it has been everything anticipated. the writing of this film has been so finely crafted and researched far beyond what is seen by the audience. i found it amusing that so many people watching will not read between some very important lines but indeed if not the movie will make sense in a different way and is very brilliant. the film has many stories and characters woven together around this one character kilo , a man whom has rose from the streets amidst many woes and become a very powerful criminal. after spending some time in prison kilo finds a loophole in the justice system and through a disturbing turn of events is released only to find everything is not at all what it seems. kilo finds himself going up against the higher realm of society and political royalty in order to make clear how important a man's word is and stands for. a war begins as the street is in arms against lords of wealth and corrupt power.a build up to explosive and powerful non stop twists and turns. this film will leave you riveted. i found the cast of this movie to be outstanding and is not a movie to be ignored. excellent. go rent it today!!

this movie was simply amazing.the writing was incredible as well as the directing and acting.the story instantly gets you interested.this movie is one of those movies that has your heart pounding the whole time.as always damian chapa is brilliant,his on screen acting is as powerful as any hollywood actor.the cast in this film is perfect.each character made the story more complete.the cinematography was captivating and it uplifted the movie.i was totally stuck to the screen and couldn't stop watching it,there was no getting up for popcorn or anything.this movie is one of the best all year,maybe even the best.definitely rent this movie,i recommend it this movie if u want to see great filmaking or just for pure entertainment.

toy soldiers is an okay action movie but what really stands out is the amount of effort that the scriptwriters and director put into portraying american counter-terrorist forces accurately. just check out the end credits--there are more than a dozen us military officers and officials listed. the movie accurately portrays the fbi as having control of the hostage situation but turning it over the us army's delta force (who are unnamed in the movie as the pentagon was still denying their existence at this time) once the president waived the posse commitatus act of us code. the us army forces at the end are accurately dressed and armed for the time. and even the use of an ah-64 apache for air support--which might seem a bit over the top, is not terribly unrealistic. far more expensive and frankly better movies have portrayed american counter-terrorist forces with far less accuracy.

i recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic phase i'm going through. i was born in 1980, and so film from mid-80s to mid-90s has quite an important place in my growing up.this particular movie was one of my favourites, and so i was thrilled when it became available in the uk. it hasn't become worse with time, it is still a great fun film, with plenty of excitement in its own way. sure, it pales in the shadow of bigger, larger budget films, but don't let that stop you enjoying this.worth a rent, or even a purchase at the discount prices you'll find it for.

this film is a perfect example of great escapism! i loved this film and was sucked in from the very beginning. sure it's just an action flick, but isn't having fun what watching movies is all about? the cast of this film are very strong with likable characters. the friendship between the boys is so realistic and appealing, it's heart warming and hilarious to see a group of teenage boys interact - especially this group of boys!! sean astin makes a great rebel, successfully avoiding being a precocious teenager.if you want fun, watch this film! i thoroughly enjoyed it even though i was watching it on a very dirty and old vhs that was terrible quality (go dvd's!)

oh boy !!! my god !!!! what a movie this one !!! this is probably the best movie by sean austin and louis gosset jr !!! i have seen all the comment for this movie...and most of them loves this movie very much!! but i don't really understand why it only got 6.1 in imdb list??? this one should above 7.5 !!! the plot and the script are completely perfect !! the acting are superbly well acted!!! sean austin...will wheaton...louis gosset jr....have given an incredible and awesome performance in their career!!! this movie contain a lot of action!!!just one thing i gotta say....watch it !!!!!!!!!10 out of 10 stars !!

this movie is my all time favorite movie! it has great acting, cute guys, and a great plot. sean astin is great in this movie! it has funny moments, sad moments, and happy moments. who could ask for anything more? this movie is great!

not only does this movie have a great title but quite simply is the greatest drama i have ever watched. the viewer is irrestiblely drawn into the movie involving 5 young men working together to try and overcome insumaintable odds, sean astin as billy tepper is brilliant along with great supporting roles from t.e.russell, wil wheaton and shawn phelan, the guidance and leadership of gosset's and astins characters makes the movie so much better. as time goes on the movie keeps gathering momentum and its a dissapointment that none of the young actors made a name for themselves in the film industry after this wonderful movie.

this is one of the best movies i've seen. the acting is good, the plot is solid, and the whole movie is very believable, which adds a lot to the movie. i rate this at least a 9.

yes, it's not a great cinematic achievement, but toy soldiers is a fun and entertaining movie. the young cast does a great job with both dramatic and comedic aspects of the story, and i particularly liked shawn phelan as derek/"yogurt". i've seen this one plenty of times over the years, and will probably see it several more. just don't think too much and you'll love it - enjoy!

this is one worth watching, although it is sometimes cheesy, it is great to see a young sean astin, and this ends up being quite an entertaining and humorous action movie. i watched it many times when i was young, and now still enjoy it when i pop the old vhs into the machine (i happen to own a copy). so sit back with this movie, let reality go for a little while, and you will be able to have a few good laughs and an enjoyable hour and a half.

it's really not worthy of a 'best picture' consideration, but as entertainment goes, it does the job! this is one that i've watched, with pulse quickening every time, at least a dozen times.most of these actors were unknown at the time this was done, and we can recognize them from other work. those that don't have current name recognition probably don't want it.this was a fun adventure. sort of like the little rascals if they just had to be serious.

i have loved this movie since i saw it in the theater in 1991. i was 12 then and wil wheaton was my favorite actor and adolescent crush. i am now 23 and i still love this movie. the best part about it is whoever i am dating loves it too because it is a total macho-guy movie! it is wrought with enough action and mayhem to keep men with the shortest attention spans glued to the screen. i only wish that it was available on dvd!

quick summary of the book: boy, billy tepper, about 12 years old is school's main trouble maker, and if he gets kicked out of one more school he'll be sent off to boarding school. his upscale boy's school in switzerland (or somewhere like it) gets taken over by arab terrorists, why i'm not really sure. billy has no friends, and likes to use his laptop to hack into his school's database. he, with the help of two teachers thwarts the terrorists' plans, and save the entire school. the book wasn't bad, but was sooooooo cliché.now about the movie; they switched arab terrorists to cuban terrorists, and make billy about 17 and the leader of his group of friends. they like to get into trouble, but normal teenage stuff. this movie was believable. maybe not realistic, but the characters are real. you can watch billy, joey, and the rest of the guys and see real kids acting out the way they did (or at least wanting to).great action scenes. not everything goes as planned for either side. overthrowing the terrorists was messy, and good guys did get hurt. i won't say who, but it is heart wrenching (i know, i use that word a lot). sean astin is excellent. as a teenager he usually played the dopey best friend. this movie proved once again that he could play the leading man, kid, whatever. the only performance that may have upstaged his was wil wheaton's, who played the only son of a new jersey mafia man. he hated his father, and everything he stood for. (a far cry from wesley crusher) usually this genre of film is one i watch for the soul purpose of making fun; but not toy soldiers. the story line flows, the dialogue is usually believable. i can't think of a single moment where i found myself shouting at the tv "oh that would so not happen" great movie that should be in everyone's collection.

i'm seldom partial to movies about smart-assed teenagers who have problems with authority, but "toy soldiers" has grown on me with repeated viewings. this is as much a movie about billy tepper growing up and becoming an adult as anything else, and i give credit to sean astin and writer/director daniel petrie jr. that they don't make a big deal of that, but let it just unfold and sneak up on you. the camaraderie of tepper's friends, their grief over joey's death, and their joy at their survival, all are genuinely moving. and, i have to admit, i take a certain patriotic (and perhaps slightly reptilian) glee when the u.s. army guys finally move in and righteously kick some narco-terrorist butt. ooh-rah, general kramer! and the heroic robert folk score is the cherry on top. i'm sure i could find a hundred reasons not to like "toy soldiers," but as long as we don't take it too seriously, i don't see the need. this is one of the most entertaining "bad" movies in my pantheon.

this came as a huge surprise for me. i had never heard of this movie when i first saw it, and the title really pointed towards something else than a great terrorist/hostage situation at a high school. toy soldiers has the best from it's time period of the early 90's, where action movies were light-hearted and very enjoyable. the action is good, the plot is interesting and way over the top, the bad guy is a one-dimensional hateful douchebag (which is great), louis gossett jr. is in it, it's simply a feel-good movie which i thoroughly enjoyed.you can't go wrong with this one if you like action. i give it a solid rating of 8/10.

i haven't seen this in years but when i was about 6 i first saw this on vhs and i must have watched it at least 10 times. now like i said its been awhile so i might screw up the plot but i remember some columbian terrorists taking a prep school hostage with demands for the head terrorist(the "wishmaster")father to be released from prison. now i could just check the plot here on imdb but i'm pretty sure thats right. any way, a group of boys at the school decide that they're not gonna just sit around and wait to die so they decide to fight back. this film has always been stuck in my mind. there are so many images that i haven't forgotten like joey's(i think?)death scene or billy spitting in the terrorists sandwiches or the one kids(no idea of his name)fake asthma attack. just a great film. it may be films like this that have given me my tolerance for film violence because if i remember right this movie is pretty graphic. guys getting mowed down by helicopter machine guns, a special forces guys hand getting blown off by a grenade(not sure about that but i seem to remember something like that towards the end)and the most bloody being the lead terrorist getting capped in the head in gory detail. great action, great humor, good acting, wonderful film experience. i've got to watch this again after all these years!

these kinda movies just don't get the credit they deserve. this is my 2nd all time favorite movie, (stand by me being 1st.) the reason i watched this movie was because wil wheaton was in it and he is my most favorite person in the whole world and i think he done an amazing job in this movie and so did sean astin. i just watched it last night actually and it just amazed me. everything in the movie is very exceptional. the script, the acting, the screenplay. i was on the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and if my mom wasn't in the room i would have absolutely balled whenever joey trotta (wil wheaton) died. i did not see that coming!! at all!! i was real surprised when i heard that it wasn't real popular back in the 90's. i was born a few years after it came out so, of course, i didn't go see it in the theaters, but im sure i would have if i would have been alive. if any of my friends watched this, they would be like, "uhh okay?" but thats just cause their not cool enough to appreciate work like this. if you haven't seen this movie, or are wanting to watch something that is the bomb, this is the movie for you to watch.

picture this. someone makes a film about the columbine or virginia tech massacre only the film is directed by the guy who did home alone (i know this isn't but bare with me) and stars sean astin off of goonies!! picture the terrorists being overpowered by buckets of water on top of ajar doors and marbles and this is why you need to see the film. unfortunately it doesn't go all the way by actually having the skateboard lying on the floor for the evil mexicans to trip on but its halfway there you have to give it above 7 for that but not a 9 because it didn't go crazy enough. pity, its seemed like it would be comical cheesiness, well worth a cult status

didn't sound like it was from a fantasy film. the film is dark, with dark overtones. the soundtrack way too uplifting to the point it intruded on the visuals. i'm sure they were aiming for something militant, but it just didn't work. the scene when astin is attempting to escape is a perfect example. why does it sound like the goonies? there is no comedy, there is no brightness to this!! the idea of the movie is great, and the acting is very good as well. i enjoyed everyone's performances. it's available on netflix's online viewing. definitely worth a viewing, but write your own soundtrack!!

sean astin pulls off another amazing performance in "toy soldiers". he plays the highly intelligent prankster, billy tepper along with wil wheaton and keith coogan who play his best friends, joey trotta and jonathan "snuffy" bradberry. during a regular day at saint anselm's school for boys, a group of dangerous terrorists take all the boys and teachers as hostages and threatens to blow up the school if the leader, luis cali (andrew divoff's), father isn't released from the american prison, but these aren't just ordinary boys that are taken hostage, most of these kids are the sons of very powerful people in america and half of them were expelled from other schools before they came to saint anselm's. they're mouths and actions just may get them killed. when the government is desperately trying to figure out a way to help, billy, joey, snuffy and some more boys decide to take matters into their own hands.

this is really good. original ideas in the film and a great terrorist action film. only second to die hard and die hard with a vengeance, this film has suspense and a good plot. i would recommend it to anyone with a taste in films like mine; action, terrorism and gangster/mafia.

i first seen this movie like a year and a half ago and i loved it, i decided to get the dvd last year for my birthday.. it has the right amount of suspense, action and drama.. this movie is about prep school called the regis school and its packed with rebellious kids, in which one kid william tepper (sean astin) has a hard time adjusting due to prior rejections from other schools cause they couldn't control his rebellious act and now at the regis school committing more acts of a rebellion there school gets taken over by terrorists on a random day and which the real reason is because the leader luis cali's (andrew divoff) father has been sent to prison,and the leader will do anything including killing the students, setting bombs and so forth in order to get his father back.along side william tepper, is his rebellious friends at the regis school, one in particular is joey trotta (wil wheaton) in which this guy holds a troubled past of living in a mafia family and being sent to the regis school because of hating his father for who he is and which now he must deal with these terrorists taking over the school, so william, joey and there friends must band together to stop these terrorists from violent acts and hazardous tactics.this movie was really awesome and i believe people should notice it more because when people think of a good hostage movie they would say "die hard" and even though i would have to agree with them, they need to recognize that toy soldiers was a good thriller, it sure had my heart beating because the students are my age and i would be scared to confront terrorists like these if they took over our school ... but overall this movie is really worth a good 112 minutes of your time and if i had a decision to rent or buy it... i would buy it! i recommend it with a lot of hype! 8/10

this is one of the best "bloke" movies from the early 90's and whilst slightly dated, its one of those movies that would never get made today, which makes it very special! in fact, a very similar movie was made in the 90's called "masterminds" and it was a pg variation on the same theme, but it was nowhere near as fun or realistic for that matter.so what's so special about this film? it's the comradre between the main characters and the against all odds theme of the film. sean astin is very likable and has starred in some of the most memorable films of the 80/90's, particularly "the goonies". he also went onto greater things with "rudy" and "the lord of the rings" trilogy, but "encino man" is a good trip down memory lane. will wheaton from "stand by me" lends nice support to the film and andrew divoff is a terrific villain. louis gossett jr sleepwalks in his role, but he does add some brevity to the film, particularly his relationship with astin's rebellious nature.so how's the action? by today's standards, it's rather tedious and cheap looking, almost like a tv movie, but the production values are good and the violence is actually quite nasty for a film involving school students. however, the director makes up for the limited budget with some nicely suspenseful moments and well placed humor.so park your brain at the door and enjoy this fondly remembered action flick, but don't expect oscar material!

colombian terrorists hold hostage a military school in the u.s. until their demands are met. the students decide to fight back. will they be able to do it?silly premise but the film actually works. the group of kids who fight were all up and coming when this film came out in 1991: sean astin (looking very cute); wil wheaton (looking miserable); keith coogan; george perez (the token latino who is very handsome, very muscular and is mostly shown in nothing but tight underwear); t.e. russell (the token black guy) and shawn phelan. none of them are very good actors (except astin), but who cares? this is a mindless action film. the only other good performances are from denholm elliott (having a ball as the headmaster) and louis gossett jr. as the dean.other than that--there's lots of action, suspense, explosions and little brains. in other words---fun! only complaint (and this is minor)--it's a bit too long (there are three endings) and there is lots of casual, bloody violence (the r rating was well-earned). still, i enjoyed it a lot.

i think that toy soldiers is an excellent movie. it's one of the only movies that, aside from some well known actors, has an unknown cast that can actually act. in my opinion, the plot is captivating. it keeps your attention without having an outrageous story that couldn't possibly happen in real life. i think that everyone would enjoy this movie. sean astin always seems to pick the perfect movies to be in that showcase his talent. he's very underrated and doesn't get the recognition that he deserves. other movies that he has been in other actors have been in the spotlight but this movie and rudy really showcase him because he is the main character in both. i hope that he someday gets the accolades he deserves for his acting. if you want to see a great movie you need to check this one out and if you are a sean astin fan you will definitely like this movie.

this is one of those movies that are very underrated. again i am voting for an underrated movie. this movie has a good story line, maybe a bit farfetched but it could happen. sean astin(one of my favorite actors) again shows us a good performance. the guy does a great job in acting but never gets recognized for his roles. he has done well since the goonies. not only him but louis gosset jr. does a swell job. i thought maybe this movie would have made more money in theaters but who cares about money anyways. all around this is a good movie that will have you at the edge of your seat at times and the plot will keep the movie moving itself. i enjoyed this movie and hopefully the rest of you will as well.

- the best bit : when the dull mobster (nicholas turturro) calls out to the runaway (matthew modine) "shane !.. come back shane !" and when the older wise guy asks him "what are you doing ?!" he replays simply "enjoying my time !" actually like me at the moment ! - the most creepy part : i've been wondering all the time of watching : where did i see that girl before ? where ? where ? till i found out while the closing credits.. ohh my god ! she's (elizabeth berkley) .. from the showgirls' fiasco ! but i just couldn't recognize her with her clothes on ! to tell you the truth i felt a brief tremor. she's really cute and nice but maybe hollywood had no mercy at all ! - the most sexy bit : when (berkley) says "do you mean the stuff which gives you a boner ?!". - the most dull thing : the retarded assistant after a day and a night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy at the end !!??, moreover the mexican smuggler took 3 bullets (at the same car !) and he's not dead either !!?? - the most ugly thing : all of those murdered people, as well as the numerous (f) ward to a boring extent ! - the most beautiful thing : the crazy clever script with all the funny characters and the tumultuous situations, the acting looked sweet also especially from (paul rodriguez) who stole the show for (as he had the best dialogue also !). - the most disappointing thing : although the direction didn't mess about the story's wittiness at all but in the same time it didn't give it a unique touch, a matchless signature, some kind of insane hilarity like the one in the story itself. however maybe the low production wronged it well ! and of course the easy tasteless music which could be like that because of cheap production too ! - the most confusing part : (matthew modine) is a talented guy but what did he do exactly to be out of hollywood's "a" list of stars ?! what could possibly be the thing he made (or didn't make !) to end up in light independent jest like (the shipment) ?!! - the most absent scene : where did (jose) the mexican smuggler go at last ?! i thought that we'll see him again at the end, smuggling once more as the surviving little criminal who, in a brief gimmick like this, could materialize the continuous disorder of such a world. - the most question i had after the end : when we'll see (the shipment - 2) ? as i'm so eager to see that fine small comic hurly-burly atmosphere again ! these were my own answers. if you interested in giving answers of your own for this questionnaire, please e-mail me.

a stolen shipment of vigoroso, the mexican viagra; a beautiful girl who is trying to rebuild her life and to leave her husband, a boss of the italian mafia; a young sheriff who falls in love with his old sweetheart. this is the plot of "the shipment", a country comedy located in small town of paradise, arizona. despite its simply and classic story, the movie (directed by alex wright) has its fun moments: when elizabeth berkley (as candy porter), looking at a vigoroso green pill, says: "what"s this? a mint candy?". or when the girl enters the sheriff"s house and finds him completely naked. or when the vigoroso shipment ends up in that lake, at the final sequence... the cast offers some nice performances: by matthew modine as the sheriff of paradise valley, who still loves his old girlfriend; and by elizabeth berkley, who"s character still loves her old boyfriend... the supporting cast, including nicholas turturro, paul rodriguez (as the mexican josè) and g michael gray (what kind of teeth...), makes a pleasant work, too. not an oscar material, but not so bad. a fun comedy without pretence.

i wonder if i could take sitting through a whole musical comedy from russia or east germany or other countries that for decades put out almost always propagandistic film, anti-fascist films, anti-war films (as this documentary points out) that just reflected the dark, grueling times under stalin and life behind the iron curtain. it's fascinating then to see the other side of the coin, the sorts of clowns and rebels with music at their side to try and please the masses more often than not stuck in the socialist walk of life. one film actually seemed rather impressive, called jolly fellows by the pioneer of the very small group of musical filmmakers, grigori aleksandrov. from the clip(s) i saw of that film, i'd wager that it was one of the only works to actually step out of itself and go into just wild, manic, make-you-laugh kind of mode. but as this film shows, if you were a filmmaker looking to entertain, it better be with a 'message'.through interviews, some occasional quasi-dramatizations (of russia/germany/etc's sort of motion picture association) at the censorship table, and clips, one gets the full picture of what it was like- both behind the scenes and on the screen- to just make sheer entertainment for the masses. some of the films (well, most of them, as apparently only 14 screened over 40 years in the countries mentioned) made a good chunk of change, but for what purpose really? one also gets drawn into the culture of it all, how it differs greatly from the american way of 'if it works, make em while they're hot' attitude. but at the same time, perhaps out of this repression, some interesting, funny, and (from what i saw) up-beat films were made. they might've been fairly typical of what was asked to be shown to the masses, under stalin's fond but demanding terms, like life with tractors. it gets to be even juicier a story though as we get shown what it was like in the 60's, the last wave of musical comedies, as rock and roll and pop tunes finally hit their airwaves.in short, some good stuff...but only if interested, really. i was shown the film in a class on documentary films, and half the class fell asleep. so be warned on the one hand, though on the other if looking for it, it can make for a really rewarding trip into european film history.

"east side story" is a documentary of musical comedy in stalinist russia and later in the eastern european satellite comedies, with many clips from the films and commentary from the survivors. although some of the stalinist films look laughingly bad (the bright road (?) being a notable exception), the films from the sixties actually look pretty good. "my wife wants to sing," "the white mouse," and "midnight revue" look particularly entertaining. the producers had to contend with the censors, who had the power to decide what was politically correct, which led to some confusion, humorous in retrospect, since the people whom the censors were trying to appease were the very people who supported making the films to begin with! since musical comedies were fairly rare behind the iron curtain--there were only something like forty made in forty years--they had a disproportionate effect upon their audiences, who made major hits of some of the films.i notice that the sound for the sixties films was much better. the directors often had to make do with antiquated equipment, and stringent power regulations--they had to film in seven minute takes or less--and dangerous officicrats.i also notice that "west side story" seems to have had a strong influence on "hot summer." the later films may not measure up to "singin' in the rain," but they certainly look like they beat the hell out of "bye bye birdy"

when i went to see this documentary on communist bloc musicals, i was expecting something totally demented, along the lines of a communist "cop rock." some scenes did deliver, including a rousing clip from a soviet film called "tractor drivers."you'd think that moviemakers given the task of making ideologically correct musicals that sing, dance and espouse the party line face insurmountable odds. and yet, one of the surprises of "east side story" is that some of the films presented actually looked promising. one was a mid-1950s east german effort called "my wife wants to sing," in which, as the title implies, an unhappy hausfrau seeks to launch a singing career over the objections of her traditionally-minded husband.another genuinely interesting-looking movie, also from east germany, was called "midnight revue." in this film-within-a-film, the producers spoof their own creative plight with the story of a group of filmmakers under party orders to make a musical. (the on-screen filmmakers themselves get to do a musical number about avoiding "too hot" subjects very reminiscent in tone of the 1957 movie "silk stockings.")the documentary is marred by somewhat insipid narration, but it's still a lot of fun to watch. (look for the closing dedication to the person who made it all possible.)

scary in places though the effects did leave something to be desired unless you have bad eyesight or are afraid of the dark. however most of the acting was convincing and most of the effects were well done. i thought the creature looked a bit too much like a man in a gorilla suit for my liking. it reminded me of the original pink panther film.

i can't believe people are giving bad reviews about this movie! i wonder why......maybe because of the book..... i have to admit, it really doesn't follow the book... for sure...the book by dean koontz is much better... but the movie is also good as well!!! it has the suspense...the acting are good... especially michael ironside, whom have given a superb acting in this movie!!!come one guyz...give this movie a chance...there are still lot more worse movie than this....like sum of all fears...phantoms...the da vinci code...this are some of the worse movie i have seen...really boring if compared to watchers which really have great elements in the movie...this movie contains great suspense and non stop action!!! i'm looking for this movie...but it is really hard to be found on dvd...by da way...i really recommended this movie to everybody... watch it!!!! you will never regret !!!10/10*

bears about as much resemblance to dean koontz's novel as jessica simpson does to a rocket scientist. if you've read the book, i suggest you put it as far out of your mind as possible before watching the movie.watchers is your typical "boy meets dog, dog turns out to be super-intelligent government lab experiment, dog and boy are pursued by super-intelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by same lab, and, oh yeah, did i mention the shady government agents pursuing the monster pursuing the dog?" movie.corey haim is the boy, barbara williams is his mother, michael ironside is one of the evil government guys, and sandy the dog is, well, the dog (named furface here; einstein in the book).the monster effects are ridiculously cheesy, much of the dialogue is laughable, the script rarely makes sense or is believable - a good example is haim's character's unquestioning acceptance of the dog's intelligence, as if every fido off the street can type messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no! hmm, it's gotta be the puppy chow, right? haim's performance is enthusiastic but shaky, as he carries off the stupid dialogue with the least amount of skill. ironside has been the highlight of many a bad movie, and this is no exception. he easily gives the best performance of the movie, although i'm compelled to add that the dog (who's a pretty darn good actor himself!) comes in a close second.all in all, an atrociously dumb movie, and yet . . . and yet i watched it three times within a week. and yet i can't help liking it. hey, what can i say, i have a taste for junk - and michael ironside (not that i've ever actually tasted michael ironside- i'm sure there are laws against that). but any movie that can make me laugh that hard (yes, even unintentionally) can't be all bad. chalk it up to a guilty pleasure, a "yes i know it's insultingly stupid but i like it anyway" movie.it's tough for me to rate this. on a normal scale i'm forced to give it a d-, but on my own personal cheese scale, it gets bumped up to an a-.yeah, i know. i'm weird like that.

i love dogs, and the most interesting character in this movie is a golden retriever. he is smarter, better looking and more interesting than any of the human characters. like many other contributors i have not read the book but i doubt that having done so would change my opinion of the movie. it is predictable from the first five minutes on. no surprises. mad scientists create a monster that gets loose and a teen age boy and his wonder dog collaborate to destroy it. all in all the movie is a dog. but as i said, i love dogs and will therefore give this movie a 7/10 rating. watch it if it comes on tv, rent it if you are bored and nothing else catches your eye, but don't buy it unless it is on special.

watchers is a fun movie if it's not taken too seriously, the novel written by dean r. koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in it's own way. the film has a lot of changes for the novel watchers, the one difference is the main character travis. in the book he was an adult and an retired delta force soldier while in the film he's a teenager. watchers has it's good points, the film does have some gory scenes in parts. i'm a fan of micheal ironside and it was cool to see him in this film, he always does a great performance in all his films. the oxcom costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film. the dog einstien was impressive since it was well trained.the film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab, a dog and a monster. both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the creature would attack and eliminate them. the dog finds a teenager named travis who takes him home and discovers that he's intelligent and so he names the dog einstein, meanwhile the oxcom is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes, two government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand. soon travis learns that his not safe as the oxcom is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in it's way, so travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend who's being held at the hospital by the two agents. they then hideout in the woods while the government agents and the oxcom are not far behind.watchers is not a great adaptation of dean r. koontz novel but it is a entraining 80's horror flick, some fans of the book may not want to watch this since it's not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy 80's horror movies may want to check this out.

i would consider myself a fan of dean koontz; having read a number of his novels and liked them all, but unfortunately i never got around to reading watchers so i'm left with no choice but to rate this film on it's own merits rather than comparing it to the book that i haven't read. i went into this expecting something awful, and while i didn't exactly get a brilliant horror film; i am lead to believe that it's fans of the book that are rating it down because as a film in it's own right, watchers is an entertaining and somewhat original little horror movie. the plot obviously takes some influence from predator and begins with an explosion at a research lab. it's not long before a rancher is killed by some strange beast and the boyfriend of the dead man's daughter has picked up an ultra-intelligent runaway dog. a secret government agency is soon on the case, as the murders continue. the boy continues to be fascinated by the dog's intelligence, but it somehow ties in with the murders and the agency is soon on his tail too.the script for this film was originally written by paul haggis, who later disowned it. i don't know why  the writing here is nowhere near as ridiculous as his 2004 hit crash! anyway, the main reason this film works is undoubtedly the dog, who aside from being rather cute, is also the best actor in the film. corey haim, hot off the success of the lost boys is the human lead and actually has a rather good chemistry with the dog, although it is a little bit ridiculous seeing him talk to it most of the way through the film. the plot is rather convoluted and as such the film is more than a little bit messy; but the ridiculousness of it all pulls it through during the more awkward moments. michael ironside also appears in the film and does well as the 'bad cop' side of the government agents. the monster is, of course, one of the most interesting things about the film and the way it goes around killing people is always entertaining and gory; although unfortunately we don't get to see a lot of it and when we finally do it's rather disappointing - obviously the filmmakers had seen bigfoot and the hendersons! still, this is the sort of film that can be easily enjoyed despite the numerous problems and i'd recommend to any undiscerning viewer of eighties horror.

when a saboteur blows up a controversial government research lab, two experimental animals are loosed in a small community in washington state. one is a dog with unusual intelligence. the other is an "outside experimental combat mammal", or "oxcom". because of reasons divulged further into the film, the oxcom hates the dog, and so is trying to kill it. watchers concerns the accidental involvement of travis cornell (corey haim), his mom nora (barbara williams) and his girlfriend tracey (lala sloatman) with the dog and oxcom, as two national security organization agents, lem johnson (michael ironside) and cliff (blu mankuma), track them down.many comments are made about watchers being very different than the dean koontz book that serves as the launching pad for the film. this is true. but it should not affect your rating. if you want the book, read the book. judge the film on its own merits, not how closely it matches the book. bill freed and damian lee, who wrote the screenplay, are just as much artists as koontz is (that's not a quality comparison, just a statement that they're all artists). so is director jon hess. their job as filmmakers isn't to slavishly follow the book as if it were a script. they're adapting the book, as artists, to make a unique artwork. it's based on the book. not identical to it. you have to loosen your preconceptions/expectations when you watch the film, because you're going to be experiencing an artwork that you are not already familiar with, even if you've read koontz' novel.so, is watchers a good film? it's pretty good, not excellent. good enough to earn a "b", or an 8. hess begins things on the right foot with one of the most beautifully filmed explosions i've seen in awhile. unfortunately, he trips a bit immediately afterward as we listen to some very thick, jargonistic exposition. after that scene watchers threatens to become a clichéd 1980s film as we first meet travis and tracey.veering towards cliché is a tendency continually threatened. but it is only a skew. more often than not, hess is able to transcend well-trodden territory with a number of interesting twists: both travis and tracey are from single parent homes, with their genders flipped. both have unique, mature relationships with their parents. although this is a horror film, a major focus is a cute, intelligent canine, and it often feels as much like an adventure film as it does horror, a thriller, or sci-fi, which are all genres it touches upon. hess introduces a large cast of characters, some not entering until late in the game, yet the film is never confusing and no characters feel as if they are left in the dust--all of the threads are nicely tied up in the end. the structure is also complex in that there are two major villains, the second becoming less obviously ill-intentioned as the film progresses, until a twist accompanied by brutal violence makes one antagonist clearer. soon after, hess gives us a nice moment of doubt with the other antagonist.the biggest flaw in my eyes is a dreaded, common one with horror films since at least the 1980s--the "attack" scenes are shot too darkly, too close, too out of focus, and they're edited too choppily. it makes it extremely difficult to tell what's going on, which saps most of the tension from scenes that should be a highlight. surely, part of hess' motivation for the style, and this is the typical justification for this problem, was worry that the creature would come across as humorous and/or fake rather than frightening and suspenseful. in my view, presenting the audience with a dizzying blur isn't a satisfactory solution. we only get to see the creature costume/makeup clearly towards the end of the film. it was well done enough that better shot and edited attack scenes would have brought the film up to at least a 9.regardless of the degree of correspondence between the novel and the film, watchers presents a gripping story using smart, alluring characters. it is frequently a nail-biter and the horror scenes are more feral than you might expect, if not exactly gory (although there is a fair amount of blood in a couple scenes). watchers tends to be underrated because of misconceptions about the role of film when it comes to adapting literature--don't pass it up or summarily dismiss it based on a misconception.

if you want to have a great time then this is the movie to watch.take the premise - there is this college which admits people with minimum qualifications of ba, b.com, m.com, ma, mba, mca, b.e., m.tech and bca. so you have to take into account the time consumed and thus it is obvious that all students are 40+ also the school admits students of a 'heavier' dispensation and has a course of p.hd in weight loss and the only student who failed this course is manisha koirala. only she was a snake in the past life. still not convinced? ok read on.here's a scene. akshay kumar, a college student, is chased by arman and he takes out a bazooka and shoots him! then throws grenades. then one of the grenades hits akshay. but doesn't die and continues to fight, arman, the snake, plunges a half foot dagger into akshay and stomps on it but akshay is still there. then akshay gets on a jet ski and follows arman. they fight and arman chokes akshay underwater and finally akshay is dead. so we think, as soon as arman is out of the picture akshay swims away to raj babbar, principal of this college + boxing refree + parapsychology ka professor + mumbling priest.but no one, i repeat no one takes the cake but a certain mr. nigam. you gotto watch to learn more. :-)

this movie is without a doubt the best i have seen in my entire life. the stellar star cast is only an added bonus over the amazing special effects, and profound story and sublime choreography. the movie is about an ancient love affair that folds down into the modern world. two lovers in heaven incur the wrath of a great sage and are cursed. subsequently the woman is born again on earth. while she is in college, she is raped and commits suicide. the rest of the movie basically focuses on the hunting down of the people who were associated with the rape, by her lover who possesses superhuman strength and the mastery of several languages. sonu nigam delivers a very mature and deep performance in this film, and all the other actors do almost as well. te action scenes with akshay kumar are mind-blowing, and must not be missed. you simply have to watch this movie!!!

all the people who voted a meager 1 on this movie, this is all i have to say: you guys have not matured enough to enjoy cinema of this kind. it takes a certain amount of dedication to reach that level of appreciation. and that is the segment of people this movie was aimed at. not you average movie-goers by any chance! . back to the movie. this one was a gem all right and definitely an inclusion in the bollywood hall of fame. i'd give it an all time rank of no # 2, surpassed only by kanti shah's legendary gunda. this movie had an impeccable story line and created a beautiful blend between a fantasy and sci-fi. pan's labyrinth would have in fact been ashamed of the balance created between the parallel stories. and now do i really need to mention the stellar cast and even stellar-er (that is a word from now) performances from them (a special mention goes to mr. nigam for the best debut ever in any movie on this earth). every actor in this movie had been very carefully chosen and the role were tailor made for them (and for their age too, i must add). manisha koirala still looks like she's 18 and wow man, with that figure i would have raped her too. are you wondering where did this rape thing come in suddenly? yes, a rape is what the premises of this movie is based on. and that is so not like your average bollywood type movies. if you are an atheist or an agnostic by any chance, this movie is again a must for you. because this movie can heal your faith. i don't think it'd even be going too far saying that this movie can cure cancer. only the people who need it the most fail to appreciate its power, charm and undying beauty. tchch, so unfortunate!only flaw in this movie: in your dreams, baby! this was flawless.only minor complain: the director failed to star mithun da as well. i won't ruin it for you any further. just go and watch it. today. and if you like it, here are some more recommendation from me. gunda, desh drohi, aparichit, the old ramsay brothers horror movies, loha, indra the tiger and sivaji.

this movie deserves the 10 i'm giving it.but it's not the 10 that you'd give to movies like 'the godfather' or 'goodfellas' or 'psycho'. this is the kind of 10 you give to a movie which just makes you laugh,over and over again! it's the most horribly written and directed movie, yet it doesn't fail to entertain. it has the most amateur effects, yet you enjoy every moment! i saw this movie today on tv, and i didn't want to move away! read the following dialogue to know why!(whole college is standing around manisha,who has just undergone a rape attempt and the guys who attempted the rape are asking for forgiveness)bad guy 1: please forgive us! bad guy 2: yes,we won't do it again. (no response from manisha) akshay: come on,forgive them! manisha: i don't know... akshay: you are a beautiful woman, and even dead men can get aroused by you! and these are living young males! don't blame them!pancholi: yeah manisha.. manisha(to suniel): what if they tried to rape your girlfriend??? suniel: i'd break their hands,legs and kill them.but anyways,just forgive them..akshay: yeah if you don't forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beauty!now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue! this movie never fails to entertain, mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations! the bad guy (munish) can do basically anything..he can blow a sandstorm from his mouth, or he can get a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again. every actor takes turns to speak..one line from akshay,then from suniel, then from arshad, then aftab, then nigam. it's the main rule followed by the director, so that equal screen time is given to each guy. and then there's the all powerful pendant, which can cause even a speeding car to go right through you without you being harmed! all these things make it an enjoyable movie, and i can watch it over and over again. i think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one..the only problem is that it wasn't trying to be funny.

i caught "on the run" at the screening room in new york and was immediately seduced by its true independent spirit. starring michael imperioli and john ventimiglia from the sopranos cast, "on the run" sets us up in a 24-hour wild ride in the city that never sleeps, as we follow the meanderings of an introspective sales agent who is suddenly dragged by his long-gone school companion, just out of jail. in fact he has escaped from it and is "on the run" looking for some action and a glimpse of life amidst the great metropolis. powered by great performances, this movie gives us back the old feeling of 70's pics, with both characters rediscovering themselves as they blaze across town bumping into wild events and locals. an elegy to a certain side of new york that seems to be disappearing, "on the run" displays great sensitivity and humour. i predict it to be a cult classic that urges to be discovered: future viewers should definitely surrender to this nocturnal trip.

don't let the rating of 5.9 (as of this writing on 12-8-02) fool you, this is one excellent film.i cannot fathom how this got such a rating considering being so solid at all levels. the direction, acting, cinematography--all good. the story is interesting and original and my only inkling as far as understanding why the rating is such, sits in the fact that it is probably the type of movie that people rating might not normally see.i equate it to playing modern rock for an 80 year old. you might be young, brought up on it and love it, but he or she has not been and as a product of a different time and taste--doesn't care for it.if you like films and can handle movies based more on real people versus those comprised of mindless action, enormous flashy budgets and mediocre talent, give this one a try next time you see it on...

just watched this movie over the weekend, and i must say i thoroughly enjoyed it. the 2 italo american actors are excellent as usual (michael imperioli and john ventimiglia). it is obvious that the director was influenced by 2 great films of the past directed by italians. primarily he was influenced by dino risi and his film il sorpasso. it is the story of 2 young men who meet by chance and become friends. one is extroverted and the other is introverted. they enjoy the whole day together and by the end of the day, the shy one learns that there is more to life than his usual routine monotony. the same thing happens to albert de santi. unfortunately, il sorpasso has a very similar ending and this apparently influenced the director of on the run because he uses the same technique but with a twist. i had expected something but was surprised to see that it turned out to be the opposite. if you watch both movies you will understand. the other film that influenced the director is after hours directed by the great italian american scorsese. i highly recommend all 3 movies !!

i went to see this film because joaquim de almeida was in it. joaquim had a fairly small part, so it was good that i liked the film on it's own. in fact, i liked it a lot!the film centers around two characters, albert and louie. albert is a shy, retiring sort, and louie... well louie is not. the story revolves around louie's request to albert to let him come over to albert's place for just a little while. louie has just gotten out of prison.albert and louie have known each other since childhood, and of course whenver they do something together there is trouble and it's albert who always takes the fall.the action of the film is based on the adventures that ensue from louie's visit. on the run is a chronicle of mad-cap, zany, situations. however, bruno de almeida and scriptwriter, joseph minion (after hours), don't always take you where you expect to go. there are twists and turns that add depth to this film. of course there is plenty of outright comedy, but there is much subtle humor here as well.there are some downright good performances here as well. albert is played delightfully by michael imperioli. he's getting fairly well-knownthese days from the hbo series, the sopranos.louie is played by john ventimiglia, who imbues his character with a lovable, child-like quality. (no matter what he does, you just gotta love louie!).both these actors are excellent in their individual characters. with imperioli, you'll want to hug him and bring him home to mom. ventimiglia, well, you won't know whether you should slap him or bring him home (and not to mom!).<p>there are other stand-out performances as well. the character of rita is played by drena deniro (yes, robert's daughter). the audience adored her. in talking with the others who saw the film it was fun to discuss whether it was albert or louie who was their favorite of those two. but, everyone loved rita!is this film perfect? no, i can't say that it is. there were many times i wished the director had had a bigger budget to work with. there were some scenes that cried out for more budgetary freedom. (give this guy a decent budget to work with and i believe you are going to see a film that will make you stand up and notice.)the ending sequence was a bit of a victim of budget. yet, budget or no budget, the ending screen shot, in my opinion, brought together the talent of actor and director into a memorable, emotionally effective scene.

this b&w film reached the spartan movie house of my frisian village about 18 months after its release. in those days much of our full-length comedy fare hailed from denmark (nils poppe anyone?) so this movie struck like a thunderbolt -- it had me weeping with helpless mirth, rotfl as we'd now put it. ok, so some of the sight gags were in fact recycled vaudeville 'schtick', but how was this 'barefoot boy with cheeks of brass' to know that at the time? in any case, my favorite scenes had jerry's unique brand of frantic clowning, like that hawaii boxing match.seeing "sailor beware" again fifty years later i still guffawed loudly at the goings-on. granted, without the nostalgia component it would probably be just another fair-to-middling comedy. but then, another movie that once had me in stitches even more helplessly, the spike jones outing "fireman save my child", now seems dated and stilted apart from some too-short orchestra bits and doodles weaver scenes. must be some special ingredient that makes martin & lewis product stay fresher longer. to me this one at least rates eight out of ten.

this is not especially well written. the songs are not memorable. the cast, however, squeezes a lot out of this martin and lewis in the navy situation. they both look great as young sailors. they are believable. the scenes on the submarine show how cramped it must have been on those underwater missions in the 1950s and before.lots of sailors in many scenes. hundreds perhaps, in a big outdoor exercise field, and again in a boxing arena.you will see james dean in his scene. he does stand out even though he is an extra here. in a scene where jerry walks across a busy street we see some of his "almost accident" comedy which he would bring into play years later in the patsy.dean giving jerry boxing instructions is a good comedy skit to watch for. jerry in the boxing ring shows his high energy that was his trademark in the late '40s and early '50s. dean and jerry dancing is a bit of a treat. not great, but better than most non dancing movies.worth seeing if you don't mind black and white. good ending.tom willett

greystoke: the legend of tarzan, lord of the apes is based on the classic book tarzan of the apes by edgar rice burroughs and is a more faithful adaptation to the classic book, the film has some great scenery like the jungles of south africa to the greystoke mansion, the acting is also great. chirstopher lambert did a great performance as tarzan, it was also his first english speaking role. the film has some funny moments, sad moments and touching moments that makes this a real classic.the film sees a boat crashing in the jungles of south africa and some time later they have a son named john, the apes go into the hut and one of them kills the father. the apes then take him to where they live and adopt him as one of their own, as the years go by john grows up and learns to be more like the apes. in his teens his foster mom gets attacked by native hunters and soon killed by them, years later a group of people are going to africa on a expedition. after setting up camp they're soon attacked by the natives, most escape but capitaine phillippe d'arnot is left behind injured by some of the arrows. after hiding he meets john now an adult who takes him to his home and takes care of his wounds, after a while phillippe starts to teach john how to speak english and teach him that he's not one of the apes but a person. when phillippe goes to leave john goes with him, after sometime they arrive at greystoke manor where the sixth earl of greystoke is shown his long lost grandson, john is shown his bedroom and picture of his true mom and dad. john also meets jane porter and slowly as they get to know each other he begins to have feelings for her, when it's christmas the sixth earl of greystoke slides down the stairs killing himself. john then starts to miss the jungle and wants to return but phillipe tells him to stay since everything they had done would be for nothing. john is then torn between his life as a greystoke and the lord of the apes.greystoke: the legend of tarzan, lord of the apes is a great classic that should be seen. 10/10

i really liked the first part of this film in africa for about an hour or so until the animal cruelty by civilized humans in scotland got to me in the second half and made me so sad i couldn't watch some of it. however, this was done by the filmmaker to make a point that early natural scientists ruined everything alive they didn't understand by "studying" it literally to death without considering the rights and comfort of the animals studied, which we know now shouldn't be studied anywhere but in the natural world they inhabit, and as unobtrusively as possible. i do recommend this film as it was a mostly serious and honest story of tarzan and made a point of showing the gross animal cruelty that was rampant in the 19th century scientific world as well as the pure and simple, beautifully primitive life tarzan lived as a young man who was found as a baby and raised by chimps after the violent death of his parents in the african jungle.christopher lambert was wonderful and very soulful in his life of tarzan role, as was ralph richardson in his last film role as tarzan's ultra-rich, nobility-reeking gramps in scotland. andy macdowell was pretty and pretty good as tarzan's gussied-up and civilized "jane" in her first movie role. from his charismatic work in this film and his very haunting eyes, i cannot understand why lambert did not later become a big star, but his really bad movie choices later may have done him in. the terrific ian holm, as a wounded frenchman in africa helped by tarzan and who then escorted tarzan back to his previously unknown, ancestral home in scotland, was great as always.i am so glad tarzan got sick of and didn't stay in the animal-cruel civilized world at that time and went home to africa in the end to live out his life with his gentle and loving ape "relatives" who raised him instead of staying in scotland and living like royalty, which would have ruined him if it didn't kill him first.

this begins a series (which i'll hopefully keep up every week-end) of films that came out during my childhood  in this case, it's one i've only managed to catch now. it was clearly intended as the last word on the subject, which basically had been debased to the level of hokum over the years; however, in its uncompromising striving for a serious-minded approach (a sure measure of which is that the protagonist is never once referred to by the name he's been known all this time the world over!), the film-makers rather lost track of the fact that the thing was intended primarily as entertainment! consequently, we get a decidedly staid representation of events  with more care given to meticulous period reconstruction than in providing a functional thematic environment for its mythic jungle hero! even so, christopher lambert rose to stardom  as did another debutante, andie mcdowell, playing his love interest (named jane, of course)  with the title role, which he handles creditably enough under the circumstances. however, ralph richardson (to whom the film is dedicated, this being his swan-song) steals every scene he's in as tarzan's natural grandfather who, in spite of showing obvious affection for his long-lost kin, can't bring himself to forget tradition in an effort to understand his predicament; the hero, in fact, is much more comfortable interacting with primates (even contriving, after having gone back home, to save his adoptive 'dad' from captivity). the film is otherwise very good to look at (with cinematography by stanley kubrick regular john alcott, no less), features an appropriately grandiose score as well as remarkable make-up effects (by rick baker)  and, while essentially disappointing as a tarzan outing, retains considerable value nonetheless as a prestige picture of its day.

if you are looking for a modern film version of buster crabbe or johnny weismuller's overcoming the machinations of unscrupulous, white safari guides or cunning, black tribesmen, while saving the animal kingdom, this is not the movie for you. this is a recounting of the tarzan "legend" from its beginning in intelligent, adult terms. it is beautifully filmed and faithful to the edgar rice burroughs stories.tarzan is no action hero, but a man torn between two worlds - the natural and the civilized. in a stunning performance, christopher lambert portrays this angst with absolute realism. if he slips up just once the cat will be out of the bag: the audience (especially the adult audience targeted by the film) will laugh, and the film will completely lose its grip. it will plummet into the cheesy depths. but lambert never lets that happen. (forget what you may think of him in other movies; when i saw this film at the theater on its original release, i thought he deserved an academy award.)the supporting cast is uniformly excellent, as other commentators have noted. i disagree with most of them in that i didn't find anything wrong with andie mcdowell's performance. i wouldn't have nominated her for an academy award - the role is undemanding - but she is completely up to it, such as it is. i don't know why her voice was overdubbed, either.the cinematography of the african segment of the tale is absolutely beautiful. it captures both the beauty of the african wilderness and the exotic expectation it holds in the collective imagination of those who have never been there. the scenery is lush and exotic, and the colors are vivid.but this is also a "period" film, and the cinematography also magnificently depicts victorian england - the countryside, the city and the interiors. the costumes are outstanding. the soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or obtrusive.there are some disturbing scenes - especially for animal lovers - but no more disturbing than a few scenes in dances with wolves. this is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature, personified in the young lord greystoke, convincingly portrayed by christopher lambert.

greystoke is without doubt the best tarzan movie i have ever seen. christopher lambert portrays a very believable man trying to return to the world of mankind alongside the fantastic ian holm. the struggle of john to leave the jungle and the apes who raised him is quite stirring. some very memorable scenes including where lambert makes the jungle noises to the romantic interest, and the scene where he witnesses his ape father's death. tarzans feelings for both worlds is well developed and really makes you feel for him.an excellent and underrated movie.

spoilers edgar rice burroughs's famous character was adapted thousand of times for the screen til one's thirst is quenched, notably during the thirties and the forties by hollywood. its productors made tarzan one of the most successful cinema characters. several years later, hugh hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the monkey-man and it's a more natural, more wild and more down-to-earth tarzan that he gives away here. hudson skilfully avoids the clichés that you usually grant to tarzan such as his famous scream or his friendly pet, cheetah. not only, are we far from the designed and invented character made by hollwood but we are also far from the film set used to make his stories. the movie was partly made in africa (more precisely in cameroon). the movie introduces two obvious parts: the first one which takes place in the jungle where tarzan lives among his adoptive friends, the apes and considers himself as their lord. but he ignores his real origins. the second one in england where tarzan discovers the english society. ian holm epitomizes the link between the two parts and hudson avoids all that could make the movie falls into the ridiculous thanks to a clever screenplay. indeed, holm teaches lambert basic rules of manners so as to behave correctly in the english society and the result works. moreover, in the second part, no-one ever laughs at tarzan and he's even really appreciated. as far as the end is concerned well it's a both bitter and happy end. happy because tarzan comes back to the jungle and meets again his adoptive close relatives. but bitter too, because this homecoming means that the greystoke line won't be ensured and is condemned to disappear... christophe lambert finds here, his first (and last?) great role. sadly, he'll never equal the achievement of his performance in this movie and he'll play in poor and insipide action movies. nevertheless, as i said previously, a clever screenplay, a performance of a rare quality, some impressive natural sceneries (both the jungle and the english country and we get a gorgeous movie. it's also an excellent rereading from a popular novel. so why is it only rated barely (6/10)?

after i first saw this, i thought, "wow, this is the most spectacular movie, visually-speaking, i've ever seen." since that time, i've seen some that topped it but it still ranks as one of the best in that department. i'm just disgusted the long-awaited dvd was so poorly done, the quality of this transfer hardly better than the vhs tape.the jungle scenes are filmed in cameroon, and "lush" is the best adjective to describe what you see. except for jungle sounds, "seeing" is certainly almost everything in the beginning as there is almost no "hearing," no dialog until tarzan (christopher lambert) befriends ian holm and vice-versa....so be ready for that, if you haven't watched this film. story-wise, all i'll say is this is not the tarzan many of us came to know in johnny weismuller films.....but that's not a complaint. for those craving action, and don't care about cinematography as i do, you just have to get past that silent introduction period in this tarzan version, our hero goes back to scotland (his roots), adapts to that environment (for the most part....and a little too quickly for credibility, frankly) and then returns to the jungle without jane. this is supposedly more true to the tarzan books, written by edgar rice burroughs.the special effects in here were done by rick baker, one of the best in the business. sharp dvd or not, this is still a stunning film to view and very interesting throughout its 2 hours and 15 minutes.

ruthless mercenary bruno rivera (paul naschy in peak nasty form) betrays his pregnant partner/girlfriend meiko (well played by eiko nagashima) in order to have exclusive dibs on a fortune in stolen diamonds. but meiko manages to seriously wound bruno before he gets away. bruno winds up in the swanky chalet of kindly rich doctor don simon (a fine performance by lautaro murua). he also attracts the attention of simon's two hottie daughters: the fiery monica (luscious silvia aguiler) and the sweet alicia (nicely essayed by the lovely azucena hernandez). however, bruno soon realizes that something is very amiss about the isolated place and plans to escape as soon as he can. meanwhile, the bitter meiko tries to find bruno so she can exact her revenge on him. naschy, who wrote and directed as well as stars, concocts one of his strangest, most twisted and perverse horror vehicles ever with this little seen oddity. the offbeat plot and mysterious atmosphere become more weird and unnerving as the story unfolds, eventually leading to a genuinely startling surprise downbeat ending. this film further benefits from occasional moments of graphic gore (watch out for the memorable sequence with one poor guy being devoured alive by vicious flesh-eating pigs!), alejandro ulloa's slick cinematography, and a decent sprinkling of nudity and soft-core sex. good supporting turns by roxana dupre as sassy maid raquel, pepe ruiz as amorous playboy don serafin, and julia saly as the deranged teresa. a pleasingly grim and worthwhile shocker.

pretty good movie about a man and his wife who get caught up in murder and the police officer investigating the case. it starts off marvelously, but kind of hits a wall at a certain point. we're sure we know what happened, then a tiny plot thread that seems at first like a red herring pops back up and disappoints. still, clouzot's direction is great, and the acting is quite good. louis jouvet, who also co-starred in marcel carné's drôle de drame, gives the best performance as the clever detective. i wonder if the coen brothers were influenced by this film when they wrote fargo. much like that film, the police officer doesn't appear until nearly halfway through, and then he becomes almost the focus of the film. there's also a lot of droll comedy surrounding him (although sometimes his methods seem sort of fascist).

should we take the opening shot as a strange frame??? i guess we have to. anyway two women are behind a closing umbrella, they walk upstairs to the talent agency and we go with them...and then they are never to be seen again. okay, how come not inside the place, at the piano, or even outside with the sound of the piano, then track inside and over, a la hitchcock??? so i guess clouzot is already telling us in a not very subliminal manner that we are following a segment of postwar society: especially how he then uses a citizen kane=like song cut up into about five pieces to show the lady singing traveling from the talent agency all the way to her first roses and applause of her vaudeville debut.after that we are relentless observers of more or less small disgusting details of a defeated country getting off its war torn tattered knees. and nobody ever handled small disgust better than clouzot. in fact, too bad he never tried sartre's nausea. almost everything we see after the first few minutes makes us ever so slightly queasy. ....okay, okay i'm grossly overstating that, let's just settle for a general feel of a lot of the film. look carefully, in fact, and you will even see one of the cops picking his nose. and in how many films has anyone ever done that. then there is a very loud nose blowing bit in front of the photographer lesbian by the main cop, and notice that she does not, literally, blink an eye or raise an eyebrow.the point of all this is an almost feverish immersion in contiguity, seemingly, until you can smell practically every scene as well as see and feel it. as for the other aspects of the movie, others here have covered them in a lot more detail than i. but forget about the mystery here: this is the ultimate mcguffin. clouzot is about as interested in the real killer as those two women coming in out of the rain in the first few seconds of the film and are never seen again. from beginning to end all he wanted to do was follow a bunch of people around, not even particularly interesting ones at that, and say, here look at this woman's twitch, that man's hitching of his pants in all their insignificance, years and years before tina turner was singing we don't need another hero. \even the forced levity of the ending is bleakly done in a dilapidated part of paris, and rather chilly bare walled apartment. with only the couples love for each other to see them through, as if to say there must be two or three million like you throughout the city, working your fingers off by the day for a little love at night.from this it was just a short step to wages of fear and the ultimate in despair. they don't even know how to make films like this anymore in the u.s. for that matter, they didn't even know how to very much in france then, much less now. the relentless detail of gesture makes even the neorealists of italy look like bad psychologists. which i guess makes clouzot a kind of rosselini on speed. very enjoyable nonsense, this movie. the only flaw, seems to me, and as was pointed out by another viewer, the lead woman is somehow not quite right. everybody else in the film is just about perfectly cast.

what do you get when you have a tenacious, seasoned french police inspector by the name of maurice martineau is called to solve a murder case? well, simply a very entertaining, fun film. the re-mastered black-and-white film "quai des orfevres" delivers the goods despite romance, jealousy and marriage that seem to just get in the way towards the truth of 'who done it?'inch by inch, technique by technique as seasoned by experience and intuition, the patience of this master inspector etches into the truth -- but of course, with the help of a bag full of dirty police interrogation tricks.martineau is the centerpiece of this film. the use by director henri-georges clouzot of raucous background music to intensify the drama in grand film noir style is a wonderful wrapper around the visual experience.martineau eventually solves the mystery and arrests the culprit. hey, he is good!! but alas, martineau, too, can keep a dark secret in his past. who is that boy that is perhaps not his son?some things can never get solved -- even beyond the closing credits.

great artists, always suffered while they were young. i could mention mozart and beethoven, but that is not the point. this movie was made by h-g clouzot whose family wanted him to succeed in the law professions.its main star is louis jouvet who studied and practiced as as pharmacist before becoming "the greatest actor" and also director of france's theater before and after wwii.they both had health problems. clouzot had tb while young, jouvet had cardiac problems and died on a theater..such events shape the character of men (and women, of course). one might even say that today's artists are so poor, because they had never suffered and fought for their lives.to me, this is the greatest of clouzot's movies. "wages of fear" is greater in "suspense", "diabolique" also has more "suspense" and a better plot and is more about "female evil".quai des orfèvres is more human. clouzot was falsely accused by de gaulle's entourage (mostly communists and jews) of collaboration with the nazis and banned from making films until until de gaulle left france's government in early 1946. de gaulle came back in 1958, as president.the main characters are all good souls: jenny l'amour may perform as a "putain" on stage, but she is not a "whore" (dictionaires make synonyms of those words, but they are not the same), loves her husband, and refuses the slight "advances from her (presumably lesbian) friend dora, the photographer.maurice the husband is jealous and timid, but runs away from the scene of the crime. he is a coward because he fell in love with a woman and traded an eventually more upscale career for love..antoine, the detective (interpreted by the great louis jouvet, basically a stage actor, performs in this french "gray" not noir, as well as e.g. robinson in "double indemnity") shows flair for pseudo criminals, tenderness for a negro son(?), and compassion for the true author of the crime, because he remembers that is father cleaned the latrines at some nobleman's château!!clouzot was capable of slapping an actor's face in order to put him in the right frame of mind, but deep inside he was very human. i have his horoscope in front of me. he had venus in sagittarius which means open-heartedness, devotion, charity and altruism. for those who do not believe in astrology, my most sincere apologies...

henri-georges clouzot's film is quiet an example of the french transition cinema. a film between the realism of the postwar cinema and the full-of-magic and symbolism nouvelle vague. with some spots of the american classic films (but not imitating it) the director tales us a story about love, crime and the importance of points of view. we can find great actors too (suzy delair is impeccable).is interesting too, how we can find aspects of this film nowadays. quai des orfèvres inheritance is palpable in woody allen tradition. plunging a crime situation in a picturesque environment. the naive ending is also typical in steven spielberg's good-ending films. and finally i would like to point out, the deja voo sensation during the photography session between jenny lamour (suzy delair) and dora monier (simone renant) in which the first one confess that she thinks her husband is being unfaithful and exactly with the woman who is photographing her. that scene is exactly the one between natalie portman and julia roberts in closer (mike nichols, 2004).

seeing this show gives me respect for mtv, though i imagine that mtv sees this random, edgy material as its main selling point and is much less concerned with the pertinent truths it expresses. i write and play music for a living and this show gets me really emotionally riled up. for me, wondsershowzen serves a completely distinct function from most tv. instead of dulling or distracting the senses, (which can be often really nice at times), it awakens my spirit of right and wrong. it makes me very uncomfortable, but in a very comforting way. i don't think a lot of viewers absorb most of this show's content, but if they do, kudos to television viewers everywhere.

i'm torn about this show. while most parts of it i found to be hilarious, other parts of it i found to be stupid and simply shock for shock sake. the off the wall parody of some of the cartoons are brilliant as indeed are a lot of the scenes with the children. however, i don't think it's clever getting little children to say rude things. it's not that i think "oh poor children, they're being exploited" - it's just that it's really not clever!! it's something that anyone could do, therefore making it as simple and pointless as making a paper airplane. in order to make this show better they would have to stick to the natural responses from children, which i think can be funnier than the scripted at time. by far the funniest part of wonder showzen is clarence, the blue puppet who wonders around the streets talking to and annoying strangers. it's really funny and it's mostly improvised. seeing him in a long scene about the importance of patience test the patience of an extremely patient man, was by far the funniest scene in my opinion. you should watch this show though because all in all it's very funny, even if it is stupid at times.

i was plagued by nightmares involving sesame street and the muppet show during my childhood. i loved the programs, but when i slept, i'd dream about muppets not unlike the ones on tv...but not quite the ones on tv.they would speak gibberish and laugh and sing while eating each other and killing each other. they'd take a bite of their cute felt flesh and it would tear apart followed by arterial bleeding. nice! but that was the past...i love this show! i saw peter jackson's meet the feebles years ago and wondered why there wasn;t similar work out there. well here it is, as sick, twisted and somehow socially potent the old hobbit's vision.if you like this show, and you haven't seen meet the feebles, get it on amazon or some such film source. you're in for a treat.by the way, clarence would totally kick triumph's dog ass.

the debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured, if limited, stab at the con game and obsession. filmed for zero money, nolan couldn't have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of london to ply his trade, given the lack of funds. this short (67 min) is at its best in playing with the audience's and protagonist's expectations about who is scamming whom, though the initial set-up does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept. the muddy cinematography (he often used natural lighting due to budget) can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization, though the limitations do show at times.one can easily see nolan's style developing in this fledgling effort; many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in memento and insomnia. not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and nolan fans.

christopher nolan's first directorial effort, a year before he did "memento," and this is almost as brilliant as that classic. he uses time differentials in a similar manner to tell his story, and it's a very clever one.bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about. one day, he follows this man, cobb, who turns the tables and confronts bill, who breaks down and confesses what he's up to. cobb is a burglar and he takes bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes. both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them. but there's an ulterior motive for cobb nurturing this relationship, and it all ties in very smartly at the end. no, i won't spoil it but this is a very cool movie and i'm beginning to think christopher nolan is a genius.if you like suspense films with surprise endings, this one is a must see.

christopher nolan's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out. shot on a micro budget of $6,000 this is a student film with real class. the film is shot in black and white, and features people who you assume are friends of nolan's appearing in the movie. this is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good. you could see jeremy theobald and alex haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven't since this was made 6 years ago.nolan's thriller, much like memento, does not play chronologically, it shifts the scenes around much like pulp fiction. the writing is fantastic. it is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting. i thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent.for a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all, this is so good. it is superior to most that hollywood studios offer and nolan after three films (this, the superior memento and the not quite as good but still excellent insomnia) has cemented himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times. i can't wait for batman.this film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch. it is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising. i also thought that the score from david julyan was also excellent, very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it. he has gone on to compose nolan's other films. overall i would recommend this, i intend to get all of nolan's films. this is a low budget gem. *****

"you were on your way up and you tripped on a skirt !" gilligan says to jim leonard. that sums up the plot of this story of up and coming leonard (a young humphrey bogart) when his dream gets sidetracked by the bombshell heiress carol, played by dorothy mackaill. leonard has been working on a new and improved motor, but now his love life and motor company both have their ups and downs in this 68 minute shortie. bogart hadn't developed the quiet, brooding style yet. good performances by most of the supporting characters - her butler, his co-workers, a sister, interlopers along the way. some adult themes, since it was done just before they really enforced the film code, but it's still tame compared to what is on tv today. directed by thornton freeland, a year before freeland directed the incredible "flying down to rio".

humphrey bogart in his first starring role looks very young, acts well, but has a pronounced lisp only hinted at later in his career. still, he's very good and very appealing as the idealistic young inventor of a new airplane motor.dorothy mackaill is the real star here, playing a once-rich woman who's torn between her real love for bogart (he's broke too) and the comfort and security of marrying an older man (hale hamilton).along for the ride are astrid allwyn as bogart's trampy sister, bradley page as her would-be producer, barbara leonard as the cosmetologist, jack kennedy as gilligan, and halliwell hobbes as the faithful (and wise) butler).both mackaill (whi had been a star in silent films) and bogart were trying to gain a toehold in talkies in 1932. bogart was a slow-rising actor from the broadway stage; mackaill was slipping and would soon appear in skid-row production like picture brides. yet they are both very good here. mackaill wasn't even 30 when she appeared in this film!

this is a movie, that has all the basic elements of its genre. it makes you wanna cry, it makes you laugh, it disgust you, it makes you angry etc. the topic of the story is fortunately not about some disease or drugs, what is the common trend in gay themed movies in these days, but it focuses on the social interactions between characters what could be considered not to be in the high school elite. the play and the direction could be a little bit more sophisticated, but on the other hand it's somehow better so, because it really shows the distress of the characters, that they are experiencing. if this was intended, then this is a remarkable job and assuredly an achievement, specially for such an young director. it's actually a good story that gives you a little inside into, how it is to be a fat girl and to acknowledge it to yourself.

i had read up on the film and thought it would be cute, a feel good saturday night movie. i wasn't expecting anything great, figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a totally bad experience. i have to admit i was pleasantly surprised.the dialogue was pitch perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and it flowed nicely. ash christian was perfect, his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was nice to see. he could have turned this character into something we've all seen before but instead strayed away from stereotypes and focused on the wittiness of the character. it was wonderful to see jonathan caouette again, i didn't know what he would do after tarnation. ashley fink is gem, a great young character actress that hopefully will get more work.there are moments in the film that could have used some work, but all in all not a bad time at the cinema. my friend described it as a gay angus/napoleon dynamite but it's something more than that. it's a character study into what it's like to grow up gay in a small town, the pain is there but the humor behind that pain (that only age can make clearer) is magnified. i look forward to seeing more of ash christian, ashley fink and jonathan caouette soon.

a good entertainment but nothing more : in this western we are between the classics and the spaghetti ones. this provides us a good a conventional story but it's always a pleasure to see robert mitchum with his legendary flegma although he isn't as fit as in the forties or the fifties. and don't forget david carradine is the son of john carradine

burt kennedy both wrote & directed this western taken from a novel. kennedy was a well known good writer & director, mostly westerns.robert mitchum was a star for over 20 years when he made this. this role was like many he had made already,one can see why he was a big star for so many years.he filled this role easily like a well used glove.the title character is played by robert walker jr. (his father a fine actor robert walker--died tragically at age 32---his mother is noted actress jennifer jones).robert was of slight build & even though he had talent only made a few films. (he was in rita hayworth's near last film.road to salinas ---the same year & was very good).he looked very much like his father, but seemed to lack his fathers charm. he made only a few more movies. he is still living & i wish him well.most of his scenes are with another son of a hollywood great. john carradine's son david, who is still making movies. they made a nice team.in westerns you always have a female character & usually she is a dance hall performer. (today they call them hookers), angie dickinson assays this role nicely. also featured are western stalwarts, john anderson & jack kelly.it was film in old tucson )outside of downtown tucaon az,. & the scenery is gorgeous.typical of the older westerns, there is not too much action,there is some good humour & the usual ending shoot out.it is a fast enjoyable 89 minutes.ratings: *** (out of 10) 84 points(out of 100) imdb 7 (out of 10)

mr. bean has always been my favorite. no matte how many times you watch the same thing, the show never gets monotonous or repetitive. mr. bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't need to even speak to make people laugh. his gestures, his facial expressions and his face itself is so funny to watch. the situations which he faces on the show is simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even greater. there is simply no reason why this show shouldn't receive a 10 because it is fabulous. its something that would even make the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh. some of my all time favorites episodes from the show are: 1) when mr. bean lodges at a hotel 2) the one where he watches the scary film 3) mind the baby ( the diaper scene especially). in fact, all the episodes are so good that it is really difficult to criticize the show. mr.bean can go to any heights to prove that he is funny, including completely stripping himself in one of the episodes. the way he handled that situation was simply mind blowing. 10 out of 10.

rowan atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless mr. bean who never goes far without his teddy bear. the appeal of mr. bean is largely his childish behavior and innocence. we don't know if he came from the sky or another planet. he is the kind of strange character that you can't make up quite easily. he is often alone and used to it. he has a hard time communicating through speech which might be why we only hear his grunts at times. there are other characters who speak to him and he responds. the character of mr. bean is a mystery and still is. he lives alone and does the unthinkable when he can do the sensible thing. mr. bean is rather an odd man out who does not mind it much. he rather live a simple life with his yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to get to work on time.

rowan atkinson's mr. bean ranks right up there with laurel & hardy, buster keaton, the marx brothers and other comedy greats. i have never seen people laugh out loud so heartily and literally fall out of their chairs as when i introduced them to mr. bean via my videos and now dvds. i'll never forget the first time my brother saw him. he was over for a visit and i asked him if he'd ever seen mr. bean? "who?" he said. so i got out my video and showed him the one where mr. bean is in church and starts to nod off. my brother laughed so hard he fell out of the chair and was holding his stomach from laughing so hard. he became an instant fan of mr. bean. we all know how hilarious these episodes are, but the fun is in sharing them with others. i have seen so many people laugh 'til it hurts! favorite episodes are: the visit of the queen, the hotel room stay, late for the dentist appointment, the christmas episode (a classic...plus kids love it!) and the new year party. rowan atkinson is a comic genius!

rowan atkinson's creation mr.bean has stood the test of time and will be forever etched upon the memory of those who viewed it.living alone and appearing not to have a job of any description mr.bean goes around doing day to day activities in a rather comedic fashion.the mistake prone mr.bean induces heartfelt laughter when put even in the most simplest situations.though he barely spoke any coherent words his jovial actions more than made up for this.even when driving in his beloved mini mr.bean still manages to cause inadvertent chaos.not very much is known about his background but his ability to draw tears of laughter from the audience at his funny shenanigans is well known.before he found fame nick hancock can be seen in a couple of the episodes

this is a wonderful family sitcom. rowan atkinson has appeared in to other excellent sitcoms, the thin blue line (better than this) and blackadder (not better than this).mr bean is a no talking, human disaster. he goes to places and gets himself in absolute mayhem, the mayhem includes: climbing up to the top diving board and is too frightened to jump off, taking about 20 minutes, until some kids eventually throw him off, ending up inside a washing machine and driving his car while sat on a roof. bean drives a mini and has a teddy.this was quite similar to the baldy man, a series staring gregor fisher who says very little, but gets himself in mayhem best episode: do it yourself mr bean, episode 9: bean hosts a new years eve party, then gets some stuff for decorating his flat, but has too much stuff and has to drive his car on the roof.

this is a very amazing movie! the characters seemed so realistic to me, it was hard to believe they weren't real people. being from the south, i thought judith ivey's character seemed especially real, and as everyone else has mentioned, she does an outstanding acting job. the characters are not beautiful and look nothing like the average hollywood stars - their imperfect bodies and personalities seem so much more natural and real. one reviewer mentioned that the main character, alice, had no good reason to run away from home, which is true - she didn't have any moral or upstanding reason to run away, such as escaping child abuse, etc. i thought that she was just fed up with dead-end jobs in a working class life and wanted to flee down to florida where her friend lived the appealing and privileged life of a college student in miami. the actress shows alice's confusion, uncertainty, and questioning turn into decisiveness and willingness to take control of her life with impressive naturalness. the film also shows how alice is trapped in situations with seemingly no options, causing her to panic, take action, and reach out for help. at first, the grainy filming style put me off and made me think that it was a very low budget or homemade movie, but in actuality it is very well done. the home movie quality really makes you feel like you are there with the characters, a part of their rv trip across the country. this is definitely a film worth seeing, although i don't quite understand all the descriptions of it as a heart-warming coming of age tale. it is rather vulgar and disturbing at times, even if it is not completely sad in the end.

while i can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography (i thought a more purposeful approach would have better supported the low-fi, home movie feel) i must say that i thought the script and acting of what alice found were excellent! dean bell has crafted a real gem that judith ivey charms with character-driven delight. her performance of sandra is a pleasure -- unfolding, alternately, as diabolical and romantic. we are at once intrigued and repulsed by her actions... and never given more information than is necessary. her's and the supporting cast's efforts meet bell's post-modern fairy tale with arms wide open. emily grace's alice is infused with a doey-eyed magic. she seems to mold like clay before us, morphing into some sort of beautiful, lost beast. by the end, we are at odds with words, as she is, saying goodbye to her mother. kudos also should be doled out to jane lincoln taylor -- whose mother provides the right amount of tragic historic weight -- and justin parkinson -- whose shy first-time john, sam, provides one of the sweetest, if not most awkward, sex scenes in film. bell has created a first rate story and assembled a plethora of talent to make it.

it's a sad state in corporate hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking routes you've been seeing in the movie house since day one. i had literally no idea how this film was going to end, because it went left when i expected it to go right, zigged when i expected a zag, etc. this could have easily unraveled into generic suspense thriller, or depressing white trash drama, but it stayed a course all its own till the end. it is a sad story, though. not because of what happens to alice, but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her down this path.the plot has a quiet dignity of form that's usually reserved for theater, but the pacing could use some tightening up. either way, it's a very good film, and for some reason i suspect sour grapes from those who have scored this one low.

having worked professionally with young girls on the run, i found this film surprisingly authentic. i would never have found it had a friend not loaned his videotape. there are classic themes here: coming of age, mother/daughter estrangement, the limited choices of the underprivileged, who is the good samaritan, tragedy is in every life & the many layers or relationships. flashbacks are meaningful (when alice acquires a gun we know she has some familiarity with how to use it) and it does not end in cliché. the cast really "sells" their roles. it is adult material and the audio is a bit too grainy. allow it 15 minutes to so to draw you in.

i saw this movie when i was very young living in houston, texas. i really enjoyed this movie, and i wrote to jean peters in hollywood, and i told her how much i enjoyed seeing her in this movie. she sent me an autographed photo. this movie was directed by jacques tourneur, and besides jean peters in the starring role. it also stars louis jourdan, debra paget, and herbert marshall. it was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long. jean peters was married to howard hughes. she also starred in "viva zapata" with marlon brando, anthony quinn, who won an oscar for playing the role zapata's brother (marlon brando starred as zapata) (1952). and she also starred in "captain from castile" (1947) with tyron power. since then i've been trying to find a place where it is available, but so far i have not been successful. does anybody have any suggestions about where i can find and purchase this movie? it this comment contains spoilers, i am unaware of it.

sometimes it's hard to be a pirate...............but by golly miss jean peters has a lot of fun trying - and it shows,particularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with blackbeard (mr thomas gomez - eminently hissable)when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face. with fifty years of hindsight feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male - dominated society but i have serious doubts that either m.tourneur or miss peters had any such concept in their heads at the time. it was an exciting,entertaining family film with absolutely no pretensions,hidden meanings or alternative agenda.it was fun. m.louis jourdan is both winsome and treacherous as her love interest. mr herbert chapman is wise and philosophical as the wise and philosophical doctor.mr james robertson justice is just a tad unbelievable as the bosun. but it is miss peters who stays in the memory.wilfully adolescent,illiterate,tough but vulnerable,wonderfully agile,and ultimately,courageous,she is everybody's idea of a lady pirate. there was a definite window of opportunity for her in feisty costume roles - that she did not choose to seize it is a matter of some regret.

this is one of several period sea-faring yarns of its era, which has the added distinction (although not in itself unique) of a female buccaneer at its center. at first, both leads – jean peters and louis jourdan – might seem miscast but they grow nicely into their roles eventually, thanks no doubt to the talented players (herbert marshall, thomas gomez and james robertson justice) who support them. velvety-voiced marshall is uncharacteristically cast as the ship’s obligatory philosophical lush of a doctor, and gomez is suitably larger-than-life as blackbeard the pirate.the cast is completed by debra paget as jourdan’s wife, who incurs the jealous rage of the tomboyish titular character in whom jourdan instills the first pangs of love (which, however, does not spare him the occasional flogging or sword-wound); incidentally, the film was the second exotic teaming of jourdan and paget in one year, following delmer daves’ bird of paradise. the direct result of this unexpected softening of anne’s character is her falling out with blackbeard’s crew, and her unlikely climactic sacrifice in order to save the lives of the stranded jourdan, paget and marshall.while the film is not a particularly outstanding example of its type, jacques tourneur’s energetic direction and franz waxman’s grandiose score ensure an above-average effort that moves along at a brisk pace; incidentally, tourneur had already done service in the genre with the superior burt lancaster vehicle, the flame and the arrow (1950). as usual with vintage technicolor productions, the cinematography gives the film a sumptuousness that is invigorating. by the way, differing running-times are given for this film (81 or 87 minutes) and, for the record, the version i watched was the shorter one.

a bit "the movie in the movie" case, or as the theme is virtual game here, which is the reality or even more frightening which reality is the "real" one.as any cronenberg there are organic things, like the pod and that wonderful idea:the organic gun, a weapon made of bones and tissues that shoots teeth. if there are some slower moments, the sets, designs and ideas are there with some thoughts of revolution. can be not liked because the way the movie is happening is quite unusual and sometimes disturbing, but it's definitely worth it.

my favorite science fiction, incredible ride through mistrust and the warping of reality. probably the best performance i have ever seen jude law play. incredibly original with interesting character developments and a story line that twists and turns so rapidly that it takes a couple of minutes after the film to fully grasps its genius. even more fun watching it again for the end changes the beginning.

now being a fan of sci fi, the trailer for this film looked a bit too, how do i put it, hollywood. but after watching it i can gladly say it has impressed me greatly. jude is a class actor and miss leigh pulls it off better than she did in delores clairborne. it brings films like the matrix, 12 monkeys and the cell into mind, which might not sound that appealing, but it truly is one of the best films i have seen.

existenz is simply david cronenberg's best movie. all the people compare it to the matrix. they're not even similar. if you enjoyed cronenberg's other works just a little bit, you'll love this one...

this movie is breath-taking and mind-blowing. but i think maybe it can only be appreciated by die-hard rpg funs. it is like a game. one problem is the plot is too game-like and just has too many twists. the twists are excessive. jude law gives a very good performance. i really like him in this movie, just as jerome in gattaca and gigglo joe in a.i.

the bottom line is: if you come looking for a sci-fi thriller/horror film, the matrix is what you'll like. if, like me, you long for the rare true science fiction film involving characters with depth and provocative thought about where science will take us, then you need to see existenz.

existenz was a good film, at the first i was wondering what is going on, organic "pods" made out of mutant reptiles which connected you and other players to a surreal virtual reality game via a umbilical cord, well it seems a little odd.but once it gets going its a pretty good film, with a few twists with a great open ending and the good aspect of weridness throughout the film is entertaining too see as your not sure whats coming next.security personnel throw away the metal detectors; they have bone guns !

existenz combines director david cronenberg's traditional love of blood and gore and exploding heads with the more confusing aspects of a reality twisting david lynch film. and it actually works effectively. i won't bother trying to give even the bare bones of a plot synopsis here because it'll only cause more confusion. all you need to know is that the film is about a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly lifelike that it becomes difficult to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality. the film almost seems to abandon its technology fearing point at the end, but then it throws in the final twist in the very last line of dialogue.there's also some very gross sexual imagery based around the 'bio-ports' in the protagonists backs, as well as some very gross acting from jude law. he manages to come off as naive and stupid and boring and any other annoying habit you can care to think of. jason jennifer leigh comes off much better, and everyone else can be called a supporting character, including willem dafoe in a functional, if unspectacular, role as a money-crazed mechanic. overall, existenz is a very effective sci-fi film about the possibilities technology can present and the possible consequences it will receive.

warning: plot spoilerthe always-abnormal movies of david cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste. fans of his earlier films will probably like `existenz', but it definitely isn't one for the squeamish. all of the usual elements are here. a game pod made out of skin (hooked into your back), buckets of blood, a gun made out of bones, and a manic mechanic to name but a few. the result is good in parts, bad in parts, and just plain weird in others. but one thing the film has is undeniable originality. despite the excessive use of weirdness it does prove a point- virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people. in the movie, a character shoots someone dead claiming that he was `annoying' (assuming that she was still in the game). but it leaves the question as to whether that really happened or if it was an occurrence in this stunningly life-like game. `existenz' leads to a conclusion that can be responded to in several ways. despite some extra gadgets and gook, it was simply your classic `it was all a dream or was it' twist. it is a smart surprise and answers a few questions, but giving that the entire film was leading up to this moment is a bit disappointing. at only 97 minutes it could have went on a bit longer too. in a peculiar way the film raises moral issues but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way. jennifer jason leigh appears here in her first big role in quite a while. but her character doesn't have enough qualities to make her jump off the screen or even give her a likeable character. jude law on the other hand (equipped with a curious american accent) is good as your average joe sucked into this abnormal world. we see the film through his perspective.`existenz' is far from flawless but it certainly is a movie experience to remember. there's tonnes of weird characteristics to match the similar styles of david lynch (what next? - being consumed by a question mark?!?!?!). it definitely isn't for all tastes but it is rewarding enough to recommend. my imdb rating: 6.2/10.

so let's begin!)))the movie itself is as original as cronenberg's movies would usually appear...my intention to see it was certainly jjl being one of my favourite actresses. she is as lovely as usual, this cutie!i would not say it was my favourite movie of hers. still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow. the rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array. ;)recommend with confidence!))))

i always believed that a film that's plot is centred around a virtual reality video game never sounds as though it's going to be anything special but existenz proved i couldn't have been more wrong. this film is unbelievable and, whilst highly entertaining, offers so much more than that. from start to finish, this film has you conceptualising to the point where you can have so many ideas, you can not make a final conclusion. david cronenberg has a talent for this as he does so many things.existenz is pure cronenberg; the way it's written and the way it's directed is very unique to his style and that can only be a good thing. cronenberg set himself a clear target with this film and that was to keep the audience guessing which he did with apparent ease. his fondness for the grotesque is not as predominant in this film as it is in the fly or naked lunch but there are still some elements such as the game pods and how they are made that can make the audience wince. with regards to his earlier work, existenz is more a combination of videodrome and a less violent scanners, a pretty awesome combination. setting the film in the not too distant future was a really good decision as it allowed cronenberg to be extremely imaginative with the films surroundings and also enabled him to visualise more concepts, allowing for less inhibited writing. it was important that the film didn't become over confusing and cronenberg avoided this very well by keeping things relatively simple. besides, if he wanted to make an unwatchable film, he'd know how to do it a lot better than this.existenz boasts an extremely talented cast of character actors and all perform very well. jennifer jason leigh gives the standout performance as the game designer who spends more time out of reality than in to it. leigh is sexy and commanding in her role as allegra and she really gets her teeth in to the role. the emotional range she shows in the film is particularly impressive, making her completely believable (if you can believe anything). jude law is also good and is very convincing in his character's fear of implantation. the chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film an extra bit of flavour. ian holm and willem dafoe are just two of the great actors in support who add further depth to the film with very colourful performances. the cast of the film isn't huge but existenz definitely has the 'quality is better than quantity' ethic which works very well.as well as being entertaining and thought provoking, existenz touches social issues such as control and loss of self. this further demonstrates the film as an intellectual vessel and could also explain why it wasn't a huge hollywood hit. existenz has so much to offer and although it isn't to everyone's taste, those who like cronenberg's work or who like science fiction will almost be certain to like this film. it is one of those films that needs to be watched with an open mind but it really is something special.

the producers of this picture are hungarians. it's not by crazy artistic momentum that x and z are capitalized in the titles considering that the word 'isten' means 'god' in hungarian. - by the way, david, isten is the word for god in hungarian... - hum... is that so ? let's consider this movie as 'a history of violence' science-fictional sibling. both films have in common the strength of blowing up respective genres ; thriller and drama in the 2005 one and 'none fx-ed as hell' science fiction in the one we're looking at right now. everything he does have a meaning and is surrounded by details : the nod to phil k. dick (who wrote "in the days of perky pat") by creating a 'perky pat' fast-food restaurant. the nod to stanley kubrick by using 2001's naming pattern ; as ibm became hal (one letter down in the alphabet) in the 1968 movie, in existenz 'classic lubricant spray' wd-40 becomes xe-60 (one letter up) when allegra cleans up pikul's port. the nod to david cronenberg by using videodrome's witty kind of formula ('death to...' & 'long live'..) and by taking another medium for central theme of a picture (tv in videodrome, video games and virtual reality in existenz in 1983, you penetrated a tv set. in 1999, you're penetrated by a game. welcome to canada!)the nod to good taste by getting peter suschitzky's cinematography, howard shore's music and ronald sanders's editing (a team that wins). for everyone born in the early 80's with a super famicom, a genesis or an arcade stick in the hands, this movie rings a bell. enough with the nods. the plot ? "jennifer jason leigh stars as a game designer (allegra) who creates a virtual-reality game that taps into the players' minds" as we can see on the movie main details page. that's the story in the story. to me, this picture is about a 'reality demonstrators' young couple infiltrating the 'brand new virtual game' presentation session to destroy its programmer. i assume that what we see in the last five minutes is reality, if there's such thing as reality. jennifer jason leigh is always playing a game designer in the game they're in and the end of the movie is the reality, with video games freaks giggles, big hairy dogs, 'cronenbergy realistic' plastic textures (helmets and stuff) and 9mm handguns. what you see is true. they play transcendenz during an hour or so (in this game, there's a game (existenz) in which jjl plays existenz's genius programmer and jude -pikul - law a marketing trainee associated with allegra's game), they play existenz because allegra is very concerned about her pod's health (the thing you plug your nervous system in, in order to play), she has to plug herself and pikul in then wins the game (transcendenz) and back in the reality they kill yevgeny nourish, transcendenz programmer.playing existenz and transcendenz is about facing your essence, face your subconscious while its creating a virtual reality you'll have to overcome in unexpected ways to win the game (by playing the game, the girl playing allegra, the 'reality demonstrator' turns into allegra, a 'virtuality goddess').what game would heidegger have played to feel his abstract da-sein term ? to be truly engaged in the world ?and what about nietschze (yes friedrich, god is dead and you know what ? willem dafoe stands for him! - god, the mecanic -) ??? yes we do construct a narrative for ourselves, and losing this thread we follow from one day to the next disintegrate people as personalities ; existenz's discusses the fact that reality is the whole perception of itself by anyone who engaged it truly. and we could sometimes get some neat stuff ; a perception of virtuality in virtuality in reality.

after his earlier movie "videodrome", which definitely shows similarities to this movie, director david cronenberg again ventures himself in the world of virtual reality, in which truth and fiction mix. it's virtual reality taken to a whole other level."existenz" is an highly original movie that is well directed and acted out but above all very well written. the movie features a fascination and well thought out concept, which gets greatly executed by director david cronenberg."existenz" is a movie that knows to constantly fool you. just when you thought you figured things out, another surprise awaits around the corner. things are never like how you think they are, especially when the line between truth and fiction gets explored. you just never really know what is the reality and what is the game-world, right till the ending. it makes the characters and events all very unpredictable and also provides the movie with a great ending that will leave you thinking even more.the movie has a perfect kind of game-play storytelling, mostly with its character appearances and its puzzling events. they have to complete a certain step or task first before they can continue in the world and find out what their purpose in the game is.the movie knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and surrealism, without ever going over-the-top with either one. the storytelling keeps the movie as simple as possible, though of course the movie isn't always that simple to follow because of its events, dialogs and unusual environments.the movie is not only just weird though. i was actually surprised to see that "videodrome" has an higher rating on here, thought it's a far more inaccessible and 'odd' movie. the movie is also still made entertaining and has a good fast pace. it doesn't ever allow the movie to get stuck in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings. it also makes this movie perfectly watchable for people who normally don't watch this sort of movies.the movie is good looking, with subtle effective special effects a great visual look, that also provides the movie with a certain required 'gaming' feeling.the movie is well cast, with jude law in a role you don't too often see him in, that of a shy insecure person. it once more shows how actually versatile law as an actor is and that he is way more than just another pretty face from hollywood. jennifer jason leigh also was a great female lead. she hasn't really played ever that many big parts in big productions but with this movie she shows why she nevertheless always have been regarded as a big movie star. the movie also features some other well known actors, in much smaller roles, such as ian holm and willem dafoe.an highly original movie that is well worth watching, especially if you have seen "videodrome" previously.8/10

existenz is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, wherein characters run from realm to realm, landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where it's leading them. within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games, calling into question which reality they arrive from is the "real" one.of course it's not spectacular at hiding the fact that it's not going to reasonably answer to a true reality, instead tossing the idea of whether it's real or a video game into question even up to the end. i'm not even sure cronenberg pretends that twist won't be there, it's so incredibly obvious in a sense it's kind of disconcerting.the problem with this film though is its base nature, in a sense. cronenberg is questioning reality and criticizing game play. yet the same things that he uses to criticize game play makes him revel in it: the violence, the discontinuity, the lack of focus and in a sense, the pixellation even if there isn't such pixellation in the film. i have once heard someone state that cronenberg's violence is actually a criticism of hyperviolence in media, but he hides that well with the fact that he derives such incredible pleasure in ripping new orifices into humans, animals, and amorphous piles of biological sludge.what is brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of video game conceits (not being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes, relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that don't make sense, only a few people around where it feels there should be many and vice-versa, all of that stuff) along with the motif of penetration. it definitely deconstructs the video game reality in a way that's nauseating and absurd, but it does it even better by replacing video game electronics with literal "pods" of biological matter that squirm and shift and are, frankly, disgusting to the one of the most horrifying degrees. for what it's worth, this film causes a reaction in you.but what for? it criticizes virtual reality, but it's a movie: it is its own virtual reality. it seems to criticize the banality of video game plot lines and character design, yet it maintains that banality. it definitely seems to worry over whether killing a video game character is more okay than killing an actual human being and how video games can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their actions in real life, and yet i say again, it derives the utmost pleasure from ripping people, objects, beasts, things, and organisms into bloody shreds.so whereas it has a key focus of angst, it doesn't really do anything with it, not really. only what it does do is present that angst in such an original way it can't really be denied its own moment of splendor.in a sense, it'd be much easier to just hate this movie for being gory and violent, because there's no good reason i can see for loving it and yet i can't disregard it as mediocre or bad. it'd be easier to simply not be able to take it, but since i can, there's nothing i can really do with it. i do believe it is a little excessive, it really didn't need to go as far as it went, but cronenberg's intentions are so mixed up and confused i don't know if that was cronenberg's flaw or cronenberg's point, and i don't think there's really any way to figure it out except maybe ask him directly.--polarisdib

an absorbing exploration of virtual reality, although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended. this film deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues about which layer of virtual reality you are in, positing an ontological confusion for the viewer to ponder. also can be seen as a satire of video games-- the whole movie though may fall into the fallacy of imitative form here. it seems unable to escape from the video game genre which it imitates; thus the satire becomes problematic. a number of interesting ideas crisscross throughout though: the biological mutant is one; the interface of technology and biology, the cyborg urge to transcend reality-- and philosophical allusions such as the title's to heidegger, along with existential questions: i.e., the game characters are partly scripted or determined and yet partly free to alter their fate, and they wonder at how strange that feels in the game. one character then notes that this existential confusion is just like real life, thereby erasing again the distinction between the virtual and the real. likewise with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble around in a world where you don't know what will happen next and you're not sure how to play since you have to stumble around just to find out the goal and the unknown rules. a virtual game within the game is titled "transcendenz". also a critique of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence. even the heroes at every level of ontological existence find themselves confused about violence. they don't like it but it is thrilling and part of the "game", which then they fear is real. the game creator, the god of the system, is assassinated in the end; yet that very scenario is played out in direct parallel to a video game we've just witnessed-- and the onlookers believe that it is still just part of the virtual reality. in the end, the film does not resolve the doubt about whether or not this is "real" but the point is clear (to me anyway). existenz means da-sein: you are there. you are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries at every level. ontologically, virtual reality recapitulates reality. and its common game motifs express, like a royal road to the unconscious, our own fascination with violence.nevertheless, while cronenberg affirms these philosophical allusions in an interview about the film, he claims that he is very much against the "reality ... {underground name of terrorist group} portrayed in the film both in the game and in the 'real' level." seems that cronenberg himself did not put that much thought into the film, though his impressive education comes through. the interview in cineaste gives the impression of a middle brow intellectual who's trying to be avant-garde by inclination. cronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination -- the clichéd bourgeois modernist credo-- despite the acknowledged ambivalence there. (my impression here might be due to one limited interview.) still, cronenburg seems to miss the point that his film betrays the fallacy of imitative form (here imitating computer games while doing a satirical critique of them, but a critique that is unable to "transcend" the same form) probably because he actually thinks that it is "imaginative" and radical. yet the film's imaginative world is less bearable, and more jejune, than our own all-too-real world. it remains trapped in the computer game worldview.

"we're both stumbling around together in this unformed world, whose rules and objectives are largely unknown, seemingly indecipherable or even possibly nonexistent, always on the verge of being killed by forces that we don't understand." so says ted pikul in the film. which for some people sums up life and 'existenz' probably is a film about existence. what is real and what is unreal and how you tell the difference. or not. the last line of the film is superbly ambiguous.the film seems like a shaggy dog story (indeed it has a real shaggy dog in it) but it takes you along on an interesting ride, full of provocative cronenberg touches that will make you look at amphibians, game pods, fish, spines and bones in a new light. some bits are quite icky. it takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called 'gas station' and a chinese restaurant is called 'chinese restaurant.'the film has an engrossing texture that is leagues away from your usual big budget science fiction movie.you can read many things into the film and it repays watching more than once.the main actors are jude law who is ok and jennifer jason leigh who is great. some roles don't suit this very talented actor but when she has a good role like this she is unmatchable. her unconventional beauty and fascinating voice suits the part of allegra. (looks great in a short black skirt too.) there are other familiar actors but they are not given much to do. it looks good, sounds good and a howard shore score complements the film very well. cronenberg is possibly the alfred hitchcock of the sci-fi/horror genre. no matter what film he makes he is always worth watching.

david cronenberg's `existenz' is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. it addresses the problems of a culture that is plugged into technology that it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical. the movie shocks the audience with its replacement of mechanical technology with organic, metabolismic one. in this context the technology is able to be part of human body. after playing the virtual reality game of `existenz', the real world feels like a game and as a result, human behavior change in order to apply violent game-urges even when the game is over. in existenz, technology has evolved from machinery to biological organisms that plug directly into the human nervous system; an idea that reflects marshall mcluhan's belief who is a well known media theorist, that computers are extensions of human consciousness. like telephone is an extention of the ear, television is an extention of the eye, telegram is an extention of the central nervous system high-tech virtual reality is an extention of human consciousness. in existenz, technology is biological and thus more human than it is in our world. but as technology becomes organic, humans become more mechanical and therefore less free, unable to resist their game-urges. existenz is a virtual realty simulation of man's existence. jean baudrillard describes a mediated society in his book of simulacra and simulation, which all power to act has been transformed to appear. the world has passed into a pure simulation of itself. in existenz it is obvious to see baudrillard's mediated society with the themes of the invasion of the body, the loss of control and the transformation of the self into other.while you are in the existenz, consciousness slowly replaces with another identity, your role in the game, which is a reflection each individual's real life subconscious. while you gain the control of your hyperreal life step by step, the aura of your real life disappers. for baudrillard, `.simulations or simulacra, have become hyperreal, more than real.' our hyperreality, like cronenberg's world of computer simulation, `.now feels, and, for all intents and purposes is, more real than what we call the real world.' (baudrillard) the purpose of the game which can basically be called 'experience' is quite metaphorical. because you can not even know what is experience unless you experience it. as existentialists say that, life without an exact explanation is absurd, the game of existenz is absurd too. cronenberg, ironically reflects the absurdity of our lives. for instance, in the game, the other roles just stand still unless you ask them a pre-programmed question. and when you put their aimless funny looking state of being into the representation of our lifes, the exposed absurdity really shocks.the theme of the game is to understand what it is for? this hidden metaphorical question creates anguish over the people who play existenz. they have no doubt about their existence, however they do not know the underlying reason of their existence. the essence.existentialists have held that human beings do not have a fixed nature, or essence, as other animals and plants do; each human being makes choices that create his or her own nature. in the formulation of the 20th-century french philosopher jean paul sartre, existence precedes essence. `choice is therefore central to human existence, and it is inescapable; even the refusal to choose is a choice. freedom of choice entails commitment and responsibility. because individuals are free to choose their own path, existentialists have argued, they must accept the risk and responsibility of following their commitment wherever it leads.' perhaps i should mention, `existenz' deals with the concept of freedom of choice too. you achieve your final role in the game by taking right decisions. if you don't than the game becomes irrevelant and boring. so, you begin to interrogate the game, your existence rather than your essence. you suddenly become schzopfrenically alianated from the game and realize your position outside the game. well as a last word, existenz is a well designed reverse simulation of life thus existentialism.

who should watch this film? anyone who has ever taken acid, read philip k. dick, thought the premise of the matrix was better then the special effects, has an interest in philosophy, or likes having their sense of reality messed with. i laughed out loud at this film, just because it was so outrageous and so spot-on. this film is great. this film is cool. it is better than the matrix, by a long shot (i didn't fall asleep in existenz, for a kick off: action/special effects films bore me stupid, and despite a plausible philosophical gloss, that is exactly what the matrix is). existenz is gross, it is disturbing, and it is funny. david cronenberg has done some shonky stuff (rabid) and some works of genius too (videodrome is another one worth checking out, as is stephen king adaptation the dead zone). but this is one of my all-time favourites. i can't remember the ending- which is a good thing, cos it means i can watch it again. or perhaps i never watched this film at all. maybe it's an implanted memory. or maybe it 'really' happened to me. i don't know. at any rate, it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality, and i'm glad.

david cronenberg, much like colleague david lynch, is an acquired taste. a director who plays with themes like reality, perversion, sex, insanity and death, is bound to get the most extreme reations from audiences. he proved this with films as the fly, naked lunch, crash and exitenz (capital x, capital z) and more recently, spider. it's best to see existenz with a clear mind. try not to read too much about the plot, or it'll be ruined for you. what i can tell you is that cronenberg takes you on a trip down into the world of videogames that acts as a metaphor for any kind of escapist behaviour. living out fantasies is something people always dream of, but how far can you go into it, before reality gets blurred and the fantasy takes over and turns into a nightmare? those are the themes touched in existenz, an exploration of identity, the human psyche, physical bodies being invaded by disease and most importantly, reality itself.the story and directing are excellent. cronenberg knows his trade very well and succesfully brings to life an artificial world, avoiding the usual pitfalls and clichés linked to stories such as this. the film shows some pretty disgusting stuff, but is unusually low-key in the gore department in comparison to cronenbergs other work. the shock effects he plays on are never over the top and the plot progression is very intelligent and creative. it's not the most intellectual movie ever, but it will leave you thinking about it, wondering and pretty confused.the acting gets two thumbs up as well. both protagonists, jennifer jason leigh and jude law, play their parts perfectly and cleverly portray their character's shifting moods and identities. the dialogue may seem a little stale and clinical at times, but that is part of the effect cronenberg was going for, to create a disaffected and alien atmosphere that puts you quite at unease. supporting actors as ian holm, don mckellar and an especially creepy willem dafoe lift the movie even higher with their disturbingly familiar performances.this movie takes some getting used to, but if you can appreciate the dark tone, blood-curdeling imagery and existentially warping story, you'll love it.

everybody seems to compare this to the matrix and the 13th floor, and when i first saw it i would have agreed -- i was expecting the matrix and was a little disappointed. but upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely.the thing to keep in mind is that the matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. the 13th floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. existenz is not an action movie at all, and is not (as many seem to believe) about "reality" or any such "deep" concept. it's about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial (both in its origin and in its behavior) world of make-believe.the most chilling moment in the movie is when allegra geller repeats her "scripted" line. it's at that point you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will in order to participate in a story. this is made even more frightening at the end when d'arcy nader (or rather his player) comments on the possibility of spending one's life in the game. i sympathize completely with the "realist" philosophy, that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the end goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence. living "in the game" is not living at all, but is a tempting way to spend one's time on earth. as allegra comments about the real world, "there's nothing going on here." might as well jack into someone else's imagination, and pretend to be doing something interesting. (although i have to ask whether cronenberg considers this a self-indictment, considering that he himself offers up worlds to be experienced in 90 minute snippets.)upon leaving the theater after first watching this movie, i thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended. but having seen it a couple more times (thank you scifi channel) i've realized how much deeper it goes. seriously, if you've only seen it once, it deserves another viewing.

this film is the most impressing turkish film that i have ever seen. probably "okul" is the first turkish horror film. i must say that i were excited while watching the movie because of some reasons, the first reason is that the story is impressive, i mean that at the end of the film you realised all the details about movie, this makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no turkish man made such a movie like that before. this shows that turkish film improves itself by time. although the first trial to make a horror movie, it was really successful. i advice all of you not to miss this movie...

i've watched the movie actually several times. and what i want to say about it is the only thing that made this movie high rank was the burak altay's incredible performance, absolutely nothing but that. not even those silly model named deniz akkaya and some of these popular names at times in the movie... burak is definitely very talented i've seen a few jobs he made and been through. even though this is kind of horror movie, he's doing really good job in comedy movies and also in dramas too. i bet most of you all saw asmali konak the movie and tv series, those two would go for an example... all i'm gonna say is you better watch out for the new works coming out from burak then you'll see.. keep the good work bro, much love..

okul is the first of its kind in turkish cinema, and it's way better than i expected. those people who say it's neither scary nor funny have a point, it's not all that great indeed. but it must be kept in mind that everyone involved with the movie is rather amateur, so it's basically a maiden voyage. and comparing this one to sinan çetin's other films such as the 1st class garbage "propaganda", this movie is pretty damn good.one thing that must be said: it deals with the highschool students' life in turkey very realistically! that's exactly how it goes! the scenes that are meant to scare are somewhat cheap, and hollywoodish. most of them even if not all. but that religion lesson scene made me laugh in tears, and emre kýnay performs the best acting of this flick as a religion teacher.it's not a waste of your time, go and watch it! you'll find it rather amusing especially if you know turkey enough to relate to turkish youngsters' school lives.

this movie coming from turkey where you can't find any tradition of horror movies. first i was afraid of watching just an adaptation but after seeing it i have changed my mind. it has original scenario.a love movie using horror thema. most of the players are not famous young people but their performance is proofing that a new generation is coming. maybe this is a sign that turkish cinema is coming back after 20 years.

a ghost story on a typical turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects. taylan biraderler(taylan brothers) had made their first shots on a tv-show a couple of years ago, as far as i know. that was kind of a turkish x-files, they had very nice stories but lacked on visual effects. this time it seems they had what they needed and used them well. this movie will make you laugh that's for sure, and as well it might have you scared. it has a nice plot and some young, bright actors in it. if you are a high school student in turkey you will find so many things about you here. there are many clues in the movie about its story and ending, some you understand at the moment, some will make sense afterwords, the dialogs were written very cleverly. so these make the movie one of the best turk movies made in the last years. do not forget, this movie is the first of its kind in the turkish film industry.

here's one of the more pleasingly scuzzy 70's blaxploitation grindhouse items; it's a pervasively low-rent pimp opus which comes across like a sleazier version of "the mack." john daniels, the studly womanizing hairdresser hero mr. jonathan in the immortal "black shampoo," gives an excellent steely portrayal of the baron, a ruthless, business savvy, forever on the make all-powerful flesh peddler who much to the dismay of his bitter, brutal italian rivals reigns supreme over the sunset strip. when not locking horns with his fellow no-count criminal pals or doing his best to avoid being busted by the local vice cops, daniels is leading a sweetly average existence as your standard garden-variety suburbanite dude (complete with caring wife and loving kids!) in some typically humdrum california small town.the glaringly absurd premise alone promises top-rate trashy greatness of a decidedly grade b schlock picture variety (george theakos deserves kudos for his hilariously ludicrous script). matt cimber's commendably tactless and tasteless direction delivers the junky goods by the slimy bucketful, thus making this film a hugely enjoyable serving of celluloid grime. among the assorted squalid delights to be savored herein are plentiful gratuitous female nudity, coarse dialogue, beautifully gaudy me decade threads (halter tops, felt hats, sparkling day-glo jewelry, loud seersucker suits), an intensely funky r&b score by smoke, some hopelessly pathetic acting (the little old lady who lives next door to daniels is excruciatingly shrill), a memorably nasty turn by patrick wright as a sadistic goon, a couple of cool action set pieces (the climactic slow motion barroom massacre seriously cooks), more lurid travelogue footage of the sunset strip than you can shake a feather boa at (said footage allegedly includes "the actual hookers and blades of the sunset strip in hollywood"), effectively dark'n'dingy cinematography by ken gibb, a few sicko sexual fetish tableaux, some raw explicit violence (a prostitute has one of her breasts cut off!), and amusing supporting performances by familiar schlock feature perennials richard kennedy and george "buck" flower as a pair of racist, corrupt, browbeating police detectives. sure, this movie ain't art, but it's certainly artless enough to qualify as a deliciously grungy chunk of entertainingly sordid cinematic swill.

what is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews i have read here, is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behaviour of gays in the era portrayed in the film. while courtenay's character is evidently gay, he is not the only one: the often talked about mr. davenport-scott is the other, and the reason that he is never seen, the reason alluded to that he has disappeared seems to be that he has been detained by the police for homosexual activity - a criminal offense in england at the time.we can read under the surface that this recent event has unsettled norman, courtenay's character: and we can also see in a passing remark by oxenby, the edward fox character, the quick renunciation of any connection to such a person when the law is involved: the fear of association affects many of the characters, and is part of the portrait the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it. the abandonment of courtenay at the end by sir has been anticipated all the way through, if this subtext is included: it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of his dresser from the list of those he gives thanks to. the flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of yearning and fear that courtenay has to 'step into the footlights', as he does when he makes the announcement about the imminent air raids, a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous, but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of the man's inner torment.so while the drama is of the decline of finney's sir, a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play comes from the 'fatal flaw' of courtenay's gayness, and makes this a film about him, as the title suggests.the art direction, pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time, more distant than the eighties and, in some ways, even than the second world war. the implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order, and the sympathy of the character racked and ruined by the cruelties of that order, of necessity trapped in the enclosed world of the theatre; and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be swept away after the war makes this film all the more poignant, for all its flaws.

i liked this movie, not because tom selleck was in it, but because it was a good story about baseball and it also had a semi-over dramatized view of some of the issues that a baseball player coming to the end of their time in major league sports must face. i also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in american and japanese baseball and the small facts on how the games are played differently.overall, it is a good movie to watch on cable tv or rent on a cold winter's night and watch about the "dog day's" of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away. a good movie for a baseball fan as well as a good "date" movie  trust me on that one! *wink*

i agree with the guy above, it is so funny i understand it all, but my friends just don't get it. go to japan and you will see a different movie after being there. when i met my girlfriends dad, at his home in kanagawa. i swear i felt the same as jack,. scared, but by the end of the day it was all good, so i give this movie a 10 out 10.i have watched it at least 30 times, taking it with me to watch on the plane flying to japan next month. one thing that is real good is the ball game scenes. makes me feel like i am there again. this is a must see if you have any interest in japan and baseball. too bad they don't make a sequel. does anyone know where the temple scenes were filmed and the argument with hirko in the walkway with a roof on it???? need to know so i can win an argumrnt with me japanese ex-wife. thanks

you have to have lived in japan for awhile to enjoy the beauty of this movie! i lived on okinawa for over 2 years, and northern honshu for 4. believe it or not, what you see paints a very good and accurate picture of contrasting east/west mentalities, both from a sports as well as personal relationships perspective. a funny, funny, and heartwarming movie that deserves better than americans viewing it can ever judge. 8+ out of 10!

anyone who appreciates fine acting and ringing dialogue will lovethis film. taken from ronald 'taking sides' harwood, it's a funnyand ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between twovery 'actorly' types. albert finney is sublime as the despoticshakespearean actor who barely notices the world war ragingaround him, so intent is he on the crumbling fortunes of his theatrecompany and his own psychological and emotional breakdown.tom courtenay is matchless as norman, the 'dresser' of the title,whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless.really a must see.

i loved the film "eddie monroe". the film had all the components that kept me interested while watching it. i especially loved the plot twists along the way and the surprising ending. craig morris has brad pitt potential both in looks and talent. his blue eyes reminded me of paul newman's. fred carpenter took this movie to a new level.i loved the cast. the music score, cinematography, talent, locations and script were awesome. i loved seeing some of my favorite actors in eddie monroe. fred carpenter is an incredibly talented and gifted director. he gives his work 200%. the film has great texture. i hope that there will be an eddie monroe 2. i would love to see how nicolette turns out after getting her windfall of money. fred carpenter's eddie monroe is hollywood level.

i viewed the movie for a second time on september 30, 2006 and thought that it was even better than the first time i saw it. i thoroughly enjoyed the acting, especially "uncle benny". i thought that fred carpenter did an excellent job of writing and directing this film. the story line definitely kept your interest and i hope this movie makes it all the way to the top. i felt it moved very smoothly between scenes and the surprise twist at the end, well, lets just say i didn't see it coming. i also thought that craig, the actor who played "eddie monroe" did an excellent job and i hope that this movie will help him to go further in his acting career. from start to finish, i thoroughly enjoyed it.

i was at a friends house for thanksgiving and watched a dvd of the movie, eddie monroe. i've been a fan of indie films for almost 20 years, (i loved the brothers mcmullen), and was impressed how good this movie is. my friend, who works at magno sound, told us that this movie was shot on super 16. the photography was so good, it looked as though it was a 35mm shoot. furthermore, the music combined with fred carpenter's direction, was art. the storyline was original and led up to an ending that surprised all of us watching...very cool. the acting by the entire cast was good, especially the actor who played, uncle benny. he was amazing. this film was a nice holiday treat, and i was delighted to be one of the first to view a movie that many will be seeing in the future.

as a long island independent film maker myself, and having have had two theatrical releases under my producing/directing belt i had always been told of how much i could learn by viewing a fred carpenter production so i was lucky enough to have his "eddie monroe" as my initiation to his superb budgeting, production, casting, settings and masterful directing talents. my heart went out to it's characters, it's story and was totally won over by the trick/switch ending that brought the film's plot to fruition! location's were marvelously chosen and human emotions in it's characters brought a realistic link to my bonding with all the elements that mr carpenter utilized throughout, to his and his film's benefit!

i found the movie very interesting. i really enjoyed the film the actors were great. it was entertainment. benny the uncle was wonderful he was real at his character. the ending took a wonderful twist. i would recommend you seeing it. eddie mores girlfriend reminded me a little of sandra bullock she was sharp as a nail. i also like the little girls acting in the movie she was very convincing. benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in brooklyn. i loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pot because thats how most people cook lol. i actually watched the movie 2 times and learned more the second time.

i've been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now. when a writer develops a story he always has a character/actor in mind to bring the story to life. last weekend i found a new one in paul vario playing uncle benny in eddie monroe. this was a slick film highlighted by vario's presence both on and off the screen (as his voice-over narration is also heard). i also especially liked the actress playing benny's niece and eddie's ex-wife, although everyone did a fine job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the double-crossing that goes with it. a nice job all around ... and mr. vario shined brightest. he's gotta be my tony gangi someday ...

"sir" has played lear over 200 times,but tonight he can't remember his opening lines.sitting at the mirror,his eyes reflect the king's madness. his dresser prompts him gently,mouthing the words.there is an air of desperation about both these men.the great actor knowing his powers are slipping away,his valet cum major domo cum conscience cum surrogate wife - aware of his boss's decline into madness and knowing he is powerless to do more than ease his passing. "the dresser" is really a love story between the two.over the years they have become mutually dependent on one another to the extent that neither can conceive a future without the other. set during the second world war,it concerns the fortunes of a frankly second - rate touring shakespearean company comprising an equal number of has - beens and wannabes led by "sir", a theatrical knight of what might kindly be called "the old school".whatever part he is playing he grabs centre - stage and bellows out over the footlights,bullying his audience into applause.but,somewhere inside him,buried most of the time deep beneath the ham he regularly dishes out,there still remains an occasional glitter of his earlier greatness.it is to catch a glimpse of this that his audiences fervently hope for. mr a.finney very cleverly concentrates on the ham,often to the point of caricature,and,just when you are ready to dismiss his performance as mere hyperbole and bluster he will produce a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that makes you realise that a great actor is playing a great actor. the same goes for mr t.courtenay.it's easy to write off his portrayalof norman as an exercise in stereotyping.here we have a middle - aged effeminate rather than camp theatrical dresser sashaying his way through life,enjoying the company of "the girls" and loving the wicked insider gossip rife in "the theatre".there were - and i strongly suspect still are - many men just like norman in the profession.infinitely kind and patient,knowing more about the plays than many of the actors,they run backstage with wisdom and affection.i believe the vast majority of them would hoot with approving laughter at mr courtenay's portrait. i saw "the dresser" on the london stage where,against the perceived wisdom,mr courtenay's "norman" was rather more subdued than in the movie."sir" was played by the great mr freddie jones to huge acclaim from the audience.it was a memorable performance that overshadowed mr courtenay's,reducing him rather to an "also - ran" as opposed to an actor on level - billing.the idea that "sir" and "norman" might be almost incomplete without each other went right out of the window. "norman" was reduced to being his puppet,which i'm not sure was what ronald harwood intended,but made for breathtaking theatre. messrs finney and courtenay redress the balance in the movie,restoring equality to the relationship. both men have come a long way since their early appearances in the british "new wave" pictures when they became the darlings of the vaguely leftish,"middle - class and ashamed of it" movement.when the british cinema virtually committed hari - kiri in the 1970s they quietly concentrated on the theatre apart from a few roles to keep the wolf from the door.with the renaissance of more substantial movies,they re - appeared,blinking in the unaccustomed bright light."the dresser" marked their return,still fizzing with energy and talent, shouting to the world at large "we're still here".it's not a big movie but is assuredly a great one.

this is a movie that deserves another look--if you haven't seen it for a while, or a first look--if you were too young when it came out (1983). based on a play by the same name, it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring shakespearean repertory company in england during world war ii. it deals with his stress of trying to perform a shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors--the young, able bodied ones being taken for military service. it also deals with his relationship with various members of his company, especially with his dresser. so far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth. while tragic overall, the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout. the two male leads both received oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so. i strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama, theater--especially shakespeare, or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity. the backstage goings-on make up another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers.

alejandro (alejandro polanco), called ale for short, works at an auto-body repair shop in what has come to be known as the iron triangle, a deteriorating twenty block stretch of auto junk yards and sleazy car repair dealers close to shea stadium in queens, new york. here customers do not question whether or not parts come from stolen cars or why they are able to receive such large discounts, they simply put down their cash and hope that everything is on the up and up. sleazy outskirts like these are not highlighted in the tour guides but iranian-american director ramin bahrani puts them on vivid display in chop shop, a powerful indie film that received much affection last year at cannes, berlin, and toronto. a follow up to his acclaimed "man push cart", bahrani spent one and a half years in the location that f. scott fitzgerald described as in the great gatsby as "the valley of the ashes".for all its depiction of bleakness, chop shop is not a work of social criticism but, like hector babenco's pixote, a poignant character study in which a young boy's survival is bought at the price of his innocence. shot on location at willets point in queens, bahrani makes you feel as if you are there, sweating in a hot and humid new york summer with all of its noise and chaos. the film's focus is on the charming, street-smart 12-year-old ale who lives on the edge without any adult support or supervision other than his boss (rob sowulski), the real-life proprietor of the iron triangle garage. polanco's performance is raw and slightly ragged yet he fully earned the standing ovation he received at the film's premiere at cannes along with a hug from great iranian director abbas kiarostami.cramped into a tiny room above the garage together with his 16-year-old sister isamar (isamar gonzales) who works dispensing food from a lunch wagon, ale is like one of the interchangeable spare parts he deals with. while he has dreams of owning his own food-service van, in the city that never sleeps, he knows that the only thing that may make the "top of the heap" is another dented fender. in this environment, ale and isi use any means necessary to keep their heads above water while their love for each other remains constant and they still laugh and act out the childhood that was never theirs. as barack obama says in his book "dreams from my father", the change may come later when their eyes stop laughing and they have shut off something inside. in the meantime, ale supplements his earnings by selling candy bars in the crowded new york subways with his friend carlos (carlos zapata) and pushing bootleg dvds on the street corners, while isi does tricks for the truck drivers to save enough money to buy the rusted $4500 van in which they hope to start their own business.though ale is a "good boy", he is not above stealing purses and hubcaps in the shea stadium parking lot, events that bahrani's camera observes without judgment. in chop shop, bahrani has provided a compelling antidote to the underdog success stories churned out by the hollywood dream factory, and has given us a film of stunning naturalism and respect for its characters, similar in many ways to the great italian neo-realist films and the recent iranian works of kiarostami, panahi, and others. while the outcome of the characters is far from certain, bahrani makes sure that we notice a giant billboard at shea stadium that reads, "make dreams happen", leaving us with the hint that, in rumi's phrase, "the drum of the realization of that promise is beating,"

i really think this movie deserves some oscars! i really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from samuel l. jackson, and mainly by christina ricci!! i'm a big fan of hers, right since i saw her in addams family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! i love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...i think she is...and i love her eyes)!! the movie is about many things...people say that is religious...people say that it's about racism...people say that is about drugs...people say that is about nymphomania...well...maybe is a little bit of all that!! but what i truly feel is that this movie has a high level of eye opening for what blues is...what it stands for...and mainly were it comes from: life...heart...pain...sorrow...and above all...spontaneous feelings!! i hope you get to see it...if you are that kind of person that likes a movie not only from the pictures or the story it tells...this is a good movie to see...if your not...well...see it anyway...cant hurt that much, and you get to see christina ricci acting so horny!! she's a fox!!

i was surprised by how great black snake moan turned out to be.being a fan of christina ricci and samuel l. jackson id figure id give this a try.well when this was over i was just left stunned by how great this film truly was.i mean everything was dead-on great and very accurate for that matter.this film shows how the great director and writer craig brewer(who made hustle & flow another great film) can just take anything even something that seems ludacras and make it into this.well, i like how it is just a good time, like its a film that just makes it there own in a good way.also i love that it doesn't show big steroeypes of the south and how its been portrayed in things as the most repulsive place to be, but not this film it makes very accurate and because of that very reconisable.the cating in this was just phenomenal especially from christina ricci(who deserves an oscar for this role), the always great samuel l. jackson, and even justin timberlake did a great job as well.overall almost everything is great about this, and while its not everyones type of film its definitely worth a viewing from anyone who can enjoy a good time. three cheers for black snake moan!!!!9.3 out of 10 stars

(my synopsis) rae (christina ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with ronnie (justin timberlake) to fulfill her needs. ronnie must report to his national guard unit and leaves rae all alone. rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. after a party, rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. the next day, lazarus (samuel l. jackson) finds rae and carries her home. lazarus gives medical care to rae, and believes that he can also save her from herself. rae is like a dog in heat so lazarus puts a 40 pound chain around her and his radiator to keep her from going out looking for men. lazarus has problems of his own, because his wife has just left him for another man. lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain.(my comment) the movie has a deep meaning to it once you get past the sex and violence. the film has a different feel to it. the story is raw and almost puts you in the movie as if you were there. the 40 pound chain is a good metaphor, and symbolic of a chastity belt. you don't give love away to anyone, but you keep it for your true love. the chain could also be a parallel to a wife who is chained to the kitchen, yet rae didn't cook. rae only wanted to have sex all the time whereas a wife may not. i think craig brewer (writer & director) has made an extraordinary movie, and samuel l. jackson sings a mean blues song. the story is emotionally charged, tackling the subjects of race, religion, music, and sex all into one. (paramount classics, run time 1:56, rated r)(8/10)

in mississippi, the former blues man lazarus (samuel l. jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. he finds the town slut and nymphomaniac rae (chritina ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. when her boyfriend ronnie (justin timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of lazarus and rae, and tries to kill him."black snake moan" is a weird tale of faith, hope, love and blues. the gifted christina ricci has an impressive performance in the role of a young tramp abused since her childhood by her father and having had sex with the whole town where she lives. it is amazing the versatility of this actress, and probably this is the most mature work that i have seen christina ricci perform. samuel l. jackson has also a fantastic performance in the role of lazarus. the soundtrack is one of the most beautiful i have ever heard in a movie, with wonderful blues. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "entre o céu e o inferno" ("between the heaven and the hell")

craig brewer grew up in tennessee, it is evident in his movie. forget the black guy on white girl action. it happens, but it isn't samuel l. jackson on christina ricci. more importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this tennessee town. how they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. while shrinks make millions in the cities of the north, midwest and west coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator. it is a interesting concept and one that may not settle well with everyone.brewer shows us the region he grew up in. yes it is still tainted with racial problems, though worse problems exist in many metropolitan cities. this is in the subtext and not the main plot of the story. people live a more simple lifestyle, yet life is still complex and excruciating.jackson and ricci do a fantastic job in this film. jackson the aging-former blues guitarist who eeks out a living on his small farm. his wife of 12 years leaves him for his brother, so he spirals into depression. meanwhile ricci and justin timberlake have a last wild sexually charged night before he ships off to the army. ricci suffers from a childhood of sexual abuse, though that isn't revealed until later, her torment can only be quenched by sexual forays with various boys (black and white) in the town.when ricci is beat up and left for dead on the road near jacksons farm, he finds her and nurses her back to health. he believes it is divine intervention that this half-naked white girl is left in his care. he clutches his bible and prays for guidance. he refuses her sexual advances and instead treats her with dignity, respect and care. something few men in her life have ever done.she in time sees jackson as a man of honor and morals, yet he also carries his own pain. he plays his guitar and sings to her. yes it's the blues and damn good too, with the minister counseling her, she slowly understands how to deal with her childhood sexual abuse. jackson, through ricci's transformation, realizes he must let his own pain heal.justin timberlake comes back, discharged due to "anxiety problems". as he searches for ricci, who has been living with jackson during her recovery, he finds out she has been promiscuous and unfaithful to him.he finds her and jackson at a bar, where jackson has decided (as part of his healing process) to come out retirement and play the blues again. timberlake follows them home and confronts jackson and ricci.you will have to see the movie to get the rest of the story. should you decide to see this film, remember to look at it from the aspect of a foreign or independent movie. it is a slice of life, from a particular region of america that few of us get to see. it is interesting and revealing. it also shows us that regardless of the color of our skin, we all have similar problems that can be fixed with similar solutions.

i watched love life on holiday, when it was filmed at a film festival in florida. it was a lovely surprise to find a british film that wasn't derivative or exploitive. a beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film. the transitions between scenes i found a bit distracting, but as whole i think love life is a winner, a ruby in the dust. one for all the family. a pleasant change to see a british film for teen audiences that isn't littered with four letter words. try and see it.

this film has its detractors, and courtney's fey dresser may offend some folks (who, frankly, need a good smack upside the head) -- but the film is top notch in every way: engaging, poignant, relevant. finney, naturally, is larger than life. courtney makes an ideal foil. i thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads, and courtney's character provides plenty of dark humor. the period is well captured, the supporting cast well chosen. this is to be seen and savored like a fine cordial. i only wish it were out on dvd already...(*sigh*)...

wow! why aren't more british movies like this. great rights of passage money with a big heart and some stand out performances. the comedy is quirky and original and the kid is really great. one to hunt down and watch. look out for it! ten out of ten.

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart. it is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent. nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.

it's just one of those films, you're either love it or hate it, my girlfriend and me loved it, told my brother to rent it and he hated it, said it was too flashy and colloquial, then again he only usually goes to see big action movies, so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed. there were some great new talent (i'd never heard of the leads before anyway)? des brady (the directors brother?) was especially good. playing a right dick at the start i thought he never would redeem himself but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and by the end i was really routing for him. a very surprising film with a whole lot of heart, if you can live without a body count and explosions then this one is very original. yashimo. brixton in the uk.

me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a friday night before going to the pub. it was the only programme that ever made us miss opening time. it is one of the best comedies i have ever watched if not the best. david jason was brilliant and was compared many times to buster keaton with his clever stunts that were pulled off so believably. i wish i could get hold of the series on dvd to watch again. he had an amazing ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions. he is an accomplished "trip and fall guy" and i remember watching a trailer once where he showed people how to do this professionally. certainly he is the one to teach people this art. he only showed glimpses of it in other programs he did. pshaw, this program shows how multi talented he is. i am lost as to why david jason vetoed another series being made, as for my mind it was one of the best things he has ever done and i've been a fan of his since he did this series. it is said he did not like it because it showed the rawness of his early career. well to my mind, that might possibly have been the right decision when he took it, but now his career has progressed so far, i believe this would be a good time for him to do another series showing him looking back on his "secret life" full of blunders that he does not see. rod

jacqueline hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is. everyone out there will like it! sandwiched between the amount of breast shots, the times jacqueline rubs herself, the various times jackie spends chatting to herself and the times spent heaving in the magdelena mountains, this could create one hell of a dishwasher if your career were to end.unlike most horror movies that take place in space or in some restless tranquility with ripe green apples, this one takes awhile to guzzle. the performing is good. other than great acting by dan the pizza delivery guy (must see), there are no standouts, but no notably bad outcroppings from my recent dinner either (and i do mean recent). excellent acting overall because there are no typically dreadful actors which you'd find in movies of the four "skin" related data fields or in the biological skimmer's found in any ibm shop. in addition if you see a female in this movie, the likelihood is that she will be butt naked by the next scene! now that i think about it, there is quite a bit of action in this movie. between the first and the second electro yank obtained from a hot chick and the time you observe her "buckets naked", keeps em' speculating. i loved it!

see no evil with kane. the movie has a great storyline but it just wasn't a hide my eye's, scream out loud horror flick i thought it was going to be from watching the wwe superstars on monday night raw when the movie first came to theaters. i did enjoy the movie though i loved the story it played out.great movie excellent would like to see a part 2 it doesn't matter if kane gets killed at the endor not they have killed off other horror stars in every movie they have out and they still comeback for more so a part 2 wouldbe very interesting.

anyone who critiques 'jacqueline hyde' as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it's intended to be is just not playing with a full deck. just from the title, it's obvious that this low budget horror comedy isn't meant to be taken seriously... it's as tongue in cheek as a nympho's french kiss, and just as titillating. the female cast members are all great and fun to watch. check this out, rolfe kanefsky is the clown-prince of soft-core horror. unlike most soft-core horror flicks, this one is entertaining all the way through with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses. the movie doesn't even attempt to follow the storyline of the robert louis stevenson classic, but instead seeks out every way possible to create risqué sight gags and erotic situations. blythe metz, the brunette femme fatale who portrays the sexier, homicidal side of jacqueline, is a real knockout. watch and enjoy!

kane is a killer named jacob goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. most of them die except for 3 of them. in my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. i still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. the best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the blonde girl's mouth. kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change. that was his only look the entire movie. great action and killing scenes, i don't think i could give it a full 10 out of 10, but 6 seems good.

there's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing god's work. yeah right! this killer makes jason voorhes look like a chump, and freddy krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. he is jacob goodnight(wwe's glen "kane" jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a axe, and a hook and chain. those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. that is totally methodical! when the encounter happened 4 years earlier, jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head. how on earth did goodnight survive after 4 years? now he's in the condemned hotel called blackwell. and this hotel got a lot of stories to tell. i thought this movie was haunting as well as interesting. i liked the part where goodnight checked out one of the girl's tattoo on her back. and goodnight himself is really deranged thanks to his maniacal mother. if you think friday the 13th was something, you better think again. this movie will leave you on the edge of you seat. and i think the eyeball rip was bone-chilling. this movie proves it point,and it wasn't a waste of my time. i enjoyed it. the title don't lie! rating 2.5 out of 5 stars!

finally a true horror movie. this is the first time in years that i had to cover my eyes. i am a horror buff and i recommend this movie but it is quite gory. i am not a big wrestling fan but kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. i have to admit that i didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad i did. during and after the movie i was looking over my shoulder. i have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough. i think that is why this movie is getting some good reviews. it is a refreshing change and takes you back to the texas chainsaw ( first one), michael myers, and jason. and no cgi crap.

this horror movie is definitely one of the best ones i have seen in my life and there are many reasons why. the storyline is really good it has lots of action and great horror sequences in it the actors are not very good but there are not that bad but kane is definitely the best actor in this but he was always a good actor also the cast is very good such as kane as jacob goodnight, christina vidal as christine, michael j. pagan as tye, samantha noble as kira etc. also i just have to warn you that the killing scenes are very disturbing but they are very creative but that just makes it better and you can't have a horror movie without blood and gore also they look very realistic. so i am sure that you will not be disappointed with see no evil because it is a really good movie. so make sure that you rent or buy see no evil because it is just so great.overall score: ********** out of ********** ***** out of *****

see no evil is the first film from wwe films. yes wwe, word wrestling entertainment, pro wrestling. of course being that it's a wwe film a wrestler has to star in it, the wrestler being glenn jacobs aka kane. which is not really important as if you didn't know kane or what wwe stood for you would never know it had anything to do with the wild word of wrestling, as the movie has nothing to do with wrestling. see no evil is gross out horror film, it has some moments were the some people may jump but for the most part it's just saying, hey look how gross we can get! not that there is anything wrong with that. jacob goodnight (played by kane) is sort of a jason type character, his mother tortured him as a kid with strict (understatement) christian beliefs and has warped his mind. now he's a big scary chopping killing machine. 90% of the movie takes place in an abandon hotel where jacob stalks six teenagers (surprised?) and a handful of adults. i could explain why they are in a creepy old hotel but eh, who cares? despite it's lack of originality see no evil is well made, for what it's supposed to be. kane plays an awesome killer and needs little make up to be scary. one flaw in the movie is the most annoying possibility people survive, i really looking forward to having them being horribly killed, but alas, does not happen. i wish the film didn't have the stigma of wrestling attached to it, although like i said the film has nothing to with wrestling, people are still closed minded enough not to want to see it because, given of course if they are a wrestling hater. then again the movie may also make money because wrestling fans will want to see it. either way, see no evil has top notch effects and little cgi, and like i said, it's quite brutal so like i say it's good stuff....if you like that sort of thing.

well, i'm a few days late but what the hell....! anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to "see no evil" was....surprise. the film is actually pretty good. there is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. it hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. think "madman" meets leatherface with a dash of norman bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick. while sne is thin on plot (most horror films are), it kind of makes up for it in the violence/methods of killing, the gore, suspense & the fact that kane does a great job of playing the highly disturbed jacob goodnight. the title of the film comes from the fact that jacob plucks out the eyes of his victims using just his fingers & stores them in big jars. why?? you'll just have to watch it & see (pun intended). there are certain cinematic elements lifted from other horror films most notably psycho, tcm, & madman but they're not blatant. finally, sne really doesn't go into territory we long timers haven't seen before & granted, sne is no "pyscho" or "tcm 74" but it certainly merits a look imo. bloodstone's recommendation: take in a matinée showing of "see no evil" bloodstone's rating: 7.5/10

a dangerous psychopathic killer jacob goodnight is holed up in the abandoned and rotting blackwell hotel,alone with his nightmares until eight teenage delinquents show up for community service duty along with the cop who wounded jacob four years ago.when one of their own is kidnapped by the killer and her fate uncertain,the remaining petty criminals must fight for their lives..."see no evil" was directed by the porno filmmaker gregory dark and it stars wwe superstar kane as remorseless psychopath.the supporting cast is terrible and there are no surprises to be found here,but there is enough extreme violence and gore for slasher fans to enjoy.overall,i liked this film and you should too,if you are into mindless slasher flicks.sure,it's cliché,but who cares.7 out of 10.

so the wwe has done it. they have poured over into film;their first one being see no evil, starring their very own kane. i caught this movie and went in not expecting it to be a great film...it just seemed to cliché and looked like nothing new. to my surprise it actually wasn't half bad. a viewer stated above that it is good b-horror movie fun, and honestly thats the best way to describe it. now the question i was asking myself was how was kane going to hold up...well let's just say he made an absolute bad ass out of the 'jacob goodnight' character. he sold the role really well, and really did look menacing. but what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs around 320 in solid muscle. the acting was decent, and the story was nothing new of course, but we all know that. the directing as well as the cinematography was done very well and the hotel backdrop really looked dilapidated and well done. considering this was directed by a porn movie director, i was quite surprised. i'd recommend this movie if you're looking for mindless gore and killing and just some overall fun. think of this movie as a modern day latter friday the 13th film. and save room for the ending too, cuz it's a good one. and stick around after the credits too...

i was expecting this movie to suck, but what i got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. the teens are decent, with penny mcnamee definitely the best of the bunch. rachael taylor looks like a young christie brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. i saw the "twist" coming from miles away, but i still enjoyed the movie.but what really stood out to me was the direction. gregory dark might actually have a career in legit film ahead of him. aside from overusing the horror film "speed cam"(you know, where like the guy's face shakes all fast?), there's some good shots here. the camera angles and environments really emphasize kane's size, making him look even bigger than he actually is.if you're looking for deep story or characters, this ain't it. but that's not what slasher films are about. if you're looking for some good violence, or if you're into gory films, go check this out!

this, ladies and gentlemen, is truly a modern b-movie. the dialog is stilted and delivered with wooden rigidity, the premise is predictable (there are a few decent twists) and characters remain 2d for most of it. and yet there is a certain...charm. wwe wrestler kane brings to life the sick, twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos (though it is somewhat like his character that he's been playing around ten years) and so i'll find it quite amusing when people say it's "not much of a reach for him," but glen jacobs is, apparently, quite the nice guy, so actually it is. in any event, he's cast perfectly as the hulking brute and the deaths are suitably over the top (jason would be proud), but i heard at least four applause breaks for four different kills scenes. frankly go into this movie thinking that you'll have some fun and a gorefest, oh it is quite the gorefest. the r-rating is richly deserved and i actually got a little nauseous during some of the more graphic times. in any event, a very, very fun, but fairly bad, movie.

one thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun/exciting for the cast and crew; i could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm & dedication because they apparently liked the people involved. i tend to like b movies that are original and have heart, and i think this is one such work. the actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual, maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress/director, and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent, watchable piece of art. the critiques of this film that more or less say, "why not just rent a hardcore porn movie," make the point as to why they didn't like the film. going to this film hoping for a lot of t&a without patience for the material of the plot is why it is so unenjoyable for them. one could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie, even though i take it the star has done her share of soft porn. i think she graduated. in terms of the writing, the dialog is not a huge part of the movie, like in a tarentino film, but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun. particularly the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure, with the villianess/heroine and the "leading man" learning from their complex web of feelings. i understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this. hats off for proving a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride. gabriella and the other girls with scenes of nudity were likable along with being hot, not just airhead bimbos, so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art, even with the limits of b-movie land, not disappointing.

the problem with other actors cast in the rôle of dorian gray is that they either looked too old for the part (hurd hatfield, helmut berger, josh duhamel, david gallagher, ben barnes) or that they were unable to pull off the english aristocratic manner without being stilted. dorian is the perpetual 19-year-old (or so), all milky skin and honey'd locks, as described by wilde, so the challenge is finding an actor that has the maturity and range for the part (i.e., who can portray the naivité, callousness, and manipulativeness), but at the same time looks like someone in his late teens. and peter firth pulls it all off in this excellent british tv adaptation.gielgud as henry wotton, while considerably older than what wilde had in mind, does wonders with his scenes--wilde's aphorisms have never sounded so natural and unforced. especially george sanders in the 1945 version was pretty feeble by comparison (and his costume didn't fit).finally, jeremy bratt plays basil as the most masculine and at the same time the most gay of the trio, again a fitting interpretation. in general, the film includes enough gay subtext without turning dorian himself gay--he's all things to all people and supposedly there's no drug or sexual perversion he hasn't tried in the 18 years covered by the story, but that makes him more narcist than homosexual. he seems to equally wreak havoc on both sexes here, as he should according to the novel.of course the budget of this production was not very large, so everything feels a little stagey. particularly dorian's encounter with sybil's brother suffers from the obvious studio look. also, the final shot of dorian (a puppet i suppose) in his white toad-like make-up is more hilarious than convincing and basil's death scene is inadvertently funny. (also, as far as i recall, basil should have been killed seated at the table.)but all in all, this is a very worthy adaptation. i'm sure wilde would have liked it. the only thing missing is the sensual side. not so much sex scenes, but wilde's decadent world of fragrant flowers, luxurious cloths, and precious gems isn't really explored here, i.e. the aestheticism is completely missing. but like "i, claudius", the excellent acting makes one easily forget these shortcomings of production values.

playwright john osborne's (look back in anger, the entertainer) dramatisation of oscar wilde's only novel positively revels in the homosexual subtext of the original, perhaps too much so. nonetheless, the dialogue, the acting, with a cast headed by sir john gielgud & jeremy brett, and the brilliantly cerebral production (marred only by a "too quick" ending) make this worth the while of any lover of theater, with a capital "t".

i will always think of mr. firth as dorian gray, if i live to be 100.perfectly acted and directed, bringing oscar wilde's insight, wit and humor alive with an absolute and utter perfection unusual in television.more proof that the bbc more than makes up in talent what it doesn't always have in money.a must have for all wilde fans-and indeed for everyone else. inspired and perfected, every one of the actors looked exactly right for the role and every shot was well done.by the end i found that i loved every single character in a way that no other movie of the type had ever inspired. watch it, then try to watch another version. it's just not the same, is it?

i enjoyed this film and after it finished it still makes you think about it. i believe jeremy brett is brilliant in this role although his "death" acting was a little over the top, but as its jeremy brett i didn't mind.this is a good piece of drama and does follow oscar wildes novel very closely. if you enjoy this film then i recommend you also watch "an ideal husband" with jeremy brett as lord goring.this film gives a great insight into oscar wildes way of thinking.and while watching it the viewer is reminded of how in a way dorian grey is lord alfred 'bosie' douglas and basil halward is oscar wilde.

in dramatising wilde's novel, john osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown dorian's essential wickedness. if you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. wilde and robert louis stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. this story really treats of a theme similar to stevenson's "dr. jekyll and mr. hyde", but note that wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas rls took the scientific route. both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil, with evil winning in the end.the actors in this bbc movie, take a different route, too, from those in the 1945 film. john gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical quips as george sanders, in his role really projecting wilde himself, but with a subtle difference. you'll suspect that sanders really believed what he was saying, but gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes. peter firth, too, shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion, but then we don't get to see as many of his escapades as hurd hatfield had a chance to display.it's a very good production, with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel, if not all of its ramifications.

onstage john osborne's adaptation of "picture of dorian gray" is a fine tribute to oscar wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.on screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between basil and henry showing that time has passed.)the acting however is brilliant. sir john gielgud return's to his wilde roots as lord henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella. jeremy brett is also strong,offering a touching portrait of the anguished artist basil hallward.peter firth,while not originally my vision of dorian, handles the role with style and grace...and later with a convincing strain of cruelty. the supporting cast is equally fine, gielgud's former 'importance of being earnest" co-star gwen francon-davies plays his philanthropic aunt agatha with dignity and judi bowker makes a touching sybil vane. the wit,pathos and tension of wilde's work have been remarkably transferred to the screen. my only other qualm is with the hair styles. many of them seemed out of place,looking more like 1970's versions of victorian hairdos rather than the actual style. overall however,the acting and writing elevates this production to a high level of small screen excellence.

this is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. lee, lifeson, and peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. that being said, i think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. this is not the fault of the boys however. they even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. they just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption. neil's snare sounds distant and geddy's bass has good harmonic content, but no bottom end at all!! they should have held out on this concert and waited for a better occasion. only buy this dvd if you are a hardcore rushian. the quality is lacking in the audio department.

admittedly alex has become a little podgey, but they are still (for me) the greatest rock trio, ever. i wholeheartedly recommend this dvd to any fan.i was very disappointed that they canceled their planned recent munich gig (logistics) and regret not making an effort to see them elsewhere. the dvd is a small consolation - the greatest incentive to acquire a proper dvd playback setup.naive perhaps, but i still don't understand the significance of the tumble-driers on-stage; i would be grateful for any clarification.cheers, iain.

after searching for 6 months, i finally found this dvd. all i can say is it was damn well worth the wait! "rush in rio" may very well be the greatest rock dvd in existence. i'm not joking. it's incredible! all the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. i find it makes you feel like you're actually in rio watching the concert from the audience. that's one of the reasons i love this dvd. it makes you feel like you're actually there. also, geddy, alex and neil have never been in better form! geddy's vocals are flawless, alex's guitar playing is still incredible, and neil - absolutely no words to say. the camera work on this concert was very good i must say. they gave us a good look at everything that was going on on-stage, and in the audience. kudos to the cameramen! anyways, enough of my raving! go watch "rush in rio" for yourself. you will be amazed. i guarantee it.10/10

these guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. the musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where rush exists. future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. get this dvd and you will enjoy it throughly!! i was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in houston, tx and was blown away. i have not missed a show since power windows and i have to say that they are better than ever. everyone should embrace these guys and teach others what real musicianship is! there will never be such a tight and well put together trio again in our lifetime. lets just hope and pray that they do not retire anytime soon!

i have to admit that i had low expectations for this movie. but i was surprised to find it entertaining, interesting, and funny. it's an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror film. there were moments that made my hairs stand up! even better, though, were the highly amusing, occasionally hysterical, comedic moments in the film (you'll know which ones i'm talking about). there also are a few great special effects (and the humor and the special effects aren't necessarily separate).the acting, on the whole, is very good--way better than a typical low budget horror film. the lead (jackie), in particular, and many of the smaller, supporting roles (like the lawyer, the couple living next door, the pizza man) are well acted. if they hadn't been, the film wouldn't have kept my interest and i would have lost my belief in the story. this is a good, interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth a rental!

rush in rio is simply an amazing dvd. this concert is one of the peak moments of the history of rush and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever.i was lucky enough to actually be in this concert, and not only that, i was in the very first row grabbing the gate that separated the audience from the stage!! it's the first and only time i've seen a rush concert live and it was a dream come true for me. i have no words to accurately describe this experience but i can tell you it is one of the highlights of my life.some people complain about the sound of this dvd saying it is not very clear and polished, but the sound you listen is real, true to how it was in the concert. it is raw and powerful and so authentic that every time i watch it i go back and re-live that beautiful moment. many artists record live shows and then they make a lot of tweaking, so the final product is far from what the actual concert really was. sure you can achieve a very sophisticated and polished sound this way but you don't get the real thing. this is not the case with rush in rio, this is the real deal!! i admit that i enjoy those fancy sounding concert dvd's, i love music and the sound is a very important aspect, but it's refreshing to listen to a concert that is so honest. you listen to rush just the way they sound in a live performance, no tricks, no tweaks. this is a real live concert dvd.i highly recommend rush in rio, the set-list is fantastic and the performances by geddy, alex and neil are mind-blowing. not to mention the crowd, you can see how much they love rush and sing along to every tune, even yyz which is an instrumental!! i actually appear singing twice; in tom sawyer i sing "always hopeful yet discontent" and in earthshine i sing "only reflect". it's just a few seconds but i simply couldn't believe my eyes when i saw myself in a rush dvd!! awesome!! i hope you enjoy this magnificent concert from the greatest band on earth.

i purchased this dvd recently and i was totally awed that rush's songs sound the same as they did when i first listened to them in 1980. the lineup of geddy lee, alex lifeson and neil peart is so talented that i want to listed to them play again and again.songs i remember like tom sawyer, xyz, the big money, the trees, freewill, closer to the heart, 2112, limelight, and the spirit of radio were played and the 40000 plus fans there singing along and having a great time and i swear over half the audience was under 25!writers who put down rush as far as rush fans like myself are concerned are a bunch of jealous dunderheads who like to taste rancid sour cream mixed with lemonade in a taco.rush doesn't put on makeup, wear spikes, lip sync,wear lipstick, get in trouble with the law, and have a band member brag about how long they have been unmarried. all they do is entertain!i give this dvd a 100 out of 100.

having seen rush live, i'm able to appreciate the awesomeness of this. others may complain of sound problems, but it's sometimes over dubbed by the overwhelming screams of 60,000 brazilians and it goes to show the band's territorial gain of attention

"rush in rio" is, no doubt, one of the most exciting dvds i have purchased. although i am a biased rush fan of almost 20 years, i found this performance to be flawless. the music is heavy and sharp (which sounds great on any surround sound system), the band is energetic, the crowd has a constant smile... it's like they were able to capture every concert i've been to. for any rush fan, this dvd is a must; if anything, just to see the "boys in brazil" documentary (which reveals the travels of this rather isolated, personal band). for any non-rush fan, this dvd is an enjoyable concert. rush fans know the talent of these three canadians. we have rather firmly stood by them for years. i've shown this dvd (or portions of it, anyway) to those who have never heard of rush, or those who think rush is less than good because they do not appeal to the pessimistic masses of rock (i.e., sex, drugs, and a drunken frenzy). the bottom line is this dvd is worth every penny and more than worth the time to view it.

i have been a "huge" rush fan ever since "moving pictures" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why rush is so popular. they completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. a real example of this is during "yyz" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. they really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful "lust" that rarely happens anymore. you get the best seat in the house for one of their best concerts given. the second dvd is a fascinating documentary of the band while they are in brazil and shows you a lot of the backstage things going on and it allows you to see them not just a musicians but as actual people in their everyday life. this dvd gift set is a must for any rush fan young and old and is definitely a keeper for your dvd collection. their is even a cd of the concert for those who just want to listen to the music. this dvd is worth it!

a long overdue concert release, rush-in-rio dvd is both compelling and disappointing. this slick two-disc set shows rush at their finest. after 30 years of honing their unique sound, it's great to have this record of one of the most talented rock bands ever.the concert features over two dozen songs, a documentary, and three songs that feature multi-angle viewing. packaged in a bi-fold holder with sleeve and a small insert, it's priced very well for the amount of material it contains.i'm a rush fan of the late seventies to early eighties period, and this dvd comes through big, with half of the show highlighting songs from that era. i won't list the songs, in case you want to be surprised. if you attended the vapor trails tour, then you'll know what they'll be playing.playing in rio to their biggest crowd ever, rush is a huge crowd pleaser here. in fact, that was one of the first things i noticed that was peculiar about this show. throughout most of this two hour concert, you hear and see the crowd, actively chanting and dancing wildly to the music. at first, it's heartening to see the fans give rush a well deserved response. but after several songs, i was ready to hear and see more of the band and less of the crowd. this is in no way a slam of the crowd of rio. more power to them! it's a critique of the final editing of the dvd.which brings me to my second and main reason "i hate it". the video editing is terrible in my opinion. save for the multi-angle view bonus cuts, the entire show is a frenzy of visual chaos. it's like the director wanted to see how spastic he could make it. i count changing camera angles, on average, between every one and four seconds, constantly! after about three or four songs, my head and eyes were ready for a break. which is too bad, because i would have liked to have sat through the whole show, like i was able to at the concert last year. maybe this fast-cut editing is the latest craze for concert dvd's, but i really think it's an annoyance and detraction from the overall experience. as stated before, i wouldn't mind it for a song or two, but the whole visual aspect of this disc is hurried, or rushed. it's really ironic, because all the previous concert clips i've seen of rush, mainly from moving pictures, are strictly straight-filmed, with little switching back and forth. it's almost boring, visually speaking. this dvd has taken it to the other extreme. i know a lot of dyed-in-the-wool rush fans will vehemently disagree with my statements, but that's just my impression of it.the bottom line: if you're a rush fan, you'll buy this dvd regardless of my review, or any other. i still would have bought it after i had read my review. just don't get expect a "normal" concert. who knows, the things mentioned above might not bother you.

this much anticipated dvd memento of rush's visit to south america in 2002 is possibly the finest rock video ever set down on disc.the picture and sound production values are amazing,even more so as they constantly battled the elements to bring this production off. all the tracks you would expect from the rush catalogue are here from tom sawyer to the pass gloriously reproduced for the frankly,orgiastic brazilian crowd.they actually singalong to yyz-which is an instrumental, and gives you an indication of their fervour!the first disc is the concert and the second disc contains 3 multi angle set-pieces -la villa strangiato,yyz and the awesome drum solo, plus a 30 minute documentary about the bands visit to brazil. all in all this is a triumph and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy.

this dvd will be treated with indifference by mllions of classic rock music devotees across the world because rush just aren't cool. it is a shame that rush have had to overcome sneering disdain from the majority of north american and british music journalists over their thirty odd year history as this has deprived many people the chance to get into a real band.each of the last four decades are well represented here and what a catalogue of songs it is! we have the seminal "2112", the magical "the trees" and the lyrical "tom sawyer" interspersed with the high-energy, genre-challenging pieces from their latest album "vapor trails." the musicianship is almost flawless, the stage show is spectacular and the brazilian fans are just plain crazy (at one point they sing along to an instrumental!)each band member plays at a level that defies belief-real craftsmen performing art.if you doubt this try out the instrumentals "la villa strangiato" or "the rhythm method" for size-and yes the latter is a drum solo (which has to be seen to be believed.)sound and vision production values are very high as befits the rush experience and you also get a documentary and multi-angled set pieces to boot.this is an astonishing performance and tribute to the canadian rockers and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy.

breathtaking at it's best, intriguing at it's worst, francis ford coppala's groundbreaking epic 'apocalypse now' is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century, and in my opinion, the greatest ever film depiction centered around america's involvement in vietnam.what i like most about 'apocalypse now' is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre. growing up as movie buff, and with a particular interest in war films, i've seen many films, which have attempted to portray the 'images' and 'feelings' of vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so. films such as 'hamburger hill' and 'we were soldiers' fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of vietnam by depicting 'heroic battles' which are, more often than not, tainted by the zeal of hollywood film production.in 'apocalypse now' there are no battles, no heroes or villains, there is nothing in the film that suggests that it is intended to reflect the imagery of vietnam through the physical aspects of war. rather, it is a film, which powerfully investigates and explores the human psyche when it has been tormented by the absolute 'horror' of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century.the sheer brilliance of the acting (in particular the interpretation of taciturn captain willard by martin sheen), along with the spectacular cinematography (filmed in the phillipines), which provides crucial realism to the backdrop of the film, makes 'apocalypse now' an unforgettable epic.evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a maelstrom of mediation, 'apocalypse now' is not for the light-hearted moviegoer. it is masterpiece that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated.

even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. alright, more than a little... my first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.don't watch this movie expecting another darko. darko fans are never going to like another richard kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. donnie darko is a thing of the past, get over it.richard kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. to be honest i had to watch the box twice before i liked it. the deeper meaning- (to spare you a bunch of sociological psycho babble) humans are self serving, we make decisions that can destroy our lives and don't open mail without a return address.summary: creepy old man tells cammeron diaz if you push the button i will kill someone you don't know and give you a million bucks. of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old gets a case of money. then the movie takes a dive into the unusual. to spare my fingers the typing... for pushing the button, diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings, in an elaborate experiment to gage the morality of the human race.i liked: the willingness of the movie to ignore the generic movie guidelines. its different. its intense. it has a deeper meaning (although its philosophy 101 material). it leaves you guessing. not a hollywood ending!i disliked: why would any being with the technology to inhibit another life form devise such a ridiculous scheme? what god like alien has the patience for that? diaz was good, but was there a need for the country accent? they live in virginia. i give it a 7 because kelly didn't put as much attention to detail as with his other movies. overall good flick.

in dublin, the crippled rebel rory o'shea (james mcavoy) moves to the carrigmore residential home for the disabled, affecting the lives of the residents. roy is able to understand the unintelligible speech of michael connolly (steven robertson), who was left in the shelter by his prominent father many years ago due to his cerebral palsy, and they become close friends. rory convinces michael to move from carrigmore to an apartment in dublin, and they hire the gorgeous siobhan (romola garai) to assist them. living together with rory, michael faces a new world, finding friendship, love and freedom and learning to survive by his own. "inside i'm dancing" is a wonderful tale of friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story. the acting of steven robertson and james mcavoy are awesome and i do not understand how they have not been nominated to the oscar with such magnificent performances. romola garai has also a top-notch performance and is extremely beautiful and sexy. the screenplay is touching, never corny and without redemption and the precise direction of damien o'donnell is very sensitive. unfortunately the brazilian title of the dvd is shamefully ridiculous, giving a wrong idea of this excellent movie. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "os melhores dias de nossas vidas" ("the best years of our lives")

when i was 10 (currently 14), i vowed to never see a movie that i knew would not have a happy ending. and until a few weeks ago i had done pretty well, except for shakespere for english class...etc...i was still only watching things that ended happy. but then i saw ramola garai in havanah nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. after seeing this a few times over the two or so years since i first saw it, i grew to like it, especially the music. so i did a search on her and found imdb...i saw "inside i'm dancing" and assumed she had done another dancing movie, and over looked it. it was later on an image search(of rory, looking for gilmore girls poster for locker) i picked up an image from this movie...i then searched for a trailer, i found the trailer and when i saw the hospital and heard rory say "you've got the future" i remembered my vow and realized this would not be a good movie for me. but it just stayed in the back of my mind until we were at the video store and there it was for $5 used, so i went ahead and bought it. after seeing it i just wanted it out of my head because it was so sad. i still wouldn't go near it until i had cerebral palsy as a vocab word. then i just had to see it again and this time all i did was laugh, even at the saddest parts i no longer felt depressed because i realized that over all this movie was happy and uplifting...i love it and it is now one of my favorites, i;m sure this is the worst comment you have ever read. but watch the movie it's worth it.

this film was amazing, it was extremely funny and moving. damien o'donnell and jeffrey caine have put together a great movie which will appeal to all ages. james mcavoy and steven robertson made this film brilliant. their acting was excellent, there was this real lifelike feeling between them, that made you really believe they were the characters they were acting out. romola garai is amazingly gorgeous and brilliant in her role. the story of these two physically challenged people and their carer is well put over, and you really start to grow to know and feel for the characters as the movie goes on, it was especially upsetting at the end. i would recommend this movie to anyone that loves a truly heart felt movie, warning to the more sensitive viewer make sure you have tissues you will need them.again amazing film!!

as is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and cram it into a two hour film, a lot is lost. here director john madden (shakespeare in love) takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off. what we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete.there is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic. the cinematography by john toll (cinematographer for braveheart and legends of the fall, winning oscars for both) is splendid. working with madden, the choices for locations on the greek island of kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful. madden also uses numerous greek actors as the townspeople, giving the town an authentic feel. the soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the italian soldiers are marvelous.madden does an excellent job of bringing us the italian occupation and the romance, which take up the greater part of the film. there are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment. however, by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold, there isn't much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated. while the battle scenes are well done, subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long. by the time we reach the post war scenes, the treatment is merely skeletal. another negative is that the dvd is particularly sparse on features.nicholas cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight. when fight he must, cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas.penelope cruz, whom the camera loves, gives an uninspired performance as pelagia. in part this is because cage so dominates the screen, but cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic. she allows the character to be objectified as corelli's love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right.john hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor, who knows as much about human nature as medicine. however, christian bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as pelagia's fiancé.i rated this film an 8/10. despite some drawbacks, this is a touching film that is well worth seeing. the photography alone is worth the price of admission.

obviously made on the cheap to capitalize on the notorious "mandingo," this crassly pandering hunk of blithely rancid italian sexploitation junk really pours on the sordid stuff with a commendable lack of taste and restraint: the evil arrogant white family who own and operate a lavish slave plantation spend a majority of the screen time engaging in hanky panky both each other and their various slaves. director mario penzauti and screenwriter tecla romanelli cram this fetid filth with a teeming surplus of sizzling sleaze: we've got nasty rape, interracial copulation (one white lady makes wild love to a muscular black stud while he's tied to a cross), copious female nudity, brutal whippings, vile degradation, lots of lurid soft-core sex, and a severely twisted tragic surprise ending that mixes elements of incest, murder and miscegenation in a questionable attempt at making a statement about the horrid inhumanity of slavery. special kudos are in order for foxy brunette actress paola d'egidio, whose lusty and uninhibited portrayal of depraved and lascivious wicked bitch rhonda positively burns up the screen. moreover, marcello giombini's funky, throbbing tribal score hits the groovy spot. maurizo centini's fairly polished cinematography likewise does the trick. a satisfyingly seamy chunk of slimy swill.

incredibly hilarious mid-70's italian rootsploitation with lots of non-consensual s&m, lesbian sex, gratuitous racial cruelty etc...few redeeming cinematic qualities, except for the fairly cool theme music with dubby "african" drums and flute. brilliant sample dialog: white slave owner (to white plantation manager): "you're so dumb, i'll bet you forgot to interrogate that n****r midwife!"white plantation manager: "not only did i interrogate her, i did it so well she died before i could get any answers from her!"all the black actors have 70's afros, and say "yes, massa" in a high-pitched voice. the female lead has sex with everybody on the plantation. 10 stars for fans of tasteless sleaze.

spike milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'puckoon' is sadly no exception. the novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'puckoon' of the title ). due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in northern ireland, the other half is in the republic. locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint. a dead man has to have a passport made out in his name before villagers can reach the churchyard to bury him.'puckoon' is a sort of irish 'under milk wood' with comic characters and surreal happenings galore. the lead character, dan milligan ( renamed 'madigan' in the film ) is impishly played by sean hughes, and has conversations with the narrator ( richard attenborough ). also in the film is milo o'shea, griff rhys jones, david kelly ( from 'robin's nest' ), freddie jones, joe mcgann, and elliott gould.interviewed for the 'making of 'puckoon' documentary, writer/director terence ryan expressed undying admiration for the book. it shows on screen. but, alas, like the ill-fated film of 'the hitch-hiker's guide to the galaxy', a good book does not necessarily make a good film. the trouble with 'puckoon' is that, like milligan's other books, they simply do not work on the big screen. 'puckoon' is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot.no way can the film be compared to train wrecks like 'sex lives of the potato men', 'fat slags', and 'lesbian vampire killers', but then neither is it as good as it should have been. the last half-hour involves a lot of running around by the police, the british army, some locals who have stashed explosives in a coffin, and is really tedious to sit through. ryan's decision to stick closely to the book is the main reason for its failure to work as a film.the other problem is the total absence of charm. 'waking ned' had this in spades, while the 'father ted' television series was funnier by far. spike lived long enough to see the film, and apparently enjoyed it. his daughter, jane, has a cameo as madigan's bride.the highlight for me though was the quotation at the beginning: "i don't mind dying!", said spike: "i just don't want to be there when it happens!".

saw the film at the closing gala of the ealing film festival in west london(england). enjoyed it immensely. although the crow & the chinese policeman don't appear, and dan milligan becomes dan madigan (played by sean hughes (i)). the interaction between dan and the author (writer/director) voiced/played by lord richard attenborough, works very well.the rumour is that lord attenborough and elliott gould (as dr. goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.

i hope, from his seat on heaven's comedic throne, spike milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as terence ryan and ken tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it "nearly turned me mad" into a joy to watch.the film tells the story of the irish town of puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between northern ireland and the republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard. this causes some deceased, buried in the catholic churchyard, to now be in the protestant north - and so the local priest, assisted by a wide variety of eccentric locals, aims to move the bodies back undercover of darkness, and so avoiding the bureaucratic british border guards.it was inspired work to cast the irish comedian and poet sean hughes to play the part of madigan. he brings an innocence to the part, especially in his to-camera pieces (which is normally where he interacts with the voiceover of richard attenborough, playing supposedly the writer/director of the film). daragh o'malley playing father rudden is also worthy of considerable praise; and the rest of the cast, from the household names like elliott gould and griff rhys jones to people with what would normally be called 'bit parts' - such as spike's daughter jane who plays madigan's wife give 100% the credit for this goes, in no small part, to the wonderful characterisations given by spike in the original book.i could argue that the film is slightly too long, or that elliott gould's irish accent left a little to be desired, but those would be only minor points and take nothing away from the excellence of this film.

if you've never experienced the thing that is zasu pitts, here is a zasu zinger! in 1933 mae questel caricatured pitt's voice for the character olive oyl for the fleischer studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip popeye. zasu (pronounced zay-sue) does her best "olive oyl" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. i kept waiting for her to say "ohhh myyyy", but instead it's "something always happens to somebody." the first time i saw this film i loved zasu and found her character really funny. i've since seen her in other films where she does this same whining, uptight, fragile-flower routine. so, upon watching this film again i started getting a little annoyed with the constant whining and near hysteria over a piece of dust. but, there are some funny comedy bits here, and it's also a mystery movie as well. it's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that actually works. the mystery plot holds together well through the camp of zasu pitts and james gleason who plays arthur crimmer the policeman. the haunted house is fun with many a secret passage and even a skeleton in the attic! well worth the watch. read more public domain movie reviews at: http://pdmoviereview.blogspot.com/

1930's comedy mystery about "the crooked circle" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them. enjoyable but really unremarkable little film, the movie works simply because the cast headed by zazu pitts and james gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of hildegarde withers films after edna mae oliver dropped out of that series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (i don't hence the lack naming). a breezy hour long romp, the movie doesn't make a great deal of sense with mistaken identity, secret passages, ghostly music and people not being who they seem. its the perfect thing for a dark and stormy night or a late night viewing when one is nostalgic for the late late show.

the "old dark house" sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.the crooked circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on col. walters (berton churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. they decide he must die that very night. meanwhile the colonel's own group, the sphinx club, is determined to protect him at all costs. this does not sit well with thelma (irene purcell) fiancée of club member brand osborne (ben lyon, late of the mega-budgeted hell's angels (1930)) who wants him to quit the club and stop endangering his own life. brand promises to resign after saving the colonel's life. everyone heads off to walters newly purchased mansion on long island to await the assassin.the colonel might be the new owner of melody manor but it's an old dark house complete with eccentric neighbours (like raymond hatton as a local hermit) and maybe even a ghost. top billed zasu pitts is nora, the housekeeper who expects to see a spirit around every corner. throw in a cop (james gleason) who is certain brand is a criminal and we have a picture which is packed with action and surprises.you will notice right away that the script writer was at a loss to come up with too much dialog because a lot of characters repeat the same lines over and over. yoganda (c. henry gordon) a hindu mystic (which movies of that time were loaded with) says "evil is on the way." many times and i lost count of how often ms. pitts says "something always happens to somebody!". there are many suspects and two characters (mr. gleason as the stereotype dumb cop and roscoe karns as mr. lyon's pal) who serve as comedy relief. the house itself is appropriately spooky looking (in fact i think the same set was used in the phantom (1931)) with lots of secret passages and violin music coming out of empty rooms but somehow you never really get a feeling of danger. maybe it's because no one in the movie, and i do mean no one!, is entirely what they seem to be. it all comes out right in the end though; but to go into any more detail would spoil it for you.watch carefully for robert frazer (from white zombie) and frank reicher (best remembered as capt. engelhorn from king kong) to pop up among the suspects.the crooked circle is a fun film. some aspects of the plot are predictable and then again several others are not. i suspect you will enjoy it.

i really enjoyed this movie about a dog who becomes a duke. it would have been very easy to mess this one up, but along with the humor, the script was filled with warmth and even some profundity about nobility and class. it's a feel good movie that the whole family can watch.. even the adults!

it's a great movie for the whole family. i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before. sophie heyman is my aunt's sister in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure. i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to sophie and she got a copy from her. if someone is reading this i suggest buy the movie and i guaranteed it won't be a bad decision. i've seen this movie about five times and every time it gives me the same message, dogs are as smart as people just give them a chance.

the duke is a very silly film--a dog becoming a duke! but it's a very fun movie. it has some of those corny pranks that many kids movies have, but (thankfully!) no bodily function jokes, as so many animal movies feel compelled to have! mostly, it's just dogs being dogs and people being. . . well, people. the 'good guys' are likeable and appealing. the 'bad guys' are ridiculous, and of course, the pun of many jokes. but there is something dignified about this movie, for even though it is silly, it's not out for every cheap laugh like "home alone" and others.crocket, simon and copper do an excellent job playing black and tan coonhound "hubert" who becomes the duke after his beloved owner, a real duke, dies. for the most part, they just act like dogs, no 'talking,' or human-like emotions and attitudes. however, they do stereotype poodles, and hubert does fall for her, just because she's a poodle. come on! these are dogs--they have a different view of beauty!!!overall, charming, fun and enjoyable.

let's be fair: there are no rules for scriptwriting, so i won't say the movie should be something other than it is. i'll just state my opinion. ok, i really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. however, i think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. since this movie was directed by joão falcão, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical. it's the man's first movie, for cryin' out-loud! what i'm saying is, there are parts in the film - like the city of nordestina, which slightly resembles the set of "hoje é dia de maria" - that feel like we're not at a movie theater. we're at the theater! lines are spoken too formally, characters are moving choreographically, and the lightening is clearly meant for a stage. sure, maybe that was the intention, but that's been done. on stage. wonderful things have been made when adapting a play into a movie - the beautiful "closer", for instance. when i went to see this one, though, i didn't feel like i was watching a movie. but overall, it was a good one, worth watching. it's a nice love story, funny at times and sad at others. my vote is a 7.

very touching film, a great surprise to come up from brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... magical realism is a very hard task, and i believe joão falcão has made it wonderfully. it seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. another mistake is to think that falcão has been influenced by the series "hoje é dia de maria". the tv series produced by globo was made after the film, but aired before... unfortunately.the negative point is the photography, by walter carvalho. it seems that he didn't capture or understand the concept falcão has created. the story is captivating and universal, in spite of taking place in a tiny little city in brazil. that could take place anywhere in the world. a great movie, i strongly recommend.

years ago i read the book 'a máquina' (the machine). as i re-read this little book again and again, i could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the brazilian culture.when i knew about the movie, i was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.i can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text. also i can't recall such a powerful performance like gustavo falcão's.you can see and feel how colossal his love for karina is. you can realize that he'll move mountains and do anything for this love.do see this movie, watch it thru the eyes of the kid that lives inside you, enchant yourself!

i rented this movie, but i wasn't too sure what to expect of it. i was very glad to find that it's about the best brazilian movie i've ever seen. the story is rather odd and simple, and above all, extremely original. we have antonio, who is a young man living in nordestina, a town in the middle of nowhere in the north east of brazil, and who is deeply in love with karina. the main conflict between the two is that, while antonio loves his little town and has no wish to leave it, karina wants to see the world and resents the place. as a prove of his love for her, he decides to go out himself and bring the world to her. he'll put nordestina in the map, as he says. and the way he does it is unbelievable. this is a good movie; might be a bit stagy for some people due to its different editing job, but i think that it's also that that improves the story. it's just fun, and it makes you feel good.

in nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in pernambuco, antônio (gustavo falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. when he is a young man, he falls in love for karina (mariana ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. antônio promises karina to bring the world to nordestina, and once in rio de janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented. fifty years later, antônio (paulo autran) tries to fix what was wrong in his travel."a máquina" is one of the best brazilian movies i have recently seen. the refreshing and original story is a poetic and magic fable of love that will certainly thrill the most skeptical and tough viewer, in a unique romance. the direction is excellent; the screenplay is awesome; the cinematography and colors are magnificent; the cast leaded by gustavo falcão, the icon paulo autran and mariana ximenes is fantastic, with marvelous lines; the soundtrack has some beautiful brazilian songs highlighting geraldo azevedo and rento rocha's "dia branco". if this movie is distributed overseas, please thrust me and rent it or buy the dvd because i bet you will love the story that will bring you into tears. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "a máquina  o combustível é o amor" ("the machine  the fuel is love")

well this was the wwf's last pay per view event of the millennium and it ended the year and millennium right. the huge story line of stephanie and hhh started right here at this event when steph turned on her dad. vince mcmahon had a great match with hhh and this event is very good i give it a 9

the subject of this movie is disturbing. how could some otherwise intelligent, religious, hard-working, and sincere white afrikaaners treat the native blacks so cruelly for so long?the movie answers this question, and also explains how some afrikaaners are changing in a positive way.

final solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid. it shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation. jan ellis was taught that a black man was a plague. he was raised to be that way. then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs, pastor lekota. will he change his ways?. the film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another, it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy. the movie shows the world of how apartheid affected the psyche of blacks and whites.this is a great film that everyone should watch.

i know gerrit. he presently lives in the u.s. this film is based on events in the lives of both gerrit and celeste wolfaardt. it's a remarkable story. it inspired me to read "cry, beloved country." the film is well-produced. the music is beautiful.the story is told in flashbacks. you learn the stories of a white racist south african (gerrit) and a black south african (moses). their lives intersect violently. the ending is not typical hollywood -- it's unusually realistic and ends on a note that encourages you to think about the characters and the themes.be sure to watch through the credits -- you'll get to see footage of gerrit in real life.

this movie, based on a true story of gerrit wolfaardt, is one of the best films i've seen on race relations in south africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's south africa. i put it in on the scale of american history x as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the aryan doctrine and how the "certain" segments of the christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.it's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today. the violence is well done as to show the severity of gerrit's crimes and greatness of his transformation.one word about jan ellis who played gerrit wolfaardt. he carries you through the darkness of gerrit's beginnings to his enlightened transformation. he went to some dark places as an actor and is to be commended on his performance.another standout performance was that of mpho lovinga who plays moses moremi, one victim of gerrit's crimes. he was able to pull from some places of pain that really touched you as you watched his performance.very good movie to show the teens.

if you are looking for a phony hollywood action movie, this won't be one for you. if the truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. from a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in south africa (and many other places).for historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as "the pianist," "schindler's list" or "nuremberg." millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. this movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper.

the animation quality here is decidedly below par imo, regardless of the age of the oav. the plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.this might sound picky, but considering that the city of olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would you feel comfortable there as a human? would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? i doubt it. there are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters. seems sloppy to me.the main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement, though no light is shed on this. little light is shed on the backstory at all, a great pity. the short length of the film coupled with the focus on mecha and the crime means that we don't see any character depth. the groundwork's all down, yet we're left with no finished product. a cropped version of this oav would have made a great tv episode, once some character sub-plots had been established.the highlights of this short film are the mecha designs and the action/espionage.the flaws really start to show through once you've had a chance to digest all the goings-on, so i couldn't recommend this for owning, but it's certainly worth a watch or two! whilst this review is mostly negative, i really do think it's worth your time to watch this, but it's not something to rush out and buy. in a nutshell: a watchable wasted opportunity.

based on the manga (comic) of well-known artist masamune shirow, this animated feature was a slight disappointment to me.the story is good, but the animation is merely "ok" while it could/should have been mindblowing. the movie is imo adequate, but seems somehow flat & uninspired, if you know what i mean. a wasted opportunity, if you consider that another work by shirow, "ghost in the shell", is considered a classic in many respects. it set new standards for japanese animation, and spawned, among other things, a brilliant series called "gits: stand alone complex".i consider this worth a rental, unless you're a fan of shirow and want it all. do check out the original manga, which comes highly recommended.

pretty decent for his early work and no kokaku kidotai without it, and gets an 2 points extra for the easter eggs. for shirow definitely a rung in the ladder. i am biased as a shirow fan but this was a big step from dirty pair which was what i knew of him. violent fun with a porno soundtrack! you cannot help but notice that. i know people appreciate him for ghost in the shell..but all of the deep spiritual overtones were dealt with in appleseed. eswat killing terrorists, the struggle for humans to stay viable as bioroids phase them out, and deunan staying thin despite her intake of junk food. definitely like the characters even the traitor..and i do not know why.

as i have said before, i am not a fan of tweety. he's just so aggravating i wish sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.in this cartoon sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. he spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys tweety is one of the passengers. the ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. if only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating canary forever. but, as cartoons starring tweety go, this one is quite good, but it's all thanks to that brilliant cat.

funny, yes. a freleng classic! to watch sylvester turn green is always a treat, and it brings us back to the days when cartoon slapstick was brave and geared for the adult mind.loved it!

in tweety's s.o.s, sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and granny, his owner. uh-oh! once again, tweety and granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times, too. and the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. so now sylvester can blow fire! i'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by friz freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo. tweety's s.o.s is most highly recommended.

a labor of love. each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. the director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. you are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. i have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. the remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and i felt i was a part of the drama unfolding before me. the casting is as perfect as one can get. vijay raaz, camille and benoit each hold their own. i strongly recommend this film to everyone who appreciates good cinema. i can't wait for the commercial release of this movie.

i saw this film at the seattle international film festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and indian ex-pats. the film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. the direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. while the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. the soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. if you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out hari om for inspiration. it was not disclosed in the q & a, but i imagine hollywood could take a lesson in budget film-making by learning from this director.

have you ever wondered what its like to feel free? i am sure that each one of us know the meaning of freedom and never seriously think of using it to our advantage. hari om shows the audience what freedom actually means. in this film freedom is described in the form of style represented by isa's discovery of india. isa discovers her inner true love when she is in a rickshaw journey with mr. hari om. she looks at life differently and portrays freedom that every woman restricts in herself when she is in a relationship.this film is definitely "worth a watch", and i saw this the first time in dubai international film festival (diff), and i left the cinema hall with complete satisfaction."watch it"!

i have watched my fair bit of bollywood films when growing up - you know the typical plot boy meets girl, girl rejects boys, dakus (bad guys) take away girl, boy rescues girl by killing hundreds of dhakus and they happily get married (of course i've omitted an hour of musical style numbers).. well going into watch hari om, i was expecting another typical bollywood style movie; however, to my delight it turned out to be atypical and indeed quite comical. bharatbala's hari om is what could be labeled as one of those 'off beat' indian films such as the ever popular south asian hits as monsoon wedding, east is east or bend it like beckham.being of south asian decent and having watched various classic bollywood films, there was much humour and sub-dialogs which could be picked up that reminded me of the fun and charming side of indian culture (e.g., the various indo-pop numbers which were actually remade by nitin soni or the witty indian slangs that were used). hari om can be enjoyed by all south asians, and is also entertaining for those not accustom to the indian humor as the characters and plot caters to all audiences. in a cocunutshell, the movie is of auto-rickshaw driver (aka 'four-wheeler' for those of you who have traveled to india know) played by vija raaz (from monsoon wedding) who gets himself involved with a crook and ends up owing him quite a bit of money. to avoid selling his four-wheeler, 'madhuri', he escapes serendipitously with 'madhuri' and a very charismatic and lovely woman from france, isa (camille natta), who herself is escaping the boredom of her boyfriend benoit (jean marie lamour who was in swimming pool). the movie is of their journey traveling across the beautiful landscape of rajasthan  the land of love stories; through the humour you see the two main actors trying to find out who they are really are.what made the night most memorable was having the director, executive producer, main editor and even the mother of ms. natta present at the screening. after speaking with bharatbala (who actually has a zoology background) many interesting tidbits of the film were uncovered including: having the film finished only 10 days prior to the toronto international film festival and taking only 45 days to shoot, and having only five actors in the play (the rest were all first time real actors). arriving home i realized two things from the movie - that there is always a human connection between any one of us despite our differences and secondly, as the director had put it 'everybody has a love story'. its a must see for everyone!

the film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. i am the first one to agree that victor fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. i also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. so what? if it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? does every film have to make sense? does every film have to be perfect? no. a person could get razed admitting that they love this film. again, so what? it's got lovable characters, it's well shot, the acting is mostly good, it never becomes too maudlin or dramatic, it's quirky. look at how many people love i dream of jeannie. is it perfect? heck no! and while this is very different, i say check it out and you'll be in a good mood after you see it.

i saw this movie on late night tv out of buffalo about 30 years ago and i'm dying to see it again one more time before i... well.. you know. the interaction between the main characters after the tiger (eli wallach) "captures" his prey (anne jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. charles nelson reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. how many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end? this film reminds us that we are all in that same struggle regardless of class, race, sex or religion. and who can forget the scene of the suburban homeowner on his hands and knees attacking those few tiny weeds that have dared to appear overnight on his perfectly manicure lawn!

while i rather enjoyed this movie, i'll tell you right now that my mother wouldn't. it's out there. really warped little dark comedy that reads like a fairy tale gone awry. >neat treat with all the cameos too. if you want something "different", look no further.

(some spoilers included:)although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. to quote from encyclopedia britannica's, surreal means:"fantastic or incongruous imagery": one needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read james kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, "no way!" what fantasies and incongruities the film offers mostly appear within the first fifteen minutes. thereafter we get more iterations of the same, in an ever-cruder and more squalid progression that, far from incongruous, soon proves predictable. not that it were, on the other hand, literally believable-- but it were unfair to tax motorama in particular with this flaw, any plausible suspension of disbelief having fallen precipitously on the typical film-maker's and viewer's scale of values ever since "raiders of the lost ark" became a blockbuster."hallucinatory": how do we know what a hallucination is if part of having one is not knowing that we are having one? at any rate, some people know that they enjoy "hallucinogenic drugs"-- but if motorama typifies the result of doing so, then i'm at a loss as to why anyone would take them more than once. there is, of course, the occasional bad trip. the movie must be one of those, pun and all."juxtaposition of words that was startling": how many times can a ten-year-old startle you by uttering "oh, my god!" when he likes something, or "damn!" when he doesn't? these two interjections are about par for the course with this script. sadly, any sense of the surreal in what passes for dialogue could only reveal, in direct proportion, one's naivete regarding the speech patterns of the rising american generation."a world completely defined and minutely depicted but that makes no rational sense:" motorama's world indeed makes no sense, but it is about as completely defined as a cartoon in an elementary school newspaper. the numerous guest stars in the cast all have cameo roles even less intelligent than our little hero who exclaims "damn!" in the blink of an eyelash but needs several seconds to concoct the lamest lie. and even *his* character, despite appearing in nearly every scene, gets no significant development. here's scant reward for any viewer who sympathizes, as i must, enough to wish to know him better and understand 'where he's coming from.' one vaguely senses a far better story and protagonist struggling to get out."fully recognizable, realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous, paradoxical, or shocking framework." no, we see a succession of stereotypical and ever more dilapidated billboards, filling stations, greasy-spoon eateries, cheap hotels, and their lowlife habitues along country highways, exactly where they stereotypically belong."largely responsible for perpetuating... the traditional emphasis on content." there is little content, moment-to-moment, in motorama.to sum up: picture british millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates on the way to a posh costume party, sitting serene and mute as cautious chauffeurs inch their rolls-royces like fragile skiffs through a roiling sea of desperate humanity, chinese who implore them through the windows and smear the glass with blood. or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques, limousines like those above now rusting, and white pianos tinkled by ghosts. into this detritus wander an exhausted boy and an ailing woman to whom he clings as mother-figure becoming girl-friend, who fall asleep side by side on the grass. he is awakened-- on the feast of the transfiguration, "white and glistering" day 1945-- by a brilliant flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun. finding that his consort has become a corpse, he first believes that he has witnessed her soul going up to heaven. later he explains only a little less innocently, 'i learned a new word today: atom-bomb. it's like god taking a photograph.' now, *there* are just two samples of cinematic surrealism, surrealism whose ironies ripple out far enough to invade its film's very title: empire of the sun. if you seek surreal, *please* don't miss it. alas, however hard he treads on the accelerator to race his chariot through and beyond the desert, no scenes so exquisitely strange, rich, subtle, or gorgeous await motorama's poor little gus in his quest.none of the above necessarily constitutes a thumbs-down on this film. though somewhat disappointed, i can't dismiss it, in view of the respectability of another genre that it does exemplify-- one influenced, to be sure, by surrealism, but also by expressionism, existentialism, and franz kafka's pessimism amidst omnipotent power structures. let's try on for size: theater of the absurd.turning to e.b.'s article on this style, i am amazed by how, to the extent that theater of the absurd is a valid artistic style, the above objections to motorama vanish like a puff of smoke. i'm tempted to quote the entire text as support of the identification.theater of the absurd attempts to show "that the human situation is essentially absurd, devoid of purpose... humankind is left feeling hopeless, bewildered, and anxious.": having instantaneously achieved his purpose of getting away from a depressing home life among bickering parents, gus finds himself purposeless until he drives past a glittering billboard reading "motorama" and decides to win the lottery that it promises. as others have already revealed, this ambition proves illusory: although the game "never expires", the sponsoring corporation has no intention that anyone should ever win, and has ways to trick, confuse, and leave crestfallen any aspirant to the reward. he, like others, is ultimately disappointed in his dream."absurdist playwrights, therefore, did away with most of the logical structure of traditional theatre. there is little dramatic action as conventionally understood; however frantically the characters perform, their busyness serves to underscore the fact that nothing happens to change their existence... a timeless, circular quality emerges." "language in an absurdist play is full of... repetitions... repeating the obvious until it sounds like nonsense." underneath a sometimes "dazzling comic surface," we find "an underlying message of metaphysical distress." gus's obsession with a silly game, his inane language, the plot device wherein he divines a bleak future and/or returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but still bleak turn-- so much fits now. while an admirer of the surreal would do better with some films, anyway, of spielberg, admirers of motorama as it really is should find fellow-travelers-- not instead but addition-- in the works of beckett, ionesco, and genet.but one can't quite stop here. after his disillusionment with the game, gus returns to "phil" (i.e., love), the first attendant he had met and the one person who had treated him decently, although he had also scolded him-- at a service station advertising "be full-filled!". under phil's tutelage he learns a life of waiting for cars. we might note here that the absurdist playwright beckett had entitled his most famous play "waiting for godot," and that for godot we should read "god." god is one of phil's preoccupations, too. furthermore, as the indirect result of his previous encounter with gus, phil is badly maimed and goes about in a cast with his arms straight out horizontally. in the last scene, gus, now phil's protege, says that he wants to hear music. we hear none, but we see phil wiggling his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm, beckoning gus closer, and gus responds. the end.finally, on to an author whom i happen to be reading currently, the anglican theologian william stringfellow. if this rebel-lawyer is not acknowledged as an architect or undergirder of liberation theology, which is more a roman catholic than an anglican movement, perhaps he should be. police brutality and corporate greed are a cliche in cinema and literature, including motorama, but stringfellow supports and illuminates such sentiments with impressive warrants from scripture, tradition, and reason.his most significant work is an expose of the earthly activities of those fallen angels whom the bible refers to as principalities and powers. principalities, wrote stringfellow, are behind all of our popular three i's: images, institutions, and ideologies. all of these commend themselves to our worship by making false promises. the more deeply involved with an image, an institution, or an ideology any person becomes, the more his own personhood becomes "depleted" and be becomes a slave to them. promising power, control, and immortality, they inexorably deliver helplessness, chaos, and death. as essentially fallen, defeated powers, they can do no more than that. yet they beguile humans with that "dominion over the earth" promised by god in the book of genesis, while in fact no one of us controls an image, an institution, or an ideology bent inevitably on its own hegemony and self-preservation. they take on lives of their own. "dominion" happens to be a mistranslation: a more accurate rendering of the hebrew would be "stewardship." but this is a quibble beside a more fundamental problem: most of us neglect to notice that god had delegated this power to adam *before* the fall. we have no reason to assume that we, his descendents, still exercise it now: on the contrary, it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us.one might add two observations of c.s. lewis: first, that "man's conquest of nature" is a mere illusion, and a ruse to cover the fact that one is really talking about the conquest of some men by other men with nature as the instrument; and secondly, contrary to popular belief, satan is no kind of good-time charlie. he may dangle out pleasures at first, but he is very niggardly with them and will withdraw them from any human firmly in his thrall, perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserably sorry for himself and seething with resentment.now, applying these insights to motorama, we seem them mirrored remarkably in gus's experience. he is, if not nice, at least a pretty little boy prior to falling victim to the motorama game. the first signs advertising it glisten glamorously. the longer he continues, however, and the deeper he journeys towards the sponsoring corporation's headquarters, the more shabby they become. he's lonely, meeting no one else who plays the game. the stations giving out the cards have either fallen into ruins or are staffed by zombies. the people he does meet along the way are more and more ugly, deceitful, and hostile. (the fact that the principalities answer to a common dictator does not mean that they can abide one another). gus's humanity is leached out of him as he becomes not only totally self-centered and oblivious to the needs of others but partially blinded... disfigured... prematurely aged while infantile in the literal sense of linguistically challenged. eventually even his precious mustang is taken from him in a crash, and he must continue in a dead man's wreck. yet at long last, having done everything he thought was expected, he presents himself to the principality in its proud tower to receive his prize. using the biblical power to confuse wielded by those who have built such monuments to their own vanity, its agents evade him, disappoint, insult, and finally throw him from the top floor. he falls long and hard, landing, finally in a body of water. in other words, in classic symbolism, he dies. he has met the inevitable bad end of anyone who has put his faith in such a deceiver.but this fate proves to be only a warning look into a mutable future. he repents and returns to phil, and upon seeing him performs the very first generous, selfless act we have seen from him for almost an hour and a half: noting that phil is now handicapped and hardly able to insert a hose into a gas tank, he asks, "can i help you with that?" then, seeing the "help wanted" sign, he decides to apply for the job, explaining to the motorist with whom he was hitch-hiking that he reckons he'll get out here, because it doesn't look like too bad a place to work.this interpretation is conjectural, of course, and it may surprise or even outrage the film's "cult classic" aficionados who see quite different points in it.if motorama isn't quite my cup of tea, i'm at least convinced now that it's hardly the worst film ever made.

this has got to be one of the most magnificent things i've ever seen on film. i don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. this film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. the packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. look at the roadmap, for one thing! and where else in america can you see a ten year old kid swear as much as this one does and then get his eye ripped out by pervert the rival of pulp fiction's zed? and that food inspector scene is the best! the amount of well known to vaguely recognized actors in this film is one of the best things about it: soon, much sooner than you realize, you too will find yourself saying, "is that meat loaf? is that drew barrymore? is that the holideck doctor from star trek: voyager? is that flea? is that the sawmill owner from twin peaks gassing squirrels with car exhaust? and isn't this guy from the new rob zombie movie? he looks an awful lot like shrek." i think my favorite scene is at the very end, with phil in a full body cast. i mean, please, why aren't more movies like this shown in airplanes? this director hardly has anything else to his name higher than return to salem's lot, but he displays true stumbling man-child genius in this creation! if you're an intellectual looking for something to p**s away your evening on, i highly suggest this film for satisfaction. this movie's plot is all too ridiculous, but imagine it taken out of context: *boy arm wrestling an over aggressive meat loaf, who seems hell bent on taking out his anger at not being accepted into guns n roses, looks over his shoulder and sees the doctor from voyager enter the bar* can you imagine what any half brained channel surfer active through the last six years would think of seeing that? now imagine if you actually cared about meat loaf or voyager to begin with! or imagine if you're a flea fan. rocky horror picture show fans, this film contains notable music, mind you, but its soundtrack is more plasticine than mad max 3. what does that entail for you? this is the retarded, inverted mongoloid cousin-sister-mother-puppy of the rocky horror picture show. how about when gus' sleeve flies back onto his arm in an act of cable-access special effects quality mastercraft? when i saw this film, it was on the suggestion of my cousin who had watched half of it in a fit of half-aware childhood in the early half of the nineties and who has since been haunted by vague memories of it, i myself had not slept in three days. it made me laugh! of course, it's also an anxiety movie. the music doesn't encourage the suspense but it eventually gets to the point where it's been fully established that the american censorship committee has obviously missed this film entirely and absolutely anything can happen in it and probably will any time gus turns a corner or the view so much as changes camera angles. i found myself obsessing over the possibility of those cards flying out his window at any second. watch this movie. awesome!

although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. the story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be "realistic." it is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail. in addition, the symbolic representations are left open for interpretation, which can be said of much great artwork. don't be fooled by the cover (if you happen to rent or buy this film)-- the movie is not what it might seem to be on the surface.

the first time i saw this movie, i just thought "what the hell?" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called motorama! hell yeah! i enjoyed this movie a lot!jordan christopher-michael is a brilliant young actor! it's a shame he stopped act. he interprets very well his character gus on the movie.gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with flea, drew barrymore and meat loaf! want more? ok, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!? just open your mind and let gus drive you into this journey."motorama gus, you won motorama"

motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as bagdad cafe or repo man (which more or less takes place in the desert). it also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer joseph minion's comedy, 'after hours.' in a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, gus (played well by jordan christopher michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents. it begins as a trip through salvation (which is apparent in the scenes with john diehl), but once he becomes hooked on a scratch-off game called motorama, he becomes easily tainted by temptation and looses his childish innocence. he travels from one crazy fictional state to another concocting ways of getting motorama cards from participating gas stations, just enough so that he might spell out the prize winning word m-o-t-o-r-a-m-a and be eligible for the $500 million cash prize.along the way, he is embattled with dozens of strange characters such as flea who plays a high strung busboy, meatloaf who plays a crazy biker, and mary woronov and sandy baron (a seinfeld regular) as two violent kidnappers. the dvd rerelease can be very deceptive, as have previous attempts to sell this film to the non-cult market first with taglines comparing it to home alone and thelma & louise. the newest calling it a love story with the tagline implying that the film is about jordan michael christopher on an adventure to meet the girl of his dreams...which, despite the size of her picture on the dvd cover, is actually only about a 1 second cameo by drew barrymore as the fantasy girl that gus dreams about. why didn't they just market it for what it was? thought it may seem totally bizarre on first viewing, it is actually a well-designed narrative. motorama is great material for fans of strange b-grade comedies. this was quite an interesting story, and particularly because of the strength of its lead actor--jordan michael christopher (who unfortunately has few other screen credits of note)--and the clever metaphor inherent in the plot. hopefully its re-release on dvd will make it an easier find for cult fans.

this movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. if you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. one of the funniest parts is when gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like hansel and gretel then he and his wife go home with them. the soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: "inspection officer -- here!" and the lines to follow will stay in my mind forever probably. when i have shown this movie to my friends, they usually say "what was that?!?" so if you're in the mood for one of those types of movies, yippee! this movie is so oop it's not funny anymore, so probably the easiest way to get it would be online auctioning. the first time i saw it was from a rental.

i loved this movie, i saw it when i was about 8 years old and almost seven years later, this evening i got to see it again. i really thought it had an interesting idea, they only thing that upset me was the ending which i felt was a cop out. 'round here it's hard to find this movie and i was lucky enough to have seen it on bravo. i also expected to see more drew barrymore in here too!

this is an entertaining surreal road movie. it was written by joseph minion, who also wrote after hours, martin scorsese's excellent surreal film. the film follows the adventures of a ten-year-old kid named gus, who drives a red ford mustang across some fictional states with names like tristana (a tribute to luis buñuel's film, perhaps?), essex & south lyndon, in search of eight elusive motorama game cards from various chimera company gas stations. the film has a surreal feel to it because a lot of the things are unusual, like the money for instance, which is like blank paper with numbers on.most of the characters are nasty to gus on his trip. they tattoo him, punch him, but this doesn't stop the kid on his relentless quest. some oddball actors like david lynch incumbent jack nance, meat loaf & flea also make appearances. jack nance plays a motel owner, who when he first meets gus tells him, "if you see any squirrels, give them to me". this is a movie where a man and his wife abandon their young children because the man owes gus $100; and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice louder while speaking rudely. if you're a fan of twin peaks and surreal movies, you'll like this. an odd little gem of a movie.

this is a great, dark, offbeat little film, a modern day adaptation of the quest for the holy grail myth. it's a sleeper if there ever was one. i saw it on cable some years ago and taped it. i've loaned it to many of my friends and everyone loved it.

don't even try to figure out the logic of this story. but do ride along with 10-year-old gus on the most bizarre road trip ever witnessed. more weird characters and implausible situations than a twin peaks reunion! nothing makes sense, yet it's impossible to stop watching motorama! now, where can i find that 'r'????

little gus is a ten year old delinquent. he runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. his goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called motorama. he has to find all eight letters in order to spell m-o-t-o-r-a-m-a. dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. he runs into some deranged lynch like characters. most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that god will see it. later gus gets a tattoo and an eye-patch for his injured eye. he becomes one of the most rebellious bad-ass 10 year olds you may ever witness on screen. this is no kid's flick! look for cameos by jack nance, flea and drew berrymore. be warned although drew is on the front cover, she only appears in the film in a dream sequence for a couple seconds. also the film gets confusing towards the end reaching david lynch territory, you may want to watch it a couple times. "motorama" was written by joseph minion, most well known for his screenplays for "after hours" and "vampire's kiss" so enjoy this depraved surreal road-trip of fun!

let's start from this point: this is not a movie intended for the common audience. utterly bizarre, somehow incomprehensible, totally unpredictable, it just keep you stoned watching at the screen trying to figure out what will happen next. if that by itself doesn't make you agree it is an excellent movie, then go back to your "family" movies and forget about motorama. it has material to be considered a cult movie, it can be placed in the same category with movies that win awards in cannes or other intellectual film festivals, but, sadly, hollywood already let if fall in oblivion, simply because it is not commercial. the performance of young jordan christopher michael may not be oscar material, but he gives the right touch to the story. even the genre is difficult to describe; it is not a comedy in the proper sense, you don't know if you are supposed to laugh at the strange situations in which gus gets involved. it is more like an impossible adventure that some kids may wish to have, but don't let them watch it either... it is not a movie for kids. so, if you like disney movies or are looking for a "home alone" style, this one is definitively not for you. but if you enjoy reading edgar alan poe or the works of tim burton, then you will like motorama. so, jump in your red mustang, get a tattoo spelling "tora" and cruise strangeland with gus. i'd like that...

as with so many modern us films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.we are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. beau bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub beau's nose. d'onofrio finds his rather surface bubba lifestyle cramped by having to look after his 'blessed' baby brother, joey, and is itching to escape the shackles of this dead hick town. their boss's business is closing down (much against his will) because of a lack of new customers and he is haunted by memories of his father as he builds up the tension towards his own attempt at self-destruction.joey, who had seemed to personify the curse on their lives, is lost at sea - believed drowned - in a freak accident. his miraculous restoration to them by the portuguese trawlermen whose boat they had just built and launched (perhaps symbolic of an angelic crew), is the sign they've been waiting for and they all decide to give life one last throw of the dice.there is a beautiful brooding mood throughout this work which excelled in holding our attention as brilliantly as 'the shipping news'. there are other parallels with the later work, too, which lead one to suspect a touch of a remake. i like 'signs of life' for its simpler, less contrived story and star performances from actors working at their craft rather than to be noticed as stars.

i saw this movie on pbs the first time. then i bought the video and watched it countless times. every time i watch it, i can get something else out of it. it's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. but you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like charlotte don't want things to change. the overall tone and mood is excellent. the cast is outstanding with all-stars like kathy bates, beau bridges and arthur kennedy. and its fun to see the upcoming stars before they hit more recognizable feature films, like kevin j. o'connor (the mummy) and vincent d'onofrio (men in black and law & order: criminal intent-one of my favorite shows). its just one of those movies that stays with you.

it's not real flashy, but this movie does a great job of developing a large cast of characters, and letting you know their hopes and desires, while still managing to be both funny and bittersweet. a very sweet movie. fun, also, to see vincent d'onofrio and mary-louise parker so early in their careers.

i first saw "signs of life" on pbs as an american playhouse presentation. it's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by michael lewis as joey and vincent d'onofrio as his brother, daryl. arthur kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. the rest of the cast which includes beau bridges, kathy bates and mary-louise parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.the direction is subtle and effective. i've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it. a beautiful piece of filmmaking.

it's showtime! showtime is simply a bump in eddie murphy and robert deniro's careers. it's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not robert's. showtime is directed by tom dey and features some small roles from guys like william shatner and mos def.showtime is about two very different cops, mitch preston (deniro) and trey sellars (murphy). one takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat. they are both after the same felons behind a huge caper of televisions, vcrs, etc. they then cross paths and a tv station wants a new reality tv show so they fight crime while they are on tv. mitch hates the publicity while trey loves it with his line, "it's showtime!" their tv antics and methods are shown on tv and they are the new "cops" show. the fun begins.overall, showtime is a fun action comedy. a good film but not quite up to the actors' expectations and standards. however, it's rolls along as it treads and parodies reality tv shows. a good break from shows like cops. truly at the end, just a guilty pleasure.my rating: 7/10eliason a.

this is actually great fun. i really enjoyed it, even though it wasn't that original at all, robert de niro and eddie murphy were great together!. all the characters are cool, and the story is pretty good, plus robert de niro and eddie murphy are simply amazing in this!. rene russo is excellent in her role, and there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout (especially when deniro spoofs clint eastwood and danny glover's lines), plus the finale is just great. yes it's just another run of the mil "buddy buddy" cop film, but it works due to the fantastic chemistry between de niro and murphy!, plus it had some great car chase scenes as well!. it's nothing that great really, however i found it to be great fun, and a perfect way to pass the time!,however the main villain was very weak and wasn't very good at all. this is far from being the best "buddy "buddy" cop film, however it's still a very entertaining one, and i thought it was pretty well made and written as well!, plus the ending was quite funny!. this is actually great fun, i really enjoyed it, even though it wasn't that original at all, robrt de niro and eddie murphy were great together, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. tom dey does a very good job here with great camera work, cool angles and keeping the film at a fast pace. the acting is a lot of fun!. robert deniro is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is hilarious, very likable, had fantastic chemistry with eddie murhpy did his usual awesome stuff, pulled some really funny faces, seemed to be enjoying himself,had some funny lines, and had a really cool character! (de niro rules!!!!!!!). eddie murphy is also amazing here, he is hilarious, like de niro did his usual funny stuff, obviously loved being in front of the camera, and while he can do this stuff in his sleep he was still a lot of fun to watch! (murphy rules!!!!). rene russo is fantastic here!, she had a cool character, and while she didn't have much to do, she added a lot of screen presence, and made her character interesting always, she was just great! (russo rules!!!!). william shatner is funny here surprisingly and didn't overdo it, and brought some good laughs into the film. the main villain is ok, but kind of weak and rather bland, still he did what he had to do adequately. rest of the cast do fine. overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5

robert deniro and eddie murphy, what a team. while rene russo, william shanter, and that guy from the everyday video are alongside for the ride. this is a funny and a great movie. not only is it that, but it's a good buddy flick.tom dey (shanghai noon) directs this hell of a movie. from start to finish, it was a masterpiece. no slapstick humor here. but good old time laughs. making fun of all other cop flicks (to name a few lethal weapon, beverly hills cop, fifteen minutes, and etc...)if you want to see a movie, see this one. you'll love it. it has a wonderful cast and crew. so, get off your a** from watching "cops" and watch "showtime" for a cop film. and remember, they'll be protrolling your neighbor at um...um...oh! at friday nights at 8:00 (man, everyone says i'm a bad writer).

showtime is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. the plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. but i laughed. a lot. credit goes to the inspired pairing of de niro and murphy. they have great chemistry. murphy delivers the one-liners, de niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. this movie will get a rush hour-like reception from the critics. don't listen to them. if you're a fan of de niro or murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.

dad (78) and i (46) both had a good time watching the flick today. for a guy primarily known for serious roles, de niro is a heckuva comic actor. of course, it helps to have his past film images to play against. consider that one of those roles, 15 minutes, was a cop having to deal with the interference of the mass media, and you have an interesting set of compare/contrast performances.murphy plays another of his axel foley sort of characters. shatner plays a burlesque of himself, a parallel world self who was best known for tj hooker and not star trek.it's interesting to watch how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its fictional counterparts in tv and film. shatner lectures on the proper means of sliding across a car hood; de niro points out holsters scratch the hood finish. ironically, as the film progresses, de niro's character begins to incorporate the illusions of tv-cop reality into the real world case he's working.the film draws its inspiration from a gamut of sources, so one could make the comment it is derivative. well, so what? satire needs to derive its humor in order to exist. and besides, the film does have quirky moments of originality. for example, i'm reasonably sure the method of the villain's death has never been done before. one quibble about the reality of the weapons involved-- shouldn't those guns have had some kind of recoil? in order to penetrate steel, those bullets had to have enough inertia to penetrate. and any bullet's highest level of inertia is at the moment of firing. so.... firing a volley of these tank-killer bullets should have driven the shooters back onto their butts. oh, what the heck... it's a satire. maybe the guns' lack of recoil is itself a satire on the b-f-guns used so casually in thrillers. 

as many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.eddie murphy and robert de niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that i really enjoyed. russo and shatner played their small parts well as well. man, i hope in the future my wife ages as well as miss renee has.moving along, this "buddy" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time. the movie is enjoyable enough to avoid the wait for video/dvd release and instead to go ahead and check it out.eddie murphy is at his usual top-form and is downright enjoyable to watch. de niro has molded into this type of role perfectly.i really enjoyed this movie and think that any true movie fan in need for a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy showtime.top performance: murphy. hilarious. enough said. directing job: nice. nice action scenes, used murphy and de niro together like a charm, russo fed off in a nice supporting job.my rating: 7 out 10. it's not going to move you or anything...but it's an extremely enjoyable movie.it's showtime...was a great success.

"showtime" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what i expected months ago when i first heard about eddie murphy and robert di niro teaming up for a comedy. overall, it was pretty good! as "real life" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but duh--- this is a comedy. also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a schwartzenegger movie, i found it a bit tiresome and overdone. 9/11 sensibilities aside, for myself, all that pyro-techno hyper-effect stuff had been getting really old these past few years. it seemed a lame substitute for characterization, story, and engaging emotions. i hope the lesser quantity of it in "showtime" is an indicator of a trend in hollywood. a trend downwards, of less use of the silly, less use of the exploding building.di niro and murphy are two of my favorites. their screen presence and charisma-- and even their character depth-- have been "a joy to behold" for many years. that can't be dismissed here--- they are engaging actors, and entertaining and appealing in this movie. i can't put my finger on it, but perhaps the explosions, the excessive fx, and all of that diminished the final product??? perhaps, or perhaps it was something else, or a combination of factors that gives one the sense that the movie didn't achieve its highest potential. whatever it was, "showtime" was entertaining-- i probably will buy the dvd when it comes out-- but i had the vibe that it nonetheless wasn't all it could have been. at least not all i had hoped for.very good movie, but not a great movie. i gave it an 8 out of 10.

i'm not going to go into too much depth, but showtime was a pretty funny movie. there wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that i can remember), but it had it's moments. the cast is pretty good, robert de niro is good as usual and eddie murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. rene russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. there were two characters in the story that i liked that they didn't explain much at all. the first one was trey sellars' (eddie murphy's) buddy at the gym played by ken campbell. i supposed he was just a friend of trey's, but i wanted to know more about him. the other character that i liked was mitch preston's (robert de niro's) fellow cop/partner played by nestor serrano. i guess he was just another cop working with mitch preston, but i wanted to know if he was his partner or what not. i think maybe i'm putting too much thought into a movie, i mean after all, it's a comedy...who cares about the characters? i guess i do though. i was really pleased to see this was directed by tom dey, who also directed shanghai noon. ever since i saw that movie i was looking forward to his next work. i think he did a pretty good job with this film, and i again look forward to his next work.all in all, it was a good movie, but i wouldn't recommend paying full price for a ticket unless you're a die-hard robert de niro/eddie murphy/rene russo fan. it was worth seeing in the theater, but not for full price, i'd recommend seeing it at matinee price. also, here's some movie trivia for ya. the guy who played the camera man, played by judah friedlander is the guy in the music video "everyday" by dave matthews band. he was also the clerk in "meet the parents", also starring robert de niro. ...and on top of that he also played derek zoolander's brother in "zoolander" (both zoolander and meet the parents star ben stiller). just some useless trivia for ya.i hope you enjoy the film. thanks for reading,-chris

"showtime" is a funny film starring funnymen robert deniro (meet the parents,a bronx tale) and eddie murphy (shrek, dr. dolittle). the story is this: in the beginning of the movie detective mitch (robert deniro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. when the cops arrive, tray(eddie murphy)a cop, tries to arrest mitch not knowing he's a cop. during this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer chase ritz. she is so excited about their adventures together, she decides to make a tv show called "showtime" starring tray (the cop) and mitch (the detective). but that's just the funny part. the rest is strictly suspense and action. there is a foreign man who is selling and making extremely dangerous guns. while playing lapd on the show and doing it in real life, deniro and murphy have quite an adventure in this story. on a scale of 1-10, i give it a seven or 8.

at one time `buddy cop' movies ruled the box office. it seemed that every summer flocks of beverly hills cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. not any more. lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. the drought has eased a bit recently with the release of showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.mitch preston is a dedicated cop. he's not a dirty harry type by any means. he's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a t.v. cameraman. mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and so falls into the clutches of chase renzi, a producer looking for a killer hook for her `reality t.v.' cop show. she thinks that mitch will give her the `edgy' boost it needs to be a hit but feels he may be too unlikable to carry the whole show by himself. enter trey sellars, a patrolman-cum-actor who's watched way too many police story re-runs. of course mitch and trey mix like oil and water and much merry mayhem ensues.we know that mitch and trey are bound to become best buddies by the end of the movie. that's the way buddy-cop movies are suppose to work. in fact, it has to be said that showtime rarely deviates from the time-honored clichés as writ by lethal weapon and tango & cash. there's a high tech mcguffin to get the ball rolling (in this case an automatic rifle that fires rounds big enough to stop tanks.) there's a slick foreign baddy with an accent of undetermined origin. there are chases, shootouts and explosions. we all know this going in and we have a pretty fair idea how it's all going to turn out. you know what? there's nothing wrong with that. yes, we know the well-worn bases are going to be touched but the fun here is the trip, not the destination. showtime doesn't strain to be original. instead its energies are funneled into its characters and humorous situations. as a result, showtime does a competent job with the action sequences but really shines in its comedy.robert de niro is dryly funny as mitch. in the past i've thought de niro to be a cold and unexpressive actor given horribly to mugging when called upon to do comedy. lately, though, he's grown on me. he seems to be injecting more humanity into his roles. eddie murphy is hilarious as trey. the best way to describe his performance is that trey is what murphy would be if murphy weren't so talented and hadn't hit the big time. rene russo has a droll time playing motor-mouthed show biz shark chase renzi. she stalks through the movie chasing high nielson ratings with awe-inspiring determination. in her zeal she re-vamps mitch's life to make it more camera friendly. she even calls upon t. j. hooker himself, william shatner, to show mitch how be a more `authentic' cop. shatner is funny, playing himself precisely as we expect him to be, loud, oblivious and slightly obnoxious.i have to admit i was really looking forward to showtime and i wasn't disappointed. ten years ago this movie would have been a guaranteed hit. today it's doing moderate business at best. that's a pity because showtime is a whole lot of fun.

contains spoiler the movie is a good action/comedy but i don't know if the director cut too many parts but it seems that the bad guy die too fast. the end of the movie come, the bad guy dies and that's it.the special effects are good and i don't regret paying to see it at the theatre.

despite of all the negative criticism i really enjoyed this movie. i am not saying this lightly. i love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home dvd collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are ok, a few i do not like at all). and, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. i simply love this movie. it is light, funny, and very restful. i am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but i love it. the comedic talents of eddie murphy and robert deniro are tapped (fully - for this type of movie). do not compare it to other movies with these star actors, simply enjoy it. the cast is great and, i believe, that the purpose of this movie was fully accomplished. if you want a really "easy-going" and very restful night - watch this movie. deniro and murphy simply had fun making this movie, so should we (watching it). and, please, do not be so negative. do not expect godfather performance or meet the parents from deniro, do not expect comedy blockbusters performance from murphy... it is a completely different genre, and it made me relax after a hard day work. your sides may not split from laughter, but it is still very funny.

i've read a lot of reviews about showtime on imdb and many seem to miss the mark. i've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical "buddy" film. de niro is in no way murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. in fact, part of the comedy of this film is de niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.murphy really shines in this one. he is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. he is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. de niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid. i thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice. rene russo is also great as the tv producer. of course, she loves everything murphy does and tries so hard (along with murhpy) to get deniro going too.a lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with william shatner, reprising his role as tj hooker to train murhpy & de niro how to "act" like cops. but, my favorite scene involves murphy in the "confessional" hoping he could get a wesly snipes-like cop to team up with instead of de niro. man, that was hilarious! comedies often depend on your personal tastes. sure you could poke holes in the plot, most often you can with a comedy. i was psyched to see the pairing of murphy and de niro...i think it brought out the best in murphy, which was nice to see him at the top of his game again. i can only imagine it was a great honor for murphy to be paired with the great de niro. rating 8 of 10 stars.

it's exactly what i expected from it. relaxing, humorous and entertaining. the acting couple was awesome, as well as the scene selection. i personally recommend this. it's kind of the movie that can be seen by whole family at the same time without anyone feeling uncomfortable or getting bored. this cute movie will make you smile, and laugh too. and the action scenes are tasty. classics of modern american comedy. and very well done.

if you've seen the trailer for this movie, you pretty much know what to expect, because what you see here is what you get. and even if you haven't seen the previews, it won't take you long to pick up on what you're in for-- specifically, a good time and plenty of laughs-- from this clever satire of `reality tv' shows and `buddy cop' movies, `showtime,' directed by tom dey, starring robert de niro and eddie murphy.	mitch preston (de niro) is a detective with the l.a.p.d., and he's good at what he does; but working a case one night, things suddenly go south when another cop, trey sellars (murphy), inadvertently intervenes, a television news crew shows up and mitch loses his cool, which results in a lawsuit by the television station that's going to cost the department some big bucks. except that they may be able to get around it, thanks to chase renzi (rene russo), who works for the station and likes what she sees in mitch-- enough to pitch an idea to her boss for a `reality' cop show, that would feature none other than mitch preston, whom chase sees as a real life `dirty harry.'	her boss likes the idea and gives chase the green light. now all she has to do is convince mitch to participate, which shouldn't be too hard, since the station has agreed to drop the lawsuit if he will do the show. but mitch is a cop, not an actor, and he wants nothing to do with any of it-- that is until he has a heart-to-heart with his boss, captain winship (frankie faison), who puts mitch's future into succinct perspective for him. and just like that, the show is on. oh, yes, there's one more thing; for the show, mitch is going to need a partner. and who do you suppose they're going to come up with for that? let's put it this way: trey sellars is more than one of the usual suspects.	this is dey's second film as a director, his first being `shanghai noon,'-- also a comedy-- and he's definitely showing a penchant for the genre. from the opening frames he establishes a pace that keeps the story moving right along, and he allows his stars to make the most of their respective talents and personal strengths, including their impeccable timing. with stars like de niro and murphy, dey, of course, had a leg up on this project to begin with, but he's the one who keeps it on track, demonstrating that he knows what works, achieving just the right blend of physical comedy and action, and employing the subtleties of the dialogue to great effect. 	there isn't a more natural actor in the business than de niro, and he steps into mitch's skin like he was born to it. and after years of doing hard-edge, cutting drama (in which he turned in one remarkable performance after another), with such films as `analyze this,' `meet the parents' and now this one, he has firmly established his proficiency for doing comedy, as well. mitch is not an especially complex character; he is, in fact, something of an `ordinary' guy, but therein lies the challenge for the actor-- to make him believable, to make him seem like the guy who could be your neighbor and just another member of the community. and on all counts, de niro succeeds. he's mitch, the guy you run into at the grocery store or the bank, or say `good morning' to on your way to work; who likes to watch the game on tv and has a life, just like you and me, who happens to make his living by being a cop. it's the character mitch has to be to make this film work, because it makes the `ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances' angle credible. it's one of those role-- and work-- that is often wrongly dismissed out-of-hand, because it looks so easy; and, of course, this is what makes de niro so exceptional-- he does make it look easy, and he does it with facility.	as trey sellars, eddie murphy turns in a winning performance, as well, and it's a role that fits him like the proverbial glove. trey is a cop, but also an aspiring actor-- and a bad one-- and it gives murphy the opportunity to play on the over-exuberant side of his personality (reigned in enough by dey, however, to keep him from soaring over-the-top into jim carrey territory), which works perfectly for this character and this film. from his melodramatic take on a part during an audition, to his throwing out of one-liners-- delivered by looking directly into the camera (which as far as he's concerned isn't even there) while filming the `reality' show-- murphy's a riot. and he has a chemistry with de niro that really clicks (which is not unexpected, as this is another of de niro's many talents; his ability to connect with and bring out the best in his co-stars, all of whom-- evidence will support-- are better at their craft after having worked with him, including the likes of meryl streep, christopher walken and ed harris, just to name a few). most importantly, this is a part that allows murphy to excel at what he does best, and he certainly makes the most of it.	russo makes the most of her role as chase, too, a character who isn't much of a stretch artistically, but whom she presents delightfully, with a strong, believable performance. and william shatner (playing himself) absolutely steals a couple of scenes as the director of the show.	the supporting cast includes drena de niro (annie), pedro damian (vargas) and james roday (camera man). well crafted and delivered, `showtime' is a comedy that's exactly what it is meant to be: pure entertainment that provides plenty of laughs and a pleasant couple of hours that will have you chuckling for some time after. it's the magic of the movies. 8/10.   

this is a funny movie. the bob & eddie show feel of it could lead to a sequel but i doubt it will make enough money. deniro proves he can be a great straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of cgi animals and rodents. rene russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. this was worth seeing in the theater. we needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end. do not leave at the start of the credits!at least a 7.

i went to see this movie not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the teaming of robert de niro and eddie murphy. it was a fast paced movie and the hour and a half went by fast. this one certainly won't win any academy awards but it was a change of pace for mr. de niro. he is good in comedy. overall i enjoyed it.

i don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. the thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. this is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. the three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former tv cop, brought in by russo's character to coach the cops on how to be "tv cops." those are by far the funniest scenes. if you want to be entertained and just sit back for a laugh, then watch this movie.

i cannot understand why so many people did not like this film. robert de niro was on top of his game, delivering his lines with such aplomb, one has to believe this is his everyday demeanor. granted, the film seemed to take on many buddy-film conventions while trying to make fun of the concept, it goes without saying this film was genuinely funny. from the police dog, to the fact eddie murphy didn't annoy the heck out of me, this film is a real keeper. rene russo also evened out the rest of the cast perfectly, establishing her role so it does not interfere with the budding relationship between de niro and murphy.

several stowaways get on a russian ship bound for france. they were going to get off there and make new lives for themselves. after being discovered by the first mate and his henchmen, they were held captive. then things got very bad for them. good show based on a true story.

i was watching an nfl game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the hbo type channels. i missed the beginning but when i started watching deadly voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. you will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your la-z-boy throughout this one. if you get the chance take the time to watch it. every once in a while i think about having the cable company take off my movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them. happy holidays to all from cape cod !!!

i absolutely hate the idea of made for television films . for me tvms usually involve jane seymour or jaclyn smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult to treat disease all done in such a sugary manner that the audience doesn`t need tissues it needs insulin . so when deadly voyage a made for tv film by the bbc and hbo based on a true story i vaguely remembered from a couple of years previously turned up on the tv schedules i sat down waiting to be bored senseless . i was surprised.no strike that last sentence , i wasn`t surprised i was shocked . here is a tvm that grips you tighter than a great white shark , in fact deadly voyage doesn`t deserve to be relegated to the tv schedules it should have been made and distributed by a top hollywood film company due its absolutely terrifying premise and what`s more it`s - unlike papillon and sleepers - completely true for those who don`t know the story !!!!! possible spoilers as to plot !!!!! sometime in the early 90s a bunch of africans stowed away on an ukrainian freight ship bound for france in order to work there. of course it was an attempt at illegal immigration but the crew of the freighter had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants onto their ship from a previous journey and not wanting to get into anymore trouble with maritime and immigration authorities the crew murder the africans after discovering them hiding in the hold. all except one african , kingsley ofusu , who manages to escape from the firing squad but who must try and survive aboard the ship , but the problem is the crew are hunting him and france is still several days voyage away .just typing the above paragraph reminds of how good deadly voyage is . what a remarkable story , and once again it is - unlike many stories that claim to be - totally true . it`s very well written , directed and acted , especially by sean pertwee ( why isn`t that guy a big name star ? ) , and most of all it`s a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that i can still remember vividly six years after seeing it for the one and only time . i look forward to seeing again .but you`ve got to ask yourself how can a tvm be better than most of the hollywood action blockbusters that came out round about the same time ? oh hold on , i`ve just had a disturbing thought about jerry bruickhiemer doing a remake with tony scott directing and with denzil washington playing kingsley , brad pitt playing pertwee`s role , massive artistic licence taken with events etc. let`s keep deadly voyage a superlative tvm rather than a poor blockbuster

this searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious african nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. they think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in new york to send for their families. unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. the captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line. the group of blacks begin their harrowing voyage in the cargo hold and are eventually discovered, forced out of hiding and murdered by the ruthless mate (an outstanding performance by sean pertwee.) a few (convincingly terrified leader omar epps among them) manage to temporarily escape and are mercilessly pursued through the ship with their lives forfeit if they are caught. altogether a riveting film which will have audiences biting their nails and gritting their teeth wondering how such dire events could take place in modern civilization.

if you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called "outlaw seas" or "the outlaw sea", and it describes, in story after story, how these things do happen. the lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons. one, many of the world's freighters are of questionable registry (nationality) and it's difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don't have an office in a real country. two, many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries. the crews are often (like illegal immigrant workers) threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices. three, there is often a language barrier, not only between the officers and the crew, but also between the crew members themselves. the crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence. four, once committing an illegal act, the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint. anyway, it's fascinating reading.horrifying story, excellent movie. does anyone else notice how hbo seems to make the best and most important movies? hollywood has trouble releasing enough oscar worthy movies in any given year, so that several of the top 5 contenders usually come from britain. jerry bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema.i loved the thoroughly evil performance by sean pertwee. i also, as usual, loved omar epps.

as an ex merchant seaman i was really interested in this movie : i personally have been involved in a stowaway search on leaving kingston jamaica where one person was found. we managed to get him ashore though as we were in territorial limits. on another ship i was on the stowaway was found and we could not land him anywhere due to passport/nationality issues. in fact he stayed on for a year as an almost "honorary" crew member and worked for his keep. africa is notorious for stowaway pickups. there is a great scene in the beginning of the film when the bulk carrier enters the african port : her size dwarfing all. the crew pop ashore for a little intercourse and inebriation. so far normal. the drama starts when the stowaways enter the vast cavernous holds of the ship. joss ackland is brilliant as the captain with a drink problem being harassed by his nemesis suchet right on form as the companys representative on board. the stowaway search is classic but we did not have guns. i question the use of guns in this film. this ship seemed to have a vast armoury. in my experience guns at sea are severely restricted due to customs regulations., also having a dog on board was odd.anti rabies laws especially in europe restrict carrying of animal severely. anyway pertwee is brilliant as the embittered mate. the horror which follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable : the grim metallic background of the ships holds and a feeling that there is no where to hide adds to the drama.some of the freighters crew are not into the murder and those who get involved are gradually sucked in to a world of violence from which there is no escape.the chase through the ship especially the engine room scenes are "edge on the seat" : the feeling of extreme claustrophobia abounds. the feeling of metal pressing in and death being only a gun barrel away. the film is brutal : my girlfriend had to give up watching it during the shooting and beating scenes. while this goes on suchet in the comfort of his well appointed cabin gets drunk unaware of the mayhem 3 decks below. its a tense film, flawed in parts but the real message is that we can all get sucked into violence like this. slowly and surely. think of the train drivers who took jews to auschwitz, the clerks who worked out those train timetable. i always remember someone who had visited dachau concentration camp at the end of the war and he said that one of the s.s. guards had put a bird-table outside the camp crematorium. this film is like that : ordinary people suddenly finding themselves in a world of unstoppable violence!

i taped the morrison murders on lifetime movie network and i watched the morrison murders on lifetime, lifetime movie network and on courttv. jonathan scarfe and john corbett did a great job of playing luke and walker morrison. i am glad that walker got his brother luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother bobby. i enjoy watching true stories on lifetime, lifetime movie network and on courttv. the morrison murders is a good movie to watch. next time the morrison murders is on lifetime, lifetime movienetwork or courttv i am going to watch the morrrison murders again because my favorite actor john corbbett is in the morrison murders. i give the morrison murders a ten because it is a good movie about walker who tries to find out who killed his parents and his brother bobby and at the end walker discovers it was his brother luke who murdered his parents and his brother bobby.

odd but wonderfully original movie. genuinely frightening, creepy and ridiculous in equal measures. the setting of a high rise red brick apartment is a perfect backdrop for the haunting action. the thought of a secret sealed room in a place like this is good enough but when the lead naive couple start cleaning up the old bed they find in this room the scene is set for some classic chills. the cast is fantastic. tanya dempsey really gets to chew some scenery after being undervalued in other full moon films. joe estevez proves why brother martin sheen is so much bigger in hollywood - his rolling eyes during the making the bed scene are really hilarious. charles band co-produced with stuart gordon and this really is an exceptional full moon/darkwave release. danny draven also directed hell asylum with dempsey.

i guess by the time i saw this episode, i had seen enough twilight zones to have it figured out ahead of time. there is this odd assemblage of characters who find themselves at the bottom of a cylinder. they are fine until an overzealous soldier shows up in their midst. it is his prime directive to escape and so he garners the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the cylinder. there is much discussion about purpose and reason and speculation on their pasts, but no one can remember anything. they represent different jobs: a piper, a ballerina, a clown, a man in a tattered hat. why are they there? it leads to an adventure and is resolved at the end, but i guess i had a pretty good idea before it all happened.

during the sci-fi tz marathon of january 31, 1999, this episode was the last one aired in the 20th century in my time zone(eastern). it was new year's eve, and when the clown starts singing, "we're here because we're here, because we're here, because we're here..." i realized that this was tz's clever nod to it being new year's eve because that tune is also the tune to old lang syne. coincidence? we will never know.i love this story for the little touches: the tear on the ballerina, the antics of the clown, and the hit-yourself-in-the-head ending. this and the art carney santa tz are the only ones that are about christmas. my personal top five episodes, after five characters...: 1. the hunt 2. the after hours 3. the hitchhiker 4. the lonely 5. little girl lost

it seems there are two kinds of people in the world: those who think that "five characters" is one of the best episodes in the series and those who are so cool that they know it sucked because they were so clever and already predicted the "lame" twist at the end (which apparently, in their small minds, is the only reason the twilight zone exists: to come up with twists).there are plenty of lame episodes in the series and i'm not one to rate all tz episodes ten. but this one is certainly one of those that merit such a rating. it is claustrophobic and colorful. the suspense is built up and we cannot wait for the reveal of the secret at the end. but whatever that secret is, what these people are, it doesn't really matter. most of the beauty of the episode is to lead up to that. it would be just as powerful if we never find out what these strangers in a strange place really are.

this is one of the classic twilight zone episodes, where with the simplest of situations the viewer was drawn into a seemingly symbolic conflict, only to find the solution surprising and strangely acceptable. five figures are inside a container/prison: a major, a ballerina, a bagpiper, a clown, and a tramp. they are certainly an odd choice of types to be in this isolation chamber, but they are all in it (nevertheless) and they are trying to figure out why they are there. what have they in common? none can figure it out. but gradually the major organizes them into working to bet out by standing on each other's shoulders. and the major, going to the top of the line of figures does reach the entrance, and .... i'll leave it like that, although one of the other critiques on this thread actually gives the story away.the title seems to be suggested by six characters in search of an author, pirandello's famous play. whether the actual purpose to the show was to spoof that play is questionable: pirandello's characters analyze their roles and relations with each other. but the five characters here, while they try to understand their situation, are totally in the dark - they are not in the situation of the six characters in pirandello who know their current situations. this uncertainty of what is going on allows the viewers to think it is an abstract drama.the actors, william windon as the major and murray mattheson as the clown in particular, give good accounts of themselves. and the conclusion, whether planned as a spoof or not, is quite effective.

in the 70's in afghanistan, the pushtun boy amir (zekeria ebrahimi) and the hazara boy hassan (ahmad khan mahmoodzada), who is his loyal friend and son of their hazara servant ali (nabi tanha), are raised together in amir's father house, playing and kitting on the streets of a peaceful kabul. amir feels that his wise and good father baba (homayoun ershadi) blames him for the death of his mother in the delivery, and also that his father loves and prefers hassam to him. in return, amir feels a great respect for his father's best friend rahim khan (shaun toub), who supports his intention to become a writer. after amir winning a competition of kitting, hassam runs to bring a kite to amir, but he is beaten and raped by the brutal assef (elham ehsas) in an empty street to protect amir's kite; the coward amir witness the assault but does not help the loyal hassam. on the day after his birthday party, amir hides his new watch in hassam's bed to frame the boy as a thief and force his father to fire ali, releasing his conscience from recalling his cowardice and betrayal. in 1979, the russians invade afghanistan and baba and amir escape to pakistan. in 1988, they have a simple life in fremont, california, when amir graduates in a public college for the pride and joy of baba. later amir meets his countrywoman soraya (atossa leoni) and they get married. in 2000, after the death of baba, amir is a famous novelist and receives a phone call from the terminal rahim khan, who discloses secrets about his family, forcing amir to return to peshawar, in pakistan, in a journey of redemption.i am not familiar with the afghan culture and i did not read this novel in spite of the recommendation of my daughter, and yesterday i decided to watch this movie on dvd. i found a good story of loyalty, cowardice, betrayal and redemption, with a brief insight in the recent history of afghanistan, from a peaceful period in the 70's to the present days with the taliban. the actors and actresses have great performances, giving credibility to the realistic story. the arid locations in china recall the images we see in television from afghanistan. in the end, i found "the kite runner" a good movie. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "o caçador de pipa" ("the kite chaser")

greetings again from the darkness. based on the mega-best seller from author khaled hosseini, the film provides us a peak at the ugliness of post-russia invaded afghanistan and the terror of the taliban. director marc foster adds a gem to his resume, which already includes "monster's ball", "finding neverland" and "stranger than fiction".the story of young friends amir and hassan and the unknown bond they share into the next generation. this is a story of honor and courage and loyalty and is an unusual coming-of-age tale. some great scenes of the boys when they are kids and then a couple of truly amazing scenes as amir returns as an adult to find hassan's imprisoned son.this is tight, compelling story telling with a message. the acting is solid throughout, with no one actor stealing the screen. although not a pleasant story to watch unfold, it is certainly meaningful and heart felt. plus a quick shot of midnight oil playing in the pool hall is a welcome gift.

it was amazing. as a librarian and an attendee at the new york library association's vitality fund event on thursday night, october 18, i was privileged to see a pre-release screening of the new movie, the kite runner. the release of the movie has been delayed because of concerns about the welfare of the child actors involved. i am grateful that the nyla event was allowed to go on as planned.regarding the movie, i feel it was masterfully done. it had as much impact on me, i think, as stanley kubrik's a clockwork orange, even though it is much less graphic - much less. there is no comparison between the horrendous, shocking violence and rape shown in a clockwork orange and the small amount of violence actually shown in kite runner; only the subject matter and the implications for the human psyche are comparable. (i have written more details about the violence and child rape and how it was handled on my myspace blog.) my overall impression was that this film was fantastic; one of the best-made films i have seen. the depiction of the afghani boys flying their kites captured some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most of the world. the subject matter is intensely serious, and the movie carries the emotions of the audience into that subject matter without many jarring "hollywood touches" which have ruined other movies. although the overturned cart of pomegranates was an obvious bit of symbolism (to me).finally, i must mention the excellence of the sound track. the recitation by the boy of poetry by rumi as two main characters are fleeing the country during the russian invasion - under terrifying circumstances - truly showed the power of those poems. i urge anyone watching to disregard the subtitles in that scene to the extent that you can, and just listen to the beauty of the language. i don't even know what language amir is quoting, whether his normal dari persian dialect is the same as rumi's original persian dialect. also, please note the sound heard every time a kite line is cut. i found it a profound, distinctive sound, though the librarians who were with me did not notice it at all. i can't help but wonder if kites actually make a sound like that when they are "cut", or if it gives a sense of the vibration/sound experienced by the kite flyer during competition.

"the kite runner" is one of the most controversial films of the year, and it's not just one of those controversies invented by pr people to sell tickets. no, this is a film that was actually pulled from release because the producers began to fear for their safety of their actors. that may give you an idea of just how sensitive and topical some of the material is. "the kite runner" is an important film for our modern world, because now more than ever, we need stories that show the reality of war, not just action movies that glamorize the violence. it was adapted from the best-selling book, and some critics have charged that something was lost in translation, but if you don't bring the baggage of the novel into the screening, you will be very moved.

a powerful debut film from murali k. thalluri that explores events in the life of a group of high school students, each of them in crisis in one way or another. the film starts with the discovery of the body of one of the students, then traces the lives of the group over the previous hours, leaving the audience in suspense until the last minutes as to the identity of the deceased. each of the main characters is facing major stressors which we could see as potentially precipitating a suicide. the cast of unknowns provide performances full of power and emotion. fantastically well done, especially considering the youth of the writer/director who was 19 years old when he wrote the script.

good grief sethrp-1, you completely missed the point. the girl was only seen briefly specifically because she was the one who was going to kill herself...everyone else was so wrapped up in their own stories they didn't notice her, nor did we. as one of the other students says at the end - we're all so wrapped up in our own problems we don't notice what's going on for someone else. the director himself said if he had killed off one of the others, it would've suggested their problems were worse than someone else's. the whole point of killing kelly was that she was unnoticed by all of us. get it now??

in this flame of emotion we are introduced to several different high-school youngsters during one eventful day at school. all of them struggle with belonging,finding them selves and keeping their painful secrets from being revealed.has the feel of a coming of age documentary focusing on students inner landscape and their way of dealing with everyday challenges.gets of with a powerful opening and develops like a hymning requiem.thalluri moves the camera with great skill and invites us slowly into the youngsters minds and hearts. a fictional reconstruction that enlightens us all and reminds us of the frailty of youth.one of the most important films of today. every teenager should be given the opportunity to see this moving piece of film.

this focuses around the lives of four women, all good friends, and their male companions. each has a story, the men as well, everything links everybody to everybody and everything is being brought to a quick change after a trip the girls take to palm springs.basically, the film is no different from other of the genre, but i liked the details. brooke shields is a divorcée that fears loneliness, therefore she bangs just about everybody to get to have a "warm body" next to her in the morning, but then can't really commit. as a man, i find these women are a blessing :), but she is not a happy person. everything else that happens revolves around this crazy woman, but in the end we get more clarity over life and relationships, which is good.i can't tell if the acting was bad. it didn't seem to me. the script was a little inconsistent, but not more than any romantic comedy. it's a bit more depressing than most, which is good, because you don't get dreary romantic comedies every day :)it's worth a watch with the missis, especially if you have cheated on her or plan to ...

this film is a tour de force from julie taymor who directs and does the stage design and masks. no-one comes near to matching her imagination on the modern operatic stage. since making this film in 1992 she has had much success in film-making and in directing musicals. one can only hope that she can be persuaded to return to opera one day. i would love to see a ring cycle directed by her. the current rheingold at covent garden has giants with over-sized hands just like the characters in this film. the current butterfly at eno uses japanese puppetry. coincidence maybe, or evidence that taymor's influence is pervasive.taymar uses fantastical costumes, masks, puppets, and origami birds to recreate the story of oedipus on a stage set on stilts above a lake. red ribbons are a recurring theme. they are used as an umbilical chord when oedipus is born, they hang down from oedipus's eyes after he has blinded himself, in a breathtaking effect they are used to make a crossroads when oedipus's slaying of his father is reenacted by puppets.this neo-classical opera-ballet by stravinsky enjoyed justified obscurity until this film brought it to life. the music is uninspired but inoffensive and philip langridge, jesse norman and a very young bryn terfel make the most of it. the singers are fairly immobile, in accordance with stravinsky's wishes. min tanaka is the dancing oedipus to langridge's singing oedipus. this creates some slight confusion towards the end when dancing oedipus pokes out the eyes of singing oedipus.the libretto is in latin but do not worry if your high-school latin is a bit rusty. there is a helpful narrator who introduces and describes each scene in japanese.

the music is by stravinsky (and not by stupid incompetent philip glass) and was written ten years before glass' unfortunate birth. the staging is simply extraordinary. the narrative in japanese adds a threatening quality and intensity that the latin version does not have. cf. terzieff's version. the giant heads and hands are totally justified by the mythic aspect of the tale. the props and make up used for the plague are simply spot on. it's taymor's best work. the singers are very good, especially terfel. langridge is quite moving and clean, and norman finds the right expression, and her beauty is magnified here and finds its right place: larger than life. simply a must.

the violent men is a good western. perhaps the story is not an original one -big ranch owner dedicated to run out small competitors out of a valley he needs for his increasing cattle- but the film has many ingredients that raises its level and makes it worth seeing.the cast is a highlight. there's the reliable glenn ford (john parrish) as a former army officer and now one of the small ranchers, who tries to stay out of troubles until he is pushed to hard. edward robinson (lew wilkinson) is as good as always as the crippled big man and barbara stanwyck (martha) plays his treacherous wife in one of her usual mean woman roles she deals with easily (others were in "double indemnity" and "blowing wild). brian keith (cole) does it perfectly as robinson's gunman brother, an ambitious man trying to take over his brother's big ranch no matter what. regular 50's westerns villain richard jaeckel (wade mattlock) is there too and ends as usual (no surprise there). dianne foster (judith wilkinson) plays robinson's daughter who does not approve his father, mother and uncle's way of handling things with their neighbors.rudolph mate brings a standard but acceptable direction, perhaps helped by beautiful and wide open scenery and a fine and appropriate music score helps too.the inevitable final showdown between ford and keith is one of the best in western movies. each man in his own dueling style (notice ford's shooting with his straight arm and aiming at its target in the military way) settle their differences then and once and for all.this is for sure one of glenn ford's best western appearances, second only to the classic "3:10 to yuma" he made two years later. it's probably the cast that puts the film as an "a" rate and, as for me, it enters the top 10 list of the genre.

this is one of my favourite westerns. what a cast! glenn ford plays his role in his usual mild, controlled but firm manner. ford plays one of the smaller ranchers in the shadow of the mighty anchor ranch that wants to swallow up the whole territory. edward g robinson plays the crippled patriarch of the anchor ranch and barbera stanwyck plays his sly scheming wife. there is plenty of action in this western that is quite impressive, the scenery is delicious and the letterbox scope photography is breath taking and the soundtrack is stereo! i would say that this western had a size-able budget it looks expensive. one of a series of great glenn ford westerns.

it's always interesting to catch a line in a film that winds up being somewhat prophetic for the future of an actor. in this case, i was intrigued by edward g. robinson's statement to barbara stanwyck - "i promised you the valley", as he discusses the lone hold outs to his attempt to control all the land in logasa. ten years later, stanwyck would star as the matriarch of the barkley family on "the big valley". somehow i thought she might have looked older in the earlier picture; i guess all those bright gowns and fancy riding outfits have a way of bringing out one's youthful side.as for my summary line above, that's lee wilkison's appraisal of john parrish (glenn ford), one of those hold outs mentioned earlier, shortly after parrish uses his knowledge of military tactics to take out a number of wilkison hands after they raid his ranch and torch his home. i liked the way the film explored his character, starting with the way he dealt with foreman wade matlock (richard jaeckel) in a calculated showdown. the set up for the ambush was also a clever maneuver, diametrically opposed to the strategy of rushing the bad guys head on with both sides fighting it out to the last man standing. for that, parrish also had something to say - "never meet the enemy on his terms"."the violent men" is a good title for this film, and was probably at the head of it's class in the mid 1950's, though by today's standards doesn't come close to the blood letting one will find in a "tombstone" or "open range", where the bullets exact a nasty savagery. but it's shaped by fine performances from the principals, with a sub plot exploring infidelity that seemed almost ironic considering it was stanwyck's character who was cheating.

this is the classic western. the good, glenn ford, the dashing hero, the ex-soldier, the man who would not hold a gun again. he eventually has to stand up the the evil land baron, edward g. robinson, who owns most of the valley and wants it all. then,there's barbara stanwyck, the real ruler of the roost. edward g. robinson's wife, who will allow no one to get in her way, even making edward g. robinson look weak. she is so evil that everyone else pales next to her blind ambition and ruthlessness to rule the valley and everyone in it. the gleam in her eye as she sees people face death for her is unnerving. it is worth waiting for.throw in a young brian keith and a few others and you have a drama that stands on its own. with the requisite stampedes, shoot-outs, ambushes and close-ups of hard riding cowboys and you have a heck of a western.without giving anything away, there are enough twists and turns within to make this not just a standard cowboy shoot-em-up.

i am appalled and dismayed that the network has canceled talk show with spike feresten !!what is wrong with the fox television network, canceling talk show with spike feresten and replacing it with wanda sikes? for those at the network with a short attention span, wanda at large was canceled because the audience grew tired of her nasty insults that would make the audience cringe, and wanda sykes spewing out her very own brand of vindictive mud slinging jokes is not humor, it is nasty and repulsive.apparently the fox television network has rewarded wanda sikes because she has garnered a self important appearance front of president barak obama. there is no doubt that wanda's recent ill tempered in front of the president of the united states are not funny and the audience laughter was only to patronize and please barak obama.talk show with spike feresten has a genuine sense of humor and has never deliberately or vindictively insulted any guest or performer. spike's well rounded personality always gleefully, poked fun of life and himself.and his filed pieces during the first two seasons with aftra actress mary mae atwill, as the mae west of the 21st century were absolutely hysterical with spike feresten's skits:judge joe brown, trading spouses and last season's james kyson lee episode where spike chats with erica via the internet on the show. despite the network's budget constraints for elaborate field pieces and the second season's wga strike, spike feresten did not waiver his sense of humor or show integrity. talk show with spike feresten always had up in coming new talent and his comedy for stoners spoofs of nanny 911 and idiot paparazzi were considered cutting edge and had excellent production value. on a professional level, spike feresten, was the best executive producers, and set producer, brett webster along with his fabulous production crew were one of the best production teams that i have worked for in my aftra career .it would really be very foolish and sad shame to cancel talk show with spike feresten. unfortunately, its success could conceivably be taken to comedy central or another network and financially speaking, that would become a valuable revenue loss for fox television..on behalf of the late night saturday fox television audience, supporters of talk show with spike feresten, including all cast and crew, we beseech the network to retain the talk show with spike feresten franchise and give the crew a second opportunity to become a successful fox show.

spike feresten is a comic genius. 'talkshow' demonstrates a fresh take on the kind of odd ball irreverence that have made shows like letterman and the daily show successful. his likability is palpable. he seems to find the unique angle of the joke, not the predictable sitcom path...thank god. his comedy is reminiscent of the award winning arrested development (cross your fingers that 'talkshow' has a longer life span). the topics he highlights tend to be those things that pass by unnoticed by everyone else, yet when he creates a joke around them out you wonder how you missed it the first time around. i particularly enjoyed the sketches..."unfair target" will be a cult classic in no time. set your tivo's people...this is a show not to be missed.

this show was a pleasant surprise after watching mad tv on a saturday night. spike is an excellent host that you can tell is still getting used to it but he is doing great adjusting to his new job. i can imagine it being a difficult transition from writer(seinfeld) to host however, unlike a lot of new talk show hosts he does not let airtime ride while trying to figure out what to do next. he is quick-minded and each segment and section rolls into one another smoothly. it also doesn't hurt that he's kinda sexy in a nerdy type of way so he's not hard on the eyes like leno or letterman. i can't remember the exact episode date that was my favorite but i especially loved the idiot paparazzi skit with a fake j-lo and katie holmes. great new show!!

i say remember where and when you saw this show because i believe if fox gives talk show a chance spike will be right up there with conan in a few years because like conan he is incredibly funny and seems to be just grateful at having his own show which adds to the humor.the funniest bits spike has had so far are the idiot paparatzi and comedy for stoners and if your not high and get cfs what does that say about you. in summary this show is funnier in 25 minutes than snl in an hour so lets hope talk show gets the attention it deserves such as an extra half hour, more money and a band.

after watching the series premiere of talk show with spike feresten i took a moment to really think wow there are actually good shows on after 12 besides snl and i was also sad to see that it was only 30 minutes long. his great writing skills helped this show overcome a series lack of money and helping hands. electronic lincoln was hilarious and i really think this will be a good dark horse talk show.i was very happy with the way he handled it and gave andy richtor some good lines to work with. as you would have suspected it was a little shaky but for that kind of time slot it was very good.overall if you are not someone on weed or even if you are and you don't have something more important to do than watch this great piece and have a fun time doing it.

i saw the movie at the nashville film festival on may 1, 2003! it was amazing! all the things that i had read about stuey were portrayed incredibly well by tony vidmer (writer, director, producer, editor), michael imperioli (incredible job as stuey), and all the others involved in this. i'm glad he (vidmer) didn't go down the "leaving las vegas" routine with stuey's bad habits, but instead put us inside his life, family, and his gift. tying the whole story from the motel room where he died was a great vehicle and showed his screenwriting skill. a big "thumbs up" on this one!

the basis for this dynamic docudrama is the true story of one of the most extraordinary card players ever.stuey is a tight, cohesive biopic of a true poker ace whose life is a one-way trip down the highway to hell with few detours.this dramatic feature stands wide apart from other films about poker. it represents a rare and earnest attempt to bring to the silver screen a true story of ultimate gambling compulsion. the complete obsession that annihilates any proximity of spirituality and nullifies any chance of redemption. this is the least likely movie a vegas casino executive would recommend. and it is the sole poker dvd you are likely to find on the shelves of gamblers annonymous.there are scenes in this movie that poker buffs are sure to refer to as some of the best gambling scenes ever. stu reading his opponent's hand and, particularly, a texas hold'em bluffing scene.prophetically, early on in the movie we see a young stu bullied out of his pocket change by a bunch of neighborhood hoodlums. poker is for loners seeking revenge. it is a game of patience which bullies lack. 'you can't bully me!' may very well be an underlying sentiment of the punishing force that a champion poker player unleashes upon his adversaries.conservatives will look upon this film as a cautionary tale of a soul lost in sin. they may evoke mark twain: 'the best throw at dice is to throw them away.' the young and liberal masses will inevitably have a more simplistic and sympathetic outlook. they may not have heard of twain's quote, but will sure remember a remark made by stu's stunned pal who learns from up-and-coming stuey that he'd won a car from a local character in an overnight game. 'you tell'em to go to hell and they look forward to the trip'.the mosaic of las vegas vignettes that we see in stuey will long linger in memory. frank sinatra, the most generous tipper? forget about it! nobody tips as extravagantly as a hot-shot gambler. and for vegas visitors who may not know the impact of tipping on the quality of their stay, check out the scene of stu checking in a vegas hotel!'this is what i was meant to do, this is where i was to be. movie stars in hollywood, politicians in washington and gamblers in vegas.'

by many accounts, stu ungar was not a very nice guy. he spat on dealers, stiffed people he owed money to, and was verbally abusive. many filmmakers might choose to sugarcoat the man, making him into some sports hero that would triumph despite adversity. but high roller doesn't do that. and that's a tough row to hoe.instead, we have to look very closely to see a man that never matured passed the frightened little boy from the streets of new york, despite all his successes. and the only real approval he ever gets is from death himself. very brave (because people won't get it) and very touching (when you do).what is also brave is the use of a scorsese feel. "aha! how derivative," people will say. really? but there's virtually no violence. and stuey loved gangster movies. maybe the feel reflects the man stu and not the director marty? and if it really is a low budget film and looks that good, bravo!finally, the linear flashback structure. wow, will that get hammered. yet, not only does it work, it works exceptionally well, even for those who don't see the connection to the "seventh seal." (proof: in ss, knight plays game of chess with death: in hr, stuey says "we can play a hand of cards for, ya know"... death says "never much good at cards.." damn great last line.)no tricky effects or camera moves. no shaky camera. nothing trendy at all. just solid, tight storytelling.maybe that makes the movie too basic and somehow flawed. but then again, so was the guy. and that makes it just about right.9/10

this movie has a "big production" feel that i was not expecting from an independent film. the characters are each developed and dealt with in a way that not only helps to tell the story, but left me with a satisfied viewing experience.

this scene shows how wallace's experiment by using his brain manipulation invention goes terribly wrong, creating the "were rabbit". his desire as a social entrepreneur is to improve society for the better, therefore, created a "brain manipulator" machine. he risked his own life to help solve tottington's pests' rabbit problem and more importantly to overcome the overcrowding of rabbits being collected and stored in his basement. though he thought his experiment worked, however, it resulted in placing more pressure on him and gromit to find a solution before the annual vegetable competition again risking his life. gromit, who is a silent faithful dog and a loyal helper finds himself continuously thinking of innovative ways to save his master, from his radical crazy inventions going terribly wrong. what is interesting in this movie, is trying to identify: who is more entrepreneurial, wallace or gromit?

going into this movie, i was a bit cautious. i have always been a bit iffy about claymation movies. i've always enjoyed decent animated movies, but claymation was always different to me. but this one caught me by surprise. wallace and gromit are extremely lovable characters, and it's a great story with jokes for all ages. there's the silly burp/fart jokes for the kids and the subtle, but over the head of young kids, jokes for us older people. very neat claymation and while the story had holes, it kept my interest beginning to end.it's so rare to find pure and uncorrupted humor these days, this movie was all the more refreshing. wallace and gromit go doing their normal thing, which is exterminating humanely the buggers that ruin people's vegetable crops. but this time they find themselves fighting some form of a freak huge rabbit that their humanely built traps can't even keep under tabs. great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun. if you have not exposed yourself to wallace and gromit, i highly recommend this movie.the only reason i rate it a 7 and not higher is because it's still a family movie and i don't have kids. i enjoyed it, but if i had been watching it with some little rug rats and my wife, it'd be at least a 9 for sure! give it a shot!

wallace & gromit have been around for some time, but this was their first foray onto the silver screen. fans of the british tv series, like myself, were eager to see them and the film did quite well in the theaters. much of the reason is that the film is fun and quite original. in a world of cg movies like shrek and toy story, this stop-motion film is a nice alternative to the trend in children's movies as well as being totally unlike a cartoon. plus, compared to much earlier stop-motion films (such as king kong and the ray harryhausen films such as sinbad), the quality and movement of the characters are light years better--looking very fluid, natural and more alive.apart from the quality of the animation, this movie also deserves kudos on every other level. first, the voice actors do a great job. second, the script is very simple but also very cute and enjoyable--with a few double-entendres that should probably go way over the kids' heads. third, they manage to make this not only a movie for kids but people of all ages as the film is neither saccharine nor aimed solely at the younger crowd. in particular, i was captivated by incredibly cute the film was--and especially the adorable bunnies. i especially liked them in the closing credits--which made me very happy i stayed to watch the entire film.the bottom line is that unless you are a real stick-in-the-mud, you will enjoy this film. it's fresh, funny and amazingly clever. i hope we see a sequel--and this is saying something, as i usually hate sequels.

the folks at aardman have done a cool, cute and wild adaptation of their short films of wallace and gromit to feature length, as the man and his dog, inventors who seem to have more of the intelligence (or practicality) for the latter. in this case they've invented a machine that can capture all of the bunnies that are eating up the crops all over a quiet english village. in particular for mrs. tottington (or 'totty' for those who are 'intimate'), much to the chagrin of victor quartermaine, who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trust rifle. wallace and gromit seem to have success with their machine, but wallace has a mix-up: a machine he's made to make more food suddenly criss-crosses himself with a rabbit - the curse is on! a lot of this is about as much light-hearted fun that a kid's movie could ask for, but it also tips its hat to the oldest tradition in classic cartoon slapstick: looney tunes, which in turn is indebted to much silent comedy and vaudeville. granted, the aardman guys (nick park and steve box) have a bunch more gimmicks and tricks and ingenuity with their material. it's never less than amazing to see how they put the stop motion to use, even when a joke or a gag might be a little on the funny "ho-ho" not funny "ha-ha" side (a tired criticism but i'll say it). curse of the were-rabbit works so well on all fronts for the audience, in its warped story and sudden dips into exposition (the golden bullet story is a doozy), park and box and company never lose sight of glee in the material.it's fuzzy and warm-hearted and completely off-the-wall for the kids (even the very youngest will love the adventures and strange gadgets, such as the truck wallace and gromit drive around in), and for adults there's little barbs of funky, absurdist tones in the midst of a classic english farce. only (and i'm probably a minority opinion here) when compared to chicken run it's almost a little slight a work- there's less any plot than there is a series of running gags, and of course lots of puns involving bunnies and monsters and carnivals and cheese (and horrible men with egos in their guns like the fiennes voiced quartermaine). but when it strikes best, it's one of the most entertaining films of 2005. it gives me a big goofy smile anytime it's on tv.

there was something about the original three films that made them so special and delightful - probably the length of them. unfortunately this lacks the charm, but it still ends up being a fun film. the bright, shimmering side is that our favourite plasticene figures are still doing a cracking great job, there is good plasticene animation used, there is a silly, but well-structured and entertaining plot, an exciting, fun adventure, a good plot idea (a were-rabbit and a giant vedgetable competition) and good new characters!as well as lacking the original charm, the only other slightly gloomy side of the film is that the humour, though good, is slightly overdone, especially compared to the original films.the popular giant vedgetable competition is drawing near and wallace and gromit are helping control rabbits from eating any vedgetables, now they are anti pesto. they are doing a good job, but soon, there is danger afoot. a were-rabbit is nearby...recommended to all wallace and gromit fans and to people who like plasticene films, enjoy "wallace and gromit: the curse of the wererabbit"! :-)

who can ask for more? taking my 2 and 4 year old children was a risk, i admit. but well worth it. they were enthralled from credit to credit, with their parents beside them.i have taken the kids to films before with mixed results: too scary, too boring, too sophisticated, whatever. with this film, however, i was glad to see a smart film with wit, style and a sense of passion emanating from the screen. any film that takes 5(!) years of production to make, good or bad, deserves some respect for the bravery and the patience it takes to film a film like this.o.k. i'm gushing a little. then again, why wouldn't i get excited? looking through the movie listing today only reminded me of the poor quality of films that are distributed. at least for the moment regardless, w & g is a film well made. perhaps the originality wasn't the most inspired, nevertheless, well told and well paced.too much adult humour? too many sex references? maybe. though my kids didn't quite catch them. too young. so, in my case, i didn't really notice.well, needless to say, i liked it.

this film is what most of the industry has forgotten how to make: family entertainment, meaning something which is enjoyable to people of all ages. this particular wallace & gromit can be enjoyed by everyone from toddlers who like the colors and cute bunnies to their grandparents who understand the adult references. this film has direction as good as any i've ever seen, and i mean that literally. it is also packed with tiny bits of humor, and each scene has so many humorous details in the background that i'm going to have to buy it, if only in order to read all the signs and handbills in w & g's world. i plan to see this movie at least twice more in theaters, then buy it on dvd. you too should see it.

imaginative, quick-paced, satirical! americans do 'zany', but the brits do 'witty' -- and they love to poke fun at themselves (ahem: unattractive teeth, large lips/nose, 'veddy' common or 'veddy' snobby, obsession with the 'gahden'). inside jokes for the older folk in the audience, lots of action for the kiddies. subtle use of devices from other classic films (watch for 'back to the future', 'indiana jones..', 'harvey', 'tremors'.. and more). also, a nifty 'buddy' film (gromit is a quiet, but resourceful sidekick). add brilliant voice work by bonham-carter and fiennes (is it true? the best acting these days is being done in animation?) - enjoy! i saw it with the grandkids. fun time for all. - canuckteach

but george and gracie's are not among them. the movie is fun and the pool table scene with wc fields has to be among the funniest i have ever seen but gracie and george are more irritating than comical in their roles, partly from script deficiency and partly from their interpretation. i gave it a 7 out of 10 for the rest of the cast, wc is a treasure of comedic timing and energy in this one.

i watched six of a kind for w.c. fields - he's only in it for around 10 minutes and has one long scene, the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville, and several other great moments. the reamaining 55 minutes are also delightful, thankfully, mostly due to the hilarious charlie ruggles as the bumbling banker j. pinkham whinney. he is everyone's foil. he stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure. also, his comedy partner, mary boland plays his wife, flora. joining in the proceedings are george burns and gracie allen. boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end, but gracie and ruggles use up most of the picture. gracie's funny, quite, but she can also get tiring. and poor george burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat gracie all the time. i don't remember laughing at him once (although he has one great scene with ruggles, where ruggles tries desperately to get george to take gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while, and one with fields, where he asks fields to sell him a sweater; that bit is exclusively fields', though). the situation is constantly funny: the whinneys are going to drive to california, but to help them with expenses, george and gracie are recruited. 8/10.

three zany couples, all six of a kind, become entangled in a madcap search for stolen bank loot.this is a lively, hilarious comedy, with the six stars - charlie ruggles & mary boland, w. c. fields & alison skipworth, george burns & gracie allen - all heartily engaged in doing what they did best: getting laughs.ruggles & boland make another of their film appearances as husband & wife - this time rather more amorous than usual. they were a perfect team - she the strident lioness, he the nervous rabbit - and they dominate most of the screen time here. from beginning to end, they are a delight.burns & allen continue the patter they originated in vaudeville, perfected on radio & would eventually take to television, with george the perpetual straight man & gracie the eternal fool. at times in the film she tends to go a bit over the top, but it's difficult to dislike her. her heart was obviously made of solid gold.while skipworth is given rather short shrift - only fragments of her formidable personality flash through - fields is in his element as the disreputable sheriff of nuggetville, nevada. whether explaining how he got the nickname honest john' or skulking about at night looking for the missing moola, he is never less than wonderful. best of all, he gets to perform his entire classic pool routine, preserving it forever for a grateful posterity. finally, he executes the near miraculous - he gets gracie to shut up.paramount was so pleased with the success of six of a kind that they wanted to hurry the principle players into another comedy. only fields demurred. he felt he had now arrived at the point where he no longer needed to share a movie with other celebrity comics. the studio finally agreed and began preparation of fields' first solo starring feature, you're telling me (1934).

that was one of the lines in a trailer about this film and for once the publicists did not exaggerate. all six of the featured players here are on the screen 99% of the time, so they have to be good.it's always fascinating how certain plot premises can be worked for either highballing comedy to a deadly serious situation. mary boland of the ditzy and charlie ruggles of the henpecked play their usual characters who are planning to motor all the way to california. to share expenses they advertise for someone to share the ride. they get burns and allen and a monster of a dog. that same premise was a deadly serious one several generations later in kalifornia.of course if you're traveling with gracie allen you know you're going to be going absolutely nuts trying to figure her monty pythonesque reasoning about the whole world. and if that ain't enough you get to run into w.c. fields, part time sheriff and full time pool hustler who's living in sin with alison skipworth. but back then we didn't delve into such things.a real classic comedy from the thirties, not to be missed.

it is not always certain that by mixing comedians together you will produce laughter. the comics involved have to actually like or admire each other, or be willing to put up with each other's crankiness. go west with the marx brothers had buster keaton write the script as a gag man. groucho did not think too highly of keaton's ideas, and embarrassed him at a script meeting. and though some of keaton's gems still appear in the finished film (such as the gun that turns into a brush that turns into a gun) the film was one of the weakest the marx brothers ever made.a better film, but also affected by dueling comic egos, was w.c. fields and mae west in my little chickadee, which jettisoned the script for a series of duels of one liners between the leads. but the one liners were equally funny, so the film remains a success.but six of a kind is an example of six film comics who worked well together. the reason is simple: it is really three comic teams working together: charlie ruggles and mary boland, george burns and gracie allan, and w.c. fields and alison skipworth. ruggles and boland were paired in about half a dozen comedies during the 1930s, usually with boland as a somewhat bossy wife, and ruggles as a nervous wreck of a husband. fields (usually a single act) was paired three times with skipworth (tilly and gus and if i had a million were the other two times). skippy always figured out how to control or counter the larcenous activities of her man - it the present film she takes action into her own hands with the stolen money that is being searched for (she knows that the local sheriff, fields, is not the one to trust with this). as for burns and allan they manage to effortlessly involve themselves with the put upon ruggles and boland on their cross-country trip by car.ruggles quickly gets to realize what a mistake it was to agree to travel with gracie - at one point she manages to cause him to fall off a cliff, and dangle from a branch. he is relatively helpless when she insists on 1) photographing him on his perch, and 2) correcting his grammar. the presence of george and gracie's humongous dog ("ran tang tang" is it's name) does not make travel arrangements easier for charlie and mary.fields has some choice moments. when he insists on shouting at the quartet, he says he's allowed to do so - he's the sheriff! he also explains, during a pool game, the improbable story of how he got his undeserved moniker "honest john". you have to listen carefully to the tale, as it is interrupted with his attempts to play pool a few times (once getting accidentally beaned by a billiard ball), but it does show that there were items that even fields would have had no reason to steal.oh, in the "summary line", i mentioned a forgotten actor named bradley page - he was the man who is responsible for the trouble that charley ruggles is suspected of. bradley has to have a reason to leave town in order to catch up with the unwary ruggles and boland, so he telephones his girl friend. he tells her to call back his job and say that he has to leave town because somebody has died. there is a pause as he apparently hears a question shot back by the girlfriend. "anybody!", he says - clearly annoyed. although the bulk of the humor in the film is carried by the sextet of performers, mr.page happened to have the most amusingly unexpected line in the film.

michelle pfeiffer stars as a mob widow who seeks a normal life but has her hands full with the new boss and an undercover agent. a lighthearted demme film with some good laughs and pfeiffer in a comical role that she has fun with..on a scale of one to ten..8

nicely done evil little comedy pitting the fbi against organized crime with a nice lady caught in the middle. the actress who played the jealous wife of the mob boss 'tony the tiger' almost stole the show with her raging tantrums. 3 stars

strange but acceptable mob comedy that has an undercover fbi agent (matthew modine) flirting with a mobster's concerned widow (michelle pfeffier) to tie two murders on a elusive mob boss (dean stockwell).the movie shows that it doesn't have to go over the top just to be funny and director jonathan demme ("the silence of the lambs", "philadelphia") keeps the movie from looking like it being was restrained. that's good and it avoids being predictiable, too.

i'm surprised with the amount of negative reviews on this film. if you don't like this movie for what it is - a silly, over-the-top, mob story - then you are simply reading too much into it. this film is a classic tale of a mob wife trying to escape "the life" and the troubles that follow her. michelle pfeiffer is terrificly 80's 'jersey, who is an uncertain, uncomfortable mob wife while matthew modine is an anal retentive-like mob tracking cop who falls for her. the plot is mostly predictable and cutesy and mercedes ruel steals the show as the queen of mob wives. if you aren't looking for something too dynamic and complex, this movie is absolutely entertaining and an 80's cult classic. you won't be able to stop watching if you start.

great characters, great acting, great dialogue, incredible plot twists in plain language one of the best shows i've ever seen in my life. do yourself a favor and watch this show, you won't regret it. this show re-writes the book on sci-fi!

faqrscape is truly one of those shows that just has it all, great acting,great cast,great writing,sets,chemistry,muppets...it's got it all and then some, except a home. this fantastic series it's seem has it all except and ending. tptb seem to think this is a series that is consecutive single set shows, when anyone who watches know this is an ongoing ,one epic, love story, that has an end that must been seen. if you have never watched farscape do youself a favor and check it out on dvd when the season 1 will be released in october....and season 2 is the best there is! watch the reruns on the scifi channel to catch up and then the new season starts in january through march when most shows are going in to hiatis and be sure to watch. if all goes well we will get our ending!

farscape totally rules! in my opinion it's very close to babylon five although there are only 7 main characters in the series (spaceship included). the humour is excellent and the writers manage to keep the show interesting though pretty much everything happens on the ship.what i really love and appreciate in farscpae is,that they don't use cgi for the alien characters or if they do, it's unnoticeable. they use those lovable, crappy rubber animatronic puppets very similar to the ones used in the original star wars.farscape is something you definitely want to look into, if you already haven't.

when we are young, we all pick out an ideal occupation for ourselves: artist, actor, writer, rocket scientist, etc.. while most of us grow out of our pipe dreams, the main character of american movie, mark, has yet to let go of his(and at a thirty-something age too): to become a wealthy acclaimed director. despite the fact that murphy's law won't leave mark alone and something always seems to go wrong, mark is able to persevere during each deterring incident with an even greater drive to reach his goals. his desire to be a director so controls his character that he sees any person or thing in his life as something to exploit to reach the goal. while i noticed other imdb commenters are lambasting mark's selfishness, i think it's an almost justified sort-of selfishness because for mark, not becoming a famous director is equivalent to death. he talks incessantly about leaving some kind of mark on the world, and he sees filmmaking as a way to do this.unfortunately any viewer of this movie picks up early on the fact that mark has a near-zero chance of ever achieving his dream. is he aware of this? no, not in the slightest, and none of his family or friends want to let him in on the secret(in fact even some of them believe in him). strangely enough though, the disappointing future the viewer feels is sure to occur for mark doesn't impede the ability to find humor in the film. this is a very very funny documentary. most of the laughs come from when mark is filming scenes for "coven". there's a scene where an actor has to have his head break a cupboard, and it's just not working. another scene has mark's very old uncle bill saying a few lines to the camera; needless to say, after 20 takes of a lot of headscratching and line-stumbling bill finally decides he's had enough. a lot of humor sadly comes from mark himself. his screenwriting, which he seems to think is worthy of a pulitzer, is laughingly bad: "it's alright, it's ok, there is something to live for; jesus told me so.""american movie" is, contrary to what people might think, a documentary that anyone can enjoy(even though my sister, who watched some scenes, seemed to think it was downright bizarre). the fact that chris smith can successfully bring to the screen a film that inspires both sadness from mark's depressing lifestyle to hilarity with scenes with bill(who unfortunately passed away before the film was released) says quite a lot about him. i wonder how the dreamer mark regards this documentary. does he realize that it casts him in a bad light? or that it sets up to show him as a fool in many scenes of the film? or does he see it as something that will be shown prior to his own a&e biography segment? it's an intriguing subject of wonder, and i hope the latter comes true for him some day.i highly recommend this movie: 9/10.

for me, the best & most memorable movies are often those which on first viewing i know nothing about. american movie is a perfect example of just such a gem. watching tv late one evening, i spotted the one & only good review among the dross - thankfully i settled in for a real treat. american movie is a documentary following the unforgettable mark borchardt (pronounced "orchard", i believe), a highly articulate & charismatic wisconson lad, as he struggles to write, direct and produce "midwestern", a gritty, low-budget horror movie on which he has been working for years. in mark we discover a young man filled with contrast. his appearance is of the classic trailer-trash stereotype - skinny, bum-fluff mustache, '80s heavy metal styling, mullet hairdo, etc. to camera however, mark reveals startling wit & insight as he philosophizes upon life, love, movies & the american way. as the movie unfolds, it sadly becomes clear that mark's lack of discipline & heavy drinking are relentlessly sabotaging his creative efforts. american movie is a charming watch, filled with hilarious moments & vivid characters. chief among these is mark's lovable buddy mike schank, a soft-spoken reformed stoner who, having conquered an addiction to scratch cards, is now dependent on soda pop. i absolutely loved american movie. it generates real empathy between the viewer & principal characters, and provides hilarity without feeling exploitative. i would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.

looking for proof that real life is more entertaining than fiction? you just found it. this superb documentary about an aspiring feature filmmaker (mark bortchart) who refuses to admit defeat is the funniest film i have ever seen -- probably because it's also one of the most tragic. oddly enough, the more i watch the film the more inspired i become.

this documentary is the most hypnotizing film i have seen in a long while. i must have had it on for an entire day. the selected material included in the piece flow amazingly well and develop three characters that are impossible to ever forget. the different layers of these people peel back to make an oddly moving film about perseverance, loyalty and determination. these characters ended up suprisingly fascinating and the film is unforgettable.

okay, so i'm a sucker for a good documentary, particularly where it tells a modern-day don quixote story. a caveat: i met mark borchardt in the winter of 1995/96 while he was still working on coven. but i'll save that story for later. american movie, which commenced production not long after, accurately portrays the person that i knew, although in greater depth than i expected or believed existed. this is simultaneously a very funny and very sad film, and is brilliantly executed. mark comes across as his own worse enemy: his childlike ambition and optimism -- which i admire -- is undermined by his apparent artistic ineptitude as well as his bizarre fiscal expectations. but he's also a charismatic guy. his loyal sancho panza sidekick is equally likeable: loyal, if frazzled, to the core. like don quixote, american movie presents an often-ignored inefficient aspect of freedom -- that people will be drawn toward professions to which they are not particularly well-suited, irrespective of repeated failure. it is a great film.

this depiction of forlorn japanese forces in the philipines is a tour de force in the utter meaninglessness of war. it is an effective representation of japanese pacifist views after ww ii. in the movie, japanese soldiers have been left to fend for themselves in the jungles of the philipines. faced with impending starvation they resort to cannibalism and gradually lose what little humanity they have left. to call this film depressing would be something of an understatement. the viewer is left with an utterly despairing sense of life's lost value in modern combat. the final scene is almost too nihilistic but the film is a worthy statement none-the-less. highly recommended.

they are hunted and starving. they are completely demoralized and yet they press on through sheer inertia. this film tries to answer the question "how far will human beings go to survive?" hopelessness emanates from every of this film and like so many japanese films of this time, it condemns the blind military loyalty that pressed the japanese people into war.

the end of suburbia, as it should appeal to general citizens & mass consumers alike, is likely to become of cultural reform status. the film uses super-cynical analysis by authors, policy makers, and social philosophers on the paradox created by suburban-style living--mainly in the post-war era.what we have created in america is a place with "none of the amenities of country life, and none of the amenities of urban city life." this is the prescription that is laid out for suburbia, and the film focus's on the singular idea of "oil". basically, in the most general sense, that the world is nearing or at it's peak oil production, and when we realize this in full, major lifestyle changes will be in effect, whether by our best interest or forced violently upon us by a quality of living even the slum-dwellers of calcutta couldn't describe to us.if nothing more, the end of suburbia will siphon the viewer flush in their gut, creating a sickening feeling. this is bound to happen. it's a bleak outlook on our inherent way of life. the ambivalence lies particularly in each respective viewers critical analysis of the film. i foresee many unprepared viewers slandering the film as smug liberal propaganda--like a michale moore film. what they fail to consider is that a reaction like this is all too normal when such a message hits so unbelievably hard to the lifestyle of the vast majority of the masses.this is the truth, and as a student studying city planning, i can tell you that we better get prepared now, because what slim chance we have of maintaining quality of life in this dwindling cesspool of tampered resources is fading faster than a race of people stricken by the black plague.

the end of suburbia is an important documentary about modern dependence on cheap energy and the coming peak in world oil production. the film is an excellent introduction to the peak oil phenomenon, and includes interviews with experts like adviser to vice president dick cheney's 2001 energy task force. mathew simmons, author richard heinberg, "powerdown - options and actions for a post-carbon world" and author michael t. klare, "blood and oil - the dangers and consequences of america's growing dependency on imported petroleum."economic growth is predicated upon more electricity. electricity is predicated on hydro-carbon energy. period. and mathew simmons made a very clear statement, he said: "future growth is not possible". and for a guy from his background to say that was one of the most.. that's like the catholic church saying the earth is round before galileo" - michael c. ruppert "the peak has happened. and now, instead of being prophets, we're now historians." - kenneth deffeyes

a truly scary film. happening across curmudgeon james kunstler's rants led me to recently-formed web logs like life after the oil crash (latoc), energy bulletin, and the oil drum, and the data behind the theory of hubbert's peak. like this film, latoc and kunstler paint a grim picture of die-off or die-back. i hope they're premature, but in mid-2005 rising gasoline prices, rising oil prices, chevron's will you join us campaign, bp becoming beyond petroleum and even t boone pickens lend credence to the idea that we are at or near a peak of oil production.after copious research of limited data, oil investment banker matt simmons has suggested that the saudis may no longer be able to increase production in their immense, but aging fields. in the face of increased demand (primarily from the us and china), the saudis have not responded with higher production, despite previous assurances. stated world production from 2000 and 2004 indicates that light, sweet crude has indeed peaked. which means that refining will become more costly.the film seems aimed at baby boomers, but younger people, our children, also need to understand the implications of an energy-depleted future.

fans of the pink panther, naked gun, or get smart will certainly enjoy this farce that won one césar and was nominated for four more.jean dujardin is agent oss 117, a man who wouldn't know a clue if it hit him upside the head. he is also a reflection of the colonialist attitude indicative of the west.all of the russian spies, nazis, and muslim radicals around him are just as stupid, but there is larmina (bérénice bejo) and the princess (aure atika) to keep things interesting.oss 117's uncanny ability to pick up languages, play musical instruments the first time he picks them up, and sing like a native are all more impressive than bond's tricks, but he is still stupid.

the two new oss 117 movies has a kind of humor which is both intelligent and dumbed-down at the same time, which i find extremely amusing. it really reminds me of the classic pink panther movies with an almost as good leading man as peter sellers in jean dujardin. and unlike steve martin completely ruining clouseau, dujardin is quite brilliant.the comments regarding the movies' being anti-semitic, are obviously a case of a complete lack of humor and therefor understanding.whether you will enjoy or hate this movie really comes down to what kind of humor you have. i can't wait for the sequel!

saw the move while in paris in may 2006 ... i was debating between that and mission impossible...i am very glad i choose oss 117 not only because it was funny but might as well watch a french movie while in france. i had a great time... would recommend it. it is important to have some understanding the french society of today to really enjoy the humor of this movie ... cannot wait for the dvd to come out... i don't know how some of the 'jeu de mots' 'puns' would be translated in english i 'll certainly buy it when it is out! p.s. i saw on 'brice de nice' which is a movie starring dujardin that all kids were talking about in france. this movie is a comedy but sillier than one can imagine...in comparing both movies i have to say that dujardin did a good job in oss 117.

this is the latest entry in the long series of films with the french agent, o.s.s. 117 (the french answer to james bond). the series was launched in the early 1950's, and spawned at least eight films (none of which was ever released in the u.s.). 'o.s.s.117:cairo,nest of spies' is a breezy little comedy that should not...repeat not, be taken too seriously. our protagonist finds himself in the middle of a spy chase in egypt (with morroco doing stand in for egypt) to find out about a long lost friend. what follows is the standard james bond/inspector cloussou kind of antics. although our man is something of an overt xenophobe,sexist,homophobe, it's treated as pure farce (as i said, don't take it too seriously). although there is a bit of rough language & cartoon violence, it's basically okay for older kids (ages 12 & up). as previously stated in the subject line, just sit back,pass the popcorn & just enjoy.

i loved this film and recommend it to anyone who like a good spy spoof and who thought johnny english was an embarrassment. this is the film je should have been. but it's based on an old french films series so it's not really bond related.the production is brilliant, you'll almost believe the film was shot back in the 60's. it even has that same pastel kind of colouring films had in those days. jean dujardin plays his part with just the right amount of dumbness and naivety, not with ham fisted pantomime silliness like rowan atkinson and even if you don't like the film, you will want to see it for berenice bejo. ooh la la! she is the hotness ...

oss 117 was fun from start to finish.it's difficult to define why one film touches or connects with you or not, and i won't try to analyze such perfect comedy, so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be dedicated to it :)!everything is old fashioned here, from women's clothes (sigh!), mambo dance, the "hero singing"... ("bambino" sounds like an italian canzonetta sung in... arabic :)!).hubert is physically imposing, but dumb as hell. from all the 007s, he looks like sean connery, but is definitely more sympa because he's... silly, speaks his mind all the time, giggles, even has some homoerotic fantasies and there are rumours about him. in short, as an anti hero, he rocks :)! sometimes he only raises his eyebrows or frowns, and that's all it takes to make you laugh. bérénice bejo is the true queen of the film. graceful, treacherous but with ideals. aure atika, to the contrary, is reduced to a femme fatale of sorts. it's surprising to see her that "sexy bomb", thou.you just can't compare it with "austin powers"! i agree with amazon's d. hartley (seattle, wa) on it being respectful to the genre.which is your favourite scene? one of my favourite scenes is the "fight of the chickens" with the masked villain. but the truly perfect one is when chatting at the cocktail with his contacts, how they all mutter platitudes with confidence... this scene alone makes the comedy genre worthwhile.

jean dujardin gets connery's mannerisms down pat: the adjusting the cuff links when entering a club as all the women turn to admire him, the nonchalant straightening and smoothing down of the tie, the swaggering, steely gait. it's uncanny, and you come to realise just how much of bond in the sixties was connery's creation and not really ian fleming's character. the cinematography is a nod to those early films, the movie takes off from russia with love and thunderball mainly. the main joke is how chauvinistic the hero is, not just in terms of sexism but nationalism and colonialism, and how he puts noses out of joint when he is sent to egypt. it's not perfect - about 20 mins in it seems a one-joke movie and bits of it remind one of spoofs of the day, of which there were plenty. morcecambe and wise's the intelligence men had suspect-looking men in fez's following their heroes around too, and that's going back a bit. unlike sellers' clouseau or baron cohen's borat, dujardin doesn't give his character that layer of realness or genuine pathos - he is too busy perfecting his connery mannerisms. it doesn't do enough with the credits or a big song, and there's no funny or serious villain, like mike myers' dr evil or ricardo montalban's naked gun nemesis, for the hero to go up against.but the scene where oss117 wakes up in cairo one morning had me laughing out loud in the three-quarters empty cinema, and the whole thing looks wonderful, plus you'll never get a chance to see operation kid brother on the screen, and the women are ace crumpet, really hot. it's a bond spoof without falling into the mad scientist/ken adam sets or funny gadgets routine. throughly recommended.

'rejseholdet' is one of the best new danish tv-series that i have watched.the series is about the danish police force's unit 1 - a kinda fbi-style team that help solve murder cases all over the country, and the cases they work on, plus the influence that their jobs have on their personal lives, and the price they sometimes has to pay to be a part of a top police team.i didn't expect much when i started watching this series - i was pleasantly surprised, the series is exciting, sometimes fun, it's got both drama and suspense, i love it.

this production, build on real danish crime stories, is a experience through excellent directing, acting on all levels and has a nerve not often seen in crime series. every episode is a thrill because it's seems like the hole team believe that "this is my life right now - this murder or murders are my responsibility to solve" and the output is brilliant.as a viewer, you just have this wonderfully filling of being entertained cause it feels like their focus, on purpose or not, lie on that they wont you to have a good time...:o) don't miss this one, it's just right under 'band of brothers' quality and is a "must have seen" experience - what a wonderful crime time !

this is one of the best non-english series i have seen. it weaves interesting single and double episodes of crime-solving together with a personal aspect that you just don't get in csi. the individual characters all have personal lives that combine well with their day job and occasionally interfere. additionally the characters all manage to naturally evolve throughout the episodes.the casting is superb and it was taped all over denmark, giving a good example of the highlights that majestic country has to offer. unfortunately only 32 episodes were made, however they are top-notch television. here's hoping they consider making some more episodes of the same caliber.

first off, i'm an american -- i haven't seen any comments on imdb about this series yet from a u.s. viewer. secondly, i work in the television business in development. so i wallow in much of the sludge that comes out of american broadcast programming. "unit one" is an example of television that's a throwback to what i would attribute as '70s-style scripting, feature-wise. namely, those films made by young autueurs who had free rein to make the dramas feel more realistic and to allow for organic character development. it tacks more along the lines of stellar british dramas like "cracker" and "prime suspect" as well as australia's brilliant "underbelly." "unit one" features stand-alone cases that are committed, then solved, each week. the mysteries aren't extraordinary or particularly byzantine. they usually center around one single twist, clocking in generally at the 40 minute mark, and resolution is neatly wrapped up in the 15 minutes thereafter. what makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it features main characters that you are hooked on and find relatable by episode 2. these are real, breathing, alive characters that have personal baggage, yet it's not a talky, batty type of baggage that american flotsam such as "grey's anatomy" or "desperate housewives" spoons out. these are realistic individuals whose backstories unfold leisurely over the course of the series, as if you work with them on a daily basis. after the mindless decade of "csi's," "ncis's," and "criminal minds," along with their subsequent spawns, it's refreshing to actually sit down to watch friends you want to spend time with, as is the case with "unit one." the quippy banter, the unemotional wooden dialogue, and the over-the-top jeopardy that those american series i mentioned bludgeon us with each week are absurd compared to the nuance and the quiet resonance you get with this remarkable danish series. i'm on episode 7 of the first season, but i've already bought all four seasons and am in for the long haul. if you need explosions and farcically-hopped up testosterone, along with music by the who and fast-cutting, neon-lit, jittery palsy-cam action with cipher-like main characters as your main diet of television drama viewing, i suggest you stay away from this series. if you are an adult with a hunger for subtle, poignant, thoughtful and, yes, sometimes straight-forward procedural crime dramas, i urge you to check this show out.

we've just watched the last of the series shown on the sbs network and will miss our weekly dose of danish delight. my wife and i picked up the show after the swedish show "the eagle" finished and it seemed by comparison to be a very poor substitute for our then favourite show on tv. week by week, however, the show grew on me, and whilst not as glossy as the swedish show and definitely grittier in terms of their investigations of everyday crimes, it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly viewing meal indeed.prior to these 2 shows i had not really been a fan of the cop genre and can't say i am now but the 2 scandinavian shows really provided us with an insight into life in those northern euopean countries through the eyes of their special policing units.

have just seen the last episode, no 32, (though the site says only 30 episodes were made) and i must comment on the fact that this series was really very good and i would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys crime/cop stories. supposedly all 32 were based on fact with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes, this has at times been a gritty, well acted, believable and dare i say, entertaining series. the fact that the powers in denmark decided to disband the unit was almost unbelievable as they did their work so well and in the series at least, never failed to "get their man"! it's a definite 10/10 for me.

this film is about aging geisha in post war tokyo. okin, played by the incredible haruko sugimara, lends money to two other ex geisha, tamae (chikako hosokawa) and otomi (yuko mochizuki) and they resent the way she is somewhat smug about it. tamae has a son, otomi a daughter, who during the film announce they're leaving them while okin, never a mother, gets visits from two men in her past who, it turns out, just want money from her. its a compelling tale of what choices you make, what you do to get through life and who you're responsible and beholden to. haruko sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character actresses ever from any country and she plays the mostly unyielding, less than compassionate okin with an air of superiority that makes you not like her, but at the same time almost envy her. at a time when great films were made by ozu, mizoguchi, kinoshita and kurosawa, amongst others, mr. naruse is right up there with him. if you have a region free dvd player, you should attempt to find the two naruse box sets released in england. i think this film was a great character study of women who are in danger of being irrelevant. that they are really not makes this film a veritable masterpiece.

naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of japanese film, the other two being ozu and mizoguchi. this is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired geishas. whatever happens, when such a woman ages, and loses her charm and mystique? well, for those who are interested, watch this film. one: okin, is successful as a money-lender, but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful. okin doesn't have any children, but the other do. okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her, and is excited. naruse is a master in subtle studies of his female protagonists' characters. bangiku ultimately draws the viewer into the study of the questions of ones happiness, and one's life-worth. very good film indeed.

a look at three geishas who are way past their prime. now they look back on their pasts with fondness and bemoan their present. kin (played by floating weeds' haruko sugimura) has sworn off men and has made a good living as a moneylender; everyone on the block owes her. the other two, nobu and tamae, wish they could land husbands, but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will. meanwhile, their children - one has a son and one a daughter - are both about to get married (not to each other). tamae is irked at how much prettier her daughter has become than her, and bitterly tries to convince her not to marry the man. nobu's concerns about her son are more legitimate in nature, but they are also (understandably) self-serving. after her son leaves, she'll be alone. a bit into the film, two of kin's former clients come looking for her, one a man so obsessed with her that he tried to get her to commit double suicide with him, the other one of her handsomest clients. unfortunately, he comes for her money, not her love. the way i've described the film makes it sound unrelentingly depressing, but it's really not. sad, but not fatally so. it's more bittersweet. unfortunately, i only marginally liked late chrysanthemums. the story seems better when i look back on it, but it is very slow and dull. i actually nodded off twice during the film, and i wasn't at all tired before i started it. this is the kind of film that i can appreciate more than like; it reminds me very much of my reaction to a couple of ozu's more famous films. 7/10.

mikio naruse's examination of the lives of three idling, constantly complaining, single ex-geishas in post-war japan is a wonderful character piece. they used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her. although the moneylender is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy, she is the only one of the three that has no children. the other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income, because neither of them work. complications ensue when the kids decide to get married (though not to each other) and leave home. this leads to the bitter, grumbling old women to become even more bitter and grumbling, getting drunk and bemoaning their rotten children and inconsiderate friend the moneylender. meanwhile the moneylender is herself unhappy, despite her fortunes. she has no one besides her young deaf maid to keep her company and chance encounters with two former lovers from her geisha days lead nowhere - all they really want is to borrow money from her. the three characters are all neck-deep in the quicksand of their own bored lives and are too weary to struggle much, usually opting instead to resign themselves to the futility of it all or, at the very most, toss complaints back and forth to each other."late chrysanthemums" is very slow-moving and not much actually happens but naruse, like all great directors, has the ability to do much with very little. i haven't seen much of his work but i suspect that this isn't his best, even though it is very good. the problem, i think, is that it all doesn't seem to amount to much. but the film is full of good points. although it is cynical, it isn't overly so. naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters, and he paints vivid portraits that make the characters seem even somewhat noble in the squalor of their self-made misery. while the film isn't a must-see, it is important as a fragment of the work of a great little-known (outside of his own country) director, precious little of which is available on video here in the u. s.

for me, "late chrysanthemums" was interesting not only because it was my first film of naruse i completely enjoyed, but because it was technically as modern and innovative as his 30s work i've seen. this doesn't mean innovative editing in the way godard would introduce it with "breathless" in 1959, but quite the opposite.the editing was as fluent as in the best of hollywood films from the 30s/40s, but at the same time incredibly fitting regarding the way he was telling his story. unlike them, it never purposefully accentuated anything or tried to make itself "invisible" but, together with the cinematography, made me feel like i was traveling on a gentle stream, constantly feeling the waves beneath me, like a gentle stroke of the hand or the almost unnoticeable rocking of a cradle. in this sense the film was comparable to ozu's and mizoguchi's work, but somehow even more subtle.what was so modern was the fact that the editing seemed almost a character in itself, similar to the remarkable camera-work in dreyer's ordet (1954) or vredens dag (1943) which is revealing us a deeper understanding of the film and its characters rather than simply showing them to us.i feel that naruse's editing and cinematography are the most interesting aspects of his films, elevating the stories significance beyond the obvious. the wonderful sets and settings shouldn't be forgotten either! i found the story itself to be rather conventional.the narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way, and i thought that the first half of the film was setting up a delicately ingenious spectrum of emotions and interrelations. unfortunately the second half of the film and its resolution were rather didactic and and formulaic compared to the set up (though by itself it would have been perfectly fitting in any other - less complex - film). somehow i felt that he failed a bit in trying to dissolve the many layers he had woven. maybe he should have kept them intact. this criticism might seem a bit harsh to a viewer of this film, especially since the procedure is again reminiscent to the way ozu dealt with the plot in his films. unfortunately i haven't yet the feeling that naruse was able to elevate the story and its characters in his films' conclusions in a similarly sublime fashion. the best efforts i have seen to date - ukigumo (floating clouds / 1955) and midaregumo (scattered clouds / 1967) - sustained the energy he had built throughout the narrative, while delivering poignant and resonant endings.this is already more than most director's are able to do, and in my opinion the basis for a real mastery of the cinematic medium. in this regard, and considering the resonance of the last two films i've seen by him, he may have already become one of my favorites.the only problem i have at the moment, is where i'm going to see more of his films on the big screen.

sadness and nostalgia permeate late chrysanthemums, a 1954 film by japanese auteur mikio naruse, now undergoing a retrospective of his long unavailable films thanks to james quandt of cinematheque ontario and the japan foundation. based on three stories by fumiko hayashi, late chrysanthemums tells the story of four retired geishas, now middle-aged, whose lives have become full of disappointment and regret. performance are uniformly outstanding, particularly that of haruko sugimura, who starred in films by ozu's late spring, floating weeds, and tokyo story among others. sugimura portrays kin, a former geisha who has no children and lives only with her young maid who is unable to speak.she has become cynical about men and has turned her attention to money, particularly real estate speculation and loaning money to her friends, nobu (sadako sawamura), tamae (chikako hosokawa), and tomi (yuko mochizuki), all former geishas. kin's friends live in meager circumstances and complain about how kin has become greedy and tomi spends considerable time gambling to try and make ends meet. both tomi and tamae are in the process of losing their children. tamae's son is leaving to work in the coalmines in hokkaido, and tomi's daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an older man. both resist the change in their circumstances but come to accept it as inevitable.two male friends visit kin, seki a former lover with whom she once contemplated double suicide, and tabe (ken uehara), another lover who she looks forward to seeing again after many years. her mood is upbeat but soon turns to resentment when she discovers that the two men are only interested in borrowing money. naruse cuts between two extended sequences seamlessly as kin confronts tabe and tomi and tamae console each other over the loss of their children the dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are women of strength who, though their future does not seem bright, refuse to see themselves merely as victims. late chrysanthemums has the simplicity, humor, and stoic acceptance of life prominent in the films of ozu and is a bittersweet reminder of the slow passing of time and the comfort that memory and companionship can bring along the way.

subtle, delicate ,touching.a young man in a summer dress on a bike like incarnation of perfect joy. history of a coming -out and anatomy of relationship.soft ambiguous gestures, slices of desire and a day like space of innocent miracle expression.two men, a girl, a afternoon on beach, some words and a gift. religious traces and a pantheist vision. cercle of light and expression, nooks of an ordinary day and hot evening.a erotic chaste film in which the gay identity or the first sexual relation are only instruments for good definition of a universe with sensitives values.pledge for self- discover, universe of beauty exploration, the sign of ozon and same nostalgic air of every creation, "robe d'ete" is a splendid occasion to understand the moment like projection of dream, to look, with emotion and child soul the essence of the essence beyond the images or people.

i expected it to be good, after i'd seen some other ozon's superb moments, and read much about it... but this movie is brilliant - clever, very bright (emotionally and visionally), perfect in all moments. every movement is there for a reason, everything fits so closely and primordially true and honest. this is the movie about the beauty and innocence; about it's simplicity.

there's not a dull moment in francois ozon's "robe d'ete". it's surprising how much is packed into this short film. while reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim, a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette. she invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach. on returning to the beach. they find that all his clothes have been stolen. she lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and requests he return it next day. he rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl. his gay companion is sexually excited. early next morning the young man returns to the sea and bids farewell to the girl whose holiday has ended. she suggests he keep the dress as a memento of their summer romance. it's a light-hearted film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea, but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes.

i'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur ozon. i've seen only 4 films so far, and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions. not a single non-lonely female character out of 12, and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings.this film is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is for good.the gay theme is an almost standard part of background for ozon's films, so it doesn't grab the accent (although the looks of the characters might). watch for the feelings, not for their objects.very nice and fleeting, truly like a summer romance, and while being a relaxation to thought and mind, it gives some food for the soul.

this is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind. one knows it's going to about a mute, one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentiment.well, forget it. the movie starts with a little black humour, and then gets started. from then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of moscow. all right, it must be said: the unexpected twists are expected, and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder. but this movie doesn't let you go.it's like the old gangster movies, but then without any glamour at all and in russia. and that's one of the most important aspects of this movie: it's situated in russia. this does have a great impact on the movie, according to me it makes it better. everything becomes simple and basic, life is without nonsense. this could be a great potential for more movies in the future, gangster movies about the russian mafia.it is a beautifull and terrifying movie. it's horror, but you can't feel but sympathy for the little mute. one last advice: don't look this too late in the evening if you want to sleep well.

first half of the movie scared the hell out of me and normally i'm not easy to scare, but second half of this thriller didn't work quite a well, but still very scary! a good thriller, than use simple ways to make good horror. lowbudget, set in russia, unknown cast, and made in europe. but still great fun, and yes there is a few laughs throw in for good matters as well!

if you want to see a true thriller, rent this!!! it's not from the director or screenwriter of "scream", doesn't feature overacting, overpaid "tv" actors passing off as "stars", and is not a run of the mill special effects bonanza. instead you'll get a top-notch, edgy, very strong (in violence) yet thrilling nailbiter.

well, this film came on on a workday at 230am. the cute little actress who played billy caught my attention initially and after the 1st 15 minutes i was held captive to my television till the very end. it has you on the edge of your seat, then throws in clever bits of comedy during the most tense sequences.the only draw back is that the story was not substantial enough to fill hour an a half film, causing certain sequences to drag just a little. nonetheless, it was still very entertaining, and i recommended it to all my co-workers the next day.

mute witness is a modest, yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves. the film  written and directed entirely by anthony waller  is a tense, action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences. no pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twistsjust straight to the point mystery. mute witness handles about the vicious topic of `snuff'-movies and is effectively set in russia. *** spoilers *** since the production costs are cheaper there, a us film crew temporarily moves to russia for shooting a horror film. an old hangar is used as film location. the female make-up artist of the team accidentally gets locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out, she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff-movie! she's caught and tries to escape but, since she's a mute, she can't cry for help and neither can she explain what she saw to the police properly. the girl's life is in real danger now, since there's a whole hidden network behind these snuff productions and they don't want the witnesses to be alive *** end spoilers ***. mute witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequences and is rather bloody. some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end. regarding the similar topic, i'd say it's definitely better than the more famous `8 mm', directed by joel schumacher and starring nicolas cage. the acting in mute witness isn't great, but the leading actress (who's russian herself) looks really cute. sir alec guinness makes a special appearance, too. and a very cool one, i may say. surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares.

this is a very good movie. i give it a 10.it's very different in that it's kind of a long stalking scene all the way through. the fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable way.she sees a murder (for a snuff-movie) and decides to run but is chased (this takes quite some time). i won't reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience, but rest assured: it's very believable, well played, very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great ending.don't miss this movie.

superbly crafted low-budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and plenty of ghoulish humour along the way as well.the cast play it very well, although richards' self-centered movie director is a bit hard to take at times. the tiny two-scene cameo by sir alec guinness, oozing menace as the crime czar of moscow, is simply the icing on the cake.well worth repeated viewing, but not on dark nights when you're all alone!

an intense thriller about a mute movie make-up artist who witnesses a snuff film being made when she is working late in the studio one night. after she tries to get away from the murder scene, she realizes she is in for more than she bargained for when the entire mafia is out to kill her for being a witness. this movie leaves you on the edge of your seat.

this is definitely one of the most scary and spell-binding films ever made. you are stuck to the movie from the beginning to the very end. even though there are some plot holes, it keeps being exciting to the final showdown. besides "8 mm" and "peeping tom" this is one of the best films about "snuff movies", a taboo theme of our culture. if you like the scream trilogy, you will probably love that one.

i love this movie ! i think i've seen it 5 times already (it was quite a success in france and they often play it on tv). ok, it's a thriller and there is great tension. but mostly (and specifically in the second part) it is absolutely hilarious ! and very original. the directing and photography are just splendid.

i've waited 9 years to watch this film, simply because i never saw it advertised on tv. eventually i caught it and it was well worth the wait. it's much better than your over-hyped scream or last summer garbage because it's all at a fairly quick pace, with no drawn out, creeping through the house to cheesy music scenes. only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but don't let that put you off in any way. what lies beneath - over hyped and crap. mute witness - low budget, not hyped at all and very good.

the plot is somewhat original, and all the actors did their job pretty well. there is a plenty of comic relief, too. some things do not make a lot of sense (e.g. the first "chase" scene, why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave?). the russians actually speak russian without accent, but the cars are extremely strange, with models spanning like 50 years, and so the place seems weirdly out of time. overall, if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well.

i enjoyed the acting in this movie. except for the sister. she reminded me of janice on friends. i could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious. my main problems with the movie were the anticlimatic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother-in-law. the guy falling out of the exploding car? maybe if his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and rushed him to a hospital, maybe then i could have gone for the ending. i think somebody needed to die in the execution scene. mainly the brother-in-law. he was such a pain in the ass anyway. or maybe the sister needed to accidentally kill the guy who saved the mute. i could have even bought into the brother-in-law killing the hero and the ending being the two sisters being put in snuff films. it is worth watching again and as i always say, it is much easier to be a reviewer instead of an author.

this is, without doubt, one of my favourite horror films ever! i really cannot believe that it didn't gain much more popularity when it was released, especially when the main contenders at the time were the usual wes craven sequels and copycat horrors, mute witness has all the style, suspense and quickfire plot twists of a hitchcock/depalma movie, coupled with some very sharp black comedy and a great plot. it never promises to be any more than a good popcorn-and-hot-dog movie, but it is difficult not to just enjoy the film for what it is.the plot centres on billie hughes - a mute girl working on the set of a horror film being made in a russian factory. by a series of events, she finds herself accidentally locked in, and stumbles on the filming of a snuff movie.one of the best things about the film is the lack of screaming that seems to invade every horror film ever made. as the main character is mute, she cannot make a noise - something which is a blessing at some stages of the movie, and a curse in others.the director seems to have studied his hitchcock very well, even the opening scene is a tongue-in-cheek nod to both hitchcock's "psycho" as well as fairly generic slasher movie scenes.while the acting can be hammy at times, the whole film does hold it together, not only throwing in a couple of excellent scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat, but a few neat little questions about how the film is going to end.all in all, a hugely overlooked, well-paced and action packed psycho-thriller which i would recommend for any jaded viewer looking for something a little different from the usual freddy/jason/scream/michael myers/damien regurgitation's at hallowe'en.

one of my all-time favourite movies. nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time. if i could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia i would so i could enjoy this movie as much as i did that very first time. it's still enjoyable second and third times round but i found myself appreciating the humour more as the shocks and thrills weren't unexpected. if you want a see a film that you truly won't be able to predict the ending of then i highly recommend this film. its chilling, shocking, full of suspense and there's also loads of humour to help you through it too. if you watch this film and don't love it i truly question your sanity!

i don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long.i saw this film on tv, i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film. i missed the first, probably , 10 minutes, but that does not matter..this film literally gripped me, it is a real spine chiller.the absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect,u do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new. u never know when they will get killed or what they are up to. so it is all the more tense.even though there are many new faces their performances were top class.the filmmakers play with your mind, just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest. the shock, fear, horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the film.the well written situations n twists,fast camera movements, slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller. this film actually switches between the genres - horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and tensed. undoubtedly comparable to hitchcock. i could not even move from the tv even during the commercial breaks .. i was the helpless mute witness to this superb film.

man, i never laugh so much this year, and it's pretty hard to make me laugh. while i expected some hostel-style movie, the smile came to my face even from the beginning. this film-inside-film shows a female stabbed "victim" messing the whole set until she finally "die". her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us, the viewers, that mute witness is not a typically horror movie.the main character, the mute american make-up artist billy hughes, is played by the beautiful yet talented russian actress marina zudina. her performance is top-notch; her character can't speak, so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensate.and, oh boy, she did a wonderful job. her sister (fay ripley) is the girlfriend or the fiancée or the wife of the "in-film director" (evan richards). they were both very funny most of the time. i won't spoil more, but the scenes following the bathtub moment, with them two, the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedy.the plot get twisted near the end, possibly misleading at one particular moment. but don't worry. such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy-/girl-/friend.

though not exactly a comedy in the usual sense of the word this more rewarding than any movie full of laughs but devoid of substance. i don't think bergman's movies can be easily classed under narrow genres, even the lightest are quite complex. this movie in spite of its light touch poses a series of problems related to marriage and its shortcomings and what happens when the flames start to die etc. i don't really communicate personally with all these issues as i am sure others do. but the atmosphere of the movie is extraordinary, you almost wish it not to end. i have to admit that i was swept away by the bergman of the fifties, having come to know most of his later, groundbreaking efforts. before nykvist, von sydow, ulman etc. the master produced some of the richest, warm and touching movies i have ever seen. though it's a long shot, i have seen this kind of love for human kind, in its complexity, only in fellini's movies of the same period. a lesson in love alongside smiles of a summer night are worth seeing for bergman fans, to have the full image of the man's capabilities, and for those who love cinema with a heart. may he rest in peace!

i've been watching buffy the vampire slayer and really didn't begin to love the show until season 4 started. this episode "hush" was view by me alone in the dark just after midnight with my windows open and the wind blowing through furiously by an after storm. the writers of this episode did an excellent job scaring the heck out of me. i was in awe the entire episode which i just finished 2 minutes ago. amazing doesn't touch the surface of what this episode accomplishes with almost no dialogue. if you've never given this show much thought at least watch this episode. if this doesn't impress you then no episode probably will.btw my heart is still racing...

having seen the movie years ago and been disappointed by its squandered potential, when i heard that it was becoming a tv series, i flatly refused to watch it. my best friend became a rabid fan immediately, and knowing my love for horror movies, could not believe that i wouldn't watch a single episode. i told him that the movie had scarred me for life as far as anything buffy was concerned, and he told me to forget that the movie even existed. he insisted that i give two episodes a shot: "once more with feeling" and this one.both of them are why i am a buffy fan today. he was right - i was hooked immediately. i have never seen a show with the guts to dare try an episode that has next to no dialogue, and nothing else could've pulled it off with the panache and the pure creativity of buffy. i think x files might've gotten away with it if they'd thought of it first, but i'm glad that buffy did it instead. it is a credit to everyone involved that you are riveted for the entire hour, sometimes hanging onto the edge of your seat. and when it was all over, i craved to know more about every character. so i went out and bought the season one boxed set. and the rest is history...i guarantee you that if you've never seen it, either, you'll want to see more if you make this episode your first. the only reason i'm not giving it 10 out of 10 is because i'm reserving that score for "once more..."

this is a good episode, but it's not my favorite. a lot of people love it and on a creative level it's brilliant. most of the episode has no dialog, which is such a cool idea and "hush" handles the silence really well. plus, this episode introduces tara, who i like a lot. but, i don't like riely or the initative or maggie walsh and they seem to get a lot of screen time in "hush." plus, i don't think the gentlemen are that scary and i get tired of watching the float around sunnydale. i know that i'm in the minority, but i tend to fast-forward parts of "hush." of course, there are other parts of the episode that i think are great, so if you're watching on dvd, i recommend seeing this episode. it really is a classic."hush" revolves around the entire town losing their voices. skelatal looking demon-guys called the gentlemen arrive to gather seven hearts from human victims, but if they hear a human scream they die. so they steal the voices of everyone in town. buffy and the scoobies try to figure out what's going on, while the initative also start investigating. meanwhile, xander comes to realize how much anya means to him and willow meets a fellow witch named tara. buffy and riely finally come face to face while fighting the gentlemen. they are both stunned about what they learn... he's a commando and she's the slayer. in the end buffy saves the day, but she now has to deal with her new knowledge of riely's secret life.really, the creativity of "hush" can't be seen in a basic outline of its plot. it's the overwhelming silence of the episode, that makes it so great. the characters try to communicate in different ways, (white-out boards, pantomime, obscene finger gestures, etc...) and it all just works really well. after a while you forget that there's no dialog because they're all so good at expressing themselves. during the "talking" parts of the episode, there are a lot of references to the importance of really "hearing" each other. anya claims that xander won't really talk to her. giles ignores spike and xander's protests and insists that spike move into xander's apartment. buffy quickly substitutes the word "petroleum" for "patrolling" when she talks to riely so she won't have to explain her calling. and then at the end, when buffy and riely really do learn the truth about each other, they sit there with nothing to say. it's all pretty cool.there are a lot of good parts to this episode. i love that people keep forgetting that they can't talk. buffy and xander both try to use the phone. riley can't use the voice recognition thing in the initatives' elevator. people try to scream. it's basically what everyone would really do if they suddenly had no speech. and i think it's hilarious that spike has to move in with xander. (they'll also share an apartment for a little while in season seven.) xander and spike have a fun bickering childishness that's just hilarious. also i like the beginning of tara and willow's relationship. tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and willow are pretty cute together. it's nice to see them just starting out.on the downside, i don't understand how the gentlemen are choosing their victims. they just seem to float around dorms and pick random people. also, i don't like riely. i've never liked him, but from "hush" on i'm pretty much just waiting for angel to come back to town and beat him up. finally, what happens to olivia after this? it seems like we just met her, she and giles have a relationship, everything's going fine... and then she's suddenly dropped. i don't get it.my favorite part of the episode: giles' "who are the gentlemen?" lecture to the scoobies. the whole scene is wonderful and his over-heads are just hilarious. he makes some similar looking flashcards in season seven's "first date." pretty much anytime giles starts drawing monsters, it's just gonna be fun.

the creepy demons "the gentlemen" capture the voice of the population of sunnydale, to steal human hearts without scream. giles find that in accordance with a legend, if a lady screams, the creatures will be destroyed, but buffy and her friends, including riley, have to fight the monsters speechless."hush" is certainly the best episode of the fourth season of buffy up to this moment. having lots of humor and funny situations, i liked a lot. spike is hilarious, the romance between xander and anya is cool, but i loved the "intense" dialog between buffy and riley in end. the gothic scenario of the final battle against "the gentlemen" recalls the environment of "dark city". my vote is ten.title (brazil): "silêncio" ("silence")

this episode of buffy was one of my personal favorites. also number three of joss' personal favorites as well. the episode featured very little dialogue and despite that the good folks at the emmy's decided it merited a nomination. unfortunately it didn't win. when hush first premiered it received about 6 million viewers, which was the highest rated episode of season four. that should tell you something. even though there was very little talking it managed to intrigue people enough to tune in. those gentlemen characters (who were played my mimes) were some of the scariest creatures the show has produced (or any network tv show i've seen). nothing is creepier then a bunch of silver teethed men coming at you with a scalpel while smiling away. i think that despite the lack of dialogue the actors did a fantastic job on the episode.

episode no. thirteen of the fanciful (excuse the incredibly gay terminology) "supernatural" tv series relocates sam and dean winchester to missouri where they have been called upon by an old flame of dean's to investigate a string of mysterious murders occurring in their small town. as it turns out, a large pick-up truck with an unseen driver is running down african americans on a desolate stretch of road... while dean attempts to rekindle his past love affair, more towns people turn up as roadkill. the cause appears to be due to a past racial incident back in the 60s, causing a frustrated redneck spirit to remain in ghostly limbo, seeking to kill black motorists. "route 666" is another good installment (which isn't uncommon, i've noticed) which contains a few notable aspects pertaining to the pair of main characters such as dean getting laid and sam's admitted regret for having left college... the killer truck does't come across as the most terrifying thing in the world, though, for an hour long show, it does it's job well. not a hands-down fantastic episode, but a solid concept with more horror movie references.

apart from being a clever and well-marketed variation on the nowadays hugely popular horror genre and a splendid formula to attract potential new fans in general, i always somewhat considered "supernatural" as a massively giant homage towards the genre through the decades. although not always noticeable to younger viewers and/or people who only have an interest in more recent horror films, each and every single episode contains a few obvious and subtler references towards classic and influential titles. from that point of view, it was only a matter of time before the writers would pay tribute to the 'creepy vehicle without a driver' type of films, and even more specifically the 70's milestones "duel" (steven spielberg's acclaimed debut) and "the car". being an avid fan of these two films, i enjoyed "route 666" a lot even in spite of its flaws and shortcomings. the episode opens tense and atmospherically on a remote missourian road, where a black man is hunted down and eventually killed by a menacing monster truck with seemingly no driver behind the wheel. the victim's daughter, cassie, happens to be dean's ex-girlfriend and she calls the winchester brothers in for help. the brothers can't prevent two more similar "accidents" before discovering the ghost-truck sudden presence relates all the way back to a racial dispute of the 60's, involving both of cassie's parents as well as several more prominent inhabitants of the little town. some of my fellow reviewers around here tend to label "route 666" as one of the weaker entries in season one, mainly because the script is too preachy regarding racial issues and shows a different and more emotional side of dean's character. he's usually the strong silent type, whereas here he's confronted with unfinished romantic affairs from the past here. to a certain level i agree with the racism debate, but it didn't bother me that much, really. the writers eventually had to give an explanation to the presence of the ghost truck, and racial conflict is an acceptable one as far as i'm concerned. concerning dean's emotional vulnerability, i can only state it's admirable to see how the writers continuously attempt to provide depth and detail to the main characters. dean's behavior towards cassie sheds a whole new light on him, in fact. besides, what really counts in this episode is the wondrously sinister truck and its virulent attacks. it's an impressive and overpowering vehicle, producing blinding lights and grisly engine noises. in case you worshiped the brilliant aforementioned "duel", you will definitely find some amusement in the compelling chase sequences depicted in "route 666".

excellent episode, showed dean has not only good taste by picking cassie for his girlfriend but also shows he does have a heart and can love just one woman, and he's not just some guy who loves and leaves em! aweso e episode. applaud them on this one. i only hope that some way they go back to the cassie relationship next season (if there is a next season??) i would like to see her come back into their "supernatural" lives especially dean's. also i like the fact the chose an african-american woman to be the special lady in his life that got away somehow. i hope they don't screw that up and end it as he episdoe ended. the girl who played cassie was truly a looker and it was good to see the wb branching out into what we all see in everyday life-the interacial coupling that has become common and acceptable(finally!)

in today's world of advertising and teenage horror and sensationalism it is very rare that one gets to see a movie and no nothing about it. movies like psycho and blair witch, while being great in suspense (both with great build ups) are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them. with mute witness, a rare treat, i stumbled upon this film and watched it, scared witless, in the middle of the night. i was scared by the menacing russian ambience, the 'snuff' theme and the claustrophobic plight of the mute and the fact that the (amusing, which always leads to likeable) characters could meet the end at any second. since this is a low budget and rare film we watch it without any expectations. it also has fay ripley in a rare movie role, watch and prepare to be excited, scared and thrilled in totally unexpected ways.

in a lonely road in cape girardeau, missouri, a black man driving a car is chased and hit by a truck, falling off-road and dying. his daughter cassie robinson calls her former boyfriend dean and asks him to investigate the mysterious accident. sam and dean see that three afro-americans and the caucasian major of the town were killed in weird accidents on the same road. when the truck threatens cassie, her caucasian mother mrs. robinson tells a tragic racist murder that happened thirty years ago, and the brothers realize that they have to fight against a hatred spirit in a ghost truck.in this episode, dean discloses his first and unique love to his brother, surprising sam and showing that he has feelings, but also that his hunting wish is stronger than his love. the story is only reasonable, touching in the delicate theme of racism in an efficient manner and blending it with a supernatural event. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "rota 666" ("route 666")

i just watched "return from lonesome dove" and it was very good! i've seen a lot of negative comments about it and i don't think the viewers are being real about it! in the television/ movie business it is hard to get all the actors back for a 2nd sequel or 3rd part. we are lucky to have another miniseries that ties into lone d. faithfully!! this production was top notch with the original music score, and the actors put their hearts into it(you can tell). if you want to watch lonesome d. with robert duvall and tommy l. j. then watch the original. return to l.d. didn't have as much wit and takes on a more serious tone but is totally captivating none the less. from the touching moments to the villains, this one is a winner! "wonderful!!!"

at first glance of this mini... i was a bit disappointed that tommy lee jones and anjelica huston didn't return to the cast. both john voight and barbara hershey did commendable jobs replacing very important characters for the continuing saga of this legendary epic western. cherokee jack jackson (haysbert) played an excellent bad guy, and louis gossett jr. was, as always, true to form with his excellent acting skills.the drama that seemed true to life in many scenes, including one of the best, where the valiant shoot-out ended with ranger walker being killed made me feel that i was actually in the film. return to lonesome dove was to me, almost up to the quality of the first of the series. the next 2 follow ups with james garner as call just didn't make it for me. and that lorena marries pea eye? how the heck did that get in their? that was a total mismatch of characters. the first 2 of the series made the epic story, the next 2 in no way were of the same quality.now, if the first 2 could be remastered in dolby digital and an anamorphic presentation, the films could be where they should have been like the movies of today.

i had my reservations about watching the return to lonesome dove after seeing and enjoying the original so much. without tommy lee jones reprising his role as woodrow call or anjelica huston as clara, i figured it just wouldn't seem authentic enough. upon viewing 'return' i can honestly say it's a worthy successor. the actors really make the show with jon voight, rick schroder, and oliver reed all preforming at their very best. i admit the story might not be quite as engrossing as the first, but 'return' definitely has it's share of excitement and captures the romance of the old west in a way that few other films have. anyone who still has reservations can rest assured that the return to lonesome dove succeeds in capturing the 'feel' of the original and will not disappoint. do yourself a favor and check it out, ol' gus would be proud!

this a wonderful sequel to the award winning lonesome dove miniseries in the 1980's. this sequel is perhaps, better than the original. it is definitely more family friendly. the language is more subdued. there is plenty of violence and one particular scene with cherokee jack is particularly gruesome. however, overall a great movie. the acting is superb. william peterson is fantastic. such a great dramatic actor with a quick sense of wit and comic timing. jon voight aptly fills tommy lee jones' shoes as captain call. ricky shroder gives a great heart-filled performance as the young boy who grew up with no family to claim him. highly recommended.

let me begin by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original "lonesome dove" than i. both the pulitzer prize-winning book and the towering mini-series adapted from it stand alone in my experience as moving, dramatic, believable, and engrossing works. there is no comparison between "lonesome dove" and any western film- at least not since the legendary collaborations of john ford and john wayne. it was with real reservations that i sat down to watch this new mini-series, what with mcmurtry's non-participation, and the missing original cast members. after watching the first episode it was clear that this is no "lonesome dove". in almost every measurable way this sequel falls short of the original. but so what? i wasn't expecting it to measure up. taken as an effort of it's own this film is engaging, entertaining and of a very good quality. if it were done as a new story, not as a sequel to "lonesome dove", there is no question in my mind that it would not have received as many negative ratings. jon voight did a creditable job as call, barbara hershey was a terrific clara, and the new characters like gideon walker and agostina vega were well rendered and believable. louis gossett jr. deserves special mention as the horse wrangler isom pickett. the film made me care about the characters, and i don't ask any more than that from an actor. it is unfortunate that this worthy effort stands in the shadow of it's predecessor- it is worth viewing in it's own right.

i've seen lonesome dove, dead man's walk, and the streets of laredo, and now the return to lonesome dove. if you are hungry for more after watching lonesome dove, this'll fill yer belly. great cast, great story. most definitely a close second to lonesome dove. i will be purchasing this movie to add to my collection. this is the best, or at least my favorite performance by jon voight. he is captain call. lou gossett jr. playing isom pickett is not somebody i'd mess with, he is a bad ass with perspective. william peterson does a great job as well. rick schroder is back as newt with an angst filled performance that reminds me of his stint on nypd blue. my only problem with this film (and it's really picking nits) is that i had the impression that call wanted to be "the first man to graze cattle in montana", and it's obvious that dunnigan had already been there a while. a little inconsistent, but easily overlooked as you lose yourself in the fantastic tale. i especially love the apparent character growth of jasper fant and july johnson. i've watched this movie several times and am ready for another sequel.

not a larry mcmurty masterpiece but it stands on its own as a good western, any of the lonesome doves do. who ever takes on the role of woodrow call, does a great portrayal in their own style. it's also easy to see that they were looking to use this as a stepping stone to the t.v series (both version of it) and that the writers knew how to keep the flavor alive william peterson was awesome in this, the geeky c.s.i guy is not the character he plays in this - this guy can do it all it seemsit's deserve to be enjoyed by those who enjoy westerns4out5 stars

let me say first off that i am a huge fan of the original series lonesome dove and the book it was based from. i have put off watching this sequel for the better part of 10 years due to the bad reviews i'd heard about it. if tommy lee jones wasn't playing capt. call i didn't see the point. if larry mcmurtry wasn't involved why should i care? how wrong i was.this is in so many ways a worthy sequel to lonesome dove, maybe even more so than the dark mood of streets of laredo. the story, acting, production, cinematography are all top-notch. of course the script isn't as colorful as lonesome dove but it has it's moments. and, much to my surprise, there are bits of lonesome done in this series; the relationship between july and clara, completely dismissed in the prequel, is brought up here almost identical to the book, a most welcome surprise. the story isn't all roses, it has it's surprises too. by far the biggest surprise is jon voight's interpretation of capt. call. while not a direct copy of tommy lee jones' his is both faithful and unique to voight's credit. the cast is fantastic all across the board, and i don't think rick schroeder has done a better job of acting than in this series. oliver reed practically steals the show here, he is superb in a role that makes you care for his character as equally as you hate him.it is worth it to watch this if you haven't due to bad criticisms, especially that the dvd is so affordable (i got the 2-disc set for $10.99, you can probably find it cheaper). it is in no way the disappointment that dead man's walk turned out (well, it was for me). and mcmurtry was involved with that one!

a rich experience is to be gained from watching this film.this is a seemingly simple story of a gifted pupil, yiu kwok, who later becomes a teacher of classical chinese poetry. he is married with two sons, and things at home seem normal. he still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage, and his sons alternately fill him with pride (the elder one) and disappointment (the younger one).his passion for the poetry makes him an object of infatuation for a senior student in one of his classes. the student, choi lam, draws pictures of him during class, significantly, one of him with a flower coming from his mouth. she teases him more with her intelligence than her sexuality, although that too is an element. he of course is not immune to her attention, though he tries for a while to keep the demarcation line between teacher and student in place.the reason why he doesn't succeed in the end is complicated. firstly there is a real depth to the communication between him and choi lam. it becomes clear that she genuinely likes him, and it's mutual. secondly, there is a long-standing problem in his marriage that is brought to light when an old friend of both his and his wife becomes ill. the consequences of the wife's involvement with this friend, both past and present, are almost too sad to bear.nothing is treated trivially in this film. all the characters have a vivid internal life, and an easily discernible history. the two leads, jacky cheung and anita mui, are outstanding, as are karena lam as the student choi lam, and shaun tam as the elder son on yin.recommended without reservation.

i couldn't stop watching this movie, though it was far past my bedtime. comparisons to hitchcock are deserved -- this thing really plays with you. it walks a wonderful line between real, immediate suspense and a dark, distancing humor. like many of hitch's heroes, our doe-eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific -- and we are taken on quite a ride with her, at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear, at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy.the filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out. right from the opening shots, they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is fabrication; who is to be trusted and who is a monster. the plot twists and turns unpredictably. suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen camerawork, imagery, music -- but most simply the eyes of the characters, which sends raw fear right into you. a warning: there is some frighteningly real gore, as well as some nudity. the horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage-slasher pic.and a teen-slasher pic it ain't. the characters are quirky and feel like real people, for one thing -- a couple (including the heroine) you may even find endearing as i did. there will be no mistake you're watching a movie made for grown-ups. i mean, alec guinness is in it, briefly, and you know he didn't need the work!pop this in the vcr some night when you can't sleep. . . and don't want to, yet.

this story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle manner, something which sets it apart from most films with this plot. mr. lam (jacky cheung) has a relationship with choy (karena lam, who was also so good in "koma") in what at first appears to be an inexplicable situation. he is married for 20 years to ching (the great anita mui, in her last role before she was cruelly taken from us), and it appears to be a loving relationship. when ching offers to care for hers and mr. lam's former teacher, choy and mr. lam have the opportunity to be together. what makes the film so good is director ann hui's pacing. it takes a while to uncover the secrets of the lamsm and it all makes sense. the movie is very dramatic and touching. you don't feel any repulsion about the teacher/student situation, something that elevates this film above many with the same plot. it is slow moving, but stay with it. also, revel in ms. mui's wonderful, unglamorous but beautiful performance. she was and is someone truly special and in this film you fall in love with her one last time. it is worth the time to witness and just be there with her.

a touching love story reminiscent of in the mood for love'. drawing heavily on chinese poetry and how this is used by eastern people to communicate feelings to each other, the story focuses on a schoolteacher who wants so much to be a model teacher as well as a good husband and father. a senior student is very attracted to him. as the story unfolds we see the emotions below the surface in his 20 year marriage and how he grapples with the moral dilemmas that face him. a beautiful and moving story.

excellent introspective / interpersonal piece that really had some teeth to it without feeling hopeless or worse, manipulative & artificially gratifying. might be a good double feature with american beauty as well. best performance to date that i've seen from anita mui, and every actor in this seems like a powerhouse. hats off to ann hui for the direction and ivy ho for the brilliant script. seriously one of the best dramas i've seen in a while, especially if you have a taste for classical literature ala poetry. again, excellent.

hummmm,...another keystone comedy set in the park!!! it seems that the number one location spot for shooting was in this same local park, as so many of chaplin's and arbuckle's films are set there! and, while this is yet another one, it is different enough and well made that i still enjoyed it.fatty is interested in a younger than usual looking and acting mabel normand. i think she's supposed to be a little younger, though in her mother's eyes she is too young to be interested in men. well, fatty does not share her feelings and soon he and mabel run away for some innocent fun. things get complicated when the mother's watch is stolen. fatty finds it and gives it to mabel as a gift,...and many problems result.decent pacing and the fact that this movie did not rely too much on cheap slapstick but a reasonable plot make this a cute and enjoyable little film.

i really liked two coyotes. one of my friends rented it the other night and we were really impressed with how good it was and how cool the main guys were. i wonder if they are thinking of making a sequel because that would be excellent!two coyotes rocks!

this first time writer/director comes across as a season pro with "two coyotes". most action dramas are all about the action first then the story. but this picture works the other way around. if this is just the beginning for this director, then hollywood will soon be making room for this rising star. independent movie making has once again reached a new level.

this film is an excellent example of what an independent film can be. the director does an excellent job of riding the line between emotional and physical violence. but in the end, he remembers what so many indie-films forget - he tells a good story. when watching this film i was reminded of how timid and mundane most big-budget hollywood films really have become.especially notable, is an exceptionally strong performance by the film's lead - jorge cordova. as an villainous thug (on his way to the top of the crime heap) cordova plays a conniving, brutal, conceited, devious, and sleazy s.o.b., but he is so likable that he keeps you entertained the whole time. i read somewhere that these guys were part of the new wave of latino filmmakers in los angeles - called la nueva obra, or something like that. either way, this film makes you look forward to seeing more of their work.

first, i must say that i don't speak spanish and usually do not enjoy spanish speaking films... but two coyotes is an exceptional film. there is enough action and hard drama that it doesn't matter that its a spanish speaking film. the subtitles were easy to read and didn't block the action - or the drama!i would tell fans of spanish speaking films and non-fans of spanish speaking films to go see this movie. the action and drama are worth every penny.

i was very impressed with this film from newcomer dir./writer jose reyes. the cast was excellent. "jorge cordoba" executed a powerfuland shocking performance as the lead character of "rafa". it's inspiring to see independent films with this level of talent. it takes talent, courage, and determination to go out and make a quality film.i admire anyone who can take an idea from concept to conception and go the mile. it's easy for people to judge young filmmakers more harshly, but i applaud "jose reyes" and the talented cast for their successful efforts.

one of the most underrated comedies. dan akroyd is hilarious in this over the top role; charles grodin gives a performance nearly as good as in "midnight run;" and walter matthau gives a superb comedic performance in this sometimes subdued, sometimes wacky film. akroyd and matthau have great chemistry together....

the story is airtight from the beginning until the latter third of this movie. then the story gets more and more outrageous. the main character portrayed by marina sudina is fantastic and had a difficult role. this could have been a super-great movie had the ending been more realistic.

"the couch trip" is one of those silly comedies that they cranked out in the '80s. in this case, dan aykroyd plays a mental patient who poses as a psychiatrist, and he goes to beverly hills to sub for charles grodin. most of the movie's humor springs from their satirical look at beverly hills and people's empty lives there (a woman has a power struggle with her maid).it's the sort of movie that you just watch to have a good time. don't expect any kind of religious experience. but you'll most likely laugh a lot at how the beverly hills people flaunt their wealth. also starring walter matthau, donna dixon, arye gross and victoria jackson (of "uhf").

dan ackroyd in his prime stars as johgn burns, a mental asylum escapee who poses as his own shrink to travel out to la la land and host a popular radio talk show while the regular host (charle grodin in his snarling prime) takes a vacation. along the way, ackroyd hooks up with walter matthau, a fellow nutjob, and the rest is sheer hilarity. ackroyd and matthau play off very well off one another. ackroyd's stunning real-life wife, donna dixon, is along for the ride as yet another shrink. the ending feels a bit rushed and contrived, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this film my top rating, an 8. a lost '80s gem.

it is always a well-known, and important directorial device to set up the atmosphere of a film within the first 5 minutes. in the crucial opening scenes, the film should assert itself and make the viewers take notice and get interested in the rest of the film. here, in "mute witness", we find a prime example of this.*scene spoiler* in the first 5-10 minutes, the film opens to a very hitchcockian scene of a pretty blonde lady in her apartment, with the radio on. she's wandering around, applying lipstick, dolling herself up, and ignoring the news report of a serial killer on the loose. of course, the serial killer is in her house, and monitoring her moves, knife in hand. she hears a noise, looks in a room, and there is her partner in a pool of blood. at the very point of her screams, she turns around to be faced with the knife-wielding maniac, who stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and horrifying act.......then something odd happens. as the woman convulses in her death throes, the killer sits down and takes out a cigarette to watch his victim perish. before he finds his lighter, his cigarette is lit...from someone else in the room! the camera pans out, and we realise that there are more and more people in the room, some taking notes, some filming, some recording the death, and that the lady is taking an awfully long time to die, and making a very hammy job of it too. when the audience realises what's going on, and the whole scene is part of a film, the suspenseful and horrific scene takes on an element of humour.*end scene spoiler* i have highlighted this opening scene for several reasons. firstly, it portrays the atmosphere of the whole movie perfectly. a thriller in the style of hitchcock or de palma, with some very disorientating, and even blackly humorous moments. - it conveys a central subject matter (that of the difference between a 'movie screen death' and a 'snuff film death', an issue which is elaborated on later in the film), and finally, it introduces the viewer to the characters, all as silently as possible.the plot of mute witness centres around billy hughes, an american special effects make-up artist who is working on the set of the film, being shot in a large warehouse in moscow. billy cannot speak, but she communicates in sign language through her sister. after the end of an evening's filming, billy inadvertently finds herself locked in the warehouse by accident, and in her attempt to escape, is witness to two of the crew making what first appears to be a porno film, but turns out to be a snuff movie. suddenly, her escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death.without doubt, the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely gripping. billy's saving grace, and her handicap is the fact that she isn't able to utter a sound. (in fact, in my opinion, one of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it isn't chock-full of women screaming). there are some utterly disturbing moments, and some superb set-pieces of real suspense (the corridoor, and the elevator shaft are perfect examples). the timing is fluid, and the whole first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in itself.the second half of the film introduces new concepts. while there are still several suspenseful moments, the focus is on plot twists. new characters are introduced, and it is ambiguous as to whose side they are on. while there is nothing wrong per se with the second half of the film, it just doesn't quite measure up to the first half. there are some neat moments of black humour that perfectly juxtapose and punctuate some very dramatic scenes, but there are also some very lame comedy moments (coming specifically from billy's sister and her fiancée, who happens to be the director of the movie billy is working on), that almost ruin the film, just because they are badly misplaced and/or mistimed and ruin the pace. - at the end, the twists keep coming at a rapid-fire speed, and the climax of the film is, appropriately, as tense as the first half.there are several things that really make the movie work. the barriers of communication that billy must face, both as a mute, and as an american in moscow, mean that even an emergency call for help becomes a dangerous situation. the actress that plays billy, natasha zudina, does a wonderful job in the film, with an engaging on-screen prescence, and a brilliant performance, and finally, the direction as a whole, but most particularly in the first half of the film, which truly is a study in alfred hitchcock's suspense/thriller film techniques.as i have already said, though, the let-downs in the film are from some terrible comic relief moments that really do not need to be added. there is already a consistent and effective streak of dark humour that appears in the film without the need for the characters of karen hughes and andy clarke (the sister and the moviemaker) to turn their scenes into some unusual sit-com. however, despite these shortcomings, the film is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller, and ideal for a group viewing at halloween. (certainly better than the usual slasher horror film...!)

if you enjoy suspense this movie has it. the fact that marina zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense. alec guiness's appearance was nice, but didn't really add to the movie. i'm not sure if evan richard's part as andy clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot. i thought the cinematography was excellent. this added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well. the bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful. also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to andy clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done. i would call it overall good entertainment

i went into this film expecting a slasher, and while mute witness does take influence from said style of film-making, this is much more than just your average slash flick. there are a number of thrillers that focus on a certain disability - blindness is more common (blind terror, wait until dark, cat o'nine tails to name a handful), but the implications of having a mute lead in a thriller such as this are well portrayed, and actually integral to the plot as the fact that the lead character can't speak is often the reason why she finds herself in dangerous situations that would be easy for anyone else to get out of. our mute witness is billy hughes, a make-up artist working on a horror film production at a studio in moscow. she finds herself locked in after hours one night, and after attempting to phone her sister for help, she stumbles upon what at first appears to be the making of an illicit sex flick, but soon turns out to be a snuff movie! she tries to convince the authorities of what she's seen, but finds that no one believes her story...recently hostel made the headlines for showing snuff movie making in a foreign country, but this film did it first and actually does a better job. it's maybe not quite as nasty as eli roth's opus, but the gore is more effective, and since director anthony waller (who went on to direct one of my favourite modern thrillers with 'the guilty') implements a good sense of humour into the proceedings, mute witness is both sufficiently gory and fun to watch. the director certainly has a talent for crafting suspenseful thrill rides, as this one never stands still. the plot is put into action quickly, and waller constantly introduces plot twists which give a big helping hand to the overall entertainment value of the film. the acting isn't bad for a b-movie, with young performers marina zudina, fay ripley and evan richards delivering good performances. the atmosphere is gritty, and the russian locations are suitably unfriendly, which helps the film to retain a foreboding atmosphere. overall, mute witness is a much better film than you might expect it to be. the plot flows well, and the atmosphere and tension are spot on.

billy hughes is a mute young lady working for make-up on a cheap horror picture being filmed in moscow by an american director. one night billy gets locked in the movie studio. later that night she hears that someone might be in the building and goes to check it out. that's when she stumbles across a woman being brutally murdered, while being filmed. after escaping the clutches of the murderers, billy informs the authorities, only to be red-faced when the men show it was an act. billy knows what she saw and soon her life is in turmoil again from underground figures that believe she has something of importance.i don't know how this heart-pounding sleeper passed me by, but i thought it was a much older flick. there's one thing though, it's got to be one of the most jarringly, and intense thrillers i've seen in quite a while. it's just a great suspense builder and mostly everything clicks into place! the first half of the feature is surprisingly gripping with taut sequences that have your heart in your throat and clouds us with an atmospherically foreboding environment of alienation. underling this is a humorously wicked black streak. faults do pop up in the story, as it does lose that furious grip it held so early and goofy humour (or better putter comic relief) between fay ripley and evan richard's characters is a hit and miss affair by being too forceful. in the long run, it probably could have done without. despite some cringe moments, this aspect didn't hinder my enjoyment of it. for me, the soft ending they decided to go with just didn't feel right.the interestingly mysterious premise was eerie to the bone and packed some unsettling goods. so multi-facet was the context and its thrills, there was something fresh to how this all plays out and the nervy jolts and unbearable tension are weaved into a range of sudden plot turns and twists. really, they made superb use of the novel idea of this disability and to handicap the situation, by staging it in a foreign place where not too many spoke english and so we are caught up in the confusion too. the delicate marina zudina gives a harrowing portrayal of the american mute girl billy. the way she able to display the erratic emotions through her eyes and actions gave it some gruff and believability. director anthony waller shoots the flick in a rather stylish, well-timed and skillful manner, without loosing that grimy look that eventuates from its rigid surroundings and a powerfully airy music score persistently nags at you. the only real name to make an appearance was small cameo part by alec guinness. the performances by the cast were all fine, especially the nail biting turns by oleg yankovsky and igor volkov as the russian murderers.this riveting feature that's mostly made up of unknowns, is way better than your average dark thriller. highly recommended.

a couple of years before scream spoofed the slasher/horror genre with savvy, self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation, a little movie produced in russia hit the theatres without any grandiose pretensions.this movie was mute witness. starring a cast of unknowns (except an extremely brief cameo by sir alec guiness whose scenes were purportedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie), it told the story of a mute make-up artist, billie, who is working on a film on location in russia produced and directed by her sister's boyfriend andy. she is unaware that the set has closed when she goes to retrieve her belongings and inadvertently stumbles onto a porn shoot that becomes extremely bloody. overcome with horror she alerts the murderers of her presence, a chase ensues, and finally she is rescued by andy who take her home as they alert the police. the trouble is... there is no body, no evidence that anything of the sort took place. even so, a mysterious inspector seems to be on billie's side of the story....and to say more would be criminal. mute witness is the kind of film that demands a scrutiny of viewing similar to the most intricate, clever thriller because as much as it is a convoluted thriller, it's one that pays its dues to movies like wait until dark and the best of hitchcock in its choice of camera cuts, deadpan humor, americans reacting in foreign countries where they are powerless, and nail-biting suspense until it seems something must snap. even if the story does become a little too implausible due to the fact that the story arc suddenly becomes the focus of an even greater conspiracy, the film succeeds in not trying to trick the audience with cheap shots (for example the sudden appearance of a person on camera accompanied by a crashing swell of violins) but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow away. very smart.

john cassavetes is on the run from the law. he is at the bottom of the heap. he sees negro sidney poitier as his equal and they quickly become friends, forming a sort of alliance against a bully of a foreman played by jack warden.as someone who has worked in a warehouse myself when i was younger, i can tell you that the warehouse fights, complete with tumbling packing cases and flailing grappling hooks are as realistic as it gets. i've been in fights like these myself, although no one got killed.the introduction of sidney poitier's widow is a variation on shakespeare's shylock "do i not bleed?" this is an anti racist film, which, at the time, was much needed.all the three principle characters - warden, cassavetes and poitier - are superb, with warden the most outstanding of the three.

martin ritt's first film offers an exceptional existentialist answer (three years later) to elia kazan's more conservative "on the waterfront." while "waterfront" benefited immensely from an electrifying marlon brando, who inadvertently disguised kazan's offensive theme of trying to justify naming names (as kazan did eagerly before the house un-american activities committee), "edge of the city" boasts a young john cassavetes and an upstart sidney poitier daring to confront issues that "waterfront" failed to acknowledge, namely, workers' rights and race relations."edge of the city" boldly dives into this (then) unknown territory, and although the quite appealing black protagonist (poitier) may seem a bit hollywood simplistic, the courageous struggle against thinly-veiled bigotry and violence has hardly aged at all. one wonders how shocked initial 1957 moviegoers were at such a bold presentation of white-black relations (if some of the bigoted didn't leave the theater early, they must of left dumbfounded, if not offended). the last reel of the film will still surprise audiences, as it refuses to sink into expected clichés, including those that tainted "waterfront." only the most jaded viewers will not realize what a radical and entertaining film "edge of the city" ends up being.what's most disturbing about this lost classic: how it sadly remains unavailable on any format, for reasons that remain quite cloudy. this film should be required viewing in high school or college history classes across the country, yet one can only find it on obscure late-night tv, if ever at all.

alex north (john cassavetes) has problems in relationship with his father and flees home to join the army, from where he very soon deserts and comes to new york intending to start a new life, using as an advantage the fact that nobody knows about his past. he finds a job at the waterfront, where he meets tommy tyler (sydney poitier) a lively young man, who is happily married and is a living contrast to cassavetes' sad and unhappy character. they very quickly become good friends and tommy does his best to help his friend. the only problem is that their superior at work, a tough worker charles malik (jack warden) is sort of envious of their friendship as well as tommy's constant happy disposition and success in personal life. he really manages to make their life difficult when he comes to know the truth about alex's past. a good drama skillfully directed by academy award nominated director-producer martin ritt (the hud) and featuring wonderful performances from sydney poitier and jack warden. 7/10

i'm not a fan of scratching, but i really dug this movie. it gave me a real insight into a world i never had a clue existed; and what else is a documentary for? funny, clever, hip - just like pray's previous film, hype! about the grunge music scene.

-that's pretty much the whole soundtrack to this film. i just saw this baby at the munich film festival and it rocked the house. director doug pray is never seen in this documentary, nor i think he is even heard, but he has done a very intimate look into the lives and history of the "mixer." he has segmented his film into about eight chapters and then his motley group of enthusiastic interviews will be spiced throughout according to what they are talking about. i was never big into "scratching" but the film does a wonderful job of keeping elementary for those who know little, and infusing in-jokes for those who are experts themselves in this area. mix master mike from the beastie boys is in this film, but it wasn't until after the film that i could name several heavy hitters in the industry (dj shadow, q- bert, etc). the extreme fascination for turntables by these talented and quirky djs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them. the film also sheds some gratifying light on these guys (and one woman) to be classified as musicians. pray doesn't let his film idle and if there exists a slow scene it is soon re-energized by hardly ever ceasing music. if nothing else, this film will increase your slang vocabulary. i have to get back to "digging", so i'll end this review. see it, it will be of interest. good stuff man. good stuff.

okay, i think we're all agreed that michael jackson was the low point.and the special effects too. but, please, keep in mind that this was not a big-budget film, okay? not every film gets as much of a budget as harry potter or star wars.however, i thought it was pretty funny altogether. b-? nothing that would, in my opinion, waste your time.parodies are always fun to watch, and just because it wasn't big budget doesn't mean it's bad.i think this was a good movie, if weak at some points.hope this comment helps. ~angela

if you like silly comedies like airplane you'll love this movie! it's definitely in the style of airplane and scary movie. a fun film! it has the strangest cast of characters all in the same movie. michael jackson, evan marriott, joyce giraurd, stuart pankin, charlie schlater and eric roberts. the special effects are hokey, but i think they're supposed to be since it's a silly comedy. there is apparently two versions of the film, one at blockbuster and one on the official website: misscastaway.com. the one on the website appears to be a preview release version signed by the director. there's some fun behind the scenes material filmed at neverland with michael jackson as well. the movie was filmed in 2003 and says it's pg rated fun on the box.

i don't understand why this movie has such a low rating. it totally deserves more! sure, it's completely ridiculous, but that's what it was supposed to be. don't expect cinematic transcendence from a movie about beauty pageant contestants stranded on a caribbean island! what you should expect is a huge spoof of pretty much every relevant sci-fi, fantasy and block-buster movie in cinematic history, and even references to other spoofers. all completely exaggerated and sometimes totally unnecessary, but that's exactly what makes this movie stand out. if you like parodies, and enjoy say, leslie nielsen or mike myers, you're gonna love this. i sure did!

i just got it and it is a great movie!! i loved it! although jane brightons voice n the beginning is so annoying because of her braces she don't open her freaking mouth...but ya have to watch it cause its a great movie!! the things he says in here are so funny and extremely cute!! and i'm sure aaron would probably say some of the things in real life cause i don't know, it just seems that way!! ha ha there is a part in tha movie that is really funny...its wen jane's little sister meets him...but i cant tell ya what happens cause ill just have to let u see for your self!! i went to go see aaron n concert and it was so much fun!! n he smelled so good ha ha...i still cant believe i got to meet him!!! i have pictures if anyone wants to see them!! steph

this is a really cute movie. i had a massive sleepover (girls 10-11) and they absolutely loved this movie. they watched it twice! don't let the rating fool you. you have to be 13 or older to rate a movie on imdb, that eliminates the movie's target audience. if you have a girl (or boy) between 7 and 13, i guarantee they'll enjoy this movie. sort of a gender reversed "notting hill" set in high school. aaron carter plays a famous pop star who is failing his privately tutored classes. his mom sends him to a "regular" high school with the ultimatum, "pass high school or no summer tour." taking the advice of his manager (former pop star david cassidy) he befriends the smartest girl in school (alana austin) with plans to cheats off her. look for the humorous and insightful janitor (another former pop star lief garrett).

i am probably a little too old for this movie, 16, and being a guy, the story is a little too girlie, but i really thought it was a cool movie overall. all the girls in this movie are so hot and really great actresses, from alana, to adrianne, to deena, to kimberly, all the way down to the cute girl that plays alana's little sister, rachel. i am not a huge pop-star fan with the lovesick songs, but i thought that aaron carter did a really great job in this, and seems like he was really into this movie, and made it seem real. my mom liked all the older farts that she grew up with, so that's cool too. i kept thinking that i liked a lot of the people, and wonder if i will see them again? a sequel would be cool. i rented this, but i might buy it too, since i have a ton of dvd's, and like to go back to see something that i missed. i couldn't buy it at blockbuster though, so i don't know where i could buy it right now, but i'll look into that. anyway, i am a 16 year old guy, i already said that, i know, but i would totally take a date to see this. it's really good for all ages, really. i think even my little half sister who is 6 could see this. that's what is so cool about it, that it is something that all ages can see. i'm sure that was done on purpose, but it really works. girls can dream about being with aaron carter, and guys like me can dream about all the hot chicks in this movie. there is something for everyone.

i know what most of people will think about this movie without even seen it... 'the typical movie from a famous singer... it will be a pink movie,a teenage film,it will be stupid...' and stuff like that... and yes, it is...i mean, it's a pink movie... but, you know what?...i loved it. seriously...it's a very romantic film... i think that every girl in this world has dreamed with something like the plot of 'popstar'... met his favorite singer, know him as a person...and even have a romance with him...right? ^^ i really enjoyed watching that... in addition, it's really funny... i think the actors did a great job... there's a lot of loving characters...and, aaron carter (jd) is not the exception... to be honest, in the first five minutes of see him act, i thought 'this will be awful'...but then , he surprised me really pleasingly...also, i gotta say that the music performances on the film are great! i specially loved the part when jd ( aaron) sings without music , (only with a guitar) a very beautiful song...this guy is really talented... time will tell...my advice to you?...watch it! don't make a prejudice ;-)

well, i have to say, this movie was probably the funniest movie i have seen all year. and i don't exactly mean that in a good way. this is probably the most pathetic movie i have seen in a while, and yet that's what makes it so hilarious. you can tell these people are really trying to act, unfortunately for them they aren't doing such a good job, making it so even lines delivered in what is supposed to be a serious tone come out sounding really funny. aaron carter is essentially playing a character quite similar to himself in real life, and still he manages to make the character seem corny and not at all realistic. this movie is one of those movies where everything that is supposed to sound serious comes out really funny and all the things that are supposed to be funny are just so stupid and corny that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying. this movie is so bad, it's actually good. i would definitely recommend it if your in the mood for a good laugh.

even though i am slightly older than the recommended age group, i really enjoyed this movie. it's a little break from reality and it must be every little girls dream to become friends with a pop star. i know it was mine, to be sure! the first 10 minutes were really cheesy and the mean girls said a few things that were also slightly cheesy. once you get over that, you can really start to enjoy it. i loved the relationship between jd and jane - it was really sweet and you could see how much they began to like each other. the soundtrack is perfect and it fits into the film really well. i also liked the family set up for jane, her sisters seemed lovely. very well made film.

aaron carter plays the pop star(j.d. mcqueen) in this movie (surprise surprise). this is a typical movie where the leading lady (jane) has a huge crush on j.d. mcqueen the pop star (as well as many other girls) but she's the lucky one that gets to spend the days with j.d. and forms a relationship with him that is more like a fantasy. j.d. has to go to a public school to keep his math grade up in order to do his summer tour. problem is j.d. isn't good at math. he finds the smartest person in school (jane) to tutor him. jane tutors and falls in love with j.d. j.d. in return falls in love with as well but j.d. screws up and has to fix everything in order to win the girl and make the summer tour. the movie is definitely worth watching. aaron will be a great actor!!!

wow is all i could say i really loved the movie and one thing i could say to aaron carter is that i really think that you should be in a lot more movies cause you rock.i love aaron carter so much hes hot and so i say thank you a lot for making this movie great.i really do so wish he would be able to make a lot more movies because he his a great dancer, actor, and singer. i so wish i could sing as good as he could. and i've been a fan of his for like ever and i will never ever stop loving him. i rented the movie and i've had it for two days and iv'e literally watched it over like 10 times. laugh out loud you could call me crazy but that just proves that i liked it a lot. if u wanna talk you can hit me up at dvlbab300@aol.com so e-mail me if you wanna. i love you aaron carter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this film brought me to tears. i have to say, that if i did not have a beautiful husband at home, i would ask this beautiful piece of art to marry me. aaron carter gives a masterful performance as a confused young pop star, while timothy barton writes quick and witty dialogue that only furthers the genius of carter's performance. kyle is pretty gay, but his performance was nothing less than spectacular. he is also very handsome and cute. i'm thinking about asking him out on a date and giving him a very sweet goodnight gift.;)if you would like to discuss this film in the future, please contact me.nick burrell vassar class of 2012 malibu, california malibu west 310 924 0126

i don't understand why everyone hates this movie, aside from the fact that they're just jealous their music careers never took off like mega popstar aaron carter. like it or not aaron has seen more success in his young life than most people could ever dream of having, so it only seemed natural for him to do a movie. lou pearlman and company have been known for over-exploiting their pop protégées, you remember justin timberlake's foray into tv movie model behavior? granted this movie isn't big scale and impressive, but it's not supposed to be. it's not trying to impress people or be an emmy award winner, it was released straight to dvd. it's just a cute little movie about an awkward teen who gets her dream of being with her favorite popstar; i know a lot of you out there have had that dream at some point or another about you favorite singer, don't deny it. it's sweet and gentle and i applaud it for not stepping into the realm of sex, violence, and vulgar language that seem to be creeping into more and more of our movies today. where's the decency? where's the line? teen dramas come in dozens these days because teens are a big market for companies, at least this one is more tolerable to me than bratz (aka slutz) with all the fake little girls running around going "oh mah gawd!" in tank tops and mini skirts and is fathoms better than those gore fest movies like saw. i feel for the main character girl because i was nerdy outcast girl in high school who loved aaron carter and nsync and the backstreet boys and other pop music and still do; and like aaron's character would get crushing "testophobia", especially in math. if you judge this movie solely based on the fact that you don't like or are jealous of aaron carter and his fame, then of course you're going to hate it and trash talk it in reviews. the only reason britney spears' dribble crossroads got a higher score is because she has boobs. accept this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be. i think this happy formulaic teen movie ends on a high note and makes you want to sing.

if monte hellman's legendary early 70's road movie masterpiece "two-lane blacktop" had been done more like a stark, stripped-down, fiercely taut and straightforward brooding mood piece embellished upon by that distinctly mean'n'lean, rough'n'tough, very raw and ragged macho australian mentality and topped off with a generous sprinkling of dour, despairing, no-hope-whatsoever end-of-the-road punk nihilism, it would undoubtedly be much similar to this jarringly bleak and atmospheric knockout.nice guy factory worker mike (an appealingly scruffy terry serio) runs afoul of sneering, shades-wearing fascist car race champ fox (a perfectly hateful richard moir) when he steals fox's fetching model girlfriend julie (the lovely deborah conway) away from him. mike and fox begin competing in increasingly lethal races in which the stakes become higher and higher with each successive bout, finally culminating in an especially pulse-pounding all-or-nothing race with only one true winner allowed. mike, assisted by his worried, but loyal italian mechanic pal tony (a splendidly smooth turn by vangelis mourikis) and tutored by blind, supremely hip 50's-style greaser rebel (marvelously essayed with maximum coolness by max cullen), willingly puts his life on the line for the sake of his reputation, the affection of his old lady, the money, and, most importantly, for the chance to topple the haughty fox from his gloating, glowering thrown. directed with utmost gravity and intensity by john clark, written to laconically right-on perfection by barry tomblim, with a shivery, flesh-crawling synthesizer score by peter crosbie and spare, unadorned cinematography by david gribble, this authentically gnarly early 80's item presents the concept of racing cars as not only a funky alternate lifestyle, but also an all-consuming obsession and reason for living (it's the sole thing most of the film's characters are really passionate about) with a remarkably astute and unblinking eye. complete with a harrowing downbeat ending and unsparingly grim central message about the bitter price one pays for being top dog, this riveting depiction of a dead-end existence rates as an extraordinary cinematic achievement.

whenever this film gets a mention, usually the discussion begins and ends with the wonderful collection of cars and drag scenes, often overlooked are the at times eclectic characters that populate the film around the three central charactersone character that stands out is rebel played by the great veteran australian actor max cullen. rebel is a blind drag racer, who nearly runs down the hero and his group in the middle of the night because he is not using any headlights.in the back story we discover that rebel master builder of street racing cars, and he and his wife seem locked in a time warp of the 1950's. rebel goes on to play a small but pivotal role in teaching mike, played by terry serio, the almost spiritual truth about street drag racing. it is not speed, reaction times that make a great racer. it is the one who feels the car best who will become the greatestthis is best exemplified as rebel explains to mike after a test drive "you got all the agony, just missing the style"graham bond, is another well credited actor lending his talents as a crooked police officer looking to get in on some of the financial action being generated by the street racing. the confrontation between bond and fox played by richard moir adds tension to the story. bond not only expects results but also fox to drum up racing businessfor most of the movie fox displays a real manipulative and evil side, yet in the climax he presents a sense of honor that turns the final few minutes into an extremely tense and memorable ending. it is almost as if the film is refocusing on its true intention, to show us the culture of street racing rather than the day to day activities of peopleone of the major complaints about the film is the script. although it is nothing exciting, i believe the complete lack of any chemistry between mikes girlfriend played by deborah conway and his mechanic played by vangelis mourikis has more to do with the problem. any scene in which these two interact simply should have been cutlastly in terms of the actors, one truly standout performance is delivered by kristoffer greaves, who plays a deaf and crippled member of fox's inner circle. his back story is never explored, was he injured in a race, born that way, what is it that fox sees value in to keep him around the reality of the film is simple, it is about street racing, and the culture behind it. when the cars are flying and action sequences are in motion it is the only time director john clark and his writer barry tomblin seem really comfortable with what they are doing.so if you are looking for an in depth exploration of human relationships, moments of life defining drama, then this film is not for you. if your pulse races at the thought of a blown 57 chev or the iconic gto phase 3 blazing away on the streets of sydney, then you wont find much better than this film

i'm guessing that we all, no matter if we are fans of cars, luv the sound of a dodge challenger as it growls along the road, the noise a 57 chevy make as it screams with ecstasy when it tears round a corner and, most of all, the blast of sound as a classic vehicle bursts into flames as it explodes. i'm not the biggest car enthusiast by any stretch of the imagination, but any of the above really does rev my engine! there's no denying the importance of transport on cinema. it has even been said that the invention of the train was one of the biggest influences on early cinema (looking out a window almost like a moving picture and the idea of being transported to a different time/space). but the car remains the most popular and most luved, it's even got its own genre: the carsploitation genre. a genre that focuses purely on the beauty of cars. in effect, it's just porn! car porn! and i'm not talking about that rather nasty documentary on channel 4 in which men actually had sexual intercourse with cars. whatever floats your...car, i guess. moving on... whilst running on empty isn't quite as pornographic as vanishing point (richard c. sarafian, 1971) for instance, with its close ups of the car in motion, all it's bumps and curves (!), this doesn't mean that the car isn't the main focus of this film. in fact, the cars themselves become characters (more on that later). they're objectified and fetishised as much as the women, in fact, maybe even more. and holy holy, are these cars something! every car in this film (besides the ones in the background) are simply beautiful  works of art, there's no question about it.as i was saying, these incredible cars are, in a way, given characters themselves. you actually start sympathising with the car! spoiler  most notably during the scene in which the car is being wrecked and burnt spoiler over. this has become almost a convention of the carsploitation genre; the evil 1978 plymouth fury from christine (john carpenter, 1983), satan's custom lincoln mark iii in the car (elliot silverstein, 1977), the nifty little mini coopers from the italian job (peter collinson, 1969) to the friendly volkswagen beetle in the love bug (robert stevenson, 1968) and of course each car from death race 2000 (paul bartel, 1975) and even wacky races (1968-1970) all of which had their own character. ironically however, this emphasis on the car often over takes (!) the human characters! and this is certainly the case with running on empty, in which only one human character (the blind character who drives his car with his hearing rather than sight) has any sort of dimension, the rest are very much stock characters. these are all your stereotypical australian 1980s teenagers; big hair, annoying accents and none of whom would look out of place in neighbours, especially the kylie minouge look-a-like. but who gives a damn? it's all about the cars racing and crashing! that's it! if you don't like that you really are watching the wrong genre.the car scenes are certainly the selling point of this film, and the best thing it's got going for it. they are fast; very fast! and we're not talking about the rather annoying technique some films seem to use where they record the car 'speeding' at around 40mph, and then speed it up. oooh no! not with this film you don't. these cars are zooming along at top speeds in real time  no fancy editing tricks here. so, we've got speed. check. what about crashes? check, check, check! whilst there isn't cars crashing everywhere a la the incredibly blues brothers (john landis, 1980) , when cars do crash in this film, they certainly crash! it would seem that they use gunpowder or something similar to build the cars as one little hit and kaboom they're up in flames. it kind of reminded me of thriller: a cruel picture (bo arne vibenius, 1974) in that sense.between these simply awesome scenes (especially the very start and the very end) there are quite a few scenes which slow everything done and, in my opinion, fail to add very much to the film. note: more exploding cars needed! however there are a couple of exceptions here which are great scenes  spoiler especially the attempted rape scene.so, all in all, this is a man's film! a boy's film! full of cars vroom vroom vrooming around the outback and a couple of tits thrown in for good measure too. i'd recommend this little film to anyone even if they are keen cyclists (!)  it's a great film which you can just switch your brain off, sit back in your leather chair and put on full volume! i'll give it 3.5 luvs out of 5 luvs  bruuuuum! p.s  amazon are selling this for just over £2  it's a real bargain although the dvd lacks any special features whatsoever.

this is a top car flick (its a work of art/ yer a work of art!) all classic cars no plastic fantastic, i have watched it over & over again i have worn out two video tapes, and will wear out lots more. lots more car lovers young or old will love this film & watch it more than 1 time! so hire it or buy it (just see it) i wish they would make more (car) movies like this v8 power not gassed up little whipper snippers!!!!(shes a 351 right?)(motor magic) (the heap the chariot)(you've got to learn to feel the power)

the movie has started, the wheels spin, your car has entered a race against the fox.... you're behind you can't get in front, you figure, "if i go out, i'm taking you with me..." you smash into the cars parked on the side of the road, you turn to hit fox but your aim is bad.... bang, you've gone up the back of a vw, and smash you've landed in a reservoir. your car lights on fire. you could get out if you wanted, but the shame of losing has taken you... bang! your car blows up, everyone looks on in despair, some crying... the sound of a siren tells you the cops are coming. everyone gets in their cars and bolts, leaving you to burn. the charred remains of the cars frame sits there, haunting the on lookers... you're dead.this is one of the scenes; actually its the first scene in the movie. there are many more like it. as you enter the cockpit of the fox in his pimped out v8 ford, terry serio in his crazy gtho, and many others in this blast from the past.... john clarks masterpiece, "running on empty" "-he'll win at any cost-"

for those of you out there who have seen this pic on vhs, i would recommend the dvd. in fact the vhs is utter rubbish. the main reason is that the film was shot widescreen (2.55:1) and the producers ran out of money making the vhs version and released it as 4:3. the result is that several actors are not on screen at all, and in many drag races, less than half the cars are showing since one is on each side of the screen. the dvd is actually a reasonable version of the film.a lot of the best scenes in the film were cut before the final release. they were viewed as being too offensive to minority groups. in fact the prospect of a us release caused even more cuts in the film. for example, the americans reputedly did not understand words such as petrol & strides. mike's dad and mum were meant to be hippies. the dad survives in the film as a wasted dope smoking guitarist. but the following scene with the mum was cut. the scene took place in the roof space of the house which was lined with aluminium foil, fluoro lights and filled with plants... you get the picture. the producers had rounded up a lot of real plants for the foreground and when they saw the result on the big sheet, they freaked and the scene was cut. cowards!yes, the film is noted as an australian cult classic. voted #2 in street machines best 100 films of all time, narrowly missing out to mad max ll. the latter had over 10 times the budget of roe. in fact the budget on roe was so small that the director could not afford to wreck any of the cars... even though there would have been a public outcry if anyone had wrecked a real ho. (compare that with smoky and the bandit or blues bros where dozens of cars were wrecked.) so there's one real gtho and two fakes. one of the fakes was bought from the local indigenous community in cobar after the standby gtho crashed into the back of the country boy's truck. (that was unscripted! the car was meant to burst out from the side of the truck.) because the budget was so tight, the car was made up with ordinary brown masking tape instead of the painted on gold trim of the real thing.the 55 chev is absolutely real. the car began as a very plain 4 door and was brilliantly and quickly converted to the blown '55 in the film. the motor was a marinised 545 which made around 1000 bhp. this was reduced to around 600 for the filming. the car was able to easily to 170 mph as show in several scenes in the film. just for the record, anyone with $12,000 could have picked up all the cars after the film. the ho, the dodge, the '53 ute, rammer's 53 chev... the lot. wonder where they are now?sw

i remember watching this movie many years ago on vhs at a friends place. at first i thought it would be a boring car movie. but much to my surprise it ended up being one of the best movies i can remember watching for its time.it has a good story line and best of all it has some awesome aussie cars and street racing. i really loved fox's car the most which was a worked dodge charger. the paint work which was done on this car was truly outstanding in my opinion :)!there's also a black two door blown 57 chev which comes into the movie later on. i actually managed to get a copy of this movie on vhs last year at k-mart over here in australia. i did have plans of converting this movie to dvd myself as i believe it is a movie worth the conversion. but much to my surprise this weekend while i was browsing the dvd movie bin i came across it on dvd. so of course i grabbed it while i could as it was the only copy there.anyway if you really want to see some classic street racing with real muscle cars, including a great story line without a rice burner in sight. then this movie is for you!!!!here is some additional info taken from the back of the dvd.he'll win at any cost fox is a young man that lives in the fast lane. he believes he is the fastest man on the road - but street racing is illegal. if he doesn't accept his latest challenge he could loose his girl... if he does accept, he could lose his life. living dangerously, living fast and winning at any cost is their obsession. they don't turn back, the don't give in.. and the don't ask for help.

this is one of my all time favourite movies, if ur not into cars then forget it!! this movie features 1 of aussies greatest muscle cars, the xygtho. yeah so the acting not the greatest - it was never made to win an oscar. the car action will keep you comin back for more and more. there is a cool collection of muscle cars from the 70's and an awesome '57 chev - with a real cool cat drivin it! also there is a really cool song sung by terry serio the main actor. the acting is pretty funny when taken lightly, but the tyre smokin and drag racing is the main focus in this movie. big fast cars with pleantly of steel(no plastic cars), and some cool street dragging. i recommend it only to people that are into cars and not someone looking for great acting.

i saw uzumaki about a year ago and was mesmerized. the only japanese horror film i had seen before this one was kwaidan (which i proudly own on dvd, by the way), superb! the idea of a town being absorbed by spirals sounds exactly like something out of lovecraft. certainly it reminds one of shadow over innsmouth, of the inhabitants slowly turning into monstrosities (in this case giant snails). and who can forget the washing machine sequence? i hope we will soon see this one available on region 1 dvd (i see that sundance has recently screened it on us tv, hopefully they'll do it again very soon) so that we can all see it. highly recommended!!!!!

having discovered the ring trilogy, i have been greedily gobbling up all those other japanese and korean films that are either on or following the bandwagon.i don't have an easy definition of horror, but this film certainly pushed some of my buttons, even though i can't claim that the film makes a lot of sense. i'm squeamish so there were several points in the film when i just didn't want to watch what was happening on screen. the film unnerved me so i became apprehensive of seeing things that i thought i was going to see.it's an imaginative film offering a great deal visually. it also provides food for thought. and plenty of material to argue about when the film is over.the characters are well-defined to say the least. could they make films like this in the west?so it doesn't make sense in the end, but when one has an appetite for the occult, the supernatural, the bizarre, the otherworldly, then no film is going to deliver a final all-explaining pay-off.

watched uzumaki last night and right away was reminded of two early peter weir films from australia, the last wave and picnic at hanging rock. they were films loaded with atmosphere but short on actual horror. uzumaki, to me, seems clearly influenced by these films. it has a number of fairly mundane scenes that become more portentous the deeper you are sucked in by the film. it also has more scenes of outright horror and although i don't think the film actually measures up to those two films it is well worth the time of most thoughtful fans of the unusual (not necessarily horror). 7 out of 10 seems fair but i must say that years after seeing the last wave the film still stays with me, and it is precisely picnic at hanging rock's unresolved ending that makes it so haunting. p.s. all the people criticizing the acting... pullleasse...in this genre?

uzumaki succeeds as at plunging you into a bizarre surreality where uzumaki shapes haunt and curse a town. it fails at being a competent horror movie. while the film is sure to draw attention mainly to it's bizarre plot line and a few interesting visual treats, it's going to come off better as a dark comedy than a horror film. it's definitely a film you should see if your into the kind of stuff- but if your looking for a scare or even a small chill, you'll want to look elsewhere. uzumaki doesn't really have much else up it's sleeve but a great chain of odd events.a

to be honest, i thought this movie would be a japanese drama. i was dead wrong. this movie is based of the popular japanese anime novel of the same name. it tells the story of a town that is cursed by the uzumaki or the spiral in english. little by little the towns residents start to slowly become dangerously and violently obsessed with anything to do with spirals and some of the residents start to actually turn into living things the actually have some sort of spiral within them such as a snail.the movie was one giant, random, acid trip twisted with romance and drama. sort of like atwisteddrama. what makes this movie disturbing is the ways that some of the people are obsessed with the spiral. for example: one of the dads has a garage full of house hold objects with spirals incorporated into them, one girl took her extremely long hair and teased to an insanely huge spiral-like style, one kid slowly transformed into a human snail, one man could twist his body into a spiral shape, one woman attempted to cut her ear open to obtain the cochlea inside and one teen ran over himself so that he could be twisted around a car tire and one kid stuffed himself into a washer so he could become a spiral.another very disturbing aspect of this very well syndicated is the atmospheric tone and the style in which this movie was shot. the camera angles add to the psychotic and twisted story, in other words, a very good cinematography. the overall coloring of this picture makes for a somewhat demented story. the coloring is a blend of lime green, yellow and a little orange and the special effects with some of the spirals are outstanding.however, like many japanese films, this one has an undertone of forbidden love and romance between a girl and a boy. however, with all the spirals and strange happening going on in the town it is hard to keep up with the relationship of the two teens. but, in some way it is very irrelevant, more like a second hand story that has nothing to do with the actual story of the spiral obsessed town.overall, i would recommend this film to anybody who likes vastly different and bizarre foreign films. it has just enough wackiness and insanity, it touched me.

uzumaki has a formidable reputation within lovecraftian circles and now i know why.uzumaki is based on a manga title (which, unbelievably, is allegedly better than the film) and follows the bizarre events preceeding a typhoon in an isolated japanese town. i'm not about to tell you anything that happens in this film because it is an absolute must-see movie. i watched it for the first time last night and i was blown away. it shot into the my top movies of all time and leap-frogged pans labyrinth as the best fantastic movie (literally and photographically) that has been released in the last decade.this movie is very lovecraftian in nature without formally having any direct connection to the cthulhu mythos. it has been made in the same way that lovecraft composed his stories; it exudes power as an aura of 'something's not quite right here' intensifies through a brooding phase to dread and, ultimately, horror through subtle progressive changes in the soundtrack and the cinematography. this is, indeed, a "weird tale" par excellence.simply stunning.

uzumaki has a very unique story and i will never look at spirals the same way again. not really spine tingling horror, this film has a dark morose, acid trip feel to it. during certain parts, was it just me or did you see vortex visuals? the camera shots are interesting and the movie lets your imagination run wild. the bizarre supernatural feel of this film draws you in just as the title suggests. acting is done well and the town setting itself seems wrong with to begin with.this may take a few viewings for it to sink in. a great trippy film.

uzumaki (that's japanese for "spiral" or "vortex") is one of the most absurd films i've ever watched. a town becomes obsessed and then all-consumed by the vortex pattern in some very grotesque ways. fingertips are cut off, people commit suicide in washing machines... just wild and crazy japanese horror. possibly as psychologically damaging as "the ring". generally not as scary as "the eye", but the imagery in this is more sickening than most of the things in "the eye". and not as gory as "the untold story"... but that isn't to say there isn't a fair amount of blood and dismemberment. seriously, if you enjoy horror films and especially asian horror - you must add this film to your list. a few parts are a little odd with the sound effects (the story is adapted from a manga comic and it shows), but it really fits. unlike some films that try too hard to capture the original source ("house of the dead") this one does it perfectly. the most original film you will see... not just this year, but probably ever. recommended!

a girl begins to notice that people in her small town are becoming fascinated by anything that is shaped like a spiral. soon, the fascination turns to obsession and things get deadly. while i won't say that "uzumaki" was an excellent film, i will say that it was unlike anything i've seen before. throughout my viewing, i felt like i was watching a cartoon. there are funny segues between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes. later, i found out the film is an adaptation of a manga comic, so this makes sense. however, just when you think you are watching something that could be a kid's movie, you are bombarded with nasty and gory visuals! the story often lags and the ending is somewhat abrupt and seemed anti-climactic at the time, but in retrospect i appreciate it more for its originality. my rating: 7/10.

uzumaki is a visually astounding film however i felt as if some of the story line may have been sacrificed. there is hardly any character development which left me feeling personally detached from the film, which is ironic because all puns aside, this film really does draw you in with its many slight spiral effects and stunning scene transitions. at first the overall cinematography threw me off but as you get used to the overall appearance you start to see the beauty in this twisted film. this is a great movie if you are looking for a looker with out too much substance or deeper meaning.it is a great horror film that is not actually scary or suspenseful but somehow...eerie.

a couple of weeks after i saw this movie it began to remind me of john carpenter's in the mouth of madness (not for the story!) for the atmosphere, the fast elements of surprise and the dreamlike sequences. on the other hand, this movie mixes very well the image and the music (note the 4th chapter in the movie)

anyone who enjoys the lynchian weirdness of twin peaks, or any fan of hp lovecraft who knows that the most frightening things are the familiar things, will really enjoy this film. don't watch it as a horror film in the "traditional" western sense, but more like a grimm's fairy tale. it is gory and definitely for 16+, but once you start watching it, you too will find yourself drawn into the vortex. definitely one of those movies that hangs with you for a few days after watching (i'll never look at my snails the same way again!)

life is comprised of infinite possibilities; some known, others a mystery and destined to remain so. and what of the vast unknown, the realms beyond which knowledge has no established boundaries or parameters? who is to say what exists or what is possible? valid questions, all of which are raised and explored in the story of a particular individual's personal journey, a strange and dramatic odyssey that defies facts and logic, in `k-pax,' directed by iain softley, and starring kevin spacey and jeff bridges. in the wake of an incident in new york's central station, a man named prot (spacey) is transported to a psychiatric hospital in manhattan, where he is delivered into the care of dr. mark powell (bridges), who attempts to uncover the truth about his patient, who claims to be from the distant planet k-pax. it quickly becomes a challenge for dr. powell, as prot, with his calm, direct, forthcoming manner and a propensity for produce (he eats bananas peels and all, and red delicious apples are his favorites) is quite convincing. but it's powell's job, as well as his nature, to be skeptical. prot's claims, however, remain intact and stand up even under the most intense probing and the watchful eye of dr. powell, who finds himself in something of a quandary-- prot even tells him the exact date and time that he will depart for k-pax, a scheduled return trip that allows powell but a short time to sort it all out. and powell just can't seem to get his mind around the idea that he is dealing with a real alien being; and it's something he is going to have to resolve quickly, if he is ever going to know the truth. and he has to know. the truth, after all, is the only thing that is going to set him free in his own mind.	softley has created and delivered a sensitive, thought-provoking film that challenges the viewer by sustaining the mystery surrounding prot while forcing you to reflect upon your own concepts of what is, in fact, possible. and as you never know for sure about prot until the denouement, you are able to identify with powell, seeing the situation from his point of view and trying to solve the riddle right along with him. softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real sense of being confronted with something that is truly unique as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that prot just may be what he says he is. and in the context of the reality to which the film is disposed, it's an engrossing matter to try to wrap your mind around. how do you react when all of the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations we've set for ourselves? while at the heart of the film there is a resounding depth of humanity that is evident, not only in prot, but in dr. powell, as well. all of which makes for an extremely engaging and gripping drama.	as we've come to expect, kevin spacey gives a brilliant performance as prot, presenting his character from the inside out, emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time. this is a unique individual, and spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing, which adds to the believability of the character and the credibility of the story itself. for this film to work, it is essential that we believe who and what prot is; we do, and it does. spacey simply pulls it off magnificently. it's a memorable performance, from which evolves a character that will stay with you for a long, long time.	jeff bridges, meanwhile, emerges on equal footing with spacey, adeptly making a very real person of dr. powell. it's a fairly straightforward role, and the challenge for bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make him unique in his own right, which, opposite the character of prot was no small task. and, again, for this film to work it was necessary for bridges to rise to the occasion. and, with exceptional skill and being the consummate professional that he is, he succeeds without question. bridges infuses powell with an underlying complexity, and is so giving in his performance, that it makes the interaction between powell and prot vibrant, and at times intense. it's a demonstration of two of the finest actors in the business doing what they do best, creating a dynamic that is alive and inspiring. it's a great job by bridges, who never attempts to steal the spotlight from prot, which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher notch.	the supporting cast includes mary mccormack (rachel), alfre woodard (dr. villers), ajay naidu (dr. naidiu), vincent laresca (navarro), kimberly scott (joyce), conchata ferrell (betty) and saul williams (ernie). an entertaining, emotionally involving film, `k-pax' is a dissertation on possibilities, as well as an examination of the ever evolving complexities of the human condition. it's a film that demands an open mind and rewards those who are able to approach it on it's own terms and embrace it. in the end, it makes you realize just how real k-pax is; and it makes you appreciate prot's journey, and just how much we all share and have in common with those around us, human or alien. and it may just make you reflect upon your own journey-- where you've been and where you're going. and that's the magic of the movies. i rate this one 10/10. 

k-pax is a very intriguing film. is prot (kevin spacey) really an alien, or is he a mentally deranged human who just thinks he is an alien? that is the question that dr. powell (jeff bridges) must answer before the self proclaimed deadline that prot sets for his departure from earth.as the film unfolds and more evidence is uncovered, both theories grow in credibility. his ability to map from memory the area of the galaxy where his home planet is located indicates a knowledge that no human could possibly possess. yet the hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life, filled with devastating events that could have caused such a personality aberration. the ending seems to give the answer, but is just ambiguous enough to make you wonder if you really know. normally, i don't like lady or tiger endings, but this one is tantalizing. i have my own theory that fits all the clues, but i don't know that my theory is any more correct than anyone else's.director iain softley (`wings of the dove') spins the tale delicately, with great skill. this is a rare example of the director staying in the shadows and inducing outstanding acting performances out of talented actors to let the story dominate. this is not to say that the directing is technically inferior, because it is excellent. however, softley remains unobtrusive, delivering great power through the use of subtlety, a pleasant change from today's vanguard directors who visually grab and shake the viewer as if to scream, `look how brilliant i am!'kevin spacey once again delivers a marvelous performance as prot. this is a part that is extraordinarily demanding, requiring spacey to render the cool and logical prot one minute, and then switch gears to conjure his tormented alter ego under hypnosis the next. spacey is so believable as both alien and human, it makes the viewer's task that much more difficult. jeff bridges is also terrific as the relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about prot.this is inspired storytelling for the thoughtful viewer. i rated it a 9/10. if you must have closure at the end of a film, this movie will be very frustrating. however, if you like a fascinating mystery that keeps you thinking long after the credits, you won't be disappointed.

i got this as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 dvds. i knew nothing about the history of the series. season 1 of the series has the pilot episode as episode 1 and then 3 more episodes for a total of 4. season 2 lists 5 episodes with the last being beyond good and evil with an original air date of 7 december 1998. the other 4 episodes on season 2 were broadcast from december 1997 to febrausry 1998. so beyond good and evil looks like season 3 episode 1, except there are no more episodes in season 3.spoilers here. the two main characters of the first 8 episodes, dr. iain mccallum (john hannah) and dr. angela moloney (zara turner), are missing from this episode being replaced by dr. dan gallagher (nathaniel parker) and dr. charley fielding (eva pope). i recognized nathaniel parker from the series the inspector lynley mysteries, which began in 2001. so they were planning to have a season 3 but only one episode was broadcast.it seems odd to try to continue a series named after the main character, mccallum, when the main character is gone from the series. so they might have been planning a return of dr. iain mccallum, but when that failed the series was canceled. i have no inside information on this but i do see that both john hannah and nathaniel parker were involved in other projects in 1999. does anyone have any information on this?

as with some of the best films and series, i stumbled across this quite by accident. it was late, a storm was in full force outside and i was sitting comfortably on the sofa when i flicked past a channel that was just about to show one of the episodes. i intended merely to watch a couple of minutes while waiting for the commercials to be finished on another channel before switching back to some or other sitcom. about an hour and a half later i remembered my resolve and was so happy that i hadn't done that. needless to say i made sure i saw all the other episodes.john hannah has been brilliant in almost everything i have seen him in and he does not let down here either. all other cast members do a stellar job too. my personal favourite (aside from john hannah, of course) is gerard murphy.the only negative side to this series are the limited amount of episodes. only 8 with jh himself and an additional 1 with someone else. i would love to see mccallum back on the screens, though it would have to be with jh!

a mixture of alien and ghost busters?starts very promising, then slows down to almost boring. lifeforce contains some awesome special effects they were able to make in the mid 80's. the story is intriguing, but becomes quite lack lustre in the end. it was rated r because of the nudeness, sex and gore. mathilda may's ethereal and savage (naked) beauty is very apparent through out the whole movie. a bizarre movie and cost a lot by the time it was made. this could have been a bigger classic with a better script, but unfortunately it wasn't a great hit, i think it actually flopped quite bad. so, something went wrong with this one, but still, it's very entertaining.

without a doubt, one of tobe hoppor's best! epic storytellng, great special effects, and the spacegirl (vamp me baby!).

non-stop action and just about every conceivable (and inconceivable!) sci-fi/horror cliche can be found in this blatantly silly but fun, big-budget epic. the pace never lets up, especially in the shorter us version, which tightens things up considerably.

lifeforce is certainly one of tobe hooper's best films. it has some great special effects and a lot of nudity, so it seems like a typical horror fan's dream. the film is quit creative though and i think that's because of the script from dan o'bannon and don jakoby. nice cinematography and a good creepy atmosphere make it a solid film.

ok, let's get this out of the way first: as a piece of cinema, lifeforce is rubbish. as a bit of cheesy entertainment for sf buffs, it's got a lot of merit. if you enjoy watching those old black and white sf b-movies - giant mutated spiders/ant or alien monsters wandering around the desert - you really will get a kick out of lifeforce.bad things: the story makes little sense and the acting is pretty poor. good things: the special effects are halfway decent; it has a welcomingly different british centered story (it's set in london) which gives different feel to most sf movies; and it has the well-endowed mathilda may (amusingly billed as "space girl") wandering around stark naked. in short: it's fun. i've seen it half a dozen times now, and every time it comes on tv i make time to watch it - admittedly this is partly to do with the naked ms. may - but it's also to do with the enjoying a bit of unassuming and silly sf.

i finally got hold of lifeforce on dvd with the widescreen format intact and rousing henry mancini score to the max. after having viewed lifeforce for fifteen years on tape, i have to say that the 'uncut' dvd version was both great and disappointing. the u.s. version is so *much* better than the dvd (european?) version. the u.s. version of lifeforce moves much faster (the editing on the dvd version is terrible. feels like an unfinished cut). and the many scenes not seen in the american version add little or nothing to the final problem. in fact one "new" moment almost destroys the entire movie, when caine (peter firth) meets the male alien at the cathedral. i love this scene, in the u.s. version though. on the dvd, the male alien speaks to caine and what he says is soooooo hilarious. it's the pinnacle of hilarity:"it'll be much less terrifying if you just come to me!" the male alien says, in a deep 1950s style voice. i was floored when i saw this. it just doesn't belong in the movie. that scene is pure camp in an otherwise super serious flick. i'm glad hooper (or whoever) cut that scene when the movie was released in north america. there are several changes that were made for the u.s. version that make lifeforce that much better and i wished the dvd had the u.s. version. the editing is sharp and frenzied without being annoying and some spots that were already boring in the u.s. version are even more boring on the dvd version because of added scenes. and the opening credits on the dvd is terrible. much better in the u.s. version. more subtle.i love this film. it's basically aliens making a pit-stop over earth and sucking up as much lifeforce as possible. the film has too many flat, uninspiring sequences (talk, talk, talk) but when the action goes to london, it's fun. the film really shines in these scenes. one can see hooper finally doing what he's great at: chaos, savagery, horror! lifeforce should have had more of these chaos scenes. they're the best apocalyptic scenes ever put on film. it's also the best zombie movie ever. the zombies are hungry (for lifeforce, not flesh) and they're crazed and agile and terrifying. not the slow moving bores of other zombie movies. also, a lot of people have criticized the ending but i love it. it leaves you high and dry, like one of the lifeforce-drained victims.and to think this movie came out during the cute and cuddly 80s, when people flocked to e.t. or cocoon or other sweet and boring, feel good sci-fi movies. no wonder it bombed because it was way ahead of its time with its super nihilistic point of view!as for the dvd, well, it ain't great. the image is muddy and grainy and there are no extras whatsoever. but it's great to see the movie in its widescreen format. i just hope that they'll release a clean, crisp u.s. version on a dvd, and with commentary by hooper and dykstra.

i am surprised so few have good words for this movie. for its time (the 80's) it was a very entertaining and engaging story. casting was good. story was good. special effects were remarkable for the time period. deserving of an 8/10.

lifeforce (1985) was a cannon funded film directed by tobe hooper. it's a very interesting film that deals with a pair of space vampires who are accidentally brought back down to earth during the latest space shuttle mission. steve railsback stars as the sole survivor of the tragedy. but really folks the movie is a mere showcase for the natural beauty of mathilda may. she's one smoking hot number. the director was a huge fan of female vampire (a.k.a. erotikill). miss may recreates lina romay's title role the film is beautifully photographed and directed. there's plenty of gore effects to keep genres fans happy.i have to give this film a very high rating. tobe hooper was the man. he made three interesting films for cannon during this time period (texas chainsaw massacre ii and invaders from mars as well). if you like science fiction/horror films, tobe hooper films or mathilda may this film's just up your alley.highest recommendation!did i mention mathilda may is smoking hot?

something i think some people miss about great science fiction is that it predicts some part of the future. no other theatrical movie that i can recall predicted that when the space shuttle went to study halley's comet that a disaster would occur! some differences were: the "churchill" (the shuttle in the movie) actually went to the comet, the "challenger" was only in low earth orbit; the "churchill" was merely burned out inside, whereas the "challenger" exploded--hey the vampires had to get back to earth. one great similarity (and this is always bad luck!) both had mixed male/female crews--the legend of halley's comet and disaster continues!other than this there is not much more to be said about this movie that hasn't been said before. as a outer space/science fiction/horror/sex film individually it provided nothing really new, but as in all great dishes it is the combination that counts. and taken together, this was a highly original and satisfying combination.i just wish mathilda may would drain her victims through another part of the body!

based on the book "space vampires" by colin wilson. this is (in my humble opinion) one of the best pieces of sci-fi horror to come out of the eighties. the effects (done by ilm) still hold up by todays standards. the actors are mostly british and being british seem to give this film a greater depth of realism. the film was panned by the critics and sadly failed to do well at the box office on both sides of the atlantic. tobe hooper blamed the promotional work that was done before its release as the main cause for it's low takings. but for whatever reason, it still does not detract from the fact that this is an excellent film with a great cast and well-paced plot. not to be over-looked.

this really is a great movie. i don't think it has ever gotten the recognition that it deserves. i have bought this movie on vhs and dvd. the special effects were ahead of its time. the story was way cool. the pace was very steady. if you haven't seen it, you definitely need to check it out on dvd if possible.

by far one of the best sci-fi films out there. however, it does take multible viewings to understand the concept of the film and to be able to appreciate not only the special effect, but the main plot of the film itself. it is my own feelings that this film film got such poor reviews because no one took the time to watch the film the way it was meant to be seen. it does have some moments you wish would hurry up and pass by, but they are few and far between. hooper, who directed tcm 1 and 2 along with a remake of invaders from mars, and the funhouse does his best work here. great score, good acting,and great effects makes this a film to add to your collection, if you get the chance see the widescreen version on dvd, highly recommended to any one who is a fan of sci-fi.

a lot of people say the end did not make sense, but it did. with the female vampire dead the link to earth was broken and the ship took off, having picked up a lot of lifeforce from hundreds of thousands of souls. enough to re-energize those hexagon cells and create new bat creatures. it seems they do not have carnal sex, like vampires of legend. vampire bats from outer space may be ludicrous, but killing them with with a shot to qui force center below the heart is consistent. all you can ask for is consistency. the viewer has to suspend disbelief, even for scifi. the only problem is having to be a sword or stake, not bullets. that puts in a supernatural twist that does not fit with sci-fi. so that is a problem. the only major inconsistency i found is killing the male vampires with the sword, but the soul of the girl and carlsen go up to the ship. i assume the males souls also went up the ship, but not shown. what about all the humans killed? do their qui forces ("souls") go up to the ship as discrete entities, are does all the lifeforce get merged into one, for use as ship sees fit? in other words, all the human souls that went to the ship could be re-incarnated as bat creatures. the basic concept is no more ridiculous than star wars "force" or even re-incarnation. this movie was over the top, kitchen sink (dawn of the dead meets alien meets dracula), but in many ways profound. it was also a beautiful love story. the beginning and end were ethereal. it both began ("what is happening to me") and ended as a love story. most of the criticism of the movie is about its being bizarre.so what? bizarre is an art form. as far as being ludicrous, it all fits. the plague concept is much more interesting and subtle than the aliens just killing people. maybe they didn't need patrick steward's blood to form an image of the girl, but it was a very far out, surreal, scene. another reason the movie is hated is because of the end. but the end fits perfectly with the beginning. people are so wrapped up in the nude girl that they miss the movie's core. its a lover story,from start to finish. it starts with carlsen and the girl on the alien spaceship and finished same way. so it fits perfectly. most people are fixated on the hero killing the monster, and this movie did not end that way, which is precisely why i love it. instead, it has a happy ending, with the 2 of them going back to ship, to be reborn. way cooler than the hero kills monster end, but that is exactly why it bombed. it was not a straight-up horror or even scifi/horror at all, but a love story, with a beautiful beginning and end. all those souls twinkling on the ship. and the crystal room pulsating with new life. most people can't deal with a love story that is also alien meets dawn of the dead meets dracula.

is it a perfect movie? no. it is a weird adaptation from a sci-fi book and it features vampires from space, naked beauties and the british army efficiency.when i first saw this movie i was rather young and all i can remember is the feeling of awe for the movie and mathilda may. actually, if it weren't for this gorgeous lady being naked the whole movie, i probably wouldn't have rated it so high, but given her sheer magnificence, i am now actually considering voting it up!lucky for me i got reminded of the movie and watched it again now. imagine raiders of the lost ark or poltergeist special effects splattered unto a rather decent sci-fi story, but with completely over the top performances. i still enjoyed the movie tremendously (as well as mathilda may), but it was a mixture of nostalgia, comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it ended.bottom line: if you are a sci-fi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie. oh, and did i mention mathilda may is young, beautiful and naked?

lifeforce is an extremely schizophrenic movie, based on colin wilson`s novel the space vampires the script ignores most of the novel`s concepts and structure ( indeed it owes more to the quatermass serials than the novel ) but the scenes it does leave in from the novel are nearly identical to those in the film . and talking of the script it must be one of the most uneven in cinema history , it`s though it was written in chapters by several different people. take for instance carlson , he disappears after the early shuttle scenes which led me to believe he was dead then he turns up again halfway through the film in order to explain the plot to the beleaguered brits and it`s this lack of attention by the screenwriters that spoils the film . and there`s plenty of other clumsy scripting such as the heroes returning to london in a helicopter and not realising it has been over run by zombies untill they`re flying over it .i could go on at great length about these plot holes but lifeforce is actually enjoyable to watch as long as you don`t use your brain . it`s good to see a sci-fi horror film from an era when aliens were portrayed as being cute creatures that children hid in their bedrooms so that nasty human adults wouldn`t get their hands on them . the special effects and pyrotechnics are very very good , there`s lots of action and stunts and lifeforce features one of the most memorable aliens in the form of the space girl . when mentioning lifeforce in conversation with males it`s always a race to say " seen the alien in lifeforce? she can suck the lifeforce out of me anytime " hardly surprising looking at the demographics of the votes that this film is more popular with males than females" don`t worry . a naked girl can`t escape from here " can`t she ? pity

to the guy who hatched the idea for lifeforce i have one thing to say: thank you, sir! lifeforce combines the big-budget sci-fi pomp of star trek: the motion picture with the cheap horror thrills of phantasm and tops it all off with t-ts-- and some real meaty hangers at that..and best of all, it's actually a good movie! it amazes me that someone actually justified a mainstream movie that is a vehicle for a hot chick to appear naked on screen for an hour and a half to producers. god bless you, all of you who were involved.steve railsback (helter skelter) plays col. carlson, the american commander of an international space mission sent to investigate halley's comet. carlson's crew finds an alien vessel inside the comet and inside that they find three naked people in suspended animation--two guys and a hot broad (mathilda may). well, to make a long story short, they're "space vampires"...naked "space vampires." they trash the crew except for col. blueballs who decided that he had to let the hot chick out of her lucite display case because the part of his brain that controls his nut fluids told him it was the right thing to do. the col. wings it back to our big blue ball in an escape pod. meanwhile, another space shuttle crew has discovered his ship floating dead in space and has brought the three space coffins of the living dead martians back to london. and that's when people start turning into pork rinds and s--t in general just starts getting' way out of hand too damn fast.carlson teams up with the unflappable col. caine (peter firth) of the british s.a.s. to track down our naked cutie--who is having one hell of a time sucking guys off left and right. carlson's discovered that he has a mental link with vampira that allows them to track her down, with the ultimate goal being to blow her ass away and wreck her and her pals' big space umbrella that sucks up the energy of the people that the vamps attack. will they succeed in time? minor spoiler: yes.wow. what can i say but "wow"? this damn movie really works. i can't believe they got actual british actors like aubrey morris (a clockwork orange) and patrick stewart (sexiest man alive or some such title) to appear in this film. all the actors are good. direction is good and really shines during the last half where we see the fantastic devastation of london. special effects are no slouch either. for 1985, this movie must've been the s--t as far as fx goes. all the effects are fairly impressive and there's a wide range of talent on display here in animotronics, makeup effects, light shows, and very nice space scenes with some good old-fashioned modeling and matte painting--very nicely done. there's even some gore and bloody squib shots for all the horror fanboys out there.lifeforce is a great film for anyone who has nostalgia for when popular films on the bigsceen were made with 100% love from start to finish. the creators of the movie really made sure all the bases were covered and the end result is a phenomenally fun affair that doesn't let you turn away because the proceedings are just too good-looking. real solid entertainment here: 8 1/2 out of 10.

tobe hooper (fresh off mainstream success with 'poltergeist') aims for the skies this time around. 'lifeforce' is an adaptation of colin wilson's 'the space vampires'. the script by 'alien's dan o' bannon and don jakoby) varies a bit i was told: the futuristic storyline was made contemporary and hailey's comet was added to coincide with its actual passage by earth a few weeks after the films release (so i've read).the story concerns a shuttle mission (commander by steve railsback) sent to investigate hailey's comet as it passes by earth. all goes off without a hitch but upon reaching the comet it is discovered that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the comet. the team investigates the massive structure and discovers desiccated bat-like creatures. looking deeper into the ship a chamber is found that contains three humanoids (two naked males and one rather fetching nude lady too) in odd stasis coffins. the crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature in tow.a bit later the ship returns to earth but no contact can be made by nasa and another shuttle is launched to ascertain the status of the mission. upon docking with the churchill it is discovered that a massive fire has seemingly killed the crew and all data concerning the flight. but the three humanoids remain. however it is learned that an escape pod had been launched but whose whereabouts are unknown.soon they make the discovery of the alien's origin when the very attractive space vampire queen arises from her slumber to easily seduce the lifeforce from the men around her. if you suck face with her she makes you like them and if you don't feed after two hours you will dry out and become dust. the goal of the three is to drain enough of the population's essence to power and sustain them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to lay waste to them as well.thankfully the commander survives re-entry in the pod (crash lands in texas no less) and now has a psychic link to her royal hotness, the queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen as she and the surviving male attempt to bleed london dry of their souls.tobe hooper (of 'the texas chain saw massacre' (1974)) does an admirable job in what has to be his largest production to date. the production assembled many fine technicians from all over the movie industry. production designer john graysmark (fresh off 'the bounty (1984)') uses every bit of four stages at elsree studios to create the spacious interiors of the ship and such. cinematographer alan hume returns to science fiction after a stint on 'star wars vi: return of the jedi' (1983) and three consecutive james bond episodes. hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the great effects. oscar winner john dykstra innovator of the groundbreaking effects of the original 'star wars' (1977) manages to push the envelope once again a creating some highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. heck even maestro henry mancini drops in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feel. in the acting department it pretty much falls onto the shoulders of steve railsback and newcomer mathilda may (vampire queen). railsback always brings an edge to the characters he plays and can play nuts like nobody's business. that comes in hand as his mind deteriorates when the queen's grip tightens on his soul. gorgeous french actress may doesn't have a heck of a lot of lines (were there more than ten?) but her frequently nude presence never gets old and you gotta give her kudos to having the jingle bells to pull it of. pretty much all the queen is there to do is feed and to do so she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence. job accomplished and where do i sign up to be victim? i really enjoyed how they tweaked the old vampire clichés and still managed to make it seem fresh but still easily recognizable. almost everything is accounted for here: bats (their true form resembles a large bat), coffins {the stasis fields resemble these), transformations (they scan your mind and can be anything), massive sexual appeal (miss may.duh) not to mention they even include the old standby stake-through-the-heart (this time a bit of a lead dagger to the energy center slightly below the heart). the only thing they didn't touch on was religion but i think that the vampires using the cathedral at the end as home base might just be a bit of a wink and a nod.in short (yeah right 800 words later) 'lifeforce' is an excellent science fiction and horror combination that pays homage to the vampire theme while adding some neat different wrinkles. the effects and scale of the production are enough to keep summer movie types engaged (at least at the time) and horror and sci-fi fans engaged. 4 of 5.

no, "lifeforce" is not a great movie.it's not a good movie.it is, however, an average movie with some good effects and a compelling storyline (and, of course, mathilda may). it may actually be one of my favorite sf/horror flicks for the very simple reason that they try to reason their way through the science of the space vampires. how often do you see that? not even in "alien" (the sf/horror flick of all time) does science come into the story at all. in "lifeforce" they are trying to make reason of an unreasonable world.now, do i think it's successful? no. i think the movie has the issue of a massive ensemble cast that hooper is straining to keep collected and on track and that the viewers have to focus on more than one 'villian' and there are one too many road trips.to be honest, the movie is eye candy and fun to watch. but there is great potential here for a superior remake to take a hold of what hooper was trying to do and really create a strong, scary, sf/horror movie.if the remake does happen, however, i demand that mathilda may have a cameo.

lifeforce starts in outer space where the hms churchill tracks haley's comet & it's equipment detects a 150 mile long alien spaceship in the head of the comet, unable to contact earth because of interference colonel tom carlsen (steve railsback) decides this is the one & only chance to investigate it. going outside in spacesuits carlsen & some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship & find the remains of a bat like race of creatures & three perfect looking humanoids, two men (chris jagger & bill malin) & a beautiful woman (mathilda may) all of whom they take aboard the churchill. thirty days later & back on earth the churchill is detected on radar, a rescue mission is sent up only to discover the spaceship is burnt out & all the crew supposedly dead. the rescue team do find the three humanoid aliens though & take them back to earth where in a space research center in london they come back to life & start to literally suck the lifeforce out of human victims who then in turn need to do the same to stop themselves turning into dust, things look grim as the epidemic spreads throughout london...this english production was produced by the notorious menahem golan & yoram globus who during the early 80's were responsible for lots of cheap low budget action flicks under their production company cannon usually starring chuck norris & they wanted to move into the big time & signed director tobe hooper up on a three film deal (which were this lifeforce, the invaders from mars (1986) remake & the texas chainsaw massacre 2 (1986) a sequel to hooper's own classic) all of which flopped & basically bankrupt both golan & globus & cannon was no more. anyway, despite being a commercial flop at the box-office i have to say i think lifeforce is a highly enjoyable, if rather silly sci-fi horror. when originally released into theatres back in '85 lifefore was cut down to 101 minutes by golan & globus but over the past few years the longer 116 minute cut has all but replaced it on dvd, vhs, laserdisc & tv although apparently hooper's original cut of the film ran for 128 minutes so there's even more footage out there somewhere. i will be basing my comments on the longer 116 minute cut, the script by dan o'bannon, don jakoby & uncredited rewrites by michael armstrong & olaf pooley was based on the 1976 novel 'the space vampires' by colin wilson & has many extraordinary ideas, it's scope is truly ambitious & one felt that it ends up being a bit of a mess but a hell of an entertaining one. it moves along like a rocket & at heart there's a really interesting story here although the film gets itself into a tangle. there are also some hilarious moments in lifeforce, the scene when the security guard tries to convince the naked female vampire to surrender by offering her a half eaten biscuit is a true camp classic, the horribly overwrought hypnosis scenes including the one where railsback ends up kissing patrick stewart & many, many more besides. i don't know, call me weird but i just thought lifeforce was tremendous fun & highly entertaining in just about every way, from silly character's, odd dialogue, strange ideas that never quite come together & some terrific visuals lifeforce certainly isn't a film that will bore you.director hooper had just about more money here to play around with than he ever has (double what he had for poltergeist (1982) even) & he uses every bit of it to bring this spectacular film to the big screen, john dykstra the guy responsible for star wars (1977), star trek: the motion picture (1979) & more recently spider-man (2002) was brought in to handle the visual effects & generally speaking they look fabulous. the sequences set in outer space with spaceships in particular look great, there's also some really good visual effects back on earth including the destruction of london as 100's of blue souls fly around everywhere. there's some nudity but not much gore, there are some withered corpses, a few gunshot wounds, the skin on someones hand peels off, blood spurts from someones eyes, nose & ears & there's a severed arm as well as some zombies. the special make-up effects are also generally very good. i wouldn't say lifeforce is scary as such as it's more of a sci-fi film than horror, i loved the way hooper shoots the outer space sequences as he keeps rotating his camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness & that there is no 'solid' floor as it were.with a supposed budget of about $25,000,000 it made less than half that in it's theatrical run & hasn't set the world alight on video or dvd either which is a shame because although it's a bit of a mess it's very enjoyable to watch. shot on location in england. well filmed in 2:35:1 widescreen, the 4:3 cropped image is horrible & cuts huge chunks of information from both sides of the screen, this is most noticeable during the opening scenes set in outer space where sometimes it's hard to make out what's going on & the sense of the vastness of space & the alien spaceship is lost. the acting is ok in a very silly film, patrick stewart replaced sir john gielgud, nancy paul replaced olivia hussey, frank finlay replaced klaus kinski while anthony hopkins turned the role of caine down.lifeforce is a bizarre film, no two ways about it really & anyone looking for something simple & straight forward should look elsewhere. anyone looking for something a bit different in the sci-fi genre than give lifeforce a go as it's one of those so bad it's good films with some impressive effects & it isn't your average run of the mill film by any means.

i absolutely loved this film... so much emotion in such a small amount of time. i loved the beginning and how it completely throws you off guard. i love the story and the deer being brought in. i know that when i think of deer i think of innocence, and prosperity. also, in psalm 42:2 in the bible it says, "as the deer pants for the water brooks, so pants my soul for you, o god". which could even connect the last moment when the woman says it will be okay. as if she knows she's going with god. perhaps i am thinking way to much into it. but sometimes it is interesting to see what goes on through peoples' minds. thank you for sharing this masterpiece with viewers everywhere. i live in texas and i had it playing on cable... i immediately got onto the computer to find out more about this film and this amazing director! i really liked the music that was used in the background. music can sometimes make or break a film. it definitely set the mood perfectly. very nice choice!thanks again.laetitia

for a film by a first time director, this is a simply amazing little film, though i have to admit that it's a bit hard to watch and will probably offend the sensibilities of many who watch it, as the film takes a definite stand in favor of assisted suicide. however, what i loved about the film is that i had no idea this is what the film was about until the film was more than half complete and by then i was already hooked.in addition to the excellent way the subject was introduced, i was amazed at the very professional style of the film--with some of the best cinematography i've ever seen in a short film. plus, this camera work was combined so well with music and images that made the film just beautiful.as i said, this is a controversial film. i myself struggle with what i think about this debate, but the film managed to make a statement in such a literate and intelligent way, i really have to respect the team who made this film.

i was fortunate to see a screening of this remarkable short film by joshua leonard before its premiere at the 2005 sundance festival. in twelve brief but exquisite minutes, leonard takes us on a life-changing journey as he probes one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues facing our society. the film embodies elegant direction, moving performances and a heart- rending story. kelli garner and lucas haas radiate as the two lovers. and, in his first venture into dramatic narrative, leonard proves to be a director with a propitious future. i feel this short should be expanded into a feature film. it's difficult to describe talent, but as this debut film demonstrates, you know it when you see it!

this short has all the elements of a great movie. every time i show it to friends (on dvr) they love it too. the dialog is so, 'real'. the acting is superb. while the effects/props weren't as convincing by themselves, taken with everything else in the shot, they are expertly placed/used. the music is so haunting, perfect for this kind of 'moment' film. people who hold dear their beliefs and thoughts are shaken to their core about what they see in this movie. most go 'that's it?', but in the end they blossom with new understanding, and leave the movie with one word to describe it:'beautiful'. the beauty of the film is also skin deep. i love the fact that there aren't any conflicting views, no other voices, and the voices that you do hear, are agreeing with each other. no conflict, but at the same time there is one. and the ending made me love it more! harsh reality sometimes is more film worthy than any plot device, or twist. (wasn't joshua leonard the guy in blair witch project?) :) movie by a fictitious dead guy..great!

i watched this short moments ago on the sundance film festival website, and i must say it is absolutely astounding. i expected it to be entertaining - like all of the sundance shorts - but i wasn't prepared for such deep sadness and yet also a sense of passion and beauty. if you haven't yet seen any of this years entries to the festival, i suggest you go onto the site and watch these mini-masterpieces - i have seen them all, and can honestly say 'the youth in us' is the one that has touched my heart the most. i'm not the weakest audience member when it comes to romance in films, but my eyes flooded up so much i'm surprised i could still see the screen.i agree with 'addicted2you', it truly is a masterful piece of directorial work, and the cinematography will just take your breath away. i can't think of a better way to spend a spare 12 minutes.

the youth in us is a pitch-perfect gem. i saw this stunning short at this year's 2005 sundance festival. the story took me on a profoundly transforming journey. the directing by joshua leonard, the acting of kelli garner and lukas haas, the art direction, the cinematography, the score -- every element was true to the bone. one can only hope that this exquisite and excruciating film is prelude to more great work from this gifted director.just as a short film is shown before a feature at sundance, commercial movie theatres used a similar format in times past. it would be wonderful if miniature masterpieces like the youth in us could reach a wider audience this way.

wildman head counselor tripper harrison (bill murray in peak nutty form in his first lead role) presides over the various wacky hi-jinks at north star summercamp. tripper befriends sad and lonely misfit kid rudy (a nice and affecting performance by chris makepeace). director ivan reitman relates the amusingly off the wall comic vignettes at a ceaseless snappy pace and maintains an engagingly good-natured tone throughout. this film astutely nails the breezy'n'breezy essence of summer: making friends, first love, pulling pranks, competing in sports with a rival camp, campfire singalongs, and, of course, the inevitable scary urban legend about the escaped psycho killer with the hook hand. the sense of gleefully raucous fun this picture generates is positively infectious. moreover, the humor is always goofy and occasionally gross, but never too nasty or mean-spirited. best of all, there's a winning surplus of pure heart to go along with said humor (the warm relationship between tripper and rudy in particular is genuinely touching). the cast have an obvious ball playing their likable characters: murray's gloriously gonzo and galvanizing presence keeps things constantly humming (his crazy pa announcements are absolutely sidesplitting), plus there are sound contributions from harvey atkin as hapless camp owner morty, kate lynch as tripper's sassy old flame roxanne, russ banham as the amiable crockett, kristine debell as the sweet, foxy a.l., sarah torgov as the feisty candace, jack blum as klutzy bespectacled nerd spaz, keith knight as tubby slob larry finkelstein, cindy girling as the fetching wendy, and matt craven as the hip hardware. donald wilder's cinematography gives the movie an attractive sunny look and makes nifty use of wipes. elmer bernstein's lively and melodic score likewise does the trick. a real riot.

... the reason i like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has. it's a genial summer camp movie, so the jokes aren't mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of ridicule. pranks do take place, but you get the feeling that the respective fall-guys would be able to look back and laugh, having been dopey enough to fall for them - and without being too cheesy, it's actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in the end!it's an extra special bonus when the ringmaster of all these jolly japes is bill murray. for me, he's still looked upon as the comedy god without peer when he gets a chance to cut loose. no one's better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone. the tone of the entire film has the same style as its leading man, established with a great opening scene showing the murray way of getting ready for the day. everything's silly, yes, but more important than behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of good-natured fun. "meatballs" promises such and ultimately delivers a nourishing watch.

i just saw this for the first time in 10 or 15 years...maybe close to 20. in some ways, it was better than i remembered...in other, it was much worse.first of all, there's the music. it's just plain awful. there are only 5 songs in the movie, most of them used more than once. the opening song is shrieked by a chorus of annoying children, and the disco-y title track is performed by rick dees. it doesn't get any worse than that. even the background music is terrible, with much of it repeating the themes of the other nauseating tunes. we also get some truly lame slapstick, mostly in the opening credits.on the other hand, bill murray is spot on brilliant as usual...you have to wonder if he ad-libbed the whole thing, or if the writers just gave him all the funny lines. or maybe he's just that great- turning a weak script into comic genius. the best part are his surreal pa announcements. ("lobsters...get out of here...you're a menace!")you also get a lot more character development than you have any right to expect in a movie like this. at least half the characters seem like real people...and mostly real people you would like to have around. even "spaz" gets to do a more than any other eddie deezen-type character ever did, and when he gets the girl, it's plausible. (she's not absurdly hot, but he doesn't automatically pair up with one of the nerd girls- see "revenge of the nerds" for examples of both cinematic phenomenons.)and when the plot seems clichéd...well, ya gotta wonder if it wasn't a cliché yet when they made this. while it wasn't the first summer camp movie- ya gotta go back at least to "the parent trap"- it's certainly the movie that made it it's own genre. in fact, i was surprised that there was no talent show scene..."wet hot american summer" spoofed the summer-camp genre so perfectly, i just assumed everything in it came straight out of meatballs. (i also half-expected jon cryer to pull up in a convertible with a chimp, thanks to "mr. show's" epic camp-olympiad spoof "monk academy") anyway, this one seems to be vanishing a little as far as the late-70's/early 80's comedies- it's not a cable staple anymore, and certainly doesn't have the cult following of caddyshack or animal house. i was pleased to catch it on showtime today- and in high definition at that! sure, it's pretty awful in spots, but you could do a lot worse in a 70's/80's teen comedy. and again, murray is a genius.

yes, it feels, and for the most part plays like an "after school special", for a slightly more adult audience, alright maybe a teen audience. but add in bill murray (already showing some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent), a nice supporting cast, and an unexpected sweetness about growing up, and remembering those great, or not so great days at summer camp, and you get a heartwarming, funny, sleeper hit.it does get a little too smarmy for its own good, but that is also one of its charms. when you hear the title "meatballs", and see the poster, you expect a teenage sex romp, but what you get is a sentamental, yet sometimes sexy look back at those formative years at summer camp. the sentamentality, and the remberances of simpler times reminds me of "a christmas story", which i also love. the rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated. the only movie i've seen that comes close, is "indian summer", which i like almost as much as "meatballs", and also stars matt craven. let's hope he completes the trilogy. maybe he could come back for "return of the meatballs", and bring some dignity back to the franchise (meatballs 2 through 4 bare no resemblence to the original classic)."meatballs" is easily on my top 10 guilty pleasures of all time (not really guilty either). it's a wonderful little film, that always makes me smile.

camp north star and it's camp counselor extraordinaire, tripper harrison(bill murray)sure would like to end a decades long losing streak to rival camp mohawk, an ivy league type place where only the wealthy kids can attend. meanwhile, we watch as tripper tries his hand at love when he flirts aimlessly with fellow female counselor roxanne(kate lynch)as other teen counselors pair up and also fall head-over-heels. the film comes to head at the camp olympiad as the rivals square off in competitive athletic contests with tripper almost realizing their doomed to fail yet another year. the film also shows the growing bond between tripper and a quietly lonely, puppy-dog eyed rudy(chris makepeace of "vamp" fame), whose dad is often away all the time. rudy doesn't seem to fit in with the other kids his age and he seems to spend most of his time either jogging in the mornings with tripper or taking his peanuts at blackjack. the film mostly contains hi-jinx of fellow teen camp counselors cutting up and goofing around.you have hottie counselors, total nerd spaz(jack blum)with his taped glasses and bad acne, beak-nosed "hardware"(matt craven)who likes to blow things up, fat kid fink(keith knight) who is often stuffing his face, amongst others in the film. there's a basketball game where poor spaz can barely bounce the ball against rival camp mohawk much less shoot an accurate shot with poor fink tossing underhanded, between-his-knees fly-balls that sail over the back-board. there's camp fire coupling(with a spirited scary tale by tripper about a hook-handed killer)and boys drooling over the lovely ladies.yes, i know it's desperate at times trying to squeeze out every laugh it can and occasionally indulges in lapses of sentimentality(such as the scenes with a sad makepeace and murray), but just as much as this recent viewing, i found myself giggling away. i'm licked and just can't help loving this. it's a summer camp movie through and through which simply wants to entertain you. i can't explain, or reinforce enough, the overwhelming joy that floods forth when i see a sleepy murray's hand reach from the covers for the alarm clock that's piercing loudly pronouncing a summer camp movie is about to begin. his intercom jokes are especially amusing. but, the flick is, let's be honest, a series of comic vignettes with murray dead-panning endlessly..not that there's anything wrong with that. the film, though, couldn't quite survive without him, could it? hard to even think of this movie without murray in the lead. it's a happier time and i think nostalgia of that summer camp experience plays quite a hand in why we grown-ups still connect with "meatballs" warmly. and, poor morty(harvey atkin), the camp head who so badly wants things to run smooth, and to beat camp mohawk for a change, is the constant source of tripper and gang's amusement as they often play gags on him..especially when he's sleeping on his bed! great enthusiastic cast who seem to be having as much as us.

this is easily the best of the summer camp movies. in fact, few of the others are even fair, let alone anywhere near as entertaining as this one is. the film is just simply out to have some good, clean, fun. many people who went to summer camp as kids will see that it is presented here faithfully to the way it usually was, but with slapstick comedy mixed in. bill murray, as the chief counselor of the camp, tripper, leads a fine ensemble cast, and is usually at the center of the riotous nonsense. tripper has great one-liners throughout, usually broadcasting his jokes as pseudo-announcements over the camp's public-address system.several great supporting actors played the campers and counselors to build a myriad of fun and interesting subplots, all the while sprinkled amongst the many incidents of camp hi-jinx. spaz (jack blum) and fink (keith knight) were two characters particularly well done. the adventures (and misadventures) of these two are hilarious. each has classic lines, and they are characters you like and root for. look for spaz in the scene of disco dance pandemonium.the girls in the story are realistic characters, too. they're not dumb, naive, freakish, oversexed, nervy, or any of the other overused, abominable teen character stereotypes. kristine debell, kate lynch, cindy girling, and others make these characters believable. the requisite pranks abound, usually at the expense of camp director morty (harvey atkin). the nature of these pranks start at outrageous and progress from there. however, with all the silliness going on, tripper and the others have their serious sides. for example, tripper befriends a shy, lonely kid, rudy(chris makepeace), and takes him under his wing.the story culminates with a sports competition against a rival camp. it's a great "root for the underdogs" finale. when the chips are down, tripper's motivational "it just doesn't matter" spiel is inspired, and one of the best moments in the movie. and get ready to root: "spaz. spaz! spaz!!!""

seeing this movie always reminds me of what i remember summer being like, god! such a long time ago. the entire scene involving the "overnight", from the canoe procession to the end of the trip, is precious, and tripper's story about the homicidal maniac is urban legend right out of my youth. a highly entertaining movie, made many times better by the awful sequels that followed.

in the seedy streets somewhere in new york city, a lonely punk named tromeo ( will keenan) has little friends but all they ever do is get tattoos, piercing and just party all the time. he does fall for a beautiful rich girl named juliet ( jane jenson) whom is also troubled as her father is being quite an abusive son of a you know what, but as our title characters meet and fall for each other things start becoming quite magical for them. unfortunately their fathers are at each other as juliet's dad wants to take over tromeo's dad's movie studio, but could love really conquer them all and stop this feud? hilarious and gross horror comedy drama satire from the wacky and disgusting people at troma is a wonderful modern day take on william shakespeare's romeo and juliet. this was released in theaters in 1997 and got some good reviews for this is a dark humored satire of the legendary story that started it all, it's got some good laughs, piercing, graphic violence and gore such as a head being smashed on a fire hydrant. for me this is the third best troma movie next to the immortal "toxic avenger" and "troma's war" being second, yes the acting can be a little bad like some troma flicks but the stuff above makes it up for that and this is a must see movie if you like horror comedies, peter jackson, and troma or if you wanna see a comical version of a beloved story, btw also look for a couple of amusing appearances by the toxic avenger and sgt. kabukiman nypd.also recommended: "the toxic avenger", "meet the feebles", "ichi the killer", " re-animator", "terror firmer", "class of nuke'em high", "romeo and juliet ( 1968 and 1996)", " pieces", " troma's war", " citizen toxie: the toxic avenger 4", "basket case", " riki-oh: the story of ricky", " demons", "new nightmare", " freddy vs. jason", " cabin fever", "nightmare on elm street", " battle royale", " pink flamingos", " perfect blue", " rabid grannies", "surf nazis must die", " hostel", " evil dead ii", "serial mom", " dead alive ( a.k.a. braindead)", " street trash".

tromeo & juliet - 10th anniversary editionwilliam shakespeare's play romeo & juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in films. sometimes literally following the original text (which is, at times, vague in stage directions), sometimes in new interpretations where directors chose to show their own view on the piece. some are good, many are mediocre. lloyd kaufman's film certainly stands out as one of the most original, modern versions of the bard's creation, it may be placed in a modern-day decaying new york and full of the modern-day anti-social behavior, body piercing, dismemberment and kinky sex (which, for the more than casual reader, shakespeare himself wasn't shying away from), but at the same time it stays incredibly close to the overall feel and point of what the play is all about, which is quite an effort. kaufman wrote the script with his co-director on the film james gunn, who is now famous for writing two successful scooby doo movies, doing the impossible by making a perfect remake of an already perfect film with his script for dawn of the dead and directing one of the best horror-films of the year: slither. lloyd kaufmans innovative directorial view alongside with james gunns original and unrestricted writing make for an interpretation of shakespeare's play that maybe not everyone will "get" immediately, but will certainly be recognized by a truly unique and highly important view on a classic play. with a script that is written entirely in iambic meter, appearances of motorhead's lemmy and an outrageous forceful soundtrack watching tromeo & juliet is something no one will ever forget. apart from it's historical significance, tromeo & juliet is a treasure for film-lovers of all kind. not only for the script by james gunn, now a good influence on hollywood while working from the inside, but also because it features an early part of legendary actress debbie rochon. well known by everyone familiar with films that are made on lower budgets. the 10th anniversary edition on dvd adds to all that by including so many as-yet undiscovered gems that not only all the information one could wish for about the film itself and the experience of making it is presented in ways that make it impossible to turn off the dvd, but also a very honest (and disturbing) look is given into the ways independent cinema has to surviver these days. in many ways the extra's on the disc are an invaluable addition to the already impressive amount given on kaufman's film-school "make your own damn movie". furtermore historical items from the troma vaults which include james gunn, debbie rochon and all other contributors to this masterpiece are included, and the film itself is, apart from looking better then ever, accompanied by no less than four audio-commentaries, each and everyone informative, excruciatingly funny and all done for serious addition to the film instead of the boring and nonsensical commentaries that are so common these days. there are new commentaries (one with kaufman and gunn together), but also the one james gunn did for the original release of the dvd but couldn't be included there for some of honesty he displays about some other people is present on this disc. with fan-recreations of a few of the scenes from the film, a video diary of lloyd kaufman's visit to the set of james gunn's slither and a visit the two brought together to eli roth's hostel birthday party and much more, this is the ultimate set everyone must own. weather you are a film historian, someone interested in interpretations of the great bard's work, a fan of great cinema, a fighter for independent cinema, a fan of james gunn, interested in learning more on making films on a low budget, a fan of lloyd kaufman or whatever: this is the most important dvd-release of this millennium!

this outlandish troma movie is actually a very good movie. it is known as their epic and best and most highly rated production. their version of shakespeare's play is extremely funny with the usual dose of troma nudity and gore. troma has made some very good gore films, one of my favorites is "street trash" and of course the toxic avenger movies. i have one troma movie, "terror firmer", which has a reputation as their goriest and nastiest movie. i enjoyed "tromeo and juliet" so much, that i need to finally watch "terror firmer". this is a 2-disc collector's version with four commentaries and many many features. "tromeo and juliet" is an absolute hoot and highly recommended.

once upon a time, troma, the company that brought us cinema classics such as: the toxic avenger, rabid grannies, poultrygeist, redneck zombies and surf nazis must die, decided long ago to adapt shakespeare's famous play, 'romeo and juliet.' this adaptation decided to spice up the story by adding kinky sex, extreme violence, genital monsters, body piercing and incest and it succeeded in creating a bizarre yet hilarious film. anyone going into a troma production should know what to expect, and that is irreverent and perverse comedy with plenty of political incorrectness. expect plenty of nods to other troma films and plenty of re-used gags (flipping cars and head squashing). many may think it sounds like utter crap that only morons would find funny...they may be right, but at the same time they may need to lighten up and enjoy the insanity and mind-numbingness that is tromeo and juliet.with a great cast, a funny script (by james gunn and lloyd kaufman), a fitting soundtrack and plenty of great visual gags, kaufman has yet again succeeded in turning what is right upside down and grossing the hell out of everyone. get some popcorn, grab a beer, invite your friends over and enjoy tromeo and juliet for what it is, a shakespeare adaptation with plenty of balls. the end.4/5

this movie almost has everything. the action is cool, it's funny, 2 great leading men and a truly nasty villain that i really hated. not a lot of films have bad bad guys. just mainly comic book villains. he really does deserve a might ass kicking.jake scott really does have his fathers talent for knowing how to make great visuals. the direction is faultless and has an irresistible lighthearted feel. i don't usually like films set in the old days but this i liked a lot because it makes a point of boring like so many other period films are (sense and sensibility, age of innocence and the absolute worst...lady and the duke). this will restore your faith. thanx mostly to craig armstrong's amazing score. the music is both atmospheric and ethereal and in scenes of action it is very exciting.the dvd is in dolby 5.1 and has a very grainy and muddy looking 2.35:1 anamorphic picture.

plunkett and macleane is a wonderful updating of the swashbuckling tradition, predating johny depp and his pirate friends. the tone is lighthearted, with a touch of social commentary, but nothing too heavy. one could almost see errol flynn and basil rathbone in this.it starts out in low gear, with the introduction of the characters and the establishing of the themes of social inequality and rebellion; but, it kicks into high gear once the boys hit the highways. the robberies are grand and stylish, with romantic touches that are the bread and butter of swashbucklers. the actors are engaging and help elevate the material a bit, which is fairly hollow. there's not much depth to the figures, but they are played with such charm and skill that it doesn't matter.muh has been said about the modern music. period music tended to the more serene, which seems out of place. a classical score with celtic rhythms for the action pieces could work, but the more modern, rebellious rock and techno music seemed to add an edge to the action. since the characters are more legend than reality, accuracy in the music seems pointless. the pieces tend to fit the mood of the aired scenes, so it mostly works well. i just wonder how they missed adam ant's "stand and deliver." make no mistake, this is not a serious film. it's pure escapism and a wonderful lark. tony scott shows some of the visual flair of his father, but i don't think we are going to see many oscar nods in his career just yet. he seems to understand the material here and pulls off a fine film. with time he may prove to be a name to reckon with. his father took a while to mature beyond visual stylization and become a more rounded director. this is definitely one to watch for an entertaining evening or for a swashbuckling film fest.

i've seen the previews everywhere before deciding to watch it. and what do you know, i actually liked it! it has a new twist of the 18th century england. although the music in the dance scene were obviously modernized and also the colors of liv tyler's clothers (although it is pretty!), it fit quite perfectly.if you just want a good time, you should check this out. very different from other 18th century detailed films.

well, i'm not about to add to the diatribe that's been 'preached' about this film.all i can add is that at no time does it even pretend to be a 'historic' picture. unlike 'braveheart', 'titanic' or 'the patriot' all of which have very credible and serious historical amendments, purely for theatric effect (possible the worst of excuses). has everyone taken a sense of humor bypass? all i can add is a paraphrase from the good captain macleane - 'it lookedfantastic and we have a bloody good laugh'.- one last point. what astonishes me is that there are comments relating to the 'modern music' in a historic setting. i wonder if the same people made the same judgment about moulin rouge. i suggest not.

normally i hate period films. living in england is a nightmare at the moment if you have an allergy to period dramas - which i do. however this one is the best. it doesn't take itself seriously and jonny lee miller and robert carlyle are great together, liv tyler's good as well although her english accent is dodgy!!the film has everything for someone who just wants to go the cinema to enjoy themselves. it has action, adventure, drama and comedy. i'm not sure how well the jokes will translate across the ocean but hopefully they will. it would be a shame for american audiences to miss out on this film. it shows that english film-makers can produce something that doesn't involve constant swearing and sex. both do feature in this but in a balanced format. iain robertson's camp portrayal of the well to do gentleman is brilliant and the two brothers who are also part of the upper class set are hilarious!as the trailer for 'the spy who shagged me' is pupported to say...."if you see one other film"....this spring make it plunkett and macleane. it's got fun, action lurve and of course, jonny lee miller with an english accent for a change!

if you liked lock, stock and two smoking barrels, the chances are you'll like this, too. although i guess a few of the british in-jokes (like calling two london characters dixon and winterburn, after arsenal soccer players) may be lost on some, this is still cracking entertainment, which veritably pumps with vitality.carlyle, miller and tyler are all excellent, bringing depth to their characters, and the interplay between the two protagonists is always well-judged. in fact scott's direction is very assured, considering that this is his first feature film, and proves that he has his father's talent for putting us at ease in unfamiliar surroundings.hell, i've convinced myself. i'm gonna see it again!

this movie, without doubt is the best i have seen, and really shows what british talent can do. it's effects are exceedingly good considering the movie is set in the mid 18th century, and all the grittiness and disgusting filth of england at the time, is captured very well. the character's are developed and fleshed out, from macleane's whoring antics to his development into highwayman and exhibitionary 'the gentleman highwayman' contrast well with robert carlyle, who's cynicism and honour show that you can love a thief and a criminal cos i quote: 'he's got more honour in his little finger, than any of you fat bastards!'not referring to you of course! but it has arguably the most stirring and emotionally charged scene ever witnessed in a movie, but you'll just have to see it to find out, suffice to say that it involves rope round your neck.

a very watchable film, and one which was eagerly awaited having seen the trailer a number of times.the whole thing looks superb, from the ludicrous efforts of the effete upper class to distance themselves from the mediocrity, to the lower class scum just trying to keep their heads above the filth, the film captures the spirit of the 18th century brilliantly.jonny lee miller plays maclean extremely well, though the part does not exactly stretch him, and robert carlyle seems a little wasted on plunkett, miller's highwayman colleague.the real star of the show was undoubtedly ken stott, who plays mr chance (a kind of 1740's chief of police) with an evil glee that set him out from the rest of the cast.a great film, and anyone that enjoys the colour and style of peter greenaway's films will love the look of this, although the thinness of the plot becomes apparent before the 2 hours are up.well worth a viewing.

.. is the princess bride meets... well trainspotting. but wait, really, it's a good combination! this was definitely one of the better movies i've seen in a long time... it has the kind of witty dialog i associate with the princess bride or cemetery man, along with the disgusting scenes of violence of a horror movie... the heroic feel of princess bride combined with the (this is odd) lack of any really good guys that trainspotting had.i'm not saying it was as good as the princess bride, but it was in the arena, and it rocked. some of the dialog transcends pleasing to brilliant, the plot is interesting, the characters - while slightly anacronistic - are anacronistic not due to their intrinsic nature (there were flamboyantly gay people in the 18th century, contrary to a previous reviewer's remarks) but just in a bit of the language they used. the anachronisms made it fun, though, and not cheesy and easily dismissed.if you've ever read any simon r. green, or gleen cook's garrett series, you know exactly what this movie is. check it out. it's great.

i'm amazed that i have a real affection for this one inasmuch as i'm not an action and adventure lover. but hey... it's pretty tough to go wrong with a robert carlyle film. i've read several poor or temperate reviews on this film, pulling it apart for it's period errors or unlikely plot development, but no one seems to mention the rather intriguing character transition which features how a hardened, down-on-his-luck scoundrel (carlyle) transforms into a rather noble, selfless hero and how the pretty-boy, cowardly vagrant (miller)develops a real taste for the life of a highway man once he "gets the feel of it." filled with lots of bad-boy humor, lavish scenes (particularly the use of "fireworks" by former apothacary plunkett) and a charmingly ecclectic musical score, plunkett & macleane is a fast-paced,highly enjoyable piece of film making. it's certainly worth your viewing time for the climax scene alone! shoot 'em up, boys!

i've been waiting since last october to see this film! (it was supposed to come out october '98) and now i've finally seen it i am not disappointed. bloody marvellous! ok it was a tad slow in the beginning, but once it got going it's a very exciting nail-biting tense robert carlyle is so different from either gaz in 'the full monty' and begbie in 'trainspotting' ) that it's hard to recognise him! and johnny lee miller, no longer with his sick boy from 'trainspotting' blond hair, plays his dashing gentlemen highway man with the right about of humour and sensitivity that it is easy to see why liv tylers rebecca falls for him. a great film. as hades in disney's 'hercules' would say: "two thumbs way way up!!"

when i sat down in the cinema to see this i was expecting to see a sort of stylish tongue-in-cheek action film, which had been implied by the trailers. however, it very quickly became apparent that this film was trying to be more.normally, i don't approve of films that try to entertain in as many ways possible. for instance, this film tries to mix action with comedy, romance, lightheartedness and gritty seriousness all at once. most of the time this sort of approach doesn't work in films (just look at batman forever) but i was was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case, they pulled it off.the end result is a highly entertaining film that should appeal to most mature cinemagoers. (however, the weak of stomach should really be warned of one or two scenes.) robert carlyle and jonny lee miller pull of a brilliant double act and ken stott does a excellent villain. this mixed in with superb costumes and a few decent action scenes makes for a very enjoyable watch.however, the big let-down here for me is that in having 'the gentleman highwayman' there was a real opportunity for some good dialogue but the script was definitely lacking in punchiness and there were few belly laughs. okay, so the lines weren't terrible but to me it does highlight a problem with recent british films; ignoring a few notable exceptions the screenplays being written today are still relatively mediocre when compared to some of hollywood's efforts.

... because while i thoroughly enjoyed this film, it seems from other user comments that i'm in the minority. maybe not one for the philosopher (eek), there are some wonderful scenes here (- particularly the techno), and the great life adventure story originally portrayed. go see for yourself!

i really loved this movie. i thought it was very well done. the character interaction was wonderfully done as was the characterization. the actors were definitely believable. the plot was very deep and intriguing. even though parts of it are a bit slow and sometimes a bit boring, it's definitely worth watching several times. the chemistry between the three main actors was great. if you don't want to watch it for that, then at least watch it for the drama between the characters. i mean, the whole thing was just "whoa!" it was like i couldn't look away. the whole movie grabbed my attention and kept my interest, even through the slow parts. i loved this movie and almost everything about it. i loved the ending because it was so interesting and, if you watch the movie a second time, makes perfect sense. but i'm not spoiling anything.

rickman is sexy and good, but the "stranger" is less convincing - reedus is sort of sexy, but he is not a consistent actor - this could be the director's fault in this case - we are supposed to find him alluring in the extreme just because he is "pretty" - but that's not enough. the thwarted wife is almost convincing - 7 years marriage and she and rickman's character should be more settled with each other, whether their roles are to be incompatible or not - they must have patterns by now. i get that, although i think the wife is a bit stiff in her role - and not convincingly attracted to the "stranger" - so that's a failing - the unspoken bonding between the rickman character and the "stranger" is better done, even if we are not sure what it is. i miss rickman's sexy english accent (luckily he slips into it and out of the american pattern). disappointing but with some great acting.

a few things to touch on as a response to the earlier person's comment. you just have to pay attention to what is going on in the film.(i guess they are spoilers)the red stuff under david's mouth? poison ivy, the wife says not to scratch it or else "it will spread".david goes "insane" because the stranger is telling him to get out of the house, which probably proves david's theory of an affair happening between the wife and stranger; he runs after the man. david does not lose him in the woods, he simply hits the stranger a couple of times and leaves it to his wife to pick up the pieces.only the wife eats the mushroom. i must say, after that one point with the wife and stranger, i began to feel disappointed. but the ending made up for the entire film.and for that and the very last scene... this is one of my favorite movies ever. i should have put it together earlier, but let myself get sidetracked. i was really surprised, honestly.this film is interesting, to say the least. but if you are not watching this for the performances that the actors give, i'd say you better let this one go, because that is all that keeps this certain film together.

if the ending hadn't been so fantastically unexpected, i don't think i could rate this movie so well.this movie has a lot of uncomfortable, distressing, "marriage falling apart" character interaction. that sort of thing is not my kind of drama, so the pace seemed to drag for me.in addition, the main characters are difficult to relate to and thus care much about -- the husband (alan rickman) is rather bitter and cranky and the wife (polly walker) is aloof and a little haughty. the acting was just fine (norman reedus was very alluring), but the characters themselves were perhaps a little too realistically flawed (for me).the setting was nice and appropriately isolated and a little spooky. the cinematography had something to it that seemed a little old-fashioned to me somehow.but the last 5-15 minutes of this movie are so ingenious that every uncomfortable scene, awkward conversation, and inexplicable character behavior absolutely worth it. i guessed every typical plot twist except the one that occurred.the ending definitely makes this movie worth watching. the intrigue and the drama, not quite as much.

dark harbor is a moody little excursion into murky emotional waters that run extremely deep. it's basically a 3-character piece, featuring a finely-layered performance by the always-great rickman, with polly walker and norman reedus (also excellent) forming the other two sides of this strange triangle. a perfect late-night cable film, with a surprise ending to boot.

i saw dark harbor at the '98 seattle film festival. filmed against a autumnal maine backdrop, this movie boasts an excellent cast and a plot that keeps you guessing throughout. at times eerie, at times funny, i have to say that it stayed with me for days after seeing it. rickman and walker are wonderful as the icy marrieds and reedus is someone you'll be hearing more from, i'm sure. the opening shot of a winding, deserted road in a downpour at dusk (and the score that accompanied it) set the tone so well -- just terrific. nice, nice work from a new-ish director/screenwriter and his talented crew.

yes i am a ff7 fan, but how many people who watch this movie are not going to be? and so, i'm reviewing this movie from a ff7 fan perspective, and with no regret. (i would not know how to adequately review the movie for someone who has not played the ff7 game.)visuals - 10/10 i loved advent children. it's a sensory delight - a complete audio-video overload. the visuals were breathtaking: some feats were accomplished that i would simply have not quite thought possible with an animated feature. when the action scenes came about, they were, for lack of a more accurate word, a roller-coaster. with dramatic camera movement sweeping across from range to range, to seamlessly integrated bullet-time effects at the crucial moments, to the sheer level of detail - it's all hard to fault. the animation looks big budget, the style and imagery is awesome, and the effects at times made me forget that i was watching animation rather than live action footage. i could ramble on for hours repeating myself on the fantastic quality of the visuals, but it simply wouldn't do it any justice.sound - 10/10 the sound was fabulous. the voices for all the characters didn't disappoint (no one sounded silly) and the sound effects were bold and sharp. the music - from the game that (in my opinion) had the best game soundtrack ever, transfered beautifully to the movie. most of the memorable themes from the game are present in the movie, albeit often using different instruments to fit in better with what's going on. there was some bolder rock and slight thrash metal music over the really intense action scenes from time to time, but it all fitted in well with the movie's situation at the corresponding time.story - 7/10 the story and characters would be the main flaws of the movie. both aspects were simply not up to par with the game - but then again, the game could spend 40+ hours developing these points - the movie only has about 90 minutes. as far as the story goes, the plot wasn't bad or anything, but just not as ambitious as was expected from someone who played the game through. in effect, the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. the game was so extravagant with the intricate plot twists and story progression/development, that the movie never really stood a chance to compete in the same league. instead, the movie took the more sensible approach - to expand on the action and try to place as many inside-jokes and themes into itself instead of trying to impossibly recreate the massive story factor, which was originally such a driving force in the game. the lack of materia usage also caused me some controversy - the story of the movie chose to use little (though not zero) materia, and instead lots of supernatural fighting ability and skill. i would hope that if a sequel was made it would incorporate materia much much more extravagantly and importantly into the film. there were also many plot holes in the movie - all which can be forgiven if you think of advent children as a random anime, but seem ridiculous when you realise how it was based on a game that executed plot tremendously well.characters - 7/10 the characters, whilst all being present in one form or another, don't necessarily shine to their true potential. there simply isn't really enough movie-time to spend with all of them. and so, all of their background stories and abilities are not entirely showcased, and in some cases, barely at all (red and cait sith leave absolutely no real lasting impressions). even cloud, who is the focal point of the movie, i feel doesn't use enough of his familiar abilities from the game. the materia issue is a strong reason for this. with that said, it's a joy to see the cast back in action, even if it's in such a role that doesn't utilise them to their fullest. the new characters were the ones that caused me most of the strife however - the bad guy trio and the kid dude denzel - there was a huge lack of explanation about any of them. anyone willing to use their imagination can probably fill in the blanks with something reasonable and be done with it, but objectively speaking the issue is still there to be commented on and is therefore a little disappointing.value - 10/10 the replay value for this movie is excellent - i personally want to watch it again in a more bigger and louder way - bigger screen, louder volume.enjoyment - 10/10 whatever the flaws of the movie, they simply weren't big enough to hinder my enjoyment of it, and i honestly think that will be the same case for most people. i enjoyed advent children tremendously, and encourage fellow ff7 fans to go see it.

now after watching the advent children twice, the storyline isn't as shallow as majority has criticized it to be in my opinion. if you haven't played ffvii or disliked it for whatever reason, this movie is most likely not for you. being familiar to the original story is a prerequisite to understanding ac fully, otherwise you will just see the greatest cg animation in your life so far.without actually spoiling the storyline, i must admit that after seeing ac we have been putting pieces together with my friends relying on our knowledge of ffvii. seeing it second time allowed to actually pay attention to the story more and most of the questions we may have had were answered. some were not. ac is clearly for ffvii players/fans and doesn't honestly try to be anything else. there is little to none realism in it outside ffvii world which serves the purpose. music is mostly reconstructed ffvii themes with a heavier touch (tbm team according to end credits) and works well with the eye candy without exceptions. i found the music enhancing the experience added to the visual fireworks in all situations.we all know you can't put a ffvii in 1.5 hours and keeping that in mind the storyline actually offered more to me than i expected. there are two issues at hand in ffvii : ac and both stories were wrapped up very smoothly between the action sequences. and trust me when i say there's a lot of it. action that is.i'm changing my vote from 9 to 10 after watching it the second time because i had missed a few explanatory sequences i couldn't put together the first time that provided some answers. as a warning, it's going to be easy to disregard the story and concentrate on graphics, but try not to judge the adevent children because of that. if you don't let the story in, it's no wonder it seems sloppy.i'm not going to praise the graphics because i assume we all know they are awesome, which might be an understatement. especially characters talk so much more with their facial expressions than ever before. i hope you pay attention to the storyline for it actually makes sense and works well with the whole. get ready for the ride of your life, there are no breaks.

i do not have much to say than this is a great finish to the story. most people have said that there is not enough plot and its just eye candy.but think about it, everything was explained in ffvii you cannot add more plot to such a grand story it would ruin it. they did the best that they could do and i think that this should be taken more as a final fmv.. the last fight. graphics - 10/10, absolutely amazing story 8.5/10 - don't think they could of expanded it that much more. and the stuff they could put in there was clever enough i thought. characters 9/10 - well most of them have already been explained during the game but still could not fit it all into 90 mins. sound - 10/10, since i am a metal fan i loved the fight music.. and piano just reaches right in there..it is a great st and i was not disappointed.tilt/replay 10/10 - enjoyable every time. overall- 9/10 (ff fan view 10/10)i personally think this is what was needed, a fight to end it all.. the plot was already in place. the action was necessary as much as people complained. i loved every second of this movie. it was a pleasure to visit the world of ffvii just one last time.just remember this.. most movies that have been made form a game have been directed by movie directors i think this is pretty great for a team of game directors.. don't think i've seen a better game to movie..thankyou square, i think you did it right!

i was surprised by how emotionally invested i became in this film. peter boyle is a tour de force as the working class socially conservative bigot, joe. i actually sympathized with some of his complaints. of course he doesn't mention the underlying historical socio-economic reasons for many of his prejudices. the film also provides interesting insight into the rapid change american society was undergoing at this time. recreational drugs, casual sex, and the challenging of parental authority became in vogue and replaced the more time honored traditions of respect for god, country and seniority. susan sarandon fans will be delighted. joe is her film debut. she also provides viewers with a visual treat near the beginning of the film. recommended, 8/10.

"joe" is one of those movies where, although you think that it might go along smoothly, ends up hitting you like...i can't come up with an analogy. it showed not only that america's long-standing idea of unity was moot, but also the various aspects within our society. melissa compton (susan sarandon) is the ultimate flower child, while her father bill (dennis patrick) is a clean-cut executive. one day, bill accidentally kills melissa's boyfriend. in the immediate aftermath, bill gets acquainted with joe curran (peter boyle), an ultra-right-wing, rabidly racist working stiff. as a result, the two of them end up associating more and more with the hippies, whom bill finds unpleasant and joe outright hates. but in the end, everything has dead serious consequences.true, some parts of the movie are a little bit dated, but it's a good juxtaposition of america's two sides during the vietnam war. and rest assured, the residual effects of all that will probably never go away.

wealthy businessman bill compton (played by dennis patrick) accidentally kills his daughter's hippie boyfriend after an argument. panic-stricken, he retreats to a bar, and meets joe curran (played by peter boyle): a loud-mouth, angry, bigot who is bitter over how his beloved country has become. unintentionally, bill allows joe to find out that he just killed a hippie. and this is only the beginning. "joe" is a classic film of an unlikely friendship. a bond between two men, one of a white-collar background, the other of a blue-collar background. bill & joe have one thing in common, they are disgraced over how crazy the world has become. dennis patrick & peter boyle have both given very realistic portrayals of their characters. director john g. avidsen with this "pre-rocky" effort, directs this low-budget gem with the same finesse as a movie with a $100 million budget. the script is loaded with excellent character development and very snappy, realistic dialog. in spite of its strengths this film does have its weaknesses. the script falls asleep roughly 3/4 of the way through, but it wakes up just in time for the jarring climax. this film also features a very early and uninspiring performance by a 24-year old susan sarandon as bill's daughter melissa, along with her hippie boyfriend frank, portrayed very blandly by patrick mc dermott. one could only be thankful that he was killed off early in the film. in spite of its few flaws this is one of those forgotten films of the 70's that should not be. even though "joe" is very dated to today's standards, the chemistry between dennis patrick & peter boyle is completely relevant today, and it is the glue that holds the whole film together.

caution-possible spoilers ahead.. just watched 'joe' for the second time. the first time was 30+ years ago on an air force base. i was reminded of that by the air force overcoat with tech. sgt. stripes wore by the boyfriend/dealer; we airmen had quite a laugh the first time that appeared on the screen because that is a 'lifer' rank. over the years i have carried several other images from the film. foremost was the absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive. as someone else commented, you could not take you eyes off her. i did not realize until now that this was a 20-year old susan sarandon in her first movie. what a loss that she did not do more movies when she looked like that. i also recall the irony of having a counterculture hero like peter boyle playing the title role of a right-wing gun nut. not unlike george c. scott playing generals in dr. strangelove and patton. and of course the shocking ending made a lasting impression.30+ years ago it was the most talked about movie that ever played on the base. we thought it was a great film then and i have been reluctant to see it again because i was afraid that it would be as disappointingly dated as easy rider. but watching it today i was amazed at how well the film has held up. it is a very strong script with few holes although you have to wonder about the boyfriend immediately getting out of the bathtub when sarandon gets in with him.searching for an explanation of why this film is still so entertaining i have to think it has something to do with the perfect physical casting. boyle was physically believable as joe (as others have pointed out his portrayal would inspire the archie bunker character a few 'years later). did ted knight model his 'caddyshack' character-judge smails after the dennis patrick's advertising executive in 'joe'? they look alike and sound alike. patrick was totally believable as the wrapped-too-tight upper middle class executive. and sarandon's doe-eyed innocent with the raggety ann doll still evokes a protective response from all male viewers-perfect casting. the nude and drug scenes actually hold up (they were very provocative for their day) and are as explicit as anything to be found in 'thirteen'. about the only thing that dates this film is that the violence is not realistic or graphic. 'joe' was about the same time as 'the wild bunch', and the tone of movie violence had a just begun to change. another reason this film holds up is that events in the past couple of years have brought back the relevancy of the theme and context of this film. in the film both types of 'conservatives' are portrayed as full of fear and hate toward the unconventional ways of the counterculture; and filled with envy at their free and hedonistic lifestyle. the counterculture is portrayed as mocking the straight culture; and although paranoid toward conservatives (legitimately so given that this was just a couple months after kent state) they cannot resist flaunting their lifestyle in an attempt to antagonize. the political landscape is not all that different 30+ years later. i'm not sure conservatives envy young people and liberals as much as 1970, but they fear and hate them more.an excellent film that surprisingly is as relevant now as it was in the early 1970's.

there is a version of "nevsky" that is shown with a live symphony orchestra, chorus, soloist and the movie. if it's ever performed within a day's travel of you see "nevsky" done that way. the oklahoma city philharmonic did it with the okc canterbury choir (one of the finest anywhere) a couple of years ago. i think i cried through the whole thing, it was one of the most emotionally powerful movie experiences of my life. i'm listening to "nevsky" on the radio right now and it still tears me up. there are movies that i love, and classical music pieces i love, but there is no combination i can think of that comes close to the impact of "nevsky" performed in real time.

alexander nevsky is a series of superb sequences of cinematic opera that pass from pastoral to lamentation and end in a triumphal cantata. the story takes place in 1242. prince alexander nevsky (nikolai cherkasov) defeats the teutonic knights in a battle on the ice of lake peipus.the film is a splendid historical pageant which shows director sergei eisenstein at his most inventively pictorial, and climaxes in a superb battle sequence using music instead of natural sounds. several films have scenes strongly influenced by the battle of lake peipus, including doctor zhivago (1965), mulan (1998), and king arthur (2004). alexander nevsky was kept out of circulation due to changing political winds, and then enshrined as perhaps the most influential soviet-made historical film.

i saw this film with a live performance by the buffalo philharmonic, and the music was one of the two things that definitely made the experience for me; particularly, the song after the battle where the woman is looking for her husband was just devastating. the other thing that stood out to me is the battle on the ice itself, a bit of strategy ripped off thoroughly by the makers of _king arthur_ in 2004. also, the battle goes on forever (half an hour?)-- painfully long. i can't think of another propaganda film that makes war look less glamorous or rewarding. i'm surprised stalin liked this film so well; i wouldn't want to go out and fight after watching it.

out of all the bat-films, batman returns is my favorite. this beautiful, dark, and funny film is one of tim burton's best work. although it is much violent and darker, this is the batman that creator bob kane envisioned many years ago. michael keaton reprises his role as the avenger of gotham city. this time he's up against two deadly foes, danny devito's penguin and michelle pfeiffer's catwoman. with a great cast and film score by danny elfman, the movie takes us on an adventure as batman battles the evil forces that are trying to take over gotham city. christopher walken makes a great appearance as max shrek, a shrewd businessman who has an evil scheme up his sleeve. but of course, michelle pfeiffer is the one that steals the show. with all of these components, you have a film that will blow you away. this is the reason why you go to the movies. it's got everything. it's really a shame that tim burton didn't get to direct the other sequels. if so i think the franchise would still be going strong today. batman returns is an awesome experience for fans that like cool movies.

i like full house and step by step the same. i don't have a favorite episode i just like certain scenes. but some scenes i don't like but i haft to say the reason i started watching this show is because it had suzanne summers in it. and my most favorite character was dana. and karen could be a snob sometimes, but she was good character also. i just like to watch family shows instead of trash that has a lot of drugs and violence. this show is a lot like other family shows where one of the parents are always strict about curfews and dates. other than step by step, my other favorite shows are full house, sabrina the teenage witch, gomer pyle usmc, the andy griffith show, and dukes of hazzard.

leaving aside the drawbacks and deficiencies of the film mentioned by other viewers i must say that it seemed to me a film about power,which is in my opinion one of the most luring illusions. i saw the drama of an emperor and people. it seems to me that the director wanted to pose a question of what the benefit of nation is and what the price of "happiness" for all is. is there justification for the enforced benefit and "happiness"? how much can be forfeited for the nation's security and peaceful existence? is the idea of a powerful would-be empire worth reducing to misery and killing thousands of its citizens now? it seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and seeks to learn it all the time the film runs. he is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically harassed by the discovery of his true origin. he seems to half hate his subjects for having to renounce his father and his love, half love the people as a good emperor should. no wonder his actions are controversial and emotions confused. it seems to me that as another film presenting the problem of power of man over other men the film is a success.

i enjoyed the film very much, especially the performance of the exceptionally beautiful gong li as the concubine.it was a little distracting, however, to have chinese dialogue plus english subtitles plus american-accented voice-over, even though the voice over was very well synchronised.qin shi huiang di's (the first emperor of qin's)family name was zheng, and his given name yiong so in the english he should have been referred to as "king zheng" or "emperor zheng", and not as "king ying zheng" as in those days the two family/given names were not used together.the state of qin is pronounced "chin" not "shin" - a pity the researchers didn't get this right.i forgave this but was dismayed at the end when the commentary announced that he was buried at "zai-an" together with his terra cotta warriors. the town xi'an is pronounced "see-an" , never "zai-an"- surely the american voice-over speakers could have got that right !

this movie is beautiful in many ways: the plot, the depth of the characters, the stunning photography and acting, the kolossal-like scenes of battles (no computer graphics here, just thousands of people). someone said the story has something to do with the sheakespearian tragedies. i find some connections with the greek tragedy tradition, too.the emperor, extraordinarily acted, struggles between power and love, but he is forced (for the greater good, for the will of his ancestors) to choose the power (and the loneliness, the hate of his subjects and kins) as his destiny. he, like creon in antigone, was a good guy before becoming emperor. once gained power, he has to be merciless and cruel (with innocent children, his mother, his father, etc.) to defend and expand the empire. entrapped by power he becomes a monster. overall, the qin emperor is a majestic greek tragedy figure.the assassin evolves towards a different direction: from pure evil to heroism and morality. even this character is forced towards his destiny by love and by his new ethics. this character is really unforgettable, too.lady zhao, a wonderful gong li, is the uncorrupted morality, nor by power or love or hate. she is morality against power, somehow like antigone. her conspiracies (for and against the emperor) have always a moral rationale.in conclusion, a wonderful movie. if you love cinema and you want to try chinese movies you can start here.

chen kaige lost his sense of tempo. i envy europeans and americans who can watch the film without following the dialog with their ears, because it is painful to do: slow, unnaturally heavy, and over-deliberate. but westerners, on the other hand, suffer from the poor quality of subtitle translation, which manages to lose all the subtlety and double meanings that make a careful study of the film so much fun.

based on the actual event , this epic, is set in the year 221 b.c and tells the true story of the unification of china. action packed and filled with intrigue, passion, betrayals and unforgettable battle sequences, it held my attention throughout in spite of its 160 minute length.the king, ying zeng, played by li xuejian is obsessed with unifying the seven kingdoms of china and becoming its first emperor. his lover, lady zhao, played by the beautiful actress gong li, devises a plot whereby she will travel to the neighboring kingdom of yan to set a fake assassination plot in motion which will give the king an excuse to invade yan. however, she falls in love with the assassin as the king becomes more and more ruthless.there are subplots, and tragedy and constant high drama. there are scenes of great beauty and of abject cruelty. there is great cinematography and brilliant use of physical space.the deep characterization made me think of shakespeare. and tragic events that call to mind greek drama. and yet it is totally chinese as it deals with age-old questions of whether the ends justify the means. and raises the questions dealing with life and death and good and evil and all the blurred edges in between.it is the story of individuals against the backdrop of history, a history that has shaped china for the past two thousand years. i was swept up in the story as well as the moral questions raised. there are no easy answers and this was one of the strengths of the movie.recommended. but be prepared for the violence and gore.

this 3 hour epic (seems much shorter) explores the will to power and conquest and the conflicting motives that underlie that quest by tracking two parallel lives: the emperor q'in, whose desire to unify the chinese feudal states has its basis in noble aims but devolves into violent oppression,isolation, and ultimate powerlessness; and the assassin jing ke, a mercenary killer who comes to recognize the unintended consequences of murder and finds a form of salvation. as with all great art, this can be understood on many levels. the movie evoked for me images and ideas from homer, euripides, machiavelli, shakespeare, and freud.the story itself is true (i checked it out at britannica.com!), so this film will appeal to history buffs. it's ironic that q'in spent much of his last years in a futile quest for immortality (not shown on the screen, but consistent with the plot).the movie can also be viewed as an allegory of maoism and the cultural revolution. through the movie, one can understand that the last 50 years of chinese history have had their precedent in the last 3000.fortunately for the audience, these complex ideas are developed in a film that is rich in imagery, action, and pagent. the battle scenes alone are worth the price of admission.

may contain spoilersthis historical movie was so refreshing. although it may be exagerating the actual events, it does show the heartless nature of emperor qui, which he was later infamous for. and there wasn't a single computer generated person in it. i think it's great that china has produce such an epic film. the costumes and the settings were beautiful, the performances were also excellent. dignity vs. death is a major theme in this movie and i think it reflects the chinese history and culture. i also enjoyed a little allusion to the terracotta warriors, a 3d map carved of the conquest of china with individual soldiers. emperor qui of course later as entombed with his life size terracotta warriors.i also enjoyed the scene with the dwarf, he was a very interesting character, even if he only had a small scene.9/10

ray is one of those movies that makes you pause. you actually think about what you heard or think about what you read about this man and it doesn't even come close. during my first viewing of ray i forgot i was watching a movie i felt like a peeping tom watching this man's life thru a window. this movie is so compelling it drags you in and it involves your every emotion you go thru a emotional roller-coaster ride and when it's over you don't want to do it again so soon because it has that kind of emotional punch that other movies are lacking. jamie foxx deserved his oscar and quite rightfully so his performance is spectacular and it should be held up as the standard for anybody wanting to do a bio pic anytime soon. this movie is as good as it's subject both deserved the titles classic and legend.

a masterful performance by jamie foxx is just one of the highlights of "ray," a 2004 film also starring kerry washington, regina king, curtis armstrong, richard schiff, sharon warren, patrick bachau, and many others, all giving excellent support to the film.the film has several main focuses: the first is charles' childhood - the drowning of his brother george which haunted him for years, the glaucoma that blinded him, and the strength taught him by his mother - don't bend, don't break, don't ever be a cripple. she eventually sends him to a special school where charles' gift of music is discovered. the next focus is charles' artistic evolution as a nat king cole-like singer, to his arrangements of gospel music, his foray into country music, and the unique sound that became ray charles. the third focus is charles' personal life - his marriage to bea, his many affairs, his heroin addiction and eventual rehabilitation.because charles lived a packed 74 years, there's a lot skipped. though charles was orphaned while in his teens, the death of his beloved mother, his rock, isn't in the film. while he is shown on the chitlin circuit and refusing to play in segregated clubs, his near-starvation as a musician isn't covered. at one point, he found a jar of jelly and attempted to eat it, but the jar broke. he was that down and out. bea is shown with him when the state of georgia, which banned him, adopts "georgia on my mind" as their theme song in 1979 and welcomes charles back to his native state, yet he and bea were divorced in 1977 which isn't mentioned. she probably was there, however. also, she wasn't his only wife - he was married once before he met her; that marriage isn't covered. in the movie, we're told of one illegitimate child - there were 12. it would have been impossible to get all of that and more into a film.what isn't skipped is his glorious music, which seems to go on constantly throughout the film, continually reinforcing his genius and artistry.charles' story is compelling and holds the audience's interest throughout. those who scoff at it as a made-for-tv movie don't give it the credit it deserves. taylor hackford's direction gives "ray" a good pace, and the movie has a lot of atmosphere and evokes the various decades beautifully.as ray, jamie foxx inhabits the character and makes one forget he's a comedian playing a part. foxx wore prosthetics, did his own piano playing, and spent a great deal of time with charles preparing for the role. he nails him, but it's not an impersonation - he's a flesh and blood man with hallucinations of standing in water and finding his brother's body; a man full of denial about his addiction, hating the word junkie and believing he's not hooked; and he's in denial about his home life, thinking that his wife doesn't know about his various affairs and illegitimate children (in the movie, child); and a man taken terrible advantage of early in his career because of his blindness who refuses to be walked on later on. he demands to be paid in $1 bills so they can be counted; when he discovers he's a gravy train for a club owner and her partner and was nearly cheated out of a record deal, he makes his own deal and leaves his job.one doesn't so much marvel at foxx's performance as accept him as ray from the first time he appears on camera.this is an excellent biography, which, like "walk the line" is punctuated with the fantastic music of the artist. whether or not you're a ray charles fan, "ray" is something to experience.

i agree that this film was spectacular. the way in which jamie foxx captured, not only the impression of ray charles, but the essence of ray charles really made the film. his life made a great story and it is good that it is finally being told. i also found a great interview with jamie foxx about this role by ernie manouse from innerviews on kuht, houston channel 8. the link is http: //video.google.com/ videoplay?docid=-3001837218936089620&q =innerviews+ jamie+foxx&hl=en . i encourage everyone to check it out, as it gives in depth looks into what went into his role and his personal feelings about ray charles. the only problem i might cite with the film is that the shotting style was rather bland at times, but in the end i think it helped make the story more realistic and keep the focus on the person, ray charles, rather than the film ray.

recent years have seen a number of biopics of famous singers, and "ray", the story of ray charles, has much in common with "walk the line" which was made the following year and told the story of johnny cash. cash and charles were near-exact contemporaries, both being born in the early thirties and dying in 2003/04. both grew up in poverty in the american deep south. both lost a brother in an accident during childhood. both achieved success in the 1950s. both experienced problems in their marriages, and both were addicted to drugs. all these matters are emphasised in both films. there are also similarities with ron howard's "a beautiful mind". although that film was about a mathematician rather than a musician, it, like both "ray" and "walk the line", stressed the part played by its subject's wife in helping her husband to overcome his problems.ray charles was born to a single mother in a poor black community in georgia in 1930. (his original name was raymond charles robinson, but when he was starting his career as a musician he dropped his surname to avoid confusion with the boxer sugar ray robinson). in some ways charles had an even harder time than did cash, having to cope with two additional disadvantages in the shape of his blindness and of the racism which affected all black americans, especially in the south, during his lifetime. charles had a particularly traumatic childhood, witnessing the death of his younger brother george in a drowning accident and going blind about a year or two later. he appears to have been haunted by nightmares and feelings of guilt over george's death throughout his life.the first half of the film is rather slow moving and is a standard rags-to-riches showbiz biopic, telling the story of how the young charles is taught to play the piano, becomes a nightclub performer and then rises to fame as a major artist, falling in love along the way with the beautiful della bea. the best scenes in this part of the film are the flashbacks to charles's childhood. there is an effective recurrent image of coloured glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of his house; perhaps this was one of his few visual memories of his life before he went blind. there is also a memorable scene in which the teenaged charles shames a prejudiced bus driver into letting him on the bus by pretending to have lost his sight on omaha beach (in reality he would only have been thirteen at the time of the normandy landings).the second half of the film becomes more interesting as it moves into more controversial territory, focusing on charles's drug addiction, the problems in his marriage caused by his affair with margie hendricks, one of his backing singers, and his battles against racism. in the early sixties charles caused a sensation by refusing to play in front of a racially segregated audience in georgia (although, contrary to what is stated in the film, this did not result in his being banned from performing in the state). he also fought against racial divides within the music industry itself, performing not only traditionally "black" styles of music such as gospel and rhythm and blues, but also traditionally "white" ones such as country and western (regarded by many black americans as the music of choice of the redneck community).as peter bradshaw, film critic of "the guardian", noted "ray" is a sunny film which diplomatically turns away from the darker side of things. it omits any mention of such matters as the death of charles's beloved mother aretha during his teenage years, his brief marriage to eileen williams in the early fifties and his eventual divorce from della bea in 1977. it also plays down the extent of his womanising and the number of his illegitimate children. there are similarities here with "a beautiful mind" which also omitted a number of controversial details about its subject's personal life, including a divorce.fans of ray charles will no doubt enjoy the film for the music, but it is worth watching even for those who do not know much about him, chiefly on account of jamie foxx's oscar-winning performance in the title role, reproducing charles's mannerisms so exactly that we think we actually are watching a blind man, even though foxx himself is sighted. (unlike joaquin phoenix in "walk the line", however, foxx did not do his own singing- doubtless charles's distinctive singing voice was too difficult to reproduce). he receives good support from some of the other performers, particularly sharon warren as aretha and kerry washington as della bea. the film is uneven and overlong, but nevertheless rewarding. 7/10

this is the true story of the great pianist and jazz singer/legend ray charles (oscar, bafta and golden globe winning jamie foxx). he was born in a poor african american-town, and he went blind at 7 years old, but with his skills of touch and hearing, this is what would later in life would lead him to stardom. by the 1960's he had accomplished his dream, and selling records in millions, and leading the charts with songs and albums. but the story also showed his downfalls, including the separation from his wife and child, because of his affair with a band member , his drug and alcohol use, and going to prison because of this. also starring regina king as margie hendricks, kerry washington as della bea robinson, clifton powell as jeff brown, harry j. lennix as joe adams, bokeem woodbine as fathead newman, aunjanue ellis as mary ann fisher, sharon warren as aretha robinson, c.j. sanders as young ray robinson, curtis armstrong as ahmet ertegun and richard schiff as jerry wexler. it is a great story with a great singer impression, the songs, including hit the road jack, are the highlights. it won the oscar for best sound mixing, and it was nominated for best costume design, best director for taylor hackford, best editing and best motion picture of the year, it won the bafta for best sound, and it was nominated for the anthony asquith award for film music for craig armstrong and best original screenplay, and it was nominated the golden globe for best motion picture - musical or comedy. it was number 99 on 100 years, 100 cheers. very good!

brilliant biographic film..well this certainly is one of my very fav. biographic movie. this movie came as a total surprise to me. i had been avoiding this movie for a very very long time. now that was because i am not a fan of jamie foxx. i still am not a big fan of him but i sure am a fan now.well he deserved every bit of that oscar. his performance is one of the best performances i have seen in a long long time. he is truly sensational!well the narration, or the flow of the story is brilliant for a biographical movie. i am a drama fan so i wasn't bored at all.i was way too much surprised to have being liking the movie so much that i did not see any flaws in the movie. i think there isn't any flaw in the movie. maybe some events errors but hey who cares?the performance by the woman who plays ray's mother was also really good. and well kerry washington  she has so much potential.. if given the right role she might just be the next oscar winner.well the story of them movie was so emotional so touching.. i cried i cried very badlyi don't give a damn if the things were mad- up or not cuz this movie mad me cry and that's a lot for me!all in all a superb film. one of the very best of this century!10/10

ray charles robinson (jamie foxx) is a extremely talented pianist and singer as well. ray is an smart man as well. ray started his career in the late 1940's before he finds his distinctive style. ray is certainly popular at the night clubs with his music. things changes, when he meets an ambitious music producer (curtis armstrong). who knows ray got what it takes to be an strong performer and he also meets an woman (kerry washington), he loves as well & marries along the way. ray's album becomes an hit, when he mixes soul music and gospel together. which makes ray an controversial man during in the 1950's to the 1960's. ray has love for all kind of music, including country. but ray isn't always the perfect man as he seems to be. since he had plenty of failed relationship with other woman, while he's married. but he also had to battle with racism, people who double-crossed him, his music ideals and of course, his drug addiction. which it made ray's life extremely difficult for him and as well for battling the tragedy of his childhood. which ray always blamed himself for.directed by oscar-winner:taylor hackford (against all odds, devil's advocate, dolores claiborne) made an fascinating true-life story of the always interesting of the late "ray charles". foxx won an oscar for his touching performance of the late entertainer. foxx brings heart and soul in the film and humour as well. but this film has plenty of rich performances by an top cast including:regina king, clifton powell, bokeem woodbine, aunjaune ellis, warwick davis, terrence howard and sharon warren as ray's mother. this is probably the best film of hackford's career to date. the film has plenty of song of charles's best music as well.dvd has an sharp pan & scan (1.33:1) transfer and an excellent dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. disc 1 has an informative commentary by the director and the dvd also has the original theatrical cut and extended version as well. but u are better watching the theatrical version instead, because the bonus footage is in bad shape at times and u have to click on a logo if you want to see these deleted scenes. disc 2 has deleted scenes with optional commentary by the director (which is seen in the extended version), featurettes and more. but the featurettes are disappointingly short for this dvd. since the movie is extraordinary good. this film was nominated four oscars including best costume designs, best director, best editing and best picture. this is an amazing true-life story well told but of course, charles' life was even more controversial and outrageous than the final film. still, it's pretty damn close. screenplay by james l. white. from an story by white and director:hackford. oscar-winner for best sound. don't miss it. (**** ½/*****).

a lecture over the life of the tormented magician named ray charles. his pulses on the piano made fire music and his nostalgic voice created exciting, cool tunes. each barrier that ray was facing never kept him down, and he found his way all over conflicts. a real lesson. a great team of producers help recreate the era and armed with great costumes, hairs and settings one will follow ray's story believing its true, direct filming! an icy music freezes and goosebumps the audience with clever sound editing. but, the most important part of the movie is jamie foxx. his acting is really superb, the most diamond polished acting ever seen. he lives his role. he is the ray of light.

like most people out there who have watched james bond 007 movies. most people never knew that thunderball was originally the first 007 movie to be released, but after ian fleming, wrote the story with kevin mcclory and jack whittingham. the 2 other authors took ian fleming to court and won the case providing evidence that ian fleming took the ideas of spectre(special executive in counterintelligence terrorism revenge extortion). so rather than making thunderball they(fleming,broccoli,saltzman) went on to make dr no.this movie had the best of the best, from getting sean connery to come back one more time, he was paid over 5,000,000 for nsna. irvin kershner and sean connery had problems on the set, that much is true. but overall this movie was up there i think with(thunderball, licence to kill, dr no) those are my favorite from the bond series. david dryer was hired for special photographic effects, he was working at the time on bladerunner before never say never again. the 100 million dollar yacht makes the disco volante, look like a canoe. this movie starred the best villian in a bond movie just behind dr no. klaus maria brandeau held together this neurotic business like calm manner, with a little wit to his authority over bond. barbara carrera was excellent as fatima blush.the music was better than every score that didnt contain john barry doing the backround score music in most bond films. michel legrand is not big in the usa compared to over in europe, he has played with miles davis and many other great jazz musicians over the years. its a little bland at times but the 007 theme that happens around 3 or 4 times in the movie never say never again is so cool, i like it more than the original.007 is back one more timetimothy dalton explained it right i thought, you cant relate to a superman or a superhero, he or she has to be human and have feelings. he was by far the best serious true to flemings version of bond. but sean connery proves he can still do the role that made him and others to follow, i bet at 75 now he could still pull off a villian role in a mcclory 007 movie if one ever surfaces.

background info - the movies octopussy & never say never again were both made the same year, 1983, and so naturally people compare them. moore vs. connery. bond vs. bond.i've heard many people claiming that the "official movie" octopussy is far superior. well, i just watched octopussy. bond is riding an airplane at 100 miles an hour (impossible---the wind would blow him off), using his feet to force the plane to ground, and then jumping off at some 60 miles an hour (again impossible---try jumping out of your car---you'd end up with a shattered body). how is that octopussy scene supposed to be "good" in any sense of the word? suddenly bond has super-human strength & a titanium body. and he does all these stunts at the ancient age of 56??? complete crap. unbelievable. farse.---> now let's contrast the above scene with connery's "unofficial" never say never again: it doesn't have the same polish due to its independent film status (less money), but at least you can believe that connery is a real spy in real danger.the movie starts off with bond showing his age (he is 50 after all) and being sent off for recuperation. entirely believable. but of course, there's no such thing as a "day off" for a world-famous spy, and bond quickly finds himself a target, even inside the hospital. from that point the story spins off into another adventure, with bond trying to locate his attempted killers and ultimately foiling an attempt to steal nuclear weapons.as usual sean connery did a brilliant job, and avoids the over-the-top/unbelievable stunts. this movie feels like a natural successor to connery's last film, 1971's diamonds are forever... the old style of bond... before the franchise got silly.highyly recommended.

there are lot of similarities between never say never again and thunderball not only on sean connery but also the story and plot. except the actors all other are same like hijacking atomic bombs, asking for ransom, trafficking nukes in a ship, etc only difference are place of occurrence in thunder ball plot it is in bahamas in never say never again it is over north africa. and in thunder ball the nato / raf itself loads the nukes into plane and in never say never again it is changed by an "rouge arm of the axe" and air dropped over us and stolen in caribbean. almost 99% is same.if anybody wants to dispute this they are most welcome.

if you can watch a bond film from 1983 that isn't as good as octopussy and still enjoy it.if you can accept production values which aren't that much above the level of a tv movie.if you can look at sean connery with wrinkles on his forehead beneath an obvious toupée and still see james bond.if you can get past an inexperienced basinger, a weaker largo and a jolly q.if you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score, not up there with barry on his worst day.if you don't believe the hyperbolic reviews that it was greeted with on release.if you can meet a poker battle and a video game face off and enjoy them both the same.yours is never say never again and everything that's in it.and, what is more, you'll probably enjoy it, my son!

1983 was "the battle of the bonds". that year both roger moore and sean connery starred in two separate james bond film, the former (octopussy) was produced by the "official" makers of the bond films while the later (never say never again) was produced "unofficially" by a group led by kevin mcclory who held the film rights to thunderball. surprisingly enough is the "unofficial" film that is better despite the obvious flaw of and the fact that never say never again is a remake of thunderball.never say never again has the distinction of sporting one of the best casts ever assembled for a bond film. it all starts with sean connery, returning to the play bond for the first time since 1971's diamonds are forever. connery might be older then he was then but he looks better here then he did in diamonds are forever. the bond of never say never again is the sleek and dangerous shark of dr. no or from russia with love, just a few years older. connery's delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead on as it ever was. the one downside to connery's age is his believability, especially when it comes to the ladies of the film. let's face it even connery, despite being in top physical shape, looks as odd as moore when he is bedding women half his age. yet despite this believability issue, never say never again shows connery in one of his better bond performances and a definite improvement on his two earlier bond performances.kim bassinger plays domino in one of her early film roles. bassinger plays the role with considerable confidence for a relative newcomer and she makes the character believable. bassinger holds her own against her co-stars and has considerable chemistry with them as well. in fact she may well outshine her thunderball counter-part played by claudine auger.then there's the villain, maximilian largo played by klaus maria brandauer. brandauer's largo is everything a james bond film villain should be: suave, charming, evil and above all believable none the less. brandauer makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap many other bond villains have fallen into by going over the top. brandauer plays largo with a silent menace and charisma unseen in many adversaries of 007.the excellent cast extends into the supporting cast as well. barbara carrera makes a fine henchwoman in fatima blush and the screen lights up when she appears. max von sydow a nice appearance as blofeld, though his appearance is more akin to a cameo. rowan atkinson makes an appearance as bond's bumbling contact that makes for some of the best scenes in the film. with all that the highlight of the supporting cast comes from the mi6 staff from edward fox's m who makes for a great contrast to bernard lee, pamela salem who make s affine moneypenny and the icing on the cake with alec mccowen's wonderful q. the supporting cast has a couple of misfires though in the form of bernie casey as felix leiter and gavin o'herlihy as jack petachi who both seem to lack credibility in their respective roles. otherwise this film sports one of the best casts ever assembled for a bond film.on top of an excellent cast the film has several other essential ingredients. from the opening central america sequence to the fight at shrublands to the underwater sequences and motorbike chase, this is a film where the action sequences are not only great but service the plot as well for the most part. the film also sports good special effects in terms of cruise missile models, explosions, and all the things we expect from a bond film. irvin kershner, then fresh off doing the empire strikes back, brings a tight sense of direction to the film especially in sequences like the substation of nuclear warheads and the subsequent theft of the cruise missiles.yet this film is far from perfect. never say never again is easily one of the most dated of the bond films with its heavy use of 1980's computer sand video games. while technology dates any film after a time, this film's heavy reliance on it, especially in the hijacking of the cruise missiles and the domination sequence makes the film look incredibly dated some quarter of a century after its release. the script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the very fact it's a remake of thunderball.yet for its predictability the script for never say never again is pretty good. the script sports good dialogue scenes, not a single cringe worthy one liner (how many of the roger moore era scripts can you say that about?), some humorous situations, and yet is watchable and tense for the most part. once you look past he fact that it's a remake, there's quite a lot of good things in the script for the film.music is in fact the biggest weakness of the film. due to the "unofficial" status of the film, the james bond theme could not be used. that said this could have shown with the right composer that a bond score without it could work. unfortunately michael legrand's score is far from adequate. legrand's score is totally out of place in a bond film and there is only of or two places where it actually works. to make matters worse the film is also lumbered with one of the worst title sequences ever to grace a james bond film.despite being heavily dated, somewhat predicable, and having a bad score never say never again is still a good bond film. with one of the best casts of any bond film, good action sequences, good special effects, good direction, and some terrific dialogue, this film proves that "unofficial" isn't a bad thing. in fact it is is better then octopussy and the winner of "the battle of the bonds".

this is an excellent james bond movie. although it is not part of the original and more famous series, and it is a standalone film, it is very well done. enticing sean connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius, as was titling the movie in a way that references his past vow to not play bond again. connery was as great as he was in his earlier 007 appearances. the script is outstanding, as are the photography and the performances. it's the earliest movie i recall with kim basinger, who became much more famous after this film; barbara carrera was excellent; and klaus maria brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. the frequent references to the aging of bond and the changing times and attitudes of the british secret service were most humorous. the 007 gadgets equaled those of the other bond films. the only thing missing was the famous 007 music theme, which, of course, could not be used by this competing production. it was rather amazing to me to be able to see two excellent james bond movies released in the same year, this one and octopussy with roger moore. an interesting aspect of the film is an emphasis on video games and computer graphics. the early 80's were the first heyday of such things, and the use of them in this film made it a very contemporary movie. the film is actually a different version of thunderball, updated with newer technology. regardless of the repeated theme, there are sufficient differences to make it most entertaining. i will watch this one frequently.

i've always liked sean connery, but as james bond i've always favored roger moore. still it was connery who set the bond standard and while he had by 1983 established himself as something other than james bond, the money must have been irresistible for him to make one more appearance as 007 and save the world from the evil designs of spectre.and what designs they are in never say never again. spectre with the help of a foolish young air force officer who happens to be kim bassinger's brother stole two nuclear missiles during a war games exercise and now spectre headed by blofeld, played here by max von sydow is threatening blackmail of the world.von sydow's operations guy is klaus maria brandauer who is also courting bassinger and is a bit on the crazy side. and he's got a female assassin working for him in barbara carrera who makes angelina jolie as nora croft look like mrs. butterworth.but before sean connery can even get started he's got to deal with a new 'm' running things at british intelligence. edward fox thinks connery is old fashioned in his methods and costs the british taxpayers too much money with his violent ways. i really did enjoy fox's performance, he's like the great grandson of colonel blimp.i also enjoyed carrera, she's something to look at and quite resourceful in her methods. when she's scuba diving with connery in the bahamas, note how she puts mr. shark on 007's case.will connery do james bond again? he was widely quoted as saying who would they cast him as at this point, roger moore's father? but i think connery would still be formidable in a wheelchair.

when i first saw this on tape, about 10 years after it had been released, i thought it was one of the better james bond movies. however, after seeing it again around the turn of the century, i was disappointed.i think it's a bit overrated only because critics were so happy to see sean connery end his 12-year hiatus from playing bond that they didn't dare criticize the film. i guess what disappointed me was the ending. after investing two hours into the film, you expect a less-hokey, more satisfying ending. and, it may be nitpicking, but i was disappointed in not seeing the regular actors in the supporting roles such as miss moneypenny, q, felix leiter, etc.on the positive side, there was plenty of unique action scenes, particularly early on, and the two villains were interesting. i thought klaus maria brandauer was the more intriguing of the two because he was so low-key and looked the "nice guy next door." he wasn't your normal bond villain.this had plenty of "skin," for a pg movie, especially with kim basinger starring, never being an actress known for hiding her figure. the language was very tame, but most bond movies are pretty good in that department.all in all, it's a "fair" bond and nothing else. just because connery is in it, it doesn't mean it's automatically good. roger moore and pierce brosnan have proved they could play the role well, too.

only connery could bring that particular style with a line like that fatima crashes into bond's arms when she water-skis up to the super agent in nassau and apologizes, 'oh, how reckless of me. i made you all wet.' the super agent replies, 'yes, but my martini is still dry.'barbara carrera makes a great villain, stealing the show as spectre executioner fatima blush fatima is number 12 in the spectre chain of command, and is a gorgeous assassin who takes intense sensations of pleasure in killing fatima assumes all the deadly characteristics of fiona, proving to be one of bond's toughest adversaries she is a victim of her vanity she's good at what she does, and wants the world to know it but her vanity is her downfall using every possible approach to eliminate 007, fatima is a wild and cunning woman who makes love to the man she is about to kill austrian actor klaus-maría brandauer (largo) does not make a very formidable opponent for 007 referred to as number one in the spectre chain of command, largo resides in the bahamas, and travels aboard his super yacht, the flying saucer max von sydow becomes the fourth actor to appear as spectre chief ernst stavro blofeld, once more plotting to put the world at ransom kim basinger takes the part once owned by the lovely french actress claudine auger she is domino, the mistress of largo, who soon falls deeply in love with her rescuer black actor bernie casey becomes the sixth actor to play cia agent felix leiter after jack lord, cec linder, rik van nutter, norman burton, and david hedison...edward fox portrays the new, unsympathetic 'm.' pamela salem is the third actress to play miss moneypenny. lois maxwell was the first and barbara bouchet was the second.valerie leon is the sexy lady in the bahamas who fished 007 out of the blue water and saved his life by making love to him in her own room valerie was the sardinian hotel receptionist in 'the spy who loved me' when bond and anya arrive seeking strombergprunella gee is shrublands physical therapist patricia saskia cohen tanugi is nicole, bond's secret service contact in the south of france gavan o'herlihy is jack petachi, the u.s. air force communications officer who duplicates the president of the united states' 'eye print' and arms two cruise missiles with nuclear warheads rowan atkinson is the bumbling foreign officer nigel small-fawcett; and alec mccowen is algernon, the armorer who provides 007 some formidable items if you like to see connery playing a tense battle of wills, disguised as a masseur, attacked by robot-controlled sharks, giving away a considerable amount of money for a tango dance, thrown into a medieval dungeon, don't miss this second of only two "unofficial" james bond films

it's not citizen kane, but it does deliver. cleavage, and lots of it.badly acted and directed, poorly scripted. who cares? i didn't watch it for the dialog.

this has to be my guilty pleasure. i am a huge fan of 80's movies that were designed to entertain and they didn't care if they offended anyone. this move has no meat, not substance, no deep thought provoking scenes. just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown, then so be it! this movie is for when you just want to relax and not think. viva la nudity!

h.o.t.s. is proof that at one time, the movie industry said "f-off" to the censors, and made movies with whatever they wanted! in today's world, this movie would be too "over the top" and "extreme" for it to be anywhere than behind a velvet curtain. although, bestbuy had several copies on their $5.99 rack (in case anyone wanted to get a copy)! the movie was brilliant in its own way, in that it blended humor into a t&a movie loaded with playboy playmates! unlike most skin flicks, it did have a plot. that, however, is not exactly why you would watch h.o.t.s.h.o.t.s. is a college movie that reminds me of the revenge of the nerds movies, in that it takes a group of "average people" and puts them against the elite rich preppies that most people can't stand! the only difference is that the "nerds" in this movie have a much better shot at getting laid! i notice that there are some people who would rate this movie low, and to me that is ignorant! obviously this is not intended to win oscars or break barriers in film. if you are looking for that, then go watch what ever the critics pick for you! you have to appreciate the fact that this movie actually had a funny plot, decent acting (for the most part given the genre), and plenty of girls getting naked! h.o.t.s. is one of those movies you watch to get your mind off of modern day problems and daily stress, and instead, laugh and have a good time! if you are looking for a funny college-based movie that has enough skin to turn a pink miata straight, then you should really check out h.o.t.s.!

i remember hearing about this movie and how it played at nearly every drive-in theatre here in toronto. it's about a group of girls that are not accepted by the other sororities at their college, so they start up their own, and of course call it h.o.t.s. it's a fun movie, that is just bursting with drive-in nostalgia! lots of fully endowed t-shirts, vans, fighting, and a football game showdown like no other! it's been compared to "animal house", which is a good movie in it's own right, but to me nothing compares to h.o.t.s. it has it's own brand of fun & character. if you are looking for a classic t n'a movie, look no further because the h.o.t.s. girls are to the rescue, boom-boom shorts & all!

h.o.t.s. is a fun film for a trip back to when skin flicks had a more positive fun-filled agenda. they were made simply to titillate and have a few laughs. everything seems less cynical and jaded. the girls all have natural figures and some are playboy playmates. the simple plot deals with a group of young women who open a non-sanctioned sorority house to get back at the snooty sorority girls who spurned and insulted them. instead of the mean spirited tricks of today, most of the hijinks are simply innocent fun. the women are decent actresses for this genre and are mostly very attractive. to keep our attention between the topless scenes, we have mafia henchmen, a stolen bear, a hot air balloon, a funky house mother, and the cheapest robot ever seen. there's even danny bonnaducci of the partridge family. if you have a sense of humor then let yourself go and enjoy some light entertainment.

this has to be my guilty pleasure. i am a huge fan of 80's movies that were designed to entertain and they didn't care if they offended anyone. this move has no meat, not substance, no deep thought provoking scenes. just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown, then so be it! this movie is for when you just want to relax and not think. viva la nudity!

topless touch football!! a wet t-shirt contest!! a jockstrap raid!! this "sheanimal house" has it all. except a plot and good actors. the film consists of several pranks and catfights between the h.o.t.s. girls and the bitchy pi house. the dialouge is a scream and the soundtrack is sublimely brilliant. over the past couple of months it's been popping up all over cable, so do yourself a favor and watch out for it. h.o.t.s. is so bad it's good!

i'm grading this film on a curve, in other words, it isn't the greatest film that has ever been made but it does exactly what it set out to do. this is an excellent t&a film. i have no idea the count of how many t's or a's were seen in this film but i did see one shot that had 16 bare t's at one time, just to give you an idea. there are topless girls all throughout. there is a wet t-shirt contest scene. and the climax involves a game of touch football between two all-girl teams and every time one scores a touchdown the entire opposing team losing a piece of clothes. i don't know why this gets such a low rating here. perhaps the people who gave it low scores thought they were going to see citizen kane. i love this movie and hope to find more similar ones. if you are looking for a good campy t&a film i'd recommend this one.

if you watched this film for the nudity (as i did) you won't be disappointed. i could have done without the bumbling crooks or the bear though. some bottomless nudity could have be shown but for what it was i think h.o.t.s. has to be the best of its genre.it is not the sort of film that could have been made today which is a pity because it is the sort of film that is worth watching in these times.i would take mindless nudity over pivotal plot points any day.it is a shame that the dvd doesn't have any extras but as they didn't have dvds when this was filmed that is understandable. i would have like to know more about the shooting of the film especially where they shot the football match at the end.

man this movie is awesome especially the part they show the italian chick damn shes incredibly hot shes not your average italian. mna i would go see that movie over and over just to see that chick. i really enjoyed the movie really hot girl shes steamy sexy. also the actor are really good but the girl is better. i think the actor played a better part in pride and prejudice so i don't think he acted in his highest level but yeah back to the girl i mean shes gorgeous perfect and i could only wish her luck in her future movies yeah also her acting skills in such young age was awesome i was just amazed wit her performance. what a great actress so yeah i recommend everybody this great movie

i think this is the best norwegian movie i've ever seen. it's about 40-year old andreas who gets hit by a subway-train, and suddenly finds himself in a strange city, however, everything here has been made ready for him. he has got a job, a house and clothes. at first, this city seems perfect, no death, no pain and no problems. everywhere there are men in gray suits who cleans up and fixes everything that doesn't fit into their definition of perfect. however andreas can't really seem to fit in and starts to long back to his old world, and tries with all means to get back. the thing that impresses my the most in this movie is how they way of making the city seem so surrealistic, even though i have seen a lot of these places in real life they seem so distant. another thing that contributes greatly to the is the performance from the actors. trond fausa aurvaag is just the perfect guy to play the confused and bothersome andreas. and all the other characters are also doing a great job by playing apathetic (sounds like a hard job, doesn't it?). the strong difference between andreas and the others leads to very amusing situations as well. all in all, this is a fabulous movie. the plot may be a little confusing, but the movie has such a great atmosphere i would recommend that everyone should go see it. and i wouldn't recommend listening to "ccscd212", as it seems he has seen too many commercial american movies and seems to have became too used to just getting served the moral on a silver plate. the way i see it there is not much in this film that tries to tell us about suicide being right or wrong. i consider it more of a warning of a direction our society seems to be taking. but sure, everyone can see a film in their own way.

totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it. this movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way. what it is about? estrangement, i believe. probably up to the viewer, but i found that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades. don't know if i'm right. but this movie really got to me. see it. i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style. and i forgot: the casting here i superb, with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why. the acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life (in the city), is what makes him bothersome. all the others do as they are told, and pretend (?) to be happy. this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.

i heard an interview with the main actor who said that the film was not intended to be a horror movie but he himself would describe it as mental horror. i strongly subscribe to that.it is not clear why he travels to this place, but everything there is monotonous, no bright colors, no honest smiles, nothing personal. everything is ordered and everyone seems to be satisfied living this kind of life. our "hero" though from the beginning seems to be misplaced and feels it himself. what makes this film so important and good is the remarkable similarity to life in many large cities or even countries nowadays. you have to function, you are not supposed to let your colleague know your weaknesses, you show off on your wealth, your car, etc., and most of all you lack the true love of life that children have. naturally, in this film you see neither children nor old people - they simply do not fit in a society of strong workers.i would recommend this film to everyone - and make sure that this utopia does not come true!

imagine a world, in which everyone treats anyone nicely, no foul word is ever uttered, office bickering is nonexistent, and your boss invites the office crowd regularly to self-cooked dinners where you can chat about latest interior design styles. everything is neat, pleasant - well, just nice. in other words: you are in hell. after being dropped off in the middle of nowhere, mid-thirties andreas (trond fausa aurvaag) starts a new job as a book-keeper in a small, clean city. from the beginning he feels foreign in this proper, impersonal world of superficial kindness, surrounded by pleasant but lifeless interior architecture and likewise colleagues. food tastes of nothing, drinks don't get you drunk, no children anywhere; after initial steps of fitting in, andreas searches for ways to escape the bland new world. he doesn't know where he came from anymore, but still remembers rich tastes, true feelings - anything beyond the non-committal flatline life he's leading now. the bothersome man resonates ideas of huxley and kafka, but here the cruelty is the omnipresent noncommittal neatness. unlike pleasantville this is not about narrow-minded bigotry, more a fable of our urban free-world civilisation of fitting in. it mostly reminds one of the ingenious fight club scene, in which edward norton walks through a mock-ikea catalogue. spiced with macabre humour, this scandinavian laconic tale convinces on every level: story, characters, and relevance. a true screen gem. 8/10

andreas arrives in a strange city. he doesn't remember where he came from and how he got there. he is ordered to arrive at work, and gets his own apartment in the city. all his co-workers are nice and polite to him, they say hi and smile when they pass by him. but then later on andreas discovers that the city isn't that pleasant as it seems. going home from work, he see some people wearing grey suits, cleaning up the bloody mess of a dead body, apparently a suicide victim that had thrown himself out of the window. the procedure is done with a calmed mind, as if they were emptying a trashcan. the following day, andreas meets the suicide victim fully alive at work. more and more andreas discovers the feelingless atmosphere of the city.den brysomme mannen might be the best norwegian film i've seen. original, artistic directing is usually missing in norwegian films, with only a few exceptions. the plot is also very original, and could even be called post-modern horror, as the film present us a terrifying thought of having to cope with a world that is completely feelingless. and the more you try to fill your life in this city with a meaning, the more meaningless it becomes. i am fascinated by how the director manages to create the feeling of a disembovled universe, a nightmare, that you simply cannot escape from, not even with death.go see it, its really worth it! i gave it 9 out of 10.

laura gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to africa for a photo shoot. there she is met by a couple and other swinging couples. they all stay at this huge, very touristy hotel with a gigantic swimming pool. one night they have a pool party complete with "real live" native dancers. it's very un-politically correct and very kitschy. later, emanuelle finally has her photo shoot, which turns out to be in one of those drive-through, stay-in-your-car safaris (albeit the photography is gorgeous). throughout the film, emanuelle is going after every man she meets. the photography is very well done in this film. there are scenes with cascading waterfalls, galloping giraffes and ancient ruins. the film is worth seeing for the soundtrack by nico fidenco alone.

the first of the italian rip-offs of the french soft porn blockbuster (though it might be interesting to note that the boot-shaped country actually got their first with cesare canevari's 1968 io, emmanuelle starring erika blanc) is a very different kettle of fish than the sleazy sequels provided by the late, questionably great joe d'amato. it is much closer in spirit to the now very dated just jaeckin film from 1973, taking a pokerfaced look at male/female relationships, questioning such then hot topics as fidelity and jealousy, all in luxurious exotic surroundings. unlike d'amato, director albert thomas (aka adalberto albertini, who also made the hard to find yellow emanuelle, actually a sexed-up version of madame butterfly !) does not present us with predatory drug lords, snuff movie makers or rampaging cannibals, making for an admittedly less sensational yet far more erotic viewing experience.photo journalist mae jordan aka 'emanuelle' (lovely java-born laura gemser in her first lead role following bit parts as a thai masseuse in emmanuelle 2 and an 'unspoilt native' in just jaeckin's portion of the rarely seen collections privees) flies down to nairobi where she's to shoot the stills accompanying an article by noted british writer anne, played by the very teutonic karin schubert with a butch haircut that takes some getting used to. anne shares an 'open relationship' (remember when this was made) with her italian husband gianni (angelo infanti), meaning that both pretty much jump anything with a pulse. contrary to her subsequent reputation, emanuelle appears positively reticent compared to her heavy breathing hosts, smoldering seductively at gianni by way of foreplay until the exquisitely tantalizing pay-off. okay, so she does make up for this lack of wantonness at the end when she does an entire male hockey team on the train. i kid you not.production on this sexploitation classic is quite impressive, especially the superb cinematography. and nico fidenco's musical theme is a solid favorite of anyone with more than a passing interest in the genre, a hilarious eurotrash pop ditty (try to make out those totally nonsensical lyrics and have a full evening's worth of fun with the family !) that turns up throughout the entire film in every conceivable type of rendition from slow 'n' sexy to hip-gyrating disco.this is entirely laura gemser's show though. billed simply as 'emanuelle' (as was another actress on the same director's elusive emanuelle nera 2), she lights up the screen from start to finish. not yet submitted to endless rape scenarios (as she would be once d'amato took over), she seems much more relaxed than in later films, even smiling from time to time, a rare occasion as anyone who has seen some of the lady's work surely knows. a flawless eurasian rather than as the title suggests black beauty (she hails from dutch india now indonesia and is actually quite close in physical appearance to the supposed author of the novel emmanuelle arsan), she projects a slightly passive, even submissive sensuality which somehow detaches her from the 'depravity' her morally corrupted cohorts indulge in. unlike the french film, cheapskate moralizing is kept to a bare minimum, almost thrown in as an afterthought near film's end when emanuelle tells gianni that he hasn't lost her as he never possessed her to begin with. i swear you could hear audiences of the just jaeckin version groan whenever alain cuny's supremely irritating mario showed up on screen as it meant we were in for too many minutes of halfbacks libertine philosophizing as an alibi for getting the divine sylvia kristel (now living in the belgian capital of brussels by the way...) to disrobe, the real reasons theaters were packed for years on end. gemser's later husband, gabriele tinti (now deceased, she has remarried), appears on the sidelines as the constantly drunk 'scottish' (huh ?) writer who forces himself briefly on emanuelle amid the african ruins at some point, but no real sex scene though.

the main reason to check this one out is to watch laura gemser in all her glory.that's reason enough for me.she heads to africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films. huge mansion near the jungle. hunters staying around for parties when they aren't out hunting zebras. and said parties becoming drunken orgies.all the high society types in the emanuelle films seem to have out of control fetishes. and emanuelle beds most of them.joe d'amato did not direct this one. he just ripped it off and used the same cast(s). and did anyone notice the 'subliminal' sexual images at the gas station? and why did most of the men stay dressed during the sex scenes? coherence? hardly any. but goddess gemser is beautiful.

i have so much hope for the sequel to gen-x. luckily, my hopes have came true. you got a whole bunch of action, comedy...silly comedy, and surprises. i think the newcomer edison, is really a hit in the movie, but i really find sam's 'alien' stupidly annoying with english. although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue, the action always keeps it strong. the action set-up is much stronger than the 1st.this movie is getting more of an american feel since 60% of the movie is in english from the cantonese. this movie will not disappoint you. i recommended this for young 'uns that care about pure action-packed fun.

i think this movie has got it all. it has really cool music that i can never get out of my head. it has cool looking characters. is really funny(you know, the kind that you'll crack up on the ground and you'll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks).despite the bad acting, bad cgi, and bad story(about cops going after a robot), its really cool. its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch, get together, eat pizza, laugh like crazy, and watch it two more times.there are so many funny parts, like when kurt was trying to get edison's attention and gave him the finger, and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball. on that part, i kept saying "remember, remember?"to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened. there was also a really funny part when edision ran into the room and kurt was there(just before they fought) and kurt was talking about his "strange dream" and how he was "superman". i loved that part, although it has been a while since i saw it, so i don't remember that part. everything the actors said were funny, like how kurt says, "i worship you, like a god!" to the robot.although there was some bad things, in all it was a great movie. man, i can't stop laughing. i wish i had that movie. );

gen-y cops...since i heard of the film being in release, i have been wanting to see it because i loved gen-x cops. i was a little disappointed that a) nicholas tse didn't return and b) too much slapstick. nevertheless, i enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first film, but it is good in its own way.stephen fung returns as the ultracool ladies man match, who has a steady girl in oli (note: where is haze?) and sam lee returns as the insane alien (this time sporting a mohawk and speaking a lot of english!!!!). the real star of the film is newcomer edison chen. he makes a great replacement for nicholas tse as...edison. i also enjoyed paul rudd's performance of agent curtis...he seems to be the tough as nails, smartmouth fbi agent you'd love to hate...but soon, you'd like his character.the fight scenes are a lot better in this one...even though there are very few, but they are great, courtesy of jackie chan stuntman nicky li.look for a cameo from ron smoorenburg as a cage fighter who has a teeny little fight with match. smoorenburg also is the stunt double for rudd.if you liked gen-x cops...you'll love gen-y cops!!!

this film is great. all the hi-tech machinery and technology is mind-boggling. it is packed with action, humour and not to mention, guys. you will want to see it again and again. very very funny. also, it has a very unique plot which is unpredictable. you wouldn't want to miss out on it.

i am having a holiday in hong kong now, and i just saw gen y cops at the cinema.... what can i say... it was sooo cool!!everything you could wish for was in it! basically... just see it if ya can... i'm gonna get my friend to send me the vcd when it comes out....only bad thing was the dodgy american style of talking employed by some of the hl actors... like edison... "what's up my man?!" but it did add even more humour to iy... hhehesee it... especially if ya like any of the following geners: hkfilm, action, comedy, sci fi! seeitman!! edison did a good song for it too... so download it... edison tse - heroes

okay, so it starts very unimaginatively with a narration from the lead character (justine played by laura fraser - an amazing actress in her own right) but it goes on to become something miraculous. it has silly little things that you really shouldn't find funny but do every time. there is an especially memorable moment that sees your jaw dropping to the ground the first time you watch it when the male body of jake, containing justine's female mind, is trying to get used to her new anatomy. i wont spoil it for you, but the second time i watched it was with friends; seeing their faces was brilliant. it makes you cringe, but laugh at the same time. i am also a big fan of the music used. there is a beautiful small band that appears randomly on the street or on a pathway every now and then, but also some gorgeous, yet unknown (often the best), pop songs. it has the feeling of being written for an english cast by an american writer, which does annoy me only a couple of times. overall, this film is hilarious. i am a massive fan of laura fraser's now, after being given his film for my birthday, and expect that, even though some of the cast are little-known to most, you too will enjoy every bit of it.

this film, won't win any awards for greatness. but if you have an hour and a half free and fancy a bit of light hearted entertainment then you could do much worse than watch this...the cast are mostly young and pretty, the script has some genuinely funny moments and the soundtrack is pretty cool too. rupert penry-jones as jake seems to have the most fun, while laura fraser as justine is sweet, likable and funny.i rented it because i like the series 'spooks' that rpj is currently starring in. and here he's young and buff and the perfect eye candy for a girls night in.get some wine and some ice cream and have a chuckle.

i really can't see why people seem to dislike this film. i found it very entertaining (of course the fact that it stars the gorgeous laura fraser is a bonus!) when i first heard about it, i thought it would be along the lines of a role-reversed "weird science" and, to an extent, this is true, however there is a twist which i really didn't see coming. having seen the trailer on the dvd (which i hadn't seen before watching the film) i saw that the "twist" is actually shown in the trailer! very strange.as the film progresses the "weird science" comparison fits less and less, and i think this is the better of the two films. certainly there are some scenes which don't work wonderfully, but these are made up for by the enthusiasm of the young cast.in summary, i'd suggest that this is a fine example of a sci-fi chick flick, and i don't think i've seen many of them!

this is not a serious film, and does not pretend to be, but it is not as bad as some of its reviews, it's title, and the first ten minutes lead you to expect.the plot is very silly, but this adds to the light-hearted fun and enthusiasm which runs through the film. the characters are played sympathetically, and while they do engage in typical teenage angst, they generally avoid the sickly sentimentality usually to be found in this film genre.unusually set in london, sympathetic to geeks, this is well worth a watch if it happens to be on; if you want some tongue-in-cheek silliness, and don't mind suspending your disbelief.

when it comes to any movie that was made in or about the south,the characters are labeled racist or hillbillies or even worse that awful racist term "rednecks". this movie was a murder mystery, plain & simple. it was a great murder mystery & did demonstrate some of human feelings about each others race. the same type of observations made by black character actors toward whits in todays' movies. before watching this movie, one should get the "mississippi burning" chip off of ones' shoulder & enjoy the plot, wonderful acting, & reminiscent scenes of simpler times that while are gone, they will not be forgotten. mr.faulkner did his hometown of oxford,miss. justice by having this movie shot there. the producer noted while shooting the movie there, his stereotypical perception of whites were misconcieved & that he observed white & black townspeople & locals getting along with each other in the same way. so, sit back & enjoy one of mr faulkner's great classics & try to figure out who the killer really is...

this is a well done action movie. there are plenty of fight scenes, the acting is convincing (for this genre) and rs1 is awesome. i don't know why people feel compelled to trash rs1, i thought his effects were executed very nicely and his design looked great. the plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie.having said that, i must tell you richard sun is one of the worst actors from hong kong i have ever watched. at least rs1 had the right idea by killing him. now, for all of you who thought sam lee (alien) was a bad actor...he wasn't meant to be taken seriously! i have just had the pleasure of watching gen-x cops (prequel) and sam lee played the same character the same way!now, please, all of you guys who watch highly reviewed oscar winners: do not judge this is a thinking man's movie! it isn't supposed to require thought! just meant to be enjoyed, that's all. i hope they make another soon.

had it not been for to kill a mockingbird, this movie would be much more famous. had it not been for gregory peck as addicus fitch, the acting here would be much more lauded. had it not been for william faulkner, perhaps to kill a mockingbird might never have been written in his shadow.i found this movie to be sadly familiar because it showed me that one of my favorite movies, to kill a mockingbird, may not have been as original as i'd always thought it was. perhaps it was inspired by this very similar movie. oh, the "whodunnit" is different, but the underlying story, a lone righteous "white" attorney against a white southern town defending a black man is all too familiar. and, written by a woman, mockingbird concentrates on rape, the ultimate betrayal to a woman while this movie concentrates on brother against brother hatred, the rape a man feels by fraternal betrayal.there's not the depth of mockingbird here. not the comfort that addicus brings with his presence. so you're just left with the sadness that, whether she intended to lift the plot from this movie or not, harper lee's mockingbird reflects. nothing changed in that 10 or so years since the time she may have read faulkner's book and saw his movie while in college in alabama and unconsciously or not took most of it as her own in later years. nothing changed in race relations and some may say nothing has changed even now, these many years later.it's all too sadly familiar, and one wishes there were an addicus of our day to make it all right. where mockingbird leaves you with hope of that, rocking in the arms of addicus and waiting for a morning of better times, this movie leaves you just sad that pride from black people might equal or better the pride of white people. but pride from either is no answer at all.rather, it's the answer of addicus we need, comfort that we are all flawed and that in our frailty we should have mercy, not pride, when facing each other in our differences.

it's too bad iameracing wants to deny the reality of faulkner's and clarence brown's purpose in the creating of the story and film of "intruder in the dust". i suppose the burden of a history of racism is difficult for any southerner to bear and i can understand that. but to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate. yes (to borrow your use of the upper case) iameracing, there are many many many places where blacks and white people in the south get along quite well. but to deny the way that black people were and sometimes still are forced to live, the conditions and injustices they have had to endure are not imaginary. sometimes black and white people got along because of genuine affection and understanding. sometimes it was only as long as blacks 'knew their place'. the point of making juano hernandez character (in film and print) a somewhat prickly type, not warm and fuzzy, was to underscore the fact that bigotry is wrong in and of itself and human rights are just that for everyone regardless of whether we like a particular individual or not. it would do iameracing good to stop denying the existence of racism and the great harm it has done to americans of all stripes. the fact is that black people (among others) did not, as a rule, not an exception, receive the benefits of the justice system as even-handedly as whites. segregation, discrimination and lynching are historical fact. people like iameracing might claim these things were not as widespread as some think and would probably love to exonerate their ancestors and heroes from any connection with such behavior. it would be a wonderful thing if iameracing's southern ancestors (if any)never participated in any of the horrible racist actions that mar this country's history and i hope they didn't. if that is so congratulations to them but that fact, if true, does not erase the fact that others did. and even if the horrible things that were done to blacks in the south (and other areas, let's not forget the draft riots of the civil war era)were only half as numerous, only a third, does that make them any less horrible? is the murder of ten children the hanging of ten men the sexual assault of ten women any less horrible than the same things happening to a hundred? iameracing asks us to get the "mississippi burning" chip off of our shoulders before we see "intruder in the dust", well i ask you, did the murders of the civil rights activists happen or not? why should that be forgotten? forgiven? maybe. but in order to prevent their recurrence they cannot be forgotten or revised into minor occurrences. the racism that is displayed in "intruder in the dust" is displayed there quite purposely. it is there to make a point. on a cinematically historical level it is also ridiculous for iameracing to discount the racial angle. any viewer of films that were filmed before the 1960's knows that black actors/characters/extras were usually deliberately cast. to judge from our movie history; wars were always fought by middle aged white men; there were no black people in the old west; it was possible to walk down a street in a major city and never encounter a black person; there were no black hospital orderlies,taxi drivers,clerks, salespeople etc. blacks were almost never cast with regard to a role unless race was a factor. if falukner (and brown) had wanted to tell a simple murder story he probably would not have made the hernandez character black. racism exists iameracing. probably for different reasons i am sure, we both wish that it didn't but it does. wanting things to be the way we would like them to be probably can't be helped but it still does not make them so.

a very potent drama of faulkner's small town south dealing with an innocent black man's murder of local ne'er do wll. striking cinematography and good narrative (via flashback) take us through the uneasy relationship between the suspect and the son of his lawyer. a still powerful story that predates the sidney poitier films of racial prejudice. porter hall has a great role as the murdered man's father. trivia: this was actually filmed in faulkner's home town of oxford, miss. with many of the residents used as extras.

i am not a faulkner fan (which is considered sacrilegious, especially since i grew up near the author's hometown); however, i think this is an excellent movie. on par with the quality of the movie "to kill a mocking bird". if you haven't seen it, buy it anyway. it's well worth having in your permanent collection. tcm recently played the movie as a part of the race on film series. i wish they'd play it more often. very moving.on a side note, the folks from oxford, mississippi, will also enjoy seeing the footage of the town square as it was back in the 1940's. the courthouse, city hall, etc.: they're all on screen. i never knew the movie was filmed there until i noticed the familiarity of the buildings. when i saw the arch in the front of city hall, i began to get suspicious. look closely at the pennants on chick's wall: you'll see two for ole miss !

hello there; i would just like to say how much i enjoyed your review and comments about that excellent film 'intruder in the dust'. i believe that the points you made were insightful, intelligent and totally valid. it's also a shame that this film is hardly ever shown on tv these days and that it isn't available on dvd region 2 - i live in england. once again, many thanks for your review. the actor juano hernandez was in another brilliant film, 'young man with a horn', which also starred kirk douglas and lauren bacall. that was a very evocative and stylish film with some superb music. i wish that someone with influence could release the entire back catalogues of films like 'johnny belinda', 'i remember mama', and 'the yearling' on dvd region 2, we love these movies in great britain. i'm not of pensionable age, i'm still reasonably young and my family and i love classic films!!films like these were so beautifully made and they bring back wonderful memories. anyway...! many thanks for your comments!

intruder in the dust (1949) dir: clarence brown production: mgmexcellent 'southern gothic' tale, adapted from the faulkner novel, about a black man, accused of the murder of a white man, who asks a young white boy he has befriended to help him prove his innocence. lucas beauchamp (juano hernandez) is something of an anomaly in this small town. he's a black man who owns the land he lives on and doesn't think much of the diseased social order that mostly keeps the peace here and in many similar small towns. so when lucas is found holding a gun over the dead body of vinson gowrie, shot in the back no less, young chick mallison (claude jarman) (who lucas once saved after chick fell through the ice while hunting on his land) fears that the town finally has the chance to "make lucas a n*****." arrested, and with a very real chance of being lynched before the night is through, lucas reaches out to chick for help, as the only person he knows "not cluttered with notions". chick asks his uncle john, a lawyer, to defend lucas and while the man is initially bothered by his own notions he agrees and they race against the gathering mob to save lucas' life.the film has an uncommon frankness for its time and is mostly free of moralizing. the lawyer character has a tendency to speak incredibly self-aware dialogue that sounds mostly like something from the printed page, but it has minimal impact on the tone. that's a credit to the rich characterization of everyone else. juano hernandez, who had mostly appeared in oscar micheaux films, is superb as the proud lucas. porter hall as the murdered man's father, in maybe the best role i've ever seen him in, and elizabeth patterson as a plucky old lady sympathetic to lucas' case, standout in support roles. the setting is perfectly realized. it is actually filmed in oxford, mississippi, faulkner's hometown. brown also uses the crowd in an effective way, it's always an anonymous mob against a single person (like lucas when he's arrested or john when he's going up to his office), that is very threatening. or the grotesquerie of the whole town gathering at the jailhouse to witness the lynching like it was a parade. of note is an absolutely riveting scene when chick and his friend aleck go evidence gathering in a cemetery. robert surtees (the bad and the beautiful, thirty seconds over tokyo, ben-hur) shot the picture. *** 1/2 out of 4

i've described this film as surprising... this is true in many respects. the subject material (black man wrongly accused), the characters (people you expect to be stereotypes often show uncharacteristic attitudes during the film), the production...all of these factors make for a refreshingly unusual film, especially for its time (1949). the only possible spoilers being the sometimes cheesy dialogue and occasional high moral stance.but, if you happen across it when you weren't planning to watch a film, you might find yourself like me - staying up into the middle of the night just to see what happens.

take a look at those faces alongside the entrance to the jail. they're not the faces of hollywood extras. somebody in production was really smart to take filming to oxford, mississippi, because you can't get that kind of authenticity from a studio backlot. scope out the narrow dusty roads, the frozen earth beneath, and the skeletal trees just barely hanging on. no wonder those faces look hard and unforgiving; they're just reflecting the soil from which they spring. old man lucas (hernandez) better fear for his life, but then he springs from that same hard earth.the movie works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor sentimentalizes and even has some suspense. old man lucas is not very likable. he's a victim and we sympathize, but he's also haughty and unfriendly. wisely, the script refuses to sweeten him up. that way we're forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the less sympathetic. the script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism since that tends to become preachy and less effective. instead, we're shown how easily prejudice can convict an innocent man and condemn him to a horrible death. so, it's through our common instinct to see justice done that the effects of racism are exposed, a much more effective pathway. it also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable since they are otherwise part of the jim crow system.note how the movie doesn't attack segregation. it's doubtful that old man lucas would want to mix with whites anyway and there's no hint that even lawyer stevens (brian) wants to cross the color line except to see justice done. no, the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future as symbolized by the kid (jarman) whose head is not yet filled with "notions". he's not exactly friends with lucas, but he has glimpsed the common humanity of being befriended after falling into the frozen creek. the last line of dialogue also shows him siding with his uncle, the lawyer, instead of his more hidebound parents (the dinner table scene is important and easily overlooked). the lawyer might not join a future civil rights march, but the kid might. that's the movie's realistically hopeful side.there was a bunch of racially themed movies during this brief 3 year period, 1949-51, (the well, no way out, home of the brave, lost boundaries). even famously detached mgm got into the mix with this little gem. unfortunately, the mccarthy purges in hollywood put an end to "problem" films that might not serve cold war ends. even so, each of these is worth catching up with, not only because they're good movies, but because even with the passage of 60 years and jim crow, they're still relevant.

this film was set, filmed, and premiered in oxford, miss., the hometown of w. faulkner, the locale of the 1948 book. most of the extras were locals. i've been to oxford, and it has greatly changed. this film features will geer as the sheriff;he was later blacklisted. it was the writers and actors of social dramas such as this film, and grapes of wrath, that were targets of the huac a few years later. i don't recall if the actor playing the young mallison boy (claude jarman jr) did anything after the tv series centennial (1978), but he was terrific in this earlier film. and do not miss elizabeth patterson who later played in little women.

as a fan of wm. faulkner since college, i was especially pleased to see intruder in the dust and for other reasons. my grandfather, also named clarence brown as was the director, grew up in the oxford area having been born near there in 1888. we attended a week long family reunion at oxford in july, 1964 a mere 15 years after filming the movie. it still looked mostly like it does in the film but was going thru a period of civil rights upheaval then as the site of ole miss. my recollection is of its being a nice little college town that summer but i was just an 18 year old college sophomore and white. i was just then beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice but still had a long way to go. anyhow, the movie is well worth watching but the filmmakers must have had to walk a tight rope to get it done there and i would love to know more about that story. now days, oxford is a larger, more modern college town with all the ills that go along with such things and i hope to return again to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 plus years. juano hernandez should certainly have been nominated for an oscar that year but hollywood was still to bigoted itself to let that happen. other faulkner stories have been filmed so look for them and compare. one of the best was a pbs treatment of the barn burner from about 1985 or so starring tommy lee jones. it really captured the intensity of rural southern whites that faulkner wrote so incisively about so often.

genius or utter madness? that depends on your interpretation of this film. i responded to it on the level of a self-aware "cop-movie parody", and i sincerely hope that was the intention as i don't see anyone taking it seriously! :-d paul rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things! is this film supposed to mark a departure for rudd from his core background in the comedy genre? some kind of insane attempt to reinvent him as a hard-boiled action star? i think not! with the cheesy, almost awkward acting, low budget fx, and zany over-the-top action set pieces, it all kinda evoked that old tv show "sledge hammer" for me! hilarious!!! :-)of course, i may have totally interpreted the film wrong. if it was in fact an attempt at a 'straight' action movie, then it was certainly an amusing failure!!watch with lots of alcohol and some mates!!! ;-)

it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time. the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism. plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job! juano hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south. the crowd could really care less about the details--they are just hell-bent on a hanging. and, despite his commitment to the law, the one lawyer in town who has agreed to defend him also assumes he is guilty and doesn't really want to know the truth--just delay the hanging until they could try and convict him and then have a legal hanging! fortunately, a young white man (claude jarmin) begins to wonder about juano's innocence and begins seeking out the truth. at this point, the best character in this wonderful drama is introduced--played by elizabeth patterson (the old lady who later played mrs. trumbull on i love lucy). she single-handedly steals the show as the white person with not only a conscience but the will and determination to stand up for the black man. at one wonderful point in the film, a mob is trying to push past her to get to the prisoner to kill him, but she stands very firm and forces them to back down. there is a lot more to this rather complicated but intelligently written story, but i'll leave it to you to see it for yourself. see it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.by the way, apparently 1949 was a great year for hollywood finally addressing race prejudice head on, as twentieth-century fox also released "pinky"--an equally effective and strong film about racism, interracial marriage and even rape! see both films if you can.

no movie could ever do justice to faulkner's command of the english language. but they did a pretty good job here. lucas beauchamp is exactly the way i pictured him in the book, as is chick. what the movie couldn't really go into was how beauchamp wasn't liked by the negro people either, because he was equally as stubborn. not that it is a bad thing, but from my take on the book that was his attitude toward the world (yet, i got the feeling it was white society's racism that started it and it spilled over into negro society, until that became his attitude toward everyone).the best part of the movie is that you get to see yoknapatawpha county (actually, oxford, mississippi) exactly as faulkner wrote about it (the film was made when faulkner was alive and writing). it doesn't look that much different today. because of this alone, the movie is worth a watch considering it is filmed in faulkner's backyard. a true must see for faulkner fans.

this is easily the best cinematic version of william faulkner's fiction that i've ever seen, and i've seen several of the most prominent ones. filmed in faulkner's hometown of oxford, mississippi, it really captures the feeling of jefferson and yoknapatawpha county. intruder in the dust is not one of faulkner's best novel, but, even if it is a cliché to say this, it would be the crown jewel in any one else's career. it beats harper lee's good but simplistic to kill a mockingbird fifty feet into the ground (i read that one in ninth grade, and that's exactly where it belongs). two of faulkner's most prominent characters play major parts in the film, gavin stevens and lucas beauchamp. stevens is probably the single most common character in all of faulkner's fiction. he's a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator, because, unlike many of his other characters, stevens is a man of logic, not emotion (at least when he's older). lucas beauchamp may be the most prominent of all of faulkner's black characters (he plays a major part in one of faulkner's out-and-out masterpieces, go down, moses); unlike all of the other black folks in yoknapatawpha, he refuses to bow down to any white man. he has pride, and many in the white population find that an execrable quality in a black man. one day, lucas is found standing over a dead white man with a recently-fired pistol in his possession. most of jefferson and the surrounding areas don't see the need for a trial, and everyone's pretty sure that beauchamp will be lynched before the evening's over, or at least the next day, as the murder and arrest occurred on a sunday. beauchamp, on the other hand, declares his innocence and tries to get stevens to help him. stevens refuses; the case seems open and shut. but his young nephew, chick mallison, because lucas had helped him in the past, is willing to help him now.as far as i know, no hollywood film of this period deals with racism as overtly as this one. hollywood films rarely persecute the black population, but instead prefer to relegate them to servant roles. if you're an african american actor, you might as well give up and accept that role as either the mammy, the maid, the servant, or the porter, because that's the only way you'll work. in intruder in the dust, there is to be found one of the most memorable non-porter roles a black actor ever had, lucas beauchamp. and beauchamp, as i described above, is no stereotypical character, and might have been hard for audiences to accept. even today, black characters are usually simple, magical, and kind. the recent arthouse hit far from heaven is a great example of that. beauchamp is kind of a jerk, and he's very stubborn. although he's perhaps a little less so here than he is in the novel, he's not any kind of stereotype. he's a complex human being. juano hernandez plays beauchamp extraordinarily well. i haven't seen the film in a while, but he also appears in robert aldrich's 1955 film, kiss me deadly, as well as the cinematic adaptation of faulkner's final novel, the reivers.all the actors are great in the film. i should also praise quickly claude jarman jr., who has the great role of chick mallison. the novel takes place from his point of view, and he is the conventional hero of the picture. jarman is quite an actor; he captures the character (who also appears elsewhere in faulkner's fiction, narrating, for example, events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel the town) perfectly. he would appear in another great role the next year in the underrated john ford film rio grande. the only other film of clarence brown's that i've seen is national velvet, quite a different picture than intruder in the dust. his job here is exceptional; i really have to credit him with capturing faulkner perfectly. other famous faulkner adaptations are too melodramatic (the long hot summer, filmed in 1958, which i really like despite that) or too cold (tomorrow, filmed in 1972, which i do not like; that coldness is a complete misunderstanding of faulkner). the only other one that really does well according to its source material is douglas sirk's great 1958 filming of pylon (really a different sort of faulkner novel altogether), tarnished angels. 10/10.

an unjustly neglected classic, "intruder in the dust" is one of the great films of the 1940's which has unfortunately slipped into obscurity. based on a story by william faulker, and shot in his hometown of oxford, mississippi, "intruder" tells the story of lucas beauchamp (played with great dignity by juano hernandez), a black man unjustly accused of the murder of a local white man, and a white boy (claude jarman, jr.) who uses this situation as an opportunity to pay a previous debt to beauchamp. terrific acting, especially by two great character actors, porter hall (as the dead man's father) and elizabeth patterson (best known as mrs. trumbull on "i love lucy") as an old woman willing to stand against the townspeople to see that right is done. this straightforward, tense and sincere study of racial bigotry deserves to be seen more.

this is a 1972 disney movie. for the time, i was eleven years old and i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. feeling nostalgic, i purchased the three series dvd's of the dexter riley movies and even now, at age 46, i still enjoyed them. it was all about fantasy, magic, and clean fun. and it still is! i wasn't sure which of the three movies came first then second and last. so now i have the official dates. on december 31, 1969 the computer wore tennis shoes--on july 12, 1972 now you see him now you don't--on february 6, 1975 the strongest man in the world. i still think the middle movie was the best. the special effects were amazing back in 1972 to us kids. i definitely recommend it to all ages.

it may not be a 10 out of 10 but for me the jokes didn't fail. i've seen it many times when i was younger and again on dvd i believe, and i laughed each time.the humor is simple and fun,this film was just one of many small flicks disney was throwing out at the time. i found the parts where the people out of the invisible loop saw people invisible. there expressions were priceless great film, if the opportunity to ever see this arises i recommend seeing it for a good oh fashion laugh. my favorite character in all the dexter series would most definitely have to be dean higgins, i love his voice and hearing him get upset especially seeing his expression at the end was just pure hysterical for me.

this is classic disney at its live action cartoon best! bumbling college student dexter riley (kurt russell) develops a mysterious liquid invisibility formula that actually makes objects disappear and helps him to save his cash strapped college. further experimentation reveals that it works amazingly well on humans too! riley's startling discovery takes some hilarious new twists when a gang of crooks headed by the notorious a.j. arno (cesar romero) steal the formula and attempt to use it for their less-than-legal activities. dazzling special effects and a fast-paced story make this lively film a textbook case of college comedy! i love this movie! this movie has always filled me with a sense of wonder and joy.a pleasant little comedy that the entire family can enjoy. not much violence or sex and absolutely no swearing, makes this a movie that parents can watch with their children.merely one in a series of kurt russell movies set at medvale college. a pleasant little series set in a wholesome america before terrorists, when people valued integrity more than cash! i highly recommend this movie!

dexter (kurt russell) returns from the computer wore tennis shoes for a new adventure that can stand alone. dexter, ever the college student prone to misadventure, has an idea for a formula to render things invisible. dean higgins (joe flynn) is less than impressed and sets his hopes for winning a lucrative science prize with the pupil studying bees. however, the bees sting the student and he turns out to be allergic. there goes that chance for a prize. but, wait, dexter does it! he actually concocts a liquid that makes him invisible. trouble is, a unscrupulous businessman (cesar romero) learns about it and decides he can use that formula, thank you, for something illegal. can he manage to steal the bottle out from under dexter's nose? this is a companion movie to the tcwt but one need not have seen the first film to enjoy this one. russell is a genial leading screw-up who comes through when it really counts. the rest of the cast is also a dream, with flynn, romero, jim bacchus and others showing why their comic abilities are still held in high regard today. the script is just innocent fun that is charming, with the special effects somewhat simple, by today's standards, but effective nonetheless. if you want to sit down and relive a bygone era or just want to share a quality, g-rated film with your family, this is a great choice. although it is over 30 years old, there is a great possibility that even now you will see your loved ones giggle away the blues with a showing of this fine flick.

okay, i'll admit right up front that the inki cartoons made by loony tunes are pretty offensive and i can understand why warner brothers has pulled them off the market. seen today, the huge-lipped and very stereotypical inki is not politically correct. however, the cartoons were well-made and it's a shame they aren't released with some sort of explanatory prologue (such as the one with leonard maltin they included with some recent politically incorrect donald duck cartoons that were recently released on dvd). in other words, throwing out the cartoons completely is to forget our history. plus, inki, little black sambo and other racist cartoons are out there--especially on the internet.this inki cartoon has our little hero out hunting. at first, he's chasing a cute little caterpillar but later accidentally happens upon a lion--a lion that is more than happy to make inki his dinner. however, through all this, a weird minah appears again and again...and eventually you'll see why this bird is so important to the story.cute, well made and clever. i like the inki cartoons. plus, i take pleasure in showing them to extremely thin-skinned liberal friends just to watch them have apoplectic fits or even heart attacks. loads of fun, folks!

if a joke doesn't offend anybody, it isn't funny.the inki cartoons are offensive, no doubt about it. so is rap music. get over it. i suspect that any sane black person will find the inki cartoons hilarious, and that the people who are offended by them white people who still think black's need their patronizing protection against racist humor.seriously, the inki cartoons are funny. it saddens me that, not because anybody is really offended, but because somebody might, just might, be offended, i can't buy inki cartoons or the african queen or song of the south on dvd.

this movie is certainly worth a watch. it's full of action. it's also humorous. you'll laugh until your stomach hurts if you watch this movie. this movie also includes lots of hi-tech things hence the name gen-y. i recommend you to watch the prequel of this movie which is gen-x.

despite looking dated, "inki and the minah bird" is, my opinion, an enjoyable and charming cartoon. the artwork isn't extraordinary, but good enough. this cartoon has no dialogs, just sounds and music, but this combination works out pretty well. the cartoon itself is good, funny, old fashioned, creative, entertaining and amusing.this cartoon also makes the difference because it focus in just 3 characters: inki (the little black girl), the minah bird (a very strange bird) and a hungry lion that wants to have both inki and minah for breakfast - so he chases them both during most of the cartoon.i actually find that lion very handsome, hilarious and cool. i really like that lion. that poor lion is so silly and loser that you have to feel sorry for him. for me, the real enemy is the minah bird, not the lion. at one point, the lion almost eats it - too bad he doesn't get to gulp it, because it deserved to be eaten.back to this animated short, there isn't a single dull or boring moment. at least for me. the only bit that i find stupid is the ending because the bird has a major fight with the lion, steals his teeth and puts them on itself. other than that, i have nothing major to criticize about this, aside the fact that the steak should've definitely have gone for the lion and not the bird.in my opinion, this is a very forgotten and underrated little jewel that should definitely get more credit.

this 60min film shows just how much fun filmmaking can be. it's all in good fun as it plays-out a no holds barred comedy assault on the star trek genre. in "hick trek - the moovie", a group of good 'ol boys are on a mission to stop a group of renegade cats out to destroy the entire redneck federation.can captain jerk stop the villainous fluffy with the power of the r.s.s. bovine and it's cow ray?? she may have nine lives, but he has ten bullets! this cult classic (previously only seen at scifi conventions) is a party favorite. lots of funny moments!

hey, its great not to have to wait for the next star-trek convention to see hick-trek! its a cheesy film by a bunch of treckies with no budget, but a good way to spend an hour. they got most of the special effects right, the dialog is classic trek and it just feels right for a trek-knockoff.

now this is classic. a friend of mine told me about this flick, saying that it's incredibly lame, stupid, retarded, and moronic. he also said that i'd love it. to my surprise, i found it available from netflix and rented it at once. i'm just shocked that i had never heard of it before. if i could give it an eleven, i would.

hick trek is clearly a film that is envious of even an el mariachi-level budget ($7,000). still, the creators are able to pull off decent effects at times (often due to great editing) such as the beamings, the situations aboard the cat ship, and slim t. jerk's unique way of communicating with his ship without use of a traditional communication device.the acting does have its rough spots but the portrayal of "horns" mcboy is excellent and fluffy is certainly not too hard on the eyes.i do wish that the film had been longer than its approximate hour - and that should be seen as a compliment. this movie is a success due to the sincerity and hard work of those involved.

man, is it great just to see young and the restless star melody thomas scott as something other than flighty nikki newman! a doctor with a brain no less! and super nice to see her with the likes of the gorgeous lorenzo lamas instead of victor newman!mel plays a college professor of micro-biology who goes to the islands with her son for spring break, only to find herself a prisoner of the island infested with a rapidly spreading virus. handy for her there is the hunky character played by lorenzo, who has a daughter just her son's age.mel shines, as does lorenzo with a bit of the overacting from the younger couple. interesting premise in these times of chemical and biological terrorism talk. worthwhile seeing, especially for y&r fans.

i usually steer clear of film festivals and don't enjoy slap-stick comedy but i must say that this picture was great. i immediately recognized david krumholtz from the tv show "numbers" and lorraine bracco, roseanne arquette and karen black were at their usual best. this is comedy at an incredibly high level with visual, spoken and satirical interludes that kept the audience, and me, laughing throughout a rather deep rooted plot.kudos to mr. parness for dealing with a delicate, but real, subject in a manner that can be enjoyed but fully absorbed by his audience at every level of intellect. the plot stays intact throughout the film and the comedic relief adds to the message without being laid on so thick as to distort. the blending of segways is done beautifully and the overall product is wonderfully tasteful.i can definitely state that this film is one that will go a long way and should be seen by audiences of all ages; the problem is real and so is the powerful impact of this production.

this really is a great film. full of love and humor, it compels the audience to really care about the characters and participate in their journey. michael parness managed to assemble a great cast of top players, a minor miracle for a first film. no doubt, they were moved to help him tell this beautiful story. david krumoltz carries the film with his understated intensity and honesty. natasha lyonne is unpredictable, exasperating, and yet totally lovable as grace. also a great turn by karen black (great to see her on the screen again) as grace's crazed but sympathetic mother. there is cutting wit throughout, allowing us the relief of laughter when faced with life's pain. the acting is impeccable, the editing tight, the direction inspired, and the music creates a fitting backdrop of mood. given the present-day hollywood blockbuster craze, full of big budgets, big names, car crashes and special effects, 'max & grace' is a refreshing departure. give yourself a treat and see this movie.

i went it to see this film with caution. a suicidal "comedy" didn't seem consistent. having a brother who is has attempted suicide and seeing the devastation that has caused our whole family, i know first hand how crushing it can be to deal with this issue. i must say - this film deals with it in a way that allows the viewer "inside" someone who is suffering and simply doesn't know why, or how to stop it. while the film is not perfect, it respects the subject matter and more importantly makes it accessible for the masses. i know for our family, humor has helped us through a lot of the pain. and, max and grace is just what it portends to be - a suicidal comedy. it's funny - and, i also felt that characters were real and vibrant. it's also extremely intelligent, yet simple. it cuts to the chase and i appreciate that! i give it a 9 and will recommend it.

on a scale of 1-10 "suicidal sweetheart" got an 11 from me and from everyone else at this showing. the picture was incredibly funny. i told my wife "it's obvious that this man walks on water but across a bed of fire, that's a bit much." this is one of the very best blends of comedy, satire and uses of innuendo i have seen since mel brooks' "young frankenstein". i can't believe this picture was not picked up by a major studio.this "film festival" audience was sophisticated and was able to pick up on every comic innuendo either visual, spoken or implied. the characters are real and the combination of a great script and a great casting was obvious. max and grace are real people with real problems that are dealt with regardless of the odds of success. it keeps you smiling while being serious and laughing with all the indirect humor brilliantly built into this production.to sum it up, this is a "must see" picture.

this is a laurel & hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a bit too much on just one comical premise.the comical premise this movie mostly relies on is very simple; stan laurel not wearing any pants. laurel plays a scottish naive young person who arrives in america in full kilt. for some reason he gets the center of attention because of this and his uncle played by oliver hardy thinks because of this that its time to put some pants on philip.its humor is well executed but the main premise also gets a bit tiresome after a while. although the movie definitely still has its comical great moments, it at the same time is also far from the best of the many laurel & hardy comedy shorts that are still around. the movie is simply too simple to be considered one of the greatest, although it definitely is most fine executed all, for most part.great good clean fun, just nothing too remarkable or memorable all.7/10

not since "harold and maude" has suicide been so successfully used as the theme for a love story. the acting, by a top notch cast is terrific. with a well structured script, things progress at an enjoyable pace. there are moments of black comedy, but i would classify "my suicidal sweetheart" as a unique romantic comedy, with a touch of dark humor. the relationship between two psychologically challenged lovers, is both touching and engaging. the movie actually makes you question, what is a normal relationship? i highly recommend "my suicidal sweetheart". seek it out on dvd under the title "crazy for love". you will not be disappointed. - merk

who'd a thought suicide could be dealt with in a way that's palpable by everyone? i saw the film at sxsw at it's premier and it turned out to be the best film there by far. yes, its warped and it's bizarre, but it makes sense in the world the filmmaker (michael parness) creates. if you didn't laugh (most everyone did), then you just ain't getting it and thats a darn shame. particularly of note, guillermo diaz as hector steals a bunch of scenes and the chemistry between natasha lyonne and david krumholtz is intense. the film reminds one of harold and maude, but not really, it takes one bizarre spin after another, and they do all make sense in this crazy mixed up world we all live in. i stayed (as did most) for the q & a afterward and what was great was hearing that the same things i thought in my head as to why things "happened" are the reasons they did. i don't think you can say much bad about the film, unless you didn't get it. i think i got it and it seemed like most everyone else did as well. the film is dubbed a suicidal comedy, but its got a lot of heart, a lot of laughs and offers a lot of hope, yet it doesn't shy away from the horrors of suicide as well. a nice little movie that should get attention when it gets a release, which will hopefully happen sooner rather than later.

quirky, vulnerable, raw, honest and a treat to watch. i'm not here to give a summary or synopsis of the film. i simply wish to congratulate this small film with the great big heart. i tip my hat to the filmmaker and it's excellent cast. if you want to know what happens in the film...then go see it. michael parness, writer/director, has handled a very sensitive and emotional subject matter , suicide, with great compassion, comedy and empathy. i see a great career ahead for mr. parness. this film works. right from the outrageous opening sequence to the tender, honest moments between david krumholtz and natasha lyonne. as with every movie, we need to suspend some disbelief, yet i found with max and grace i was easily transported and completely convinced with it's "surreal moments". i only wish they would have pushed some of those moments even further. mr. parness has "pulled" some wonderful performances from this already talented cast. for instance guillermo díaz' performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical as well as moving. the colossus ralf moeller, former mr olympiad, as a terrified patient...perfect. i can go on and on...this independent feature has the star power of a big budget hollywood film however, you forget about the stars on screen as you flow along with this wonderfully written story. the real star here is the brilliant screenplay. i look forward to seeing more from writer/director michael parness.

many films attempt the ambitious. few succeed. this film is one of them.though billed as a black comedy, that term seems too limiting to express the true nature of the story behind max and grace. multi-hyphenate michael parness has managed to weave elements of absurdest comedy with incredibly real human emotion. quite a remarkable feat, to be certain.while the comedic aspects are certainly present, the heart of the film lies in its leads: david krumholtz and natasha lyonne. the delicate balance of the film - really crazy versus real love - falls to them and they achieve it, carrying it through from the opening scene to the heart wrenching climax and on to the heartwarming ending. david krumholtz, in the titular lead role and as narrator, anchors the picture and does an exceptional job. we see the world through max's eyes and krumholtz imbues them with a sort of wonder and hopefulness that one would not expect to be believable coming from a character who had previously attempted suicide. there should be no doubt from this point on that he has truly achieved leading man status, well deserved after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles. natasha lyonne might be something of a revelation for anyone who has seen her only in less challenging roles. the role of grace is expansive in scope, requiring her to show both great rage and great tenderness - sometimes within seconds of each other. she manages to convince us of grace's deep seated desperation that lies just beneath her alternating torpor and mania.this is not a laugh a minute type of comedy so don't see the film expecting strictly humor from start to finish. think more dramedy than comedy. there are some very dark moments, as one would expect given the subject matter of suicidal individuals, and some oddly real moments delivered most notably by emma adele galvin as max's sister, sis. the most humorous scenes are those populated by the myriad of name actors in supporting roles. while lorraine bracco and david paymer lend the most surreal aspect with their scenes the other supporting characters who populate the institution where max and grace meet are the real treat. guillermo diaz is a wanton scene stealer as the delightfully frenetic oddball, hector. ralf moeller, as bruno, acts as his straight man but has his own charm and appeal. rosanna arquette fully inhabits the role of vera with the crass vitriol of an embittered truck stop waitress. even her hardhearted character melts eventually, as does everyone who is touched by max's literally undying love for grace.can love conquer all might be the question behind the film and even though the realist within says no, movies are about an escape from reality, even if only for a few brief hours. i recommend seeing this film as an antidote to not just reality but to the cynicism that says that a love story like this never happens. spending a few hours immersed in a world where it can and does works wonders on the psyche.(seattle international film festival - june 2005)

this film was original in an unoriginal way. although many movies have tackled the subject of suicide and mental institutions, it was always about treating the patients and making them better because of the doctor's assistance, in this film, however, we follow a depressed guy who falls in love with a suicidal girl and will stop at nothing to make her happy even though she doesn't care for happiness at all, she just wants to die. this was a very interestingly cute romance comedy that in nothing less than enjoyable. this is a fun one to check out if you ever get the chance, you just have to be open minded about the material. overall i give it a 6.4, i just voted 9 to get the rating higher :)

i really loved this original screenplay and the different places it took me, emotionally, spiritually and just plain silly stuff. i didn't get caught up in "believability" in the screenplay or the actors and didn't even think about it until reading the reviews listed here in imdb for the movie. listening to michael parness talk at the q & a about his idea of the film, wanting to see how crazy people, or "f'ed" up people, as he put it, fall in love is really interesting. i identified with not having a story book romance and liked seeing dysfunction at it's best. i like watching david krumholtz in anything he does and have followed his career for a few years now. i believe this is some of his best work and say to anyone, just see this film to watch an amazing young actor. i agree that guillermo díaz really was a scene stealer, and what he did with his character is really a great acting lesson in commitment. i laughed and cried both in this movie and was disappointed that it didn't win any awards at the festival. i question why that didn't happen. i gave max and grace a ten because these interesting, unique, creative indie films deserve an audience. technically watching this film, it's really beautifully done  the colors are amazing, and lastly, it's one of the best soundtracks i have heard in a film in awhile.

saw this at newport beach film festival the other day. the film is really exceptional. the crowd i went with all loved it. funny, poignant and great acting. i'm tired of the tried and true hollywood romances, who can relate? david krumholtz (max) is really amazing as the sure and true lover of the ultra-screwy grace (natasha lyonne, who is also excellent). when max falls for grace we believe it. why? because love at first sight is crazy and we're dealing with two lost, and maybe not so crazy, souls. also of note are giullmo diaz as hector and rosanna arquette as a sexless/sexy neurotic, both "roommates" of max and grace before they embark on their trip to sheboygen, wi and finding themselves. don't miss this one, its something special! p.s. the soundtrack, led by kevin hearn (of bare naked ladies fame) is really super super cool as well.

peter lorre was born to play stephen danel with lines like: "mr. smith, you shouldn't hold my wife like that." and "i told you not to keep the monkey in the house!" the poster for this film is an eerie green and peter lorre leers in way that makes you never want to go to his penal colony / island. this film is not available on dvd although it is a classic and very rarely shown on tv. what exactly is the relationship between stephen danel and the monkey? why does the monkey upset him so much. we will never know. the film should be colorized by someone and excerpts should be made into a kinks video. the film was re-released in the 1950s and only a few of the peter lorre biographies spend any text on this film. casablanca was right around the corner. bogart could have been on that island but they surely did not have the budget for him

the story in this movie is fairly implausible b grade stuff, but the script called for a creepy guy to play the lead, and in 1940, that meant peter lorre. and peter is at his creepiest in this one as island owner stephen danel, who gets prisoners paroled to his custody to work at his island diamond mine. upon arrival the parolees discover that they are slave mine workers that can be beaten or killed at the whim of danel.only two things seem to have it worse off than the slaves; danel's wife, and monkeys. monkeys tick him off so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat the slaves get.lorre is perfect in his role here, and creeps up the screen in industrial-strength fashion. although the script is not casablanca caliber, the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes. this is a very watchable story, but i'm not sure what niche this movie filled. too long for a short subject, and too short for a feature length film, i'm not sure how this was marketed to theaters.i just caught this for the first time on a late night/early morning tcm showing. lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they haven't seen it.

peter lorre gives one of his most evil performances as the owner of the titled place. the plot has a new government agent being put on the track of peter lorre's character. when the g-man's contact his killed by one of lorre's agents, the g-man is sent to prison for the killing even though everyone knows there is more to the story. lorre has the man paroled into his care and brought to his island where he is mining diamonds. lorre wants to know what our hero knows, but he isn't talking and a battle of wills is set in motion.this is a good solid little thriller that doesn't quite make a great deal of sense plot wise, but even so the film holds your interest. i had put the film on last night in order to use it as something to drift off to, instead i found the tale riveting enough i was up an extra 70 minutes. lorre is the reason that one falls into this. his quite demeanor is unnerving. he does very little but its clear from his orders and the way everyone reacts to him (watch how they light his cigarettes) that he is a bad dude.worth a look if you should run across it.

this is one of l&h's shorts most frequently cited as the first "real" l&h teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features. j. piedmont mumblethunder (ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew philip, whom he's never seen. at first ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way he's behaving during his medical exam, but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow he's supposed to be greeting. he has been told that philip is a good boy, but he has one weakness--women. mumblethunder and philip set off to go home, but their journey there is continually interrupted by philip breaking into a little dance every time he sees a woman, then chasing after the woman. huge crowds gather each time this happens, not so much because he's chasing skirts, but because philip himself is also wearing a skirt (a kilt). finally mumblethunder manages to drag philip into a tailor's shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants, but philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts. there are lots of laughs all around. it's also nice to see a short like this because the boys aren't exactly the characters we know and love. ollie is pretty much his usual character, but it's such a joy to see stan acting so differently from his usual man-child character. it shows he wasn't a one-trick pony and excelled in other types of roles when he got the chance. with a run time of 19 minutes its short and sweet, providing classic one liners which still have me in stitches.

im usually wary of movies hovering around the 6/10 mark on imdb. id like to think people know what they are talking about and know what they like. i guess the trick with reviewing is to take an approach of "hey, if i liked types of movies like these- would i give it a higher score than i am about to give it now since i don't like these types of movies" then again people judge differently , basing more value on acting, or perhaps story or directing. anyway, landing the plane here- i had rented this movie out before and hadn't had time to watch it, this morning i did.wow! see this movie. i am personally interested in the paranormal/have read a bit about near death experiences, so automatically i was hooked. i am unsure about some of the comments here saying that a quality cast here was wasted - i disagree- the acting here was superb from all- i think this is the only time i didn't mind julia roberts, it was good to see 24's kiefer sutherland (currently at the time of this review, serving a jail sentence for dui), and kevin bacon sporting an interesting hair style.overall- i liked the direction, the atmosphere, the acting, and the story line most of all- particularly the idea of karma, and , to quote nelson wright "everything we does matters" so true.10/10!

very suspenseful, surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students flatlining themselves and then being resuscitated to share their experiences of death and what lies beyond. joel schumacher directs with some skill - creating some very eerie scenes as well as particularly beautiful ones. the visions of death are not what viewers might expect nor is that which awaits us all when we go - thanks to screenwriter peter filardi who really did an outstanding job coming up with this story. while the creativity of the story is impressive, the story has many holes as well, particularly in the logic department and believability factors. notwithstanding all of that flatliners is a good effective film because of the script, the direction which again is very surreal at times, and the acting which brings four very talented actors and william baldwin together. this core of actors acts and reacts off each other very nicely. keifer sutherland does a very impressive job as the head of the group - the one who comes up with the idea to die and be born again. he also manages to portray a man- a young man - with a damaging, destructive secret from his past. kevin bacon is fine as the most pragmatic and skeptical of the group. oliver platt is really good as the voice of reason and human fears. platt has some really good lines and plays the paranoia well. yes, julia roberts is here too and very good. the actors do best though by playing off each other and making us believe they are such good friends. i was duly impressed with much of flatliners but more than anything else the story affected me the most. the scene with that dog hobbling around the street just one of those powerful images evoked as were many of the "flashback" scenes.

the bevy of box office big league stars is phenomenal in this movie!! william baldwin, kiefer sutherland, kevin bacon and julia roberts!! this movie was made in one of my favorite years too, 1990!! i am a chicagoan, and the setting in chicago was very identifiable and artistically expedited as well!!i liked this movie, and the agitation which motivated the climax in this picture was a powerful element to the plot which was utterly sensational!!"flatliners" centers around a group of disgruntled pre-med students who want to be flat lined as a way of attaining some sort of societal vindication!! when life does not make sense, it would appear very illogical to get curious about apocalyptic nightmares!! at the same time, once their desultory curiosity has gotten the better of them, there is no turning back!! the king of the hill, (so to speak) is the one who vehemently shouts: i will do two minutes!! who else is going to do that!! anyone want to try for two and a half!! ultimately, all of these newly arrived and very unwelcome recriminations now have an extremely ubiquitous disposition in these re pro-bate's lives!! the consummation to their justified or unjustified pathos required a full 360 degree perspective on the issues they were agonizing over!! whatever purpose all of this reckless and academic chicanery serves, it is definitely an original approach for asserting your personality!! i liked this movie, 1990 was a good year for me too, things seemed to fall into place that year!! when i saw this movie some night in november during the year 1990, i was very glad that i did!!

flatliners left quite a noticeable impression in my head. the story is quick paced and leaves you constantly absorbed and at many times quite tense. its about five remarkable student doctors (notably julia roberts and kevin bacon) among whom, one of them has devised the mechanism of remaining dead (or getting flat-lined)for a few seconds and then coming back to life.the procedure is quite 'complex' involving a plethora of medical knick-knacks - injections, electric blankets, oxygen masks and a variety of esoteric medical terms. i strongly suspect doctors coined all these words so that they never need to get layed off. but funnily they follow the kiss (original version for engineers: keep it simple, stupid) (extended version for doctors: keep it stupid, simple) philosophy as well. at the risk of getting euthanized by some revenge-taking doctor reader, let me continue.so the first guy who gets flat-lined hopes to find the answers to life which philosophy and religion cannot convincingly answer. he hopes to get it answered (and become famous) through applied science. he flat-lines for around two minutes and then comes back into our world left quite shaken. during death, he has a vision of an incident, when he was young, which left the strongest impression on his life. he killed another boy when he was kid, by accident, and he still feels responsible for it.with the success of the first flat-liner, the others follow suit each of them extending their flat-line time further and further to test the limits of how long one can remain dead and experience life after death.meanwhile monsters from the past and future, keep coming back to haunt them after their flat-line experience. the first flat-liner is haunted by a young kid who tortures him when he is alone. the second who camera-ed all the women he took to bed, sees television sets all over playing his videos. the third is haunted by a young girl who he teased in school. the fourth is haunted by her suicide-dead father, for whom she feels responsible.all of them are driven insane by these haunting and obsessions and think that the past seems to want to take revenge on them. the main focus on getting flat-lined is that your entire life passes through your eyes, at the moment of 'dying', whatever stage that is, and you are left mostly with the strongest impressions of life in your mind. since they didn't die these strong impressions have somehow resurfaced and have become the focus of their lives.all of them somehow come to terms with (and extinguish) their past demons. all of them except the first one who realizes the only way he can move on through life is getting flat-lined again. during this flat-line session, he sees himself getting flat-lined the first time and also sees the boy he killed, trying to kill him this time round. the boy kills him this time for a few minutes and in doing so has sought revenge. for a few minutes in the movie one is left wondering if he gets to come back. thankfully (because most of us like happy endings) the boy absolves him of his past and he comes back to life again.

stan laurel regarded putting pants on philip as the first true' l&h film. the second hundred years was the first 'official' l&h film, but this was the one where stan completely resigned himself not only to performing (he had signed on with the hal roach studios as a director and 'gag-man', before certain situations - among them oliver hardy's accident with a leg of lamb leading to stan having to replace him; and the extra money that performing would provide for himself and his new wife, lois - brought about his historic return to performing, as well as writing, directing, editing and involvement in other areas of production), but also realised the fact that he was part of a team that worked well together. this, therefore, is an historic and very important film in the history of comedy.it is also a surprisingly funny little silent film; rather different from what laurel & hardy would become known for and from what they are more immediately associated with today. the characters of 'stan & ollie do not appear - scottish stan laurel plays the nephew of oliver hardy, a respectable man about town who is reluctant to be seen with this strange-looking fellow with a kilt and the habit of chasing pretty girls. there are some very funny moments in this well-made, charming little movie, and the performances of these two kings of comedy are spot-on - watch stan's little 'scissor-kick' and smile that says, "well waddaya know?" when he sees girls, or the hair-ruffling scene at the airport, for instance. hilarious.watch this film if you can, with backing music from the beau hunks orchestra (available on the vvl video releases) which enhances the 1920s feel and is very, very pleasant to listen to. it's a brilliant and underrated little film, which is why i said it was 'surprisingly' funny.

transcendental, sophisticated, incisive, emotive, powerful... i could think of a hundred adjectives to describe this fantastic work of art and intelligence, and still i would feel they were insufficient. all i can really say is that i am infatuated with this film. applause to krzysztof kieslowski, zbigniew preisner, irène jacob, and jean-louis trintignant. may "rouge" live forever.

what some hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed, creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons (without becoming unrealistic), manages this beautiful movie perfectly well (resembling in that way a little to the wonderful 'la double vie de veronique' of the same director and with the same beautiful actress). this is a real movie, that changes perspective of life a little bit - intelligent and beautiful story, masterfully directed, excellent main actors, masterful cinematography. i've just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time, and i still think it's one of the best i've ever seen. and if you should be unhappy with the ending of 'white' - 'red' puts an happy end to the whole trilogy.

a wonder. my favorite film. the most important film about relationships ever made. brilliant writing. magnificent directing. image systems and symbolism that leave you thinking about it all days, weeks, years later. wow. a truly great work of art.

this movie is not only about feelings and human emotions, it is also about everything that could be but it's not. poetry in movies can be awfully boring and annoying, but this movie is delightful to be watched. not to mention the amazing irène jacob, a great actress in france - one of the best, actually. when the movie ends, you can only feel sorry. after all, when something is truly great, we want more (well, for another great movie by k kieslowsky with irène jacob we can always watch la double vie de veronique)

"they both believed that a hidden sentiment has unified them. this certitude is beautiful,but the incertitude is more beautiful. they believed that they had never been met.nothing has happened between them.but those roads,those stairs,those corridors for all that time they could have been met." although it did not mean to be,it was a swan song.two young people,who are neighbors and have never been met,are found in the same places,the same times,doing most of the times the same things.they finally meet in the dramatic and very brilliant end that brings them together.meanwhile the woman has met an old man.their relation is brotherhood-like.he told her his life.it was like the young one's but with better prospectives.the young man can do whatever the old man has not lived.he can be happy with the woman. the ending is exceptional.there is a ship wreck.the only survivors are the heros of the "three colors".the man and the woman finally meet.the scene lasts a few seconds.the woman there looks like the photo she had taken for an ad in the beginning of the film;sad in a red fond."but every start is only the continue.the book of the life is opened in the middle."

irene jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of krzysztof kieslowski's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it succeeds in tying all three films together. i am simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to do one of these stories, let alone all three. everything seems to fit together so precisely, all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently executed, and the end result so much greater than the sum of the individual parts. trois couleurs is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements. simply brilliant!

most of kieslowski's films seem like puzzles to me, meant to expand mind and soul. the characters are not very believable, are idealized, are schematic. nevertheless, the way kieslowski presents their winding ways through life, their complicated interaction with others, with the universe, with chance or destiny, makes me understand faith, makes me (want to) believe in god. that at some point it all has a meaning, if not to me, then certainly to someone.trois couleurs and especially "rouge" comes closer to making me touch, feel, experience the "truth", the "meaning" than perhaps any other of his films. the only problem being the paths of the "puzzles" explored are a bit too similar to his other films and at some point they become somewhat predictable. there is still plenty of joy to be had here. it is like a familiar brand of wine - you know what to expect and it delivers, sometimes with a newly found bouquet which might come from aging - either the wine or yourself.

"rouge" is part of a trilogy, but very much stands on its own. it isn't a sequel of any sort. the very end, which i won't divulge, ties the three films together, but not seeing the other two doesn't make it too confusing. this film amazes me because it is so spare, so subtle and simple, but is as effective, emotionally and intellectually, as any big-budget spectacle or all-star melodrama. kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and destiny. both themes are loosely woven together in the story. the film is very much a puzzle, but the message is pretty straightforward: everything happens for a reason. love is in all of our destinies as long as we open ourselves to it. the title, "red" refers to the french flag, where red represents "fraternity," or brotherhood. the color dominates the visuals of the movie. i tend to think of it as representing love or passion, or the blood of life. it's great when a film allows the freedom to do that ;)

there's a spartan, unsentimental edge to this film that allows plenty of room for us to participate in the action without any stylistic encumbrance telling us how we're meant to be feeling; in 'blue', everything was overtly sad (sure, powerful as hell, but still); in 'white', it was delightful whimsy. but there are no such emotional clues, or cues for that matter, in this one. it's as if he finally let the force of the tale work its own magic without razzle-dazzle embelishment. i think that's what makes it the most initially enigmatic of the three, but finally, the most transcendent and redemptive. never has remorseless, unsparing honesty been quite so beautiful.

valentine "dogkiller" dussaut and joe "the judge" kern join forces to clean up the mean streets of geneva! thrill as they put the kibosh on international heroin smugglers, polish fugitives, peeping toms, philandering girlfriends, renegade dogs, and litterbugs who are too lazy to bin their recyclables. don't be fooled by the deceptive miramax ad campaign that paints it as a pretentious, art house flick. this movie is 100% action!

i use imdb very much. mainly reading comments of other people about movies i´ve or not seen. i´ve thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life, and the way i look a movie. i think i have seen it at least a dozen times since autumn 94, when i saw it in the theatre for the first time.i feel kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time. and i think this is his best one. it was his last one. i was very sad the day i knew he has died, because sure we lost the chance to get something more from him.red is just the best kieslowski + incredibile performance by trintignant & jacob + cinematography by sobocinski. if you haven´t seen it look for it!!! if you have, just come back to it!!red: just a masterpiece. please, forgive my poor english!, reader

a boy who adores maurice richard of the montreal canadiens receives, much to his horror, a toronto maple leafs sweater in the mail. i recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey, but nearly everyone knew about maurice richard and the toronto/montreal rivalry. highly entertaining, amusing, and accurate.

valentine, a model in france is separated from her lover who is abroad, they plan to meet up in england, but seem to be growing ever more distant as the film progresses. one night after declining a pass made by her coworker, she hits a dog named rita. the dog survives and she returns it to her owner, a hostile retired judge who's is living as a hermit and eavesdropper, listening in on the conversations of all his neighbours. she becomes intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him often, often becoming part of his eavesdropping games. one conversation the two listen in on is of extreme importance though, the conversation between a young soon to be judge and his wife, which we find out parallels the life of the man who is eavesdropping upon them. as we find out more about the couple, the man reveals more of his story, then continues his story, and we find out if the two men will continue towards the same fate. little does valentine know how her life, this encounter and the fate of the young judge will become entangled together. her hitting the dog that day seemed to be fate, a divine sacrifice by the dog for her owner, allowing valentine to be the saviour of the young judge, who is traveling the same path as her dear friend, to prevent him from having such a grim future, filled with loneliness and solitude. it seems the old man's dream will come true after all, and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his days.an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time! kieslowski never ceases to amaze me. he is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema. his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art. three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen. and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome. usually signified with a subtle pause, or late focus in a scene, see if you can spot some. i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her tv, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years. i couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy! i recommend this for everyone who loves film, movies, anything...a work of art! 10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.

and there are not many in cinema history. "rouge" seems to be a bit of a hope. hope in mankind and in life. but to say only that may be naive. kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of that embittered judge and the twentish but wise model. perhaps that old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated -there's the new couple with the young judge after the accident-. but what to say about this master of the camera? you can't miss a second of the movie because you have to watch every and each one of those faces. kieslowski loved human beings and that is quite evident in the way the camera treats the actors. ms. jacob and mr. tringtignant are perfect it's not only this movie but the downbeat "thou shall not kill" and "a story about love" that may you think about contemporary cinema as a way of expressing an artist's point of view. pity american public -the average one- could not see these films. at least they are not in the maltin's dictionary. and even the baseline does not know what to say about this unique man. abel posadas

it is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of kieslowski's trilogy, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite: view them in order, blue, white, and red, and consider them together as one complete work. it is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes: liberty, equality, fraternity, and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry. they are each well worth seeing independently, but i believe they are best seen as one work. collectively, i would rate the trilogy as a 9; separately, i place each in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994.the color red is most memorable in the third movie as a backdrop in a billboard ad, the profiled model of which is the central of the movie's three main characters. the other two characters do a double-take of a varying degree of recognition when they first come upon the ad, posted larger than life alongside a busy city intersection. this ad is not a major part of the plot of this movie, yet its image becomes striking and is one of the reasons i have called red a `mind-bending' film. this is the third of kieslowski's three colors trilogy, based on the blue-white-red of the french flag and the three parts of its motto, `liberty, equality, fraternity.' the films stay primarily focused on these themes, keeping with the basic levels of one, two, or three main characters, yet with each film the complexity of plot escalates as the three principles move from fundamentally personal (liberty, blue) to relational (equality, white) to social (fraternity, red). red is my favorite of these films, and i give it a 9. it stands by itself as a great film, but one should see blue and white first for the fullest effect.

the final part of kieslowski's trilogy based on the colors of the french flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematic image. in red, imagery is paramount, as well as the obvious but clever color coding. however, rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the 'cinema du look', kieslowski's red is a multi-layered, densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love. in red, love and fate are intertwined but complex notions, dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by. you sense red is really an allegory, a reenactment of prospero's omnipresent gestures in the tempest, yet it is more than its story appears. red demands countless viewings, and in each viewing something new is discovered that weaves itself into the already immaculately plotted structure.although red stands alone as a masterwork from kieslowski, it's best viewed as part of the trilogy. elements of blue and white are referenced in red, which knowing viewers will enjoy.

this film is not only the last piece of the three colours trilogy, but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s. there's hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being. valentine (irene jacob) lives in geneva, where she works as a model. though she has a boyfriend, she seems to be rather lonely. one night she has an accident and injures a dog and who leads her to his owner, a retired jugde (jean-louis trintignant), who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls. disgusted by him she cannot go away and they meet again. two lonely souls meet each other and they become friends and develop a deep love for each other. the story itself is too complex to be told completely, there is another connection between them in a young man who represents both the judge and valentines real love and there is more to their relationship than only friendship.the actors are wonderful, irene jacob and jean-louis trintignant developing a deep and authentic friendship. the topics are of an endless validity, fraternity, not only in contact with each other, but also in the respect for the right of privacy. alarmingly we seem to loose this right more and more, which makes movies like this one even more important than it might have been in 1994.red is one of the strongest colours that exists, representing inner turmoil, love, anger and passion. used here as another protagonist, it brings a unmatched depth to the movie. a masterpiece!

see three colors: blue and three colors: white. they are both wonderful films and will give an added dimension to the finale three colors: red. red is a fantastic film. it can be enjoyed in a single viewing, and indeed, the climax of the film is very powerful in that first viewing. but, watch it again. once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie, you will see new things with each viewing. with the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind. with each additional viewing, you find yourself discovering that it is, in fact, a work of genius. red is meant to symbolize fraternity in the french flag. the story turns the theme of fraternity around to be viewed at angles one would never suspect. the facets of fraternity shared by the different characters is as deep as you care to peer. if you are used to the blatant "symbolism" in most mass films, you may find red a bit slow. you may find yourself looking at a screen filled with intensity that you do not fathom... and yawning, wonder what all the excitement is about. this is not a mindless, vicarious experience. everything is not explained to you. you must think as you watch. you must see... not simply look. wonderful movie... one meant to be enjoyed by a wonderful moviegoer.

this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. he intended to retire after this film, so in a way it is his artistic testament. he died a couple of years after making the film, and though it is said that he intended to return to directing, destiny decided that this was indeed his last. and what a film!'rouge' the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film. set in geneva, one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge, and durenmatt immediately comes to mind. but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere, in the lack of communication of the characters, in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life. several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final, which only a great artist could have staged.little else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times. yes, the film starts slowly, and the fans of the american style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers. they deserve it. the film gets quality as it advances, and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters. cinema quality is very original, the image being a 'study in red', as the title shows. acting is fabulous, with irene jacob and jean-louis trintignant - the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age. a great film. seeing it again probably adds, and i am happy to have it recorded on tape. 9/10 on my personal scale.

i feel at a loss, so brilliant is this film. kieslowski is a writer, a philosopher; and while an excellent filmmaker, his greatness lies in his writing; and "red" is his paradigm. this film is a metafictional study of the artist's judgement in the creation of his fictional world; of how an artist can attempt to remake life -- even his own -- thru his art, even as he cannot escape the knowledge that, no matter how he involves himself in his story, it is still fiction and he is still outside of his remade world, still burdened with its unreality and the reality of the life he has tried to artistically remake. and magically, all of this is not to the smallest degree at the expense of a wonderful story about the mysteries of love and fate and the characters who live out this story, this pre-judged destiny. if i had to choose, i might nominate this the greatest film ever made.

it's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of three colors: red without letting people in on some of the ideas that krysztoff kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy. the more i see them and think of them, and imagine myself in their world, the more i get its theme: that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves, and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion. in blue, juliette binoche played a grieving widow whose plan to live her life without connections to the past had her meet someone unexpected. in white, an act of cruelty spawns an unlikely friendship between two men who will, against the odds, conspire to bring the perpetrator to justice and full circle. and now, in red, all the elements of fate and apparent coincidence apply themselves into the meeting of a young genevese model and a retired judge who has a habit of prying into other people's lives.this young girl is appropriately named: valentine (a luminous irene jacob), who has this radiance about her and even smiles openly while working the runway. not that she is without some baggage: she has a boyfriend, unseen, who also demands to know what she is doing at all times, she has a brother who troubles her, and she rejects the advances of a photographer who is working on her image for a huge billboard. she strikes a dog while driving and nurses her back to health, but when she takes her to the owner, a retired judge (jean louis trintingnant), he does not want her. "i want nothing," he coldly says, and elements of blue suddenly reveal themselves as this arrogant man, who also lives in anonymity and apparent, free-floating freedom, conducts surveillance on unsuspecting people. this male version of juliette binoche's character at first shocks valentine -- she states she can only feel pity for him as she walks away in horror, but a chance event has her back at his place, and here is when he begins revealing who he is, and his great loss.at the same time kieszlowski is unfolding a parallel story: the story of a young man, auguste (jean pierre lorit), about to become a judge and who lives right across the street from valentine -- but they keep missing each other. chance is the word. like valentine winning the jackpot at the grocery story she visits, elements of chance pepper her life and auguste's. he has a girlfriend who also supplies people with telephoned reports about the weather. one of them happens to be the old judge. he knows more about her than auguste does, and he's never met her. like god, or prospero, he is slowly creating a storm which will crack the walls of this present state of conformity and bring a new meaning to the expression "we meet again." it's this parallelism between the old and young judge that makes red so beautiful and transcendent, because time is, in reality, a lot more fluid than we would like to deem it. there are people whom we meet in life that if only we had been born in similar time frames, so many things would be different.such is the case with valentine and the old judge. i believe that there is definitely a strong fraternity of souls tying them together in a tight bond: she is that woman whom he did not meet -- by chance or not -- and is, whether he knows it or not, trying to make amends, hence why he goes to the great risk of revealing his surveillance and becoming the social outcast. but it doesn't end there. one of the many links between the three movies is the character of an old woman walking to a large garbage container. where julie did not see her (and would not have helped her anyhow), and karol fresh from his public humiliation sneers at her thinking, "someone is worse off than i am," valentine is the one who helps her. frailty in need can happen anywhere, and kieszlowski even applies it here in a minor character.now, red is so much more than a story. valentine, the old judge, auguste, even rita the dog: these aren't characters confined by storytelling. an american version would ruin the idea and commercialize chance encounters and even bring forth a dumbed-down ending. red is so devoid of a linear, defined plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the possibilities that this story could have veered off in so many directions had one crucial element not taken place at the exact moment and place.adding to the concept of characters who mirror each other despite time frames or location is the theme of sexual betrayal. this is also an important and character defining element in all of the three films: in blue, julie's husband had a mistress and she also betrays olivier when it's become clear she's emotionally dead. in white, dominique has karol listen to her moan over the phone (which becomes an important device in red) as she has sex with a man while the billboard of brigite bardot's contempt looks on. in red, the old judge's tale of love and betrayal gets re-enacted. and all this time, valentine's billboard image looms over them like a presage of what is to come at the same time that rita, the dog valentine's car struck, bears seven pups, life renewed for the six major players in this complex trilogy obviously filmed with care and love. why do i say six? you'll have to watch the movie and wonder.

brilliant aussie movie... a little slow at the beginning, but once it gets going you can't stop laughing. when i originally saw the movie i vaguely knew the plot line, as i am not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story, and more so in particular, the director and his mother (obviously names have been changed). i only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family. when i saw the movie, somehow my stepmum kept it secret that we were to meet matthew newton after the screening... such a nice gentleman (except for a particularly nasty incident with his ex)! brillian casting as well with sam neill and others! a great reason to keep supporting the australian film industry

this marvelous short will hit home with everyone who, as a child, specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool, only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your mom or dad (or both) that it didn't matter, as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a witness protection program in order to avoid ridicule. for those u.s. residents who don't get the horror because you don't follow hockey, it's like a dallas cowboy fan getting a washington redskins jersey or a yankees fan getting a red sox jersey. it isn't pretty. for our european friends, think of two great rival football (soccer to us) clubs and imagine a fan of one getting a jersey from the other. ouch!!! nfb of c outdid themselves here!une hommage du maurice "rocket" richard, merci, m. richard.

i saw this film purely by chance. it was shown very late, or more correctly very early one morning on television. i had woken up and was having trouble getting to sleep and this film came on.it deals with a subject covered many times elsewhere (it certainly isn't as good as educating rita, despite a couple of additional twists) and has a very predictable ending.despite its very obvious shortcomings i did enjoy the film and this was thanks to the acting of some of its players rather than the story or the piece as a whole.i am a big fan of sam neil and have seen him in many different films including: dead calm; the piano; sirens; children of the revolution; event horizon; bicentennial man and the ubiquitous jurassic park. he was very good but he could have played this part with his eyes shut.some of the acting was, in my opinion, dreadful rose byrne for example and some of the elusions were rather heavy handed (all the board woman in empty lives all dressed totally in white for example).however, two actors (who i hadn't, or don't remember, seen before) impressed me a lot sinéad cusackn as frances (frank) kennedy, and especially matthew newton as her son david. he, in particular, was very convincing and i would like to see a lot more of him.

a fantastic film featuring great aussie talent. director mark lamprell dealt with the potentially sob-inducing subject matter in a way which was humorous and refreshing. definitely the highlight of the 2000 brisbane international film festival. australian film veteran, sam neill was, as always, fabulous in the role of frank's uni professor and new talent matt newton gave a performance which will have people saying, " you know, bert newton, matt's dad!" get out and see this movie!!!

the australian public and the australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great aussie films around, or that they are all the same.well in this case this film is not a carbon copy of other australian films. it is unique - it will make you laugh out-loud, it will make you cry and it will make you feel really good about yourself.the casting of this film is superb and the acting is second to none. the script and the photography (colour/light etc) is wonderful. but more important this is a great film. i don't want to talk about the plot as i think it is always best to see a film knowing as little about it as possible. suffice to say this film will appeal to a wide range of audiences. take your girlfriend, take your mum, take your friends - for a great evening out.10/10!!!!

i can't see how a film of this quality only gets an average of 5.7 from imdb voters. it's a classic australian production that resembles recent efforts such as love and other catastrophes, the sugar factory, occasional coarse language, russian doll, sample people, the secret life of us, la spagnola, strange planet, fresh air, dust off the wings, doing time for patsy cline, etc..., as a 19-year-old uni student (newton, in perhaps his best role yet, on par with changi at least) with a bored, over-religious mother gets the shock of his life when she decides to enrol in the same course as him - and before you go thinking another goofy movie, it's not, there's some real substance here. sure, it's a simplistic view of life in general and arts students in particular (but then they are rather simplistic under all that philosophical mumbo-jumbo aren't they?), and maybe the study of sinead cusack's character is a little muddled at times, but the film is bright, funny, and has some important messages. the principle cast is terrific: cusack and newton are wonderful, and rose byrne (see her also in the goddess of 1967) is so underrated it's not funny. she's a beautiful, fresh, confident actor who deserves every accolade she receives. i gave my mother frank 8/10.

my mother frank begins as a warm, amiable comedy about a middle-aged catholic woman (frank, short for francis, played by sinead cusack) who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student in her son's university. most of her friends and family are horrified, not least her son (matthew newton), who is busy falling in love with his best mate's girlfriend (rose byrne). meanwhile frank has raised the ire of her disapproving english tutor (sam neill).matthew newton is utterly disarming as david; relaxed and natural in the role, even when the character's uptight. he generates valuable goodwill, steering the audience through some of the film's more awkward, broad comedy moments. not long after the half-way point, first-time writer-director mark lamprell expertly steers his film into darker emotional territory and gives cusack a real chance to shine.the supporting cast is full of familiar and welcome faces (lynette curran, sacha horler, nicholas bishop) and all the principals (including a more animated than usual sam neill) are excellent. while it meanders a little towards the end, my mother frank delivers more than it promises and is a genuine australian crowd-pleaser.

the japanese have probably the most sadistic movies around the world,and this is one of the strongest examples.with a running time at about an hour,it contains enough sexual violence and gore to disgust every single sane person on earth(even those who are hunting this type of movies).three men and a woman are making a porn film.after some normally shots(which are pixelated),the girl is tied up,and the madmen cut her food,arm and tong.after that,they make a hole in her abdomen and a man has sexual intercourse with her intestines.he is knocked unconscious too and has his penis cut off.the special effects are good for an obviously low budget production(only the tong cut scene looks fake),and we can't talk about acting,direction or screenplay.after hearing a lot about this film,i was very happy when i finally found it.the first part is pretty boring,but the second one totally f***k up my mind,the torture and killing scenes being some of the most extreme and disturbing i have ever seen.the gore hounds will be satisfied by "tumbling doll of flesh",but an unknowing viewer shouldn't even read the synopsis.

tumbling doll of flesh (aka niku daruma and psycho: the snuff reels) this was on my want list for quite a while, and then i finally scored a copy on ebay a while back. it's never been on dvd, and what i got from ebay was a very good quality dvd-r, which i'm quite satisfied with. the movie is i believe the most extreme example of torture porn, with an emphasis on porn. a woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed. the porn is definitely real, with the annoying japanese pixelation to try and hide the hardcore shots, without much success most of the time. after the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave, she gets clubbed over the head with a baseball bat, and taken back to the room and savagely dismembered in slow shots, and in one of the most disgusting scenes, the male porn guy screws her in an open wound in her chest. this is after both legs have been severed, her arm, and a few other niceities. this movie outdoes the guinea pig series by a long shot, in fact, they are not even close to the realism, although cheap gore effects, shown in this movie. this is indeed one of the best fake snuff films i have ever seen, if not the best. now i must warn you, that if you are not into this stuff, you should stay far far away. this movie is very strong, and with the real sex, it is in a very sick way, erotic to an extent. and i mean, in a very sick way. but wherever you come down on this subject material, this movie brings the goods home, and i would definitely recommend you seek it out. after reading about the movie, i was expecting something very strong, but it exceeded that by a bunch.

first of all , you should watch this only if you don't mind the lack of subtitles , pornography , kinky sex and utter , horrifying and truly shocking depravity . i mentioned kinky sex , but to call sex in the second half of the movie " kinky " would be a great understatement . it's more like a punch in the face if you aren't prepared for this sort of sickness . that being said , i can go back to reviewing this morbid piece of pseudo - snuff genre brought to us by our fellow japanese .the plot seems to be fairly basic , almost nonexistent : a girl is hired to perform in amateur porn movie . don't expect much in first 30 - 40 minutes . there is some dialog - if you don't speak japanese it's not going to mean much to you - that seems to be an occasional chatting between the girl and the crew & performer , then there is some porn ( straight sex ) , and after the scene is finished the performers and the crew take a break . and then ... it starts to happen .it seems that the girl is talked into performing one more scene - this time tied with the rope . the abuse begins : whipping , slapping , hot wax ... in the end , girl breaks down and cries . they untie her .then we see performers and crew sitting at the table as if nothing had happened - except for the girl . she is visibly shaken and looks like she wants to leave . she walks to the door , sits on the floor to put her shoes on ... and that's when hell breaks loose .she is hit in the head with the baseball bat , her wound is treated , she is tied to the bed . what ensues can be briefly described ( i'm not going to spoil everything for you ) as rape during dismemberment . think of " flower of flesh and blood " , mix it with porn and you will get the idea .it goes on for about 20 minutes or so . sfx are very good , makeup too . everything is shown , with no mercy for the viewer . you have been warned .i thought " visitor q " was a very sick movie . after watching " niku daruma " it looked like a fairytale to me .this movie is so sick , so depraved , so twisted , so disgusting that the harshest words pale in comparison to it's finale . too bad it's released only on vhs so there are no subtitles available . but the movie still works without them . so , if you are into ultra sickness , extreme sadism and other beauties of this beloved genre , check this out . i hope you won't have nightmares .8/10 .

if you were enjoyed by watching "guinea pig" - then you'll like this movie to! "psycho: the snuff reels" is a nice pseudo snuff movie with lots of sex elements. actually the effects are not so realistic like in "guinea pig", but its still pretty gory."psycho: the snuff reels" contains 70 minutes of sex, fetish and then torture scenes. first 20 minutes is like a normal porno movie. after that you'll see fetish sex scenes. and last one is a torture scene. the guys torture and rape girl - they cut off her legs, hand, tongue... in the end guy rapes girl in her stomach (!) and after that other guy beat him and cut off his balls. sounds pretty sick, isn't it?:) like i said - it's pseudo snuff movie. "psycho: the snuff reels" is pretty rare japanese movie and as i know it's really hard to find it. but if you are crazy about that sort of films i believe that you can find it!

"tumbling doll of flesh" by tamakichi anaru is a japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse,torture and dismember a young woman whilst filming their horrible actions.typically twisted japanese porno sickie that offers plenty of sadistic sexual violence and grisly gore.there is no plot to speak of,just plenty of hard core sex scenes(optically censored again)and lots of blood.the special effects are quite impressive-the dismemberment of japanese porn actress is shown in unflinching detail.the tongue cutting scene really made me squirm.her arm is also chopped off and her stomach is graphically sliced open and finally one of the sickos is having sex with her intestines."psycho:the snuff reels" actually reminds me "guinea pig:flowers of flesh and blood",but it's not as memorable.so if you're a fan of ultra-depraved japanese sickies like "all women are whores" or "raping my virgin slave" give this one a look.8 out of 10.

animated shorts just don't get much better than this wonderful canadian film. this short feature is dripping with canadian references, and so, this film will probably be appreciated by canadians most of all. but the basic story is universal, and it is told lovingly by writer roch carrier. it is a hilarious story that i have known for quite sometime, and i was recently fortunate enough to see it again, so i simply had to write a hearty recommendation for it. this is a masterpiece, and a must-see whether or not you are canadian.

the word ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli-danda (a precursor to cricket) in india. the use of the word as nickname for the principal character is stylish, as it signifies one who is sharp, fast and can hurt badly when rubbed in the wrong way.ghilli is one of the best movies for vijay and in it is unrivaled in its pace and action. the movie never slacks for a moment, and keep you always with some exciting action. the movie is set in madurai and chennai and its story core is simple. a rich landlord tries to covet a beautiful girl in his town, and his unquestionable power and authority, prevents the girl from seeking a justice. the hero tries to rescue her and the majority of this movie portrays the week in which all this action happens.a very exciting movie and though the story is nothing new, the director and the actors receive praise for the full-paced action.

if u haven't seen vijay in "ghillli", "gilly" or "ghillie". go watch it. wow. its devastatingly hilarious. i don't know if dharani (the brilliant director) was being serious or not. there are tons of hot guys in this one, look out for someone who calls velu "maacha". the one with the brilliant braids, devastatingly hot. his teeth are brilliant as well. vijay rocks. trisha cries every 5 seconds. it is very deep. watch it, you won't regret it. there are some great laughs in this one. if you don't speak tamil, learn it. then you will get all the inside jokes. it is one for the whole family, except maybe the violent bits should be skipped. i've seen this movie around eleven times .... and counting.wow!

ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in his career.... as i had not seen the telegu movie so i could enjoy this movie even more.the story is about a girl wanting to escape the clutches of a local goon who wants to forcibly marry her. since he is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine. vijay who had come to play a kabaddi match there sees this and decides to help her. the rest of the movie is how vijay helps her & how the girl ultimately escapes the clutches of the goon & the goon's father's political cronies. the movie has lot of the edge of the seat thriller moments and will keep the viewer engaged till the end. vijay is as usual very good in role of the kabaddi player. trisha,ashish vidyarthi,the bunch of vijay friends all have done their job competently. a special mention has to be made about the villain of the movie prakashraj.the villain's character has been properly etched out and prakashraj has portrayed it very well. surprisingly, for the first time, i felt sympathy for the villain in the end. the dialogue "hi chellam" has really caught on with the masses. the music by vidyasagar is brilliant and the song 'apadi podu' is a rage all over..dharani has to be credited with such a nice masala movie which will be enjoyed by not just die hard vijay fans but also by the general tamil movie audience all over the world.

brilliant screenplay..the screenplay is very tight ..that u will be gelled in seat..this movie is an example for movie can survive only with screenplay and no-story needed..story is very simple that u can write in one line. but screenplay was amazing..brilliant performance by vijay and prakashraj..though plot is similar to okkadu.. director adapted only the plot. tamil version is much fast paced than telugu.movie travels straight without any chance of deviation, though u can understand each and every characters back-drop.keep going

ghillie a remake of the telugu "okkadu' is thankfully a clarified version of the original. it packs the same punch and dharani true to his cinematic brilliance delivers it with style and panache. a flagging vijay's career with the entry of the likes of surya and vikram on the fray, got the much needed uplift with this movie. this might well prove to be the best movie vijay has ever been on, considering the choices he has been making since then. the hard-working actor seems to have lost his bearing what with talented new entrants being accepted both by the industry and public alike.the tightly snug script, which runs at, a neck-break speed revolves around velu, a willful youngster aspiring to make a mark in the game of kabaddi( a popular game among boys in india). the events following the chance encounter with muthupandi, his rescue of the girl in distress and how he juggles with the aspirations of his friends and his own forms the fulcrum and end of the movie. vijay fits as a 't' into the role and essays a subdued and believable portrayal of the boy next door.trisha has more than a stereotyped tamil heroine mantle to play. the role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble. with limited dialog's, trisha exploits her occasional muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role. this is a classic case of a cover page girl coming-of-age to become a professional actress. trisha became my personal favorite after this movie.the movie ends on predictable lines, although one has to credit the director for keeping the audience guessing on many things including trisha's change in decision to leave the country. prakash raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counter-weight for vijay's role. his almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent chinks in the hero's armor form a perfect ploy for keeping the audience guessing.overall this is a great movie that deserves at least a single viewing. i give it a clear 8 out of 10.

having been raised in canada, i saw this short many times mostly on the cbc. i have seen it numerous times, at many ages in my life, and each time the reactions are the same. it is a joyous bittersweet, beautifully animated film that tugs at your heart. i am sure i have it on some vhs tape somewhere digging around.every kid growing up can relate to the situation, and wanting to fit in with your favourite idols. the scene and look on the kids face when his mom is filling out the eatons catalogue and his jumping around the room is priceless. i haven't seen someone capture that carefree mood of youth on film as well as this little short has.sure i am a montreal habs fan, and that makes my appreciation for it more special. but in the end it is the nostalgic look and feel of pond hockey, and the memories of your family telling you that you should be greatful for what you get even if it isn't exactly what you wanted. and oh yeah, the animation is beautiful too ;)rating 10 out of 10

i know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious; it's not like american pie or something. i know not why people are offended by the universal plugs; since it's part of the plot, the advertising is excusable.this is a funny movie with good dialogue, good subtle wit, a good story, a good moral (that thankfully doesn't get too sappy), great acting, and a cheesy ending.(minor spoiler) the basic premise here is the classic story of a shepherd boy (muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when the wolf (giamatti) comes along. so he gets his best friend kaylee (bynes) and they go and drive the wolf crazy.frankie muniz can be annoying in other roles, but not as jason shepherd. he handles the suave confidence of his character perfectly well, and what appears to be a lack of expression at first glance is really a perfectly executed nonchalantness.amanda bynes. what more can i say? the girl's got the gift. she's funny, talented, versatile, and very, very attractive. (i'm only 6 months older than her. i need to get to california sometime soon.) in fact, the 'best-friend' part was originally a boy, but became a girl as soon as the makers saw amanda's interest. which works out pretty well, since the part would've been pretty dull without the blessing of bynes's abilities.paul giamatti is a very talented man. while some would play marty wolf as evil and diabolical, giamatti made him-not just a jerk, mind you, but a likeable jerk, a jerk that livens up the screen, rather than intentionally dimming it. and i doubt many other actors could pull off the psychological breakdown that wolf undergoes as well.all in all, great movie. loved seeing jaleel white able to mock himself. loved seeing all the little references & such built into the film. (one of the guests in the party scene is the director, shawn levy, another is bynes's former co-star kenan thompson) loved seeing amanda in those outfits........ get the dvd if you can. it's got all kinds of great extra stuff, and the lovely ms. bynes is your guide through the menus. :)

who said it had to be believable? do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film. you'll enjoy the experience much more. you'll find yourself forgiving some of the movie's more outlandish plot set-ups, and simply accepting it for what it is--a great family film. i appreciated not having to be concerned about "questionable elements" in a children's film for once. that, to me, is worth the price of the ticket. and it manages to maintain its wholesomeness without being obvious about it--older chidlren will enjoy this film. enough good humor to keep adults interested. very good film.

fun movie! great for the kids - they found it very entertaining. somewhat predictable, but there are a few surprises. great movie to watch if you're looking for something just to entertain (don't expect to be seeing a classic!)

with all of the "r" movies out today, it's hard to find something you can take the whole family to see. my kids loved it. it was good clean fun. i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to take the whole family out for a nice evening at the movies.

i wasn't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script.. who then he travels to hollywood to get even.. but.. hey.. it's still a fun film. frankie muniz of "malcom in the middle" fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and amanda bynes as his friend is also very good. yea the film does work as an advertisement for universal studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film.. but i enjoyed it anyways. grade: b-

spoiler alert!!!! this was my son's review of the movie, which he wanted me to post.he wrote this, i swear.with malcolm in the middle's frankie muniz, and nickelodeon's amanda bynes, they get to go to show business. they team up on the actor paul giamatti. he stole jason shepherd's essay on big fat liar, and makes it in to a movie. jason (frankie muniz) and kaylee (amanda bynes) have to go to l.a. to get it back. jason's dad does not believe that he wrote that essay. so every time they see each other jason asks wolf (paul giamatti) to give jason's dad a call because he wants his essay back!!!! wolf does not make the movie but the president of the company makes it. at the end the family and kaylee see the movie, made by wolf pictures and based on a real story written by jason shepherd.

after seeing big fat liar, i think jason learned a lot more. when he told the truth about marty stealing his story, it was like the boy who cried wolf. people heard him, but they didn't believe him. nobody did anything to help him. besides, not only marty's movies stink, so does his advice. the truth is not overrated. i am so glad he got exposed for what he really is. everyone found out that he stole from that boy, including his parents. not only he stole from that boy and lied about it, he gave them someone else's work and tried to call it his own, which is plagiarism. doesn't he know that it is illegal to plagiarize someone's idea? another reason why he got fired. he is not trustworthy. he's a liar, a cheat, a thief, a crook, and a plagiarist. you got that marty? you're a plagiarist. plus, you got everything that you deserved.

big fat liar is a pretty funny movie. but as i was watching it, i thought about something. some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable. so really, the film is kind of a big fat lie. there is no way that he could've gotten away with all of this. here are all of the unbelievable stuff.1. when he fakes his father had choked on a meatball, and acts like he is the father. jason(frankie munez) couldn't have gotten away with that. well, luckily for us, he didn't. so it didn't stick with it, the outrageous.2.even if the grandmother was blind, she still could've figured out that that wasn't her granddaughter. 3.they couldn't have gotten on the plane, flown to l.a., acted like they were coat salesmen, sneak into the studio, and then, and then... well, some of the film is a little unbelievable. but it doesn't hurt to tell a little white lie. trust me, i do it all the time.big fat liar, though unbelievable at times, is fun. it's also very funny. but let me just say one thing before i continue this review. if paul giamatti wasn't in this movie, it would really suck. it would be horrible. big fat liar is also pretty funny, though corny at times. i give it a thumbs up.big fat liar:***/****

big fat liar is a great watch for kids of all ages, even adults. i had a great time watching this movie and recommend this to kids of 10 years and under. the laughs never end and the adventurous plot is pretty good too! frankie muniz is funny and marty wolfe is hilarious! overall, a nicely made film for kids to enjoy and just have a great time.

big fat liar, in my opinion, is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it. when jason (frankie muniz - "malcolm in the middle") and kaylee (amanda bynes - "all that") played those tricks on marty (paul giamatti - doctor dolittle), i really smiled and felt good. that's what i liked most about this movie. as a matter of fact, everything that happened after jason's essay erroneously ended up in marty's hands was hilarious. i especially loved jaleel white's cameo. when i first saw him, i couldn't be certain, but, when i asked my mother if it was him, she said, "of course!" before i wrap this up, i'd like to say, "like i said earlier, there is a moral to this story, and that moral is, always tell the truth." now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of frankie muniz, amanda bynes, or paul giamatti, i highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it.

well, i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated short. he loves it and claimed it was hilarious. i enjoyed it but didn't see any humor. he doesn't even like hockey or know anything about it, and still loved the story. living right across the border from canada, i have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in buffalo....but i didn't think much of this cartoon. oh, it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec area - disaster! that especially holds true in the glory years of les canadians. however, that doesn't make the story funny. back in the 1950s, everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal canadians and their star player, maurice richard, and everyone wanted to be like him. when his mother orders a new sweater, it has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it, so the kid doesn't want to be caught dead wearing it.. when he finally does and heads to the local rink, he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies. what's so funny about that? i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox die-hard and his mom gets him yankees shirt! horrors! you couldn't wear it, and vice-versa.maybe to someone who doesn't follow sports at all, like maltin, this situation seems odd and humorous to him...but it's a fact of life or any bit-time sports fan and his favorite team. it was an interesting story, and totally believable, but nothing that made me laugh.the art was fun to look at throughout, almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid. the french canadian accent was good, too. this movie was part of the dvd "leonard maltin's animation favorites from the national film board of canada.

spoiler warningwe've all heard the "boy who cried wolf" legend. but what if the wolf was a person in the modern world. well it might be something like big fat liar. fourteen-year-old jason sheperd ( frankie muniz from "malcolm in the middle" ) is always lying to keep himself out of trouble. one day he is pressured to write an english essay, but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film-maker marty wolf ( paul giamatti ) who plans to turn jason's story into a hollywood blockbuster. no one believes jason when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school. however jason is determined to prove to his parents the truth and travels to l.a. with his friend kaylee ( amanda bynes ). when wolf refuses to admit he ripped off his story, jason plans to make wolf's life a living hell. b.f.l. is no masterpiece but it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes of you're time. i wished they could've made it a bit longer though and there aren't that much pranks although they are clever enough ( i like the pool-dye the best ). i might not have liked this as much as i do if it weren't for paul giamatti. he is simply hilarious in this. if you have 90 minutes to kill try this out. you might just enjoy it.

i love this movie. yes, the main character lies, but that's why it's called "big fat liar". even though this kid runs away to hollywood, it doesn't give kids the idea that they can. besides, he doesn't just do it for fun or to get away from anything, he does it to regain trust. i don't think it was just one big ad for universal studios, because i liked how it gave an inside view of what it's like for kids who don't know how cool movie-making is. it has good music and fun characters. this family/comedy is totally fun for kids and parents alike. it has humour, excitement, and real life difficulties like lying.in the end, "big fat liar" sends out a moral: don't expect lying to be easy.

this isn't a life-changing movie; it's not an epic, or anything like that. but it's entertaining, and it's fun. it's a film that the whole family can watch together, and at the moment there are precious few kid-suitable films that don't have a love story in them! it tells a good story in a lighthearted way without trying to dazzle the audience with over-the-top special effects, like lots of films these days are. it's got some fairly good acting in, and all the music that's been used fits in pretty well with the movie content. the acting is quite good too, the actors look comfortable and believable in their surroundings and most importantly the jokes are actually funny. i'd recommend it for people of all ages - it certainly made me laugh. :)

this is one of the funniest movies i've ever saw. a 14-year old boy jason shepherd wrote an english paper called "big fat liar". when his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to the college on time and he hit a limo. when he went into the limo, he met a famous producer from hollywood, marty wolf. when he left the limo, he forgot one thing: his paper! so marty wolf took it and he turned jason's english paper into a movie! when jason admitted that he left his paper in the limo and marty took it, his parents and his english teacher didn't believe him! so jason and his friend kaylee had to fly to los angeles to go to hollywood to make marty admit he stole his story to jason's parents. when jason told marty to call his dad that marty stole that paper, marty tricked him and burned his paper! jason got so angry that marty burned that paper so marty called security to get jason out of his site! jason and kaylee realized marty isn't going to admit the truth. in order to take marty down in phase 2: the takedown, jason and kaylee put permanent blue dye into the pool and when marty jumps in, his body turns all blue and it wouldn't come off! then they put permanent orange dye in marty's shampoo and when he uses it, his hair turns all orange and it wouldn't come off too! finally, they put lots of glue on marty's earpiece to make him call jason's father and when marty uses it, it sticks to his ear! it was funny when marty's hair and body turns all blue and orange and his headset is glued to his ear! after that, they tricked marty by telling monty, who is marty's assistant, that duncan moved to a house where there's a party going on. when marty went in to see duncan, he was at the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him up! when marty was in the house, jason and kaylee switched the controls of his car. when marty drove his car, he knew all the controls were switched and he didn't know which button to push. he's stupid enough to fall for it. when marty hit the rear end of the masher, the masher wrecked his car! it was so funny. so marty starts to call jason's dad and tricked him again! he was on the phone, but it wasn't his father, he called security! after the security got jason and kaylee out of marty's site, they suggested them to go home. monty was going to be on jason and kaylee's side cause she knew that marty was a liar and a jerk so she told rocco, who is one of the security guards that she will take care of the kids. jason told his father the truth of what he's been up to for the past 2 days and had his parents come to l.a. when monty came to the kids, she's going to help the kids move into phase 4: the payback. jason splits the crew into 3 teams for phase 4. one team will distract and trick marty until jason's parents get to the set. marty first rode with frank jackson, but his car broke down so he rode with jaleel, but he took him into the desert and leave him there. when marty was in the desert, a helicopter came to rescue him. after that, one of the blades are jammed so marty and the pilot got off the helicopter. after that, he was on the way to the set and when jason saw him, marty stopped and saw what jason has: his monkey! so marty went after jason and kaylee and when they saw lester, he released the water and when the water came, it pushed marty away. marty was still after the kids and when kaylee went the other way, jason led marty to the top of the apartment building. at the top, jason was challenging marty by making him admit the truth and marty will never ever tell the truth. when the crew caught marty in surprise, all the people including jason's parents who were at the set knew what marty did. marty was going to kill jason but the only way for jason to escape is jump down from the top! after that, his parents believed him that marty took his story. when the people who were on the set left, this is the end of marty. at the end, jason's story, big fat liar was a movie. i cant get enough of it.

i could watch this movie all day! i love it. probably my all time favorite movies. but, by the way, "badger1970" there are a few parts with bad language, not too bad, but it's not exactly g rated. great movie!!!!! i recommend it to everybody. any way, it's making me type 10 lines of text, so i am going to keep typing until it will let me post this comment. okay... still typing... this is getting annoying. ugh. i still have four more to go. anyway, watch this movie! even if you have already seen it. i don't care! has it been 10 lines yet? nope. only 2 more lines left. i don't even know why it wants me to do this. i think i am done. wait a minute, i'm not done, sorry, people. i know it's torture listening to me. well, i suppose that you don't have to read this comment... but you should, because i wrote it. i am probably done now. finally, bye.

much better than expected. good family flick - catch it on reruns. the whole is more than the sum of its parts. paul giamatti chews up the scenery - he has way more talent then the role deserves. a treat to watch inspector uhl from "the illusionist" go over the top. the blue man scenes had my 11 year old in stitches. the cameos were particular fun for the parents - nice to see lee majors and urkel (umm, jaleel) again. it's going to be tough to think up 10 lines for this film , but let's hear it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and their parents! amanda bynes does a fine job when she gets to be part of the sting. i normally can't stand frankie muniz but he is just fine here. hats off to the casting director - if only for hiring giamatti!

i found this movie to be educational, entertaining and very moving. i was impressed when i learned of just how much justice arbour had contributed in during her time in kosovo.wendy crewson is highly under rated and it is good to see her again in a canadian production. other easily recognizable stars are leslie hope (24) and john corbett (sex in the city.)while the story line of this movie may not be completely factual it did leave me with the desire to learn more about the word of arbour. a great movie for inspiring young women.i say the movie is a "must see."

hunt for justice is about the setup of slobadon milosevic for his trial in the hague. while it was a little too clinical in presentation the subject matter could have gotten very depressing very quickly. a canadian judge, louise arbour, becomes the chief war crimes prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the un in yugoslavia. she battles everyone to pull out the evidence that sent milosevic to trial. not a bad docu-drama with class a directing and production work. the 'evidence' was disturbing by the shear discussion of the facts, happily they didn't go into too much detail and no real pictures of the tortured.

hunt for justice is a canadian television drama that has made it to dvd and that is reason for gratitude for those who hunger for educational dramas that inform us about facts of current history that somehow get buried in the media. the film is not a hollywood production, it relies heavily on footage from court files, but it also introduces to many of us the act of heroism of louise arbour in bringing about the trial of yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic.louise arbour (veteran canadian actor wendy crewson) is a canadian judge appointed by nato as the chief war crimes prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal in the hague. the film begins in 1996 when arbour travels to the hague to face the political obstacles that are preventing the tribunal to bringing to justice the war criminals in the war yugoslavia has been waging in serbia, croatia, and bosnia, a war that has gross evidence of crimes against humanity in the form of genocide, extermination camps, and other heinous abuses. the progress toward bringing the criminals to justice is hampered by generals (including one played by william hurt) who fear a major world war if precautions against same are infringed upon. arbour, with the keen help of her translator pasko odsak (stipe erceg), her staff including keller (heino ferch) and the unexpected assistance from british capt. john tanner (john corbett), forges ahead, focusing the impossible task of bringing all responsible parties to justice on three specific events. two of the three top suspects are captured but during their trials each meets his end. this leaves only slobodan milosevic himself, and arbour and her colleagues are successful in bringing the war criminal to justice in 1999.there are several touching side plots employed in the telling of this well-documented tale, stories that make the point in history more personal. some may find the film footage of corpses and prisoners and death camps too strong to watch, but they are necessary to bring home the purpose of the film. wendy crewson carries the power to drive the message home - the message that war crimes must never go unpunished. there is much current history to be learned from this film: writers ian adams, riley adams and m.a. lovretta have condensed the information and made it dramatic as well. director charles binamé balances the docudrama with the story progress, never forgetting that he has a tale of intrigue to tell as well. hunt for justice is worth watching! grady harp

if "love me tonight" is "the musical for people who don't like musicals", it has to be said that "the gay desperado" is definitely not a musical for people who don't like opera. in fact -- despite apparently being based on a comic operetta -- it is not really a musical at all but a spoof bandit story with interpolated unrelated arias to show off the voice of one character; and what a voice it is.nino martini, as the young singer chivo who joins the bandit troop to get a spot on the radio (no, the plot doesn't make a lot more sense later on either...), has a glorious golden tenor whose style hasn't dated a day since the era when it was recorded. the trillings and warblings of some of his musical contemporaries belong to a bygone fashion, but it's very easy to picture chivo belting out "nessun dorma" to a world cup crowd and topping the charts in the process. unfortunately, while he has an engaging grin and a decent dramatic range, he is completely incapable of acting and singing at the same time. the result is that the otherwise rapid-paced film grinds to a shuddering halt every time chivo lays his hand on his breast and starts to declaim, and the viewer's tolerance of the result is likely to depend on his appreciation of operatic performance.aside from this drawback, the film is an enjoyable broad-brush satire on hollywood conventions and the mexican bandit stereotype in particular, which achieves the vital goal of all such spoofs in making its characters engaging enough in their own right to hold the viewer's interest when the joke would otherwise have grown stale. the bandit chief and his sidekick have the traditional double-act relationship, there is an enigmatic peon with a carved-teak face, and a spirited heroine (a young ida lupino) who performs the generic "you say you hate me but you love me really" routine with a refreshing twist.overall the film is entertaining and pretty funny, and i feel i did get my money's-worth -- but it can't be denied that the musical interludes, while admirable in their own way, introduce severe pacing problems.

"the gay desperado" is wonderful throughout. the banter between leo carrillo and harold huber is as funny as anything you would hear in a movie today. best line? "that would be my third choice!" "diego" is obviously the archetype for kevin smith's "silent bob". lucien n. andoit's black and white cinematography (particularly with the banditos' shadows) was striking. all i can say about ida lupino is, "thank god for dvd!" you can go right to the scene where she is trying on sombreros and serapes and watch her standing in front of that mirror over and over again.lest i forget, that nino martini guy sings real purty, too.

i don't know where this movie was shot, but because it was shot on location, it has the authenticity that this story deserves. it is the story of a young english woman who is taken prisoner by the japanese in southern asia at the beginning of wwii, with a group of other english women. there is no prison camp for women so they are forced to march for months from place to place, because the japanese don't know what to do with them. the courage and resilience of the english women, and the bravery of the australian soldier who tries to help them, is the core of the movie. this movie is very long, maybe 10 hours, so you can watch it as it was shown on pbs, as a series, which actually adds to the feeling of the endless journey this woman makes from england, across this remote island, and finally australia. story, cinematography, location and actors combine to make this a movie not to miss. my only question is why this hasn't been released on dvd!

i cannot believe it has been 25 yrs since i first watched this story on tv. i remembered to have been very much touched by it and was lucky to get the vhs tape several years ago. i did not watch it again until just recently. i have been watched it over and over ever since. i must have watched it 10 times in the past 2 wks.the acting is superb, the story is compelling, and i am embarrassed to say that i did not appreciate actor bryan brown's talent until now. the playful facial expressions shown in the first half - when he gave jean the stolen medicine in malaya is such a contrast to his very reserved and nervous body languages shown in the second half: in their first drink together in caines and the touring of the homestead. we have to wait until the wedding reception, especially the final dance scene to see his open display of affection for jean. the same dancing eyes that first revealed his admiration in malaya. who wouldn't want to be his mrs. boong ? while joe changed from a cocky, almost bigger than life figure in the malaya jungle to a somewhat self-conscious average joe in his own backyard, jean took the opposite road; her wartime experience seems to have given her new confidence. she wasted no time and went after what she wanted. she took steps to take what she could get - exactly as joe had told her to once upon a time.for me, all these transformations helps to show this is more than just a love story - this is a story about growth, courage and fragility in life. the solicitor -noel is both a sweet and sad figure. he too gave much to jean - he gave his last hope for love. at the end, he did what true love requires -- he put her happiness ahead of his own.i happened to like the fight between joe & jean that was not in the book. i thought it's an appropriate and necessary addition for it helped to surface the inner struggles they both had to deal with in order to make their life together possible.now, i am older, maybe i understand life, love and loss a little better. this story touches me even deeper. i am, however, surprised to see b. brown has blue eyes in the promo photo shown on this site. he most definitely did not in "a town like alice." well, 25 yrs is a long time !

jean paget, joe harman, and noel strachan--all are unlikely heroes and survivors. petite but strong jean whose strength and resolve help save lives, marching hundreds of miles and with calm self-discipline and persuasive powers, joe harman ("oh my word") who took risks for jean and the other prisoners, only to suffer the worst pain imaginable, and noel strahan, who trusted jean regardless of the odds. her good humor and hardiness inspire everyone around her, and those with the courage to go in with her are rewarded. the beautiful scenery and musical score adds to the adventure. despite the length it was never boring to me. these ordinary people did extraordinary things and it is based on a true story. someone borrowed my vhs a few years ago and i never saw it or them again. learned my lesson, mates, and will buy another copy when it can be found. it's a shame the miniseries is not on dvd.

i can't understand why imdb users would rate this movie 5.2/10? it really is great, very funny. i would strongly recommend this movie for all of you, adults, teenagers and especially children! the story is about a 14-year-old kid who always tell lie, at home and school. one day he had his homework of writing a 1000-word-story. but he didn't, so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours, or he would have to go to summer school. yep, he wrote it in 2:45. "big fat liar", i think it was a story of himself. on the way to the school he hit a limo of a famous hollywood producer, and he gave him a ride. but the kid forgot the story in the limo. he told his parents and the teacher, but of course, they did not believe him. and the movie producer, he took the kid's story as his new movie, "big fat liar". when the kid saw the trailer of the movie, he told his parents he had written it, but they didn't believe. so, he and his friend had to go to l.a to prove one thing: the truth is never overrated enjoy this great movie, you won't be disappointed. don't trust the 5.2/10 rate, it should be 9/10! believe me! p/s: so sorry, my english isn't good enough to make a better comment!

i can't count the times i have watched this, and although it differs from the book in story line the mood is still the same. the bond that two such diverse people give each other that surpasses trials and years is immortal. and that the element of the women prisoners was an actual event, that did happen to real people. the story is about the strength of character of ordinary people, people who just tried to survive a horrible time in their lives. and this also presented australia in a real mode. the country is like all countries, areas that everyone loves, quaint country areas and desolate areas. but it gives shute a stage for jean's transformation from a lowly outback town to a family community.

if you love the book, as i do, stop watching the video after jean and joe meet in australia. up to that point it is a fairly faithful rendition of the book, and the visuals are great. 10 out of 10 to that point and i've enjoyed it many times. after that, the story is seriously rearranged and revised in ways that really destroy the key part of the book, i.e., how jean creates a town like alice (springs). in the early part, the major change is to make strachan a 40-something bachelor instead of a seventy-year old widower. this rather skews this love story, especially when there are also small changes that contribute to making him more selfish and avaricious, such as: in the book, he intimates to joe at the ship that he might find more than a letter waiting for him in australia, but in the video he gives joe no clue about jean's whereabouts or intentions. the last hour of the 5-hour video scrunches and mangles the last third of the book. i see no reason why they threw in a fight between joe and jean -- it is quite out of character and seems to be just an aussie dig at pommies for telling them what to do. then they bring on strachan for the wedding (instead of some three years later) -- and have him read the toast!! -- very strange, especially in the context of the relationship between jean and noel as cast in the video. the whole wedding scene is the invention of the screenwriters. these abominations take up time in the last hour, which was already not long enough to do justice to the fascinating story of how jean recreates willstown as a place where she and joe can both be happy.

this is one of my favourite books and i remember watching this series and loving it immensely. sadly i have never seen it repeated or been able to get on dvd, but it made such an impact i have never forgotten it.the lead characters were perfect for the roles, especially the lovely bryan brown and although the scenes in australia were not entirely in keeping with the book at least they were there, unlike the film version with virginia mckenna which missed that part out altogether.i agree that gordon jackson's character of strachan is entirely different from the book but he is still excellent. for your information "moley75" "strawn" is the gaelic pronunciation of "strachan".

this review contains what might be a spoiler if you never read the book or saw the cover of the video box. so if you want to approach the movie not knowing anything about it, except that i like it a lot, stop here...the production values are not first rate, but the acting between the leads is, and they give the romance between them more life than shute does in his novel (although i generally prefer the novel). my very faint objections to the film as opposed to the book is that the film dumbs-down some of the relationships with secondary characters, and between the lead characters in a scene toward the end of the film, to provide for some not at all realistic dramatic tension and as a general plot device. all this is handled much better in the book, with the result that i find the end of the book quite a bit more touching than the end of the movie.

this movie is a sleeper - i've watched every miniseries that was ever on tv, some many times, and this one is the best. wonderfully cast, superbly acted, and the characters are well-developed. helen morse perfectly fits the part of jean paget - strident, in control, sharp, and a bit belligerent. she bounces well off of joe harmon, the cowboy/taciturn/"it'll be okay" sort of guy. i was sorry that the movie didn't stick to the book, in that there was no romantic interest between noel struan and jean paget. for those who don't know, this is taken from a true story about english women marched around malaya for 3 years by the japanese, who indeed did not know what to do with them. very few of them survived. neville shute talked to one of them, and this is her story. this movie deserves to be in everyone's collection who loves wwii stories.

i have seen this film at least 100 times and i am still excited by it, the acting is perfect and the romance between joe and jean keeps me on the edge of my seat, plus i still think bryan brown is the tops. brilliant film.

i raced to the library to check out this miniseries after having just finished listening to the marvelous "talking books" unabridged version of the book. the first half of this tv version is really very good, but it stumbles quite a bit in the second half. the relationship with the trustee is overplayed and conflicts are inserted between jean and joe that don't exist in shute's story, unwisely in my opinion, as they greatly diminish the power of their love story. i was disappointed to find that the wonderful bryan brown's joe seemed a lot cockier and much less appealing than the man in the book, but helen morse's jean was really quite good. i think they would have had to make this a 10-hour miniseries to develop the outback story properly. but all that said, i did watch whole thing in more or less one go and did appreciate its merits, all the while wishing that someone would do a less soapy remake.

i remember watching this series avidly and being so disappointed when it came to an end. over the years since then, i have tried to find out if i could obtain a copy of it on either video or d.v.d., to no avail. however, i was delighted to find this website with details of it, only to be disappointed again at the point of purchase, that the videos available will not play on english recorders! this production was so wonderful, being absolutely accurate with nevil shute's novel, taking the storyline through after the end of the war, with joe and jean's subsequent life together - absolutely marvellous - and i just wish i were able to see it again, as since it's original screening, there have been no repeats of it on british television.

i have seen this film at least 100 times and i am still excited by it, the acting is perfect and the romance between joe and jean keeps me on the edge of my seat, plus i still think bryan brown is the tops. brilliant film.

apparently this australian film based on nevil shute's novel exists in more than one form. beware heavily cut versions sometimes shown on cable or satellite, running anywhere from 95 minutes to 2 hours. only the full 5 hour miniseries version tells the story properly. it is a very close realisation of the story, suffering only from editorial faults commonly found in tv movies: choppiness and episodic progression. but this excellent cast carries the story forward very well with generally good production values accompanying their work. yuki shimoda is notable as "gunso mifune", one of the guards assigned to accompany the women on their agonising trek. in the end he becomes a friend. you will agonise with him when his loss of face leads him into death.helen morse as "jean paget", pretty but not a great beauty (she resembles sigourney weaver a bit)registers just the right amount of spunk and winsomeness as the occasion demands. the miniseries properly emphasises the beautiful love stories, three of them: "joe" and "jean", "noel" and "jean", and "jean" and willstown. gordon jackson plays "noel strachan" appealingly, but as a somewhat younger man than nevil shute indicated in the novel. the third love affair i mentioned doesn't get quite the emphasis it is due, and the full significance of the title is diminished. "jean" is devoted to the goal of bringing businesses to willstown that will attract young women and girls and their civilising influence to this god-forsaken out back town. she wants to make it "a town like alice"; alice springs, that is. we get only a few hints of this in several scenes. if you have the five hours to spare, this miniseries is a truly rewarding experience. nevil shute based his novel about the cruelty of the japanese military in shunting a large group of women and children from one place to another on the maylay peninsula on a true occurrence. it happened on sumatra, according to shute, though, rather than on the peninsula. the crucifixion of "joe" by a japanese officer for stealing chickens to feed the women is probably fiction, but the cruelty of the japanese in dealing with prisoners is certainly a matter of record.

i just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one. paul giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot. he would probably say it was easy, but he really does a great job and should have won something for it. we've had the dvd for several years and my kids (boy now 4 1/2 and girl 9) will watch this one over and over, and the humor is adult enough that i don't mind having to hear it in the background (and i do run to the tv for the really funny parts). simple moral message, lots of decent action and slapstick, "bad" grownups acting goofy to take the edge off, minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard.

this mini-series is iconic of the australian spirit. while there may be what are perhaps considered glaring inconsistencies, the film portrays a spirit that is unique to australia, and one that should be cherished. if anything, this mini-series demonstrates the aussie sense of humour. the ability to laugh at the supremely ridiculous. our willingness to have a laugh in even the most dire of situations. while a large part of this series focuses on mateship and how humour can be used as a means of survival, it also has elements of drama that are evoke real emotions. the main actors who appear are absolutely sensational and very convincing in their different roles. capturing the essence of their characters perfectly. this mini-series should be mandatory viewing for all australians.

i saw this drama by cable tv. although i saw just two series, i love this drama. i'm waiting for more series will be aired by cable.even though it describes horrible, absurd situation in a prisoner's camp, this one shows us an indomitable spirit, warmth, friendship and humanity. they don't know whether they can survive or not, but kept their hope strongly without being discouraged by adversity.i know this movie is not realistic like other war documentary, but i don't want to blame for it. it makes me believe the strong will of people in the most difficult situation. 'private bill' , especially, this episode touched deep in my heart.i remember every scene. i always hate mathematics. but after seeing this drama, i can understand something about mathematics... mathematics is his connection between past and present, also symbolizes eternity.'time, light and memory framed in a circle.'like other victims of war, he lost his lover by irresistible fate. i'm immersed in his time and memory as if i experienced same thing.he experienced the great loss but he has pure passion of study.he started his study in the camp, his joy of realize,i believe his dedication of study sustained him.i saw it several times, but the meaning of this film never faded. every time i saw it, i feel same deep emotion.* their songs are beautiful, harmonious,i'm sorry that i can't listen ost.

never have i sat down for six hours straight to watch a miniseries, but changi changed that. i'm not going to lie, i know some aussie flicks can be pathetic and boring (actually, i quite like aussie flicks myself but maybe i'm biased) but changi is on a completely different lane. although not historically accurate, as we are continually reminded, the show combines superb acting, an excellent script and the addition of humour to provide us with an entertaining and emotional perception of life in a pow camp in wwii.keep in mind, the show was not supposed to be a documentary so don't let any factual errors disappoint you. this series exposes such creative writing by john doyle (aka roy slaven)who is known more for his comedy than anything else, and an excellent director and actors move this creativity along perfectly. if you want to see how much hard work went into this series, visit the official website, it is really interesting and you'll learn a lot about true accounts of changi. if you haven't seen changi yet, make sure you are doing nothing for a whole day because you'll want to watch the series in its entirety.

this movie was fun! especially if your between 8 and 15. frankie muniz and amanda bynes make a believable team of 8th graders getting back at an adult who really deserves it. paul giamatti makes a great adult who you really want to 'get'. my 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it. parents: no really bad words or any sex to worry about. recommend it for the 'right' crowd. ap

this short deals with a severely critical writing teacher whose undiplomatic criticism extends into his everyday life. when he learns why that's not a good idea, we learn a bit about the beautiful craft of writing that he's been lecturing on.

this movie, with all its complexity and subtlety, makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films i have ever seen. the topics it addresses are ugly, cynical, and at times, even macabre, but the film remains beautiful in its language, artful with its camera angles, and gorgeous in its style, skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories, tobias wolff.not wishing to spoil anything of the movie, i won't go into any details, other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself. it takes pride in what it does, and does it well. it shows the most important memories of life, all of which can be topped by the single most elusive feeling: unexpected bliss. this movie, of its own volition, has created in me the same feelings the main character (tom noonan) felt when words transformed his very existence, and that is one impressive feat.

"opera" is a great film with some wonderful,imaginative imagery.an opera singer(cristina marsillach)is being stalked by a killer who forces her to watch him murder everyone she knows by tying her up and taping needles under her eyes.this idea of the needles comes from the fact that argento doesn't like it when people cover their eyes while watching his movies."for years i've been annoyed by people covering their eyes during the gorier moments in my films.i film these images because i want people to see them and not avoid the positive confrontation of their fears by looking away.so i thought to myself 'how would it be possible to achieve this and force someone to watch most gruesome murder and make sure they can't avert their eyes?'the answer i came up with is the core of what "opera" is about."-says argento.plenty of suspense,wonderful cinematography and brutal,gory murders.one guy is stabbed in the throat with a knife causing a gushing wound,daria nicolodi gets shot in the eye while looking through the peephole,etc.for anyone who hasn't caught this one yet,give it a try.highly recommended.

opera (the u.s. title is terror at the opera) is somewhat of a letdown after some of dario's other movies like phenomena, tenebre, and suspiria. (i still can't find inferno anywhere.) it's one of those movies that has a great first half but midway through it's like someone started slowly letting the air out of the screenplay and logic.the basic plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is being stalked by a deranged obsessed fan. this killer begins killing people close to her in a most unique fashion. he binds and gags her and tape tiny sharp pins under her eyelids so if she tries to close her eyes she'll gouge out her eyes. this forces her to watch while the killer murders her acquaintances in typically brutal and gory argento fashion.unfortunately, about midway through the film becomes sluggish and illogical. (this is especially directed towards the killer's motivations. i still haven't completely figured out why he's such a nut.) the ending especially come out of left field in the worst possible sense.but, for about the first hour or so this is some of dario's best filmmaking and the camera work is breathtaking. too bad it couldn't maintain it through to the end.rating:7

a young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major part in a staged play as lady macbeth thanks to the mishap of the production's diva falling in front of a moving car. a success winning her accolades, betty(christina marsillach)finds instead horror as the one responsible for getting her to this point terrorizes her in cruel ways.first her stage manager boyfriend, stefano(william mcnamara)is viciously stabbed with a knife while she has to watch, rope-tied to a pillar in his uncle's vast mansion, keeping her eyes from closing thanks to needles scotch-taped under her eyes, with pricking a result if she blinks. allowing her to escape, betty again finds herself in this unfortunate position, when a specific gold chain is found on her lady macbeth wardrobe that had been torn to shreds by the madman after killing a series of crows which escaped from their cage in the equipment room, by the clothing designer who is first knocked to the floor by an iron and subsequently stabbed heinously by a pair of scissors(..to cap off this nasty scene, the chain falls into her throat with the killer having to cut open her throat to find it; while not specifically elaborating this act, dario uses the ripping sound of the scissors for optimum effect with the camera often retreating back to the victim's dead face). having nowhere to turn, inspector alan santini(urbano barberini, playing him cold and bland at dario's request)promises to catch the psycho as betty relies on her few remaining friends for comfort, the theater director marco(ian charleson, of ghandi & chariots of fire who would later die of aids;a sad footnote, dario revealed in an interview that charleson informed him at the end of the shoot that he was hiv positive)attempting the stage after a successful horror movie career despite being rejected by critics, and pal mira(daria nicolodi, dario's former squeeze), her agent and confident. but, the serial killer is quite driven and a showdown between them will, of course, occur in the theater as marco has added an interesting change to the production using the crows at his disposal.i think this is dario at his most savage & nihilistic. although he has certainly made later gruesome films(..such as his masters of horror entries and sleepless would suggest), this film really ups the ante in pure violence towards the victims of the psychopath. his method of forcing betty to watch was admittedly a gag by dario regarding the type of audience who like to look away from the more horrific parts of horror movies. i found myself rubbing my eyes every time she just has to blink(..brilliantly, dario shoots the pricking from point-of-view achieving a tormenting effect from our perspective as if we were the ones with the scotch taped needles holding our eyes open). i like how dario will show the widened eyes of betty, horrified at what she's being forced into watching, as little blood tears down the needles when she has no choice but blink. the photographic work of ronnie taylor is impeccable, such as the crow's point-of-view shot in the theater at the end as it searches for the killer. or, when the camera "travels" through rooms in the theater following the killer who wishes to see his muse from a box seat. or, the dream sequence where we are taken into betty's memory of an event regarding her mother's death by a certain killer, donning the same mask and gloves as the one causing her trauma at present. the highlight, in my opinion, is the peephole bullet-fire sequence, masterly staged by all involved as the camera follows a bullet which shoots through the eye of a victim, exploding from the back of her head, going through a telephone betty planned to use to call for help. we even get a crow pecking the eyeball from the killer(..to add to this vicious scene, the crow is shown with the eyeball rolling around in it's beak). only aspect i didn't care for, often pointed out by naysayers of the film, is the "final" ending which i personally felt was a bit unnecessary, but i guess dario wanted to point out that betty was indeed not like her mother, a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies which, in a twist, relate to why the killer torments our heroine. the rock music used during the violent scenes didn't bother me, because i felt that those moments of wicked graphic attacks needed a jarring thud which heavy metal can often provide.

i finally managed to get myself a copy of dario argento's opera, and i tell you ... that was about time !! it was the last argento movie i had yet to see and i'm a fan of most of his work. i reckon that most of his work is extremely important for the genre of horror but some of his movies tend to disappoint ( like phenomena ). but the plot idea of opera always appealed to me and it turns out i was right !! i enjoyed every shot in opera and i was fascinated by this movie for the first minute till the last. out of all the argento movies, opera went straight to the number one spot and i hope i can encourage as many people as possible to see this one as well.the script and plot-idea of opera is rather simple. especially compared to argento's previous movie phenomena that had too many ideas in it, and ended up being a mess. the plot of opera is creepy and chilling but at the same time it's an excellent satiric comment - almost a spoof - towards the opponents of explicit violence. ***spoilers*** a young opera singer ( the gorgeous cristina marsillach ) is being stalked by a horribly sadistic murderer. during every massacre he commits, he forces betty to watch his actions with her eyes wide open. there are needles attached to her eyelids and when she closes them, they're getting torn apart. ***end spoilers***. to this simple - yet effective - idea, argento adds a lot of horrific elements like ravens, the classic piece ( and curse ) of macbeth and the whole atmospheric location of the opera building and the music. especially the presence of the creepy ravens are and extra value. ancient masters like edgar allen poe already knew these black birds have a lot of mystery hanging around them, and dario argento knows it as well. the violence and gore is very well presented in opera and that's what makes this a true argento picture. his best in my opinion with profondo rosso as a close second. i surely hope to recommend this movie to a lot of people among you. especially for fans of the ( italian ) horror business, this is an absolute must ! favorite "rewind"-scene : argento shows his visual talent the best in the scene where betty's friend is getting shot in the eye while she's trying to see who's in front of the door.

if you're ok with the outlandish work of italy's premier horror directorable to accept his outrageous story lines and flamboyant stylethen you should have a great time with opera. if you don't, then you won't.cristina marsillach plays betty, a beautiful young opera understudy who is given a shot at fame (in an avant-garde production of macbeth) when the star of the show is hit by a car. as any thesp who has 'trod the boards' will know, macbeth is a production that carries a curseand betty soon discovers that the show in which she is now the star is no exception: a killer is systematically offing the staff at the theatreand poor betty is forced to watch by the sadistic murderer (who tapes needles under her eyes to prevent her from closing them!).with the help of a little girl who crawls through her air-conditioning ducts, her director and agent, and a few ravens who have seen the murderer's face (!!!), betty discovers the killer's identity, and the truth about her mysterious past.let's face it... opera is one crazy film, with its preposterous plot-turns, convoluted death scenes, and an ending that beggars belief. and whilst director dario argento has never been one for, shall we say, conventional story lines, this particular giallo is so daft, and features so many of his trademark stylish touches (all ramped up to the max), that it's almost as if, with each successive film, he is seeing what he can get away with (at times almost parodying his earlier work).this is exactly why i find the film such fun!!!argento's camera movements are absolutely incredible: gliding, creeping and, in one amazing scene, even swooping around the opera house above the audience; the power of verdi's music is combined perfectly with the synth majesty of claudio simonetti's score, providing a suitably grandiose accompaniment to the sumptuous visuals; and several outstanding set-pieces (featuring sergio stivaletti's nauseating gore fx) go to prove that no-one does death better than argento (check out one character's stunning demise, in which a bullet passes through a spy-hole in a door in slow motion, and straight into their eye!).7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for imdb.

venice, in 1596.jews are separated from the good christians.bassanio, a young but poor venetian loves the fair portia, who is a wealthy heiress.so he approaches his friend, a merchant called antonio for three thousand ducats to travel to belmont and propose portia.all of antonio's ships and merchandise are busy at sea, so he turns to the moneylender shylock, the one of jewish faith.shylock does not like antonio, for he spat on his face.he offers antonio a three-month loan at no interest, but if he will not pay the money in that time, he will own a pound of his flesh.also, shylock's daughter jessica elopes with the christian lorenzo.the merchant of venice is based on william shakespeare's play that's believed to have written between 1596 and 1598.i read the play last summer and now i've seen the movie, made in 2004 by michael radford.i liked the play, and i don't quite agree with the accusations of it being anti-semitic.the jewish character does not appear as an inhuman monster, even though he's ready to cut a piece of antonio's flesh.there's a lot of depth in his character, which all comes out in his speech where he asks "if you prick us, do we not bleed?" and so forth.there is much more human in shylock's character than in one of antonio's, who spits on the good jew.al pacino is unbeatable as shylock.he gives such a strong performance.jeremy irons is also terrific as antonio.lynn collins is most beautiful and brilliant in the role of portia.zuleikha robinson does great job as jessica, and charlie cox as lorenzo is also very good.kris marshall plays gratiano, and he does a good job.in the role of nerissa we see heather goldenhersh.mackenzie crook plays launcelot gobbo.as in shakespeare plays usually, also this one contains most brilliant dialogue.the movie paints a fantastic portray of the era.it deals with some great issues, in a shakespearian way.

the merchant of venice 8/10(this review assumes a basic knowledge of the story and so may be thought of as containing spoilers to anyone unfamiliar with the plot.)as a film version of the famous shakespeare play, merchant of venice does what few adaptations have done since polanski's rather gritty macbeth: it takes the spirit of the play and brings it out not just as well as, but better than the play alone could readily achieve. lord of the rings director, peter jackson, has argued that in adapting a book or play there are three options: attempt to replicate the original as perfectly as possible, use the original idea as an inspiration but take full license for cinematic change, or (the one he avowedly preferred) stick to the original as much as is cinematic ally viable but make such changes as are necessary for the film and while remaining faithful to the intention or spirit of the original.in macbeth, polanski used the rain-sodden beaches and realistic rapes and murder to convey what a bloody and horrific period the play was set in, thus bringing to mind the horrific context in which the characters make such ill-advised decisions. it differs from (say) branagh's hamlet, which achieved new heights of faithful rendition, but otherwise offered little new. macbeth, on the other hand, maybe enabled audiences fresh to shakespeare to appreciate some of the drama's fullness without extensive study; similarly, more familiar audiences might find a greater depth than the unaided stage performance could accomplish. such interpretation plays a vital part if audiences are to fully engage, not only intellectually but also emotionally, with the points shakespeare wanted to make.radford's adaptation of merchant of venice does just this. it takes crucial moral dilemmas involving religious bigotry or the keeping promises and, with minimal messing of the bard's holy tome, conveys them faithfully within the spirit of the original story.the first of these, religious bigotry, gives meaning to shylock's otherwise outlandish behaviour. we see the jews of the period relegated to a walled ghetto, only allowed out if wearing an identifying red cap. not being allowed to own property, one of the few ways they can earn a living is by money-lending. this makes them both useful to their christian oppressors and at the same time the object of their vilification. the idea behind (both old and new testament) biblical prohibitions against usury probably stems from not making a profit by helping one's friends. this is extended by the bigoted christians to curse those they spit on (we see shylock not only spit on, but fellow jews thrown into the waterways for sport - in an atmosphere that can only be described as threatening).the topicality of the film is curious, since the bigotry of right wing christianity (as personified by bush-following americans) has turned full circle, as they are now the main supporters of zionism, and the jewish political leaders bite at their palestinian neighbors much as shylock tries to bite at antonio (once he thinks the law gives him the power to do so). the psychology is self-evident - kick a dog repeatedly and it will become vicious. the circle easily continues as the victims of oppression themselves easily lose their sense of moral values and become oppressors.the stringent sleight of hand that the disguised portia uses to save antonio has some merit, both as a clever interpretation of the unsophisticated law that the venetians of the play so rue and also as a moral pointer. shylock may 'have his pound of flesh' according to his contract, but may not have any blood. an easy analogy could be made as far as warfare and terrorism goes - it is much easier to justify fighting among combatants or attacking ill-doers if soldiers or evil-doers are the only victims - when there is massive collateral damage, as when innocent citizens, including women and children, are killed in their hundreds, the warmongers' arguments (whether those warmongers be israeli, palestinian or us american) carry far less popular support. there has long been much argument whether shakespeare was being anti-semitic in this story. one wonders if he had to adapt the ending for a largely christian audience who had little dealing with jewish people. far from teaching him a greater good, the ending enforces christianity and humiliation upon shylock - a course likely simply to perpetuate pent up resentment. both camps look just as bad - one simply holds more power than the other. the slight amelioration of the judgment simply gives the christian judges a better public image, or as bassanio so acutely (observes when choosing the caskets and solving the riddles to win portia's hand):in religion, what damned error, but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text, hiding the grossness with fair ornament? there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts.of course, the bigotry applies to organised religion (rather than spirituality), especially when organised for political purposes, but one that easily goads ordinary god-fearing people who are not in the habit of splitting hairs. the kindness, mercy ('chesed' in judaism) which is so fundamental to true christianity, is something also practiced to a wonderful degree in judaism as in most creeds. the jewish faith distinguishes between kindness and charity, ways of practicing both effectively, and ways of making it part of one's being rather than just an outward show. both shylock and antonio are bigoted and use their respective faiths to abuse those of another faith. while shakespeare maybe pointed up the chasm between the goodness prescribed by different faiths and its absence in practice, the film version reduces much of the window for interpretations of anti-semitism and brings a greater degree of realism to the psychological causes.the keeping of promises (the men to their wives) is dealt with less well, as are the comic elements inherent in the cross-dressing sub-plots. bassanio, however strong his love for antonio (are there homosexual elements there?) cannot make sound moral judgements when showing his gratitude to the 'judge', and so breaks his promise (for which portia forgives him, displaying a triumphal character for women, not only as supremely intelligent and witty but also as more truly merciful and considerate of others than her bigoted male counterparts, including her husband.)some of the acting is a bit stilted, and there are too many regional (english) accents, but on the whole merchant of venice delivers a fresh and rewarding reworking of shakespeare. i enjoyed the acting, and also the very beautiful soundtrack by hayley westenra and others, singing ballads penned both by shakespeare and edgar allen poe. all in all, merchant of venice is a not inconsiderable achievement of british (as far as any film can be said to be of a particular nationality these days) cinematic tradition.

michael radford, the director of "the merchant of venice" makes a tremendous job in opening the play, as he makes it more accessible for everyone to have a great time at the movies watching this thorny account of a horrible time in history. the luscious production of the shakespeare's play is a feast for the eyes with its rich detail of the venice of the xvi century.this is a story of revenge, prejudice and justice, as imagined by william shakespeare. having seen the play a few times, we were not prepared about what to expect. mr. radford takes care of presenting the story with such detail so it can be easily understood by everyone. also, he has used a version of english that makes more sense, rather than relying on the original text. in fact, the way shylock speaks in the film, doesn't shock at all, being he, a member of a minority that has been marginalized by the venetian authorities and the catholic church.al pacino tremendous portrayal of shylock shows a man that is vulnerable, arrogant, revengeful, mean, and totally human, all at the same time. mr. pacino sheds light into the character of the man who is defeated in court by a technicality. his own daughter has left him and his whole world seems to be caving in on him. at the end of the film, we see a man that has been reduced to being the target of hatred and ridicule by everyone.lynn collins, as portia is a happy discovery. having seen her in lighter fare, she not only surprises, but she makes the best of her role and her time in front of the camera. she shows us she is a woman with a high intelligence, who comes to the help of her husband and his best friend, who risked his own well being in trying to help bassanio get portia's hand.jeremy irons plays antonio, the man who seeks shylock for a "bridge loan". after all, he knows his ships will be returning with fortunes from abroad soon. antonio gets much more than he bargained for in agreeing with shylock to the terms of the loan. antonio's best laid plans go astray when he is suddenly unable to fulfill his obligations. mr. irons gives a subtle performance.joseph fiennes, makes a good appearance as bassanio. his good looks and his charm make an impression on portia, who clearly sees a soul mate in this young venetian as she knows he is the one for her. also, in smaller roles, kris marshall, zuleika robinson, charlie cox, contribute to make the film an enjoyable experience.ultimately, it's mr. radford's triumph because of the vision he gives us of venice and its citizens during a horrible time in the history of mankind.

seriously, where is al pacino's oscar nomination for this one? is it that we take him for granted at this point in his career? pacino here is extraordinary.. he gives a complex, heartbreaking performance as shylock, the jewish money lender.. the movie as a whole was quite great, with beautiful shots of venice to look at and a pitch perfect score to listen to.. the other actors all do a fine job as well, but the real reason to see this is pacino.. i have seen all the nominated oscar performances of 2004, and i must say that pacino was snubbed.. blame it on the anti-semitism associated with the play, the lack of campaigning by the studio, the late release date with no major push, or most likely, all of the above.. in my mind, the best performances of the year belong to jamie foxx in ray, don cheadle in hotel rwanda, and al pacino in the merchant of venice..

william shakespeare's the merchant of venice is about a jewish moneylender and his bond to extract a pound of flesh from the wealthy merchant antonio, the forfeiter of a debt. the jewish moneylender, of course, is shylock and he is given such a towering performance by al pacino that even outstanding actors like jeremy irons, joseph fiennes, and lynne collins fade into the background. the film is set in 16th century venice and director michael radford relies on setting, mood, and realism to tell its story, rejecting lavish period costumes or a modern setting with rock music to appeal to a wider audience.radford slices the play's three-hour length to a manageable two hours and eight minutes and also provides some historical background. in the opening narration, he tells us how jews came to england, were subject to increasing persecution, and eventually expelled from england. they were forbidden to own property, could make profits only by lending money at interest, and were forced to live in a venetian "geto", a forerunner of darker events to come. in the film, the merchant antonio (jeremy irons) spits upon shylock in public, yet feels no shame in going to the usurer to borrow 3000 ducats to help his friend and suggested lover bassanio (joseph fiennes) to properly court portia (lynne collins), a wealthy heiress. though shylock has been insulted by antonio, he agrees to loan the money without interest for three months on the condition that forfeiture of the bond grants him the right to exact a pound of flesh from antonio's heart.the play is primarily a drama of hatred and revenge, but like many of shakespeare's works there are touches of broad comedy as well. here the comedy involves three pairs of lovers: bassanio and portia, gratiano, bassanio's friend, and nerissa, and lorenzo, another friend of bassanio, and jessica, shylock's daughter. portia has offered herself to the person who can pick the right treasure from one of three boxes, made of gold, silver, and lead. the prince of morocco chooses the one of gold, the prince of aragon the one of silver and both are disappointed. bassanio, however, loves her for herself and opens the leaden casket to find the portrait within. radford's adaptation conveys a remarkable feeling for time and place. portia's residence at belmont suggests one of those splendid summer homes complete with immaculate gardens and art treasures hanging in every room and contrasts well with the grungy look of shylock's city with its dank alleyways.when it becomes clear that antonio cannot repay the debt, bassanio returns to venice, leaving portia behind. when he arrives, the loan is in default and shylock is demanding his pound of flesh. even when bassanio, backed by portia's wealth, offers many times the amount in repayment, shylock is intent on revenge not only for the loss of the money but for a lifetime of outsider status. the duke, who sits in judgment, will not intervene as portia enters in the guise as a lawyer to defend antonio. it is here that the film reaches its dramatic heights as all parties come to court to achieve a final resolution.the merchant of venice is not only about an unpaid debt but also about the estrangement of jews from christian society and their desire for belonging. it has been one of shakespeare's most controversial plays and analysts have debated for a long time whether it is an anti-semitic play or simply a play about anti-semitism that reflects the prevalent view of christian society in elizabethan england. although shylock is definitely a caricature, he is an ambiguous figure and there are many indications that shakespeare views his flaws as human failings, not jewish ones. the duke recognizes that he is simply a man who has failed to adhere to the compassionate language of the torah.in the monologue, "i am a jew. hath not a jew eyes? if you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?", shylock shows a universal humanity, expressing the equality of all men. though we are horrified at the sentence he wishes to carry out, we can feel his pain accumulated over the years. pacino's performance brings new vigor to the text and his often over-the-top persona is replaced with a gentler, more understated demeanor that brings understanding to his cause.. during a toronto international film festival interview last september, radford said about pacino, "when you work with a brilliant actor, you have a great machine. it's a bit like driving a powerful car. you have to dare to do it." he has dared and we are all the beneficiaries.

i saw the merchant of venice in london last week. great acting by al pacino, jeremy irons, joseph finnes and lynn collins. compare to other movies based on shakespeare's play, this production has made the play so easy to understand and follow. bravo to michael radford for directing such top actors. the costume and the scenery are great and since it was filmed on location in venice it gives the film and authentic flavor. i had read the play over thirty years ago at school and the emphasis was on the characters' anti-semitic behavior toward the jews and the cruelty of the christians. i do not know if this movie is going to be controversial but in any case i am sure that it will get few oscar nominations.

it is a risky business to film such a lavish production of "the merchant of venice". it could be a stodgy, wooden, period piece, or it could be laughable for its excesses. this version is neither. while i am not completely sold by al pancino's very restrained shylock, he does give a competent and honorable performance. jeremy iron's antonio, is as always with his tortured-self roles, riveting. some of the lesser roles seemed to be a little to much in the spirit of boisterous fun, "a boy's own venician adventure story", but the central plot is efficiently and sympathetically moved forward through the film.it goes without saying, that the location shots, costumes, and interiors were breathtaking, almost to the point of distraction.one thing, on which i do not wish to comment on, is the anti-semetic content of the play. the film is as sympathetic to the predicament of the jews as possible while still portraying shylock as the instrument of his own self-destruction. it is a sad comment that four centuries later, the director of this film found it necessary to comment on his nuanced view before the premiere screening at the toronto film fest.this is a beautiful film, and i look forward to several viewings.

i am always impressed when a director (and this case director/screenwriter) takes a piece of classical text - and makes it come alive. sure, shakespeare's text can give you goosebumps even when hammered out with self-importance, but to see a production where true inventiveness makes wonderful words even more so - by the provision of context or nuance not found in the stage directions is simply awe-inspiring. there are many troubling things about the play. it is a racist play about racism - and that still sticks. i have never accepted jessica's desertion of her father without any acceptable reason. i have never accepted the christians' position of sanctimonious self-righteousness. but, brilliantly, there is a text prologue which helps us understand the times and politics in which the story is set, and mercifully, much of jessica's part is cut.the text is quite stripped down with many passages cut. but, i only noticed one line which was cut at the moment when i expected to hear it - and it was replaced by a look that said it all. this economy and judicious editing has given us a gripping movie - not just a film of the play.and at last, there is a rationale as to why antonio is so loyal and generous to the undeserving/unrelated bassanio - you can almost feel antonio's pulse start to race when he catches glimpse of bassanio passing by in a gondola, or arriving for a visit. but it is as subtle as that - no more. i was spellbound.there were many other highlights. i felt the arguments during the trial to be heartbreaking. and, the suitors' trials are hilarious.add all that to glorious cinematography and costumes that resonated with the times, and you'll understand why i can't wait to see it again. and again.
