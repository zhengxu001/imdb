if there's one good suspenseful film, this is one of them. james stewart puts on a dazzling performance as american dr. ben mckenna who, with his wife and son, are in africa on tour. they stumble on a murder scene, and dr. mckenna's son is kidnapped hours later.before you can say, "fasten your seat belts," dr. mckenna finds out too much about a assassination attempt and tries to stop it. however, other people know he can be dangerous, (dangerous to them, that is) and try to dispose of him.eventually, hank, the son, is found alive and well.if you like suspenseful movies, this is the one to watch.my score: 8/10.

james stewart plays dr. ben mckenna, who, with his wife and son, are tourists in an arabian city. they get caught up in the middle of a murder scene. the victim whispers something in dr. mckenna's ear, and he is told to do something.later, his son is kidnapped. the kidnappers turn out to be a man and woman he knew, but the woman is a bit softer than the man.the song, "que, sera, sera" (whatever we'll be, we'll be," is one of the best songs ever sung in any movie.doris day play's stewart's wife, and she sings the song mentioned above. her performance is oscar worthy. i'm surprised she wasn't even nominated.my score: 8/10.

i have been getting into the hitchcock series very much lately. i find myself always renting one of his movies when i'm at blockbuster or hollywood video. like i said before, hollywood is loosing it's touch incredibly, i needed a reminder that there are terrific films out there. not to mention, i want to be a film appreciator, not a movie buff. is there any better way to do that than with alfred hitchcock's movies? the man who knew too much is another great and exciting thriller starring alfred's favorite leading man james stuart and the woman who steals the show dorris day. they play husband and wife who go on vacation with their son, but when a spy tells james some information that could arrest another spy, his son is kidnapped and held for ransom. james seems to just doubt dorris and her ability for ideas on how to get their son back, but she makes a great comeback and just about ends up being the hero of the flick.the acting again, i would say that dorris was the one who outshined the whole cast. james did a great job keeping up, together these two made you sit down and never budge throughout the film. i loved the little bit of comedy at the end that alfred added. you'll see what i mean. i would always highly recommend this film, despite not being the best hitchcock film, it's still a treasure.9/10

i hate to admit it, but i didn't find it to be one of hitchcock's best but nonetheless a riveting, climatic thriller. in a remake of hitchock's 1934 movie of the same title, dr. ben mckenna (james stewart) Â– the man who knows too much - and his wife jo mckenna (doris day) are holidaying in morocco with their son hank (christopher oslen) when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught up in the web of an assassination plot. the conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot: kidnapping their beloved hank.i found it surprising that doris day, who i usually associate with rock hudson comedies, was cast in a hitchcock film. as i was watching it, i soon realized that this was more of a family film compared to hitchcock's other works (example: psycho) and she had singing ability needed to pull off "que sera sera", which she did beautifully. she was well cast as herself and james stewart had chemistry, which helped make the couple believable.in comparison to the great director's other works i believe this isn't as good, but it is still a exceedingly entertaining family thriller/mystery. there is also the added bonus of que sera sera, which turned out to be a smash hit for doris day. well directed, well acted. a fine film.

this movie is amazing. you will never laugh harder. it's a target. no, i think it's...yes it's...a boob! this movie gets funnier by the second--like when jackie chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene. this movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha! congrats if you buy or rent this. you'll never return it, in my opinion. i didn't, and i haven't found it in a store since. i watched this movie once and i was forever in love with kung-fu action flicks. if you're looking for an amazing film in the realm of great production value, good or even mediocre acting, and good special effects...this is not that movie. if you're looking for laughs and timeless wonderment, pick this up for a dollar and you'll probably never let it go. with friends, popcorn and drinks, it's the perfect evening.

the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to- due, in no small part, to john woo's masterful direction, coupled with kat's superb cinematography: some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental; there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art-house film. both james tien and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate. tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad. it's a role reversal the likes of which i don't think i've ever seen before (tien normally played a hero and, in fact, with his moustache, i didn't even recognize him at first). sammo's goofy "buck teeth" only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed; that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable- in a villain you love to hate kind of way. his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic. jackie chan appears briefly (early on and late in the going) as a blacksmith, and i believe i actually glimpsed yuen biao somewhere along the way. tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent.

the hand of death aka countdown in kung fu (1976) is a vastly underrated early work by director john woo. the film stars dorian tan (tan tao-liang) and features jackie chan, sammo hung and james tien in significant supporting roles. many people believe, or have been lead to believe by deceptive advertising, that this is a jackie chan film. this is not a jackie chan film, dorian tan is the star but jackie gives one of his best (most serious) early performances.the hand of death is about a shaolin disciple named yunfei (tan) who is sent on a mission to assassinate a shaolin traitor named shih xiaofeng (tien) and protect a revolutionary named zhang yi (woo). along his journey yunfei meets up with a young woodcutter named tan (chan) and a disgraced sword fighter (chang chung) known as "the wanderer." both men have suffered at the hands of shih and want to take revenge. the three team up to defeat shih and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety.the martial arts action is above average under the direction of sammo hung. dorian tan uses his trademark high kicks very effectively as the "northern eighteen styles kicks" along with some "southern five styles boxing." sammo hung and jackie chan provide excellent martial arts performances as well. james tien is not the greatest martial artist on the jade screen but does an acceptable job. some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem over choreographed but the final showdowns featuring chan, tan and hung are very good.director john woo provides plenty of interesting character development in the film, which is refreshing. the cinematography by leung wing kat is very stylish, unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era. joseph koo's music: a combination of soft flutes and 70's "shaft" style orchestral pieces is kung fu cinema at its best. hand of death is not jackie and sammo's usual kung fu comedy. hand of death is a serious, straightforward revenge driven story.hand of death aka countdown in kung fu is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre. the film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things to come from jackie chan and sammo hung. hung's great choreography is put on display here before his directorial debut and chan's early charisma and talent can be clearly seen.hand of death is a solid, stylish old school kung fu film and a brilliant early work of the legendary john woo.kung fu genre rating 7.5/10 wanderer to tan (referring to his new weapon): "the little eagle wing god lance." tan: "just a knickknack."

i put this film in the queue on a whim after a recent trip to nyc, and i couldn't believe i'd never heard of it anywhere! it has all the makings of a cult classic, starting with the characters. they are archetypal roles we recognize from every stretch of daily life, but were so nuanced and fully realized by the actors playing them (peter stormare and bai ling's performances were particularly strong). their interactions are poignant and grounded while at the same time brimming with a subtle, quirky humor that is (sadly) all too rare in american films these days. writer/director ramin niami does a beautiful job of weaving these scenes together into a funny and moving portrait of a city of the past. highly recommended!

the director, ramin niami, delivers the goods with somewhere in the city. this hilarious farce, i believe, is in the tradition of a mel brooks comedy. niami pokes fun at new york society by creating the believable, eccentric, and tragic characters of one tenement apartment building bringing them to life from the very opening one shots that introduce them. peter stormare's performance as a gay shakespearean actor is absolutely award worthy and the film in general does a good job at showing the hopelessness and laugh-ability of self-centered ambition. sandra bernhard is cast perfectly as the straight, self-obsessed therapist. i really enjoyed sandra's performance immensely especially since i haven't really been a very big fan until now. bai ling, ornella muti, and bulle ogier round out an international ensemble par excellence. i loved the scene with robert john burke and his gang of idiot criminals who couldn't plan a robbery if their lives depended on it. with a cameo appearance by mayor ed koch and a solid performance by paul anthony stewart, the revolutionary momma's boy, somewhere in the city entertains without missing a beat.

i agree with the aussie's comments for the most part. however, there id seem to be a fairly decent plot, if unoriginal. christina (kelli mccarty) inherits a rural property that she intends to open a mountain lodge. she gets reacquainted with chip (bobby johnston) whom she had known when she was growing up in there. the plot thickens when james (paul logan) arrives with his new stripper friend, shene (devinn lane) because christina had been james' stripper friend in years gone by, and the implication is that james had done her wrong somehow. to add interest to the movie sophia linn (monique parent) a romance novelist shows up as a guest at the lodge, as do eric (sebastien guy) and linda (flower), pair of lawyers from the city. james sicks the local building codes inspector on christina's business as one of his dirty tricks to shut her down. so the question is, "how far will james go to sabotage the lodge and will he succeed?"watch for devinn lane here and in "beauty betrayed." she seems to be making a transition from the hard core business to the "r" world. another notable is samantha mcconnell, playing the role of "bait," clearly the most outrageous character name in the movies!

wow, i've sure seen quite a bit of kelli mccarty this summer. i didn't know this woman made so many softcore flicks in the past three years. it's like seeing a future softcore star blossom in front of me, much like michelle hall did a couple of years ago."passion's peak" is the third quality softcore flick i've seen kelli mccarty in, with "girl for girl" and "house of love" being the others. "desire and deception" was okay, but it wasn't spectacular. there's spoilers in this review, so read only if you want to.the story begins with christina (kelli mccarty) heading out of the big city and to the mountains. she has inherited a house from her dear departed grandmother and plans to turn it into a mountain lodge. before she can even set her things down, some woman named kim (uncredited in this film, but quite the aggressive one) begins booking guests to stay there. now she has to get the house into shape quickly--in comes chip (bobby johnston), a childhood friend, to the rescue. chip helps her get the house in workable condition. she hires two local slackers to work in her lodge--chip's sister bait (samantha mcconnell) and her sex buddy hank.now the guests start coming. the first to arrive are eric and linda (flower), two stereotypical money-first lawyers. linda and eric get into a huge argument during a dinner party halfway through the film which leads to their breakup; sad stuff there. next, there's romance novelist sophia, played by b-movie goddess monique parent. she's using that silly alias scarlet johansing again, and she's got a very professional look this time--with blonde hair, of course. it wouldn't be monique if she didn't have at least one scene where she plays with herself--and she obliges, during one of eric and linda's sex scenes.james and shene (devinn lane--yes, the porn star devinn lane) show up for a little weekend getaway as well. unbeknownst to shene, james and christina have quite a history. james and christina used to date, but christina broke it off to head to this mountain lodge. james comes up to the lodge to get christina back, but his plan backfires. christina spills the beans to shene, which causes shene to walk out on him and down to the local bar to strip for the locals. shene ends up in the sleeping bag of the now-single eric, and they leave together. bait realizes she wants something more than just sex with hank, and christine finds true love with chip, with sophia soaking it all in and writing it into her next romance novel. in fact....if you ask me, this whole movie played out like a romance novel. i don't know if the screenwriter was going for that effect, but i sure got that impression. sophia had some of the best lines in this film, playing up the idea that this is a live-action romance novel. she seems to enjoy all the fighting and backstabbing going on.now to the sex. there was a fair amount of it, and it was the usual bump-and grind stuff. monique did her fair share of moaning in her two sex scenes. this film was tapeworthy, and the story will actually keep the audience somewhat interested in between the sex scenes.women: a- (monique was simply monique. out of all the softcore actresses i've seen over the years, she's the best at acting, in my opinion. she can really act and be sexy, which is why she's holding on to the #1 position in my skinemax top 10. kelli mccarty is better at doing softcore films than she is on the soap opera "passions"; i don't know why she's not doing more of these. flower was merely background scenery for the most part in a limited role. samantha mcconnell continues to impress me, and devinn lane is yet another hardcore actress crossing over into the softcore realm and doing a halfway decent job at it.)sex: b (it was good, but not awe-inspiring spectacular. plenty of moaning. don't watch the r-rated version, trust me....most of the good stuff is taken out. my grade is for the uncut version.)story: b (a solid storyline which throws in a contrived "ooh, the building inspector's gonna shut us down" subplot toward the end which messes up things. the underlying story between christina and james was nice, and sophia's dialogue, full of the metaphors and imagery usually found in romance novels, was a nice touch.)overall: b+ (i found this movie to be quite entertaining. it's not a surefire softcore hall-of-famer like "girl for girl" is, but it's a respectable addition to the skinemax collection.)

one of keli mccarthy's best. this movie is filled with sex, and nudity. it has gorgeous, sexy women and some sexy settings.believe me, there are many spicy and steamy sex scenes but not as hot as the women. we have outside settings, a hot tub, beds of course, and some other nice places to have sex.monique parent is great in the opening sex sequence where she behaves like a naughty girl. keli is amazing, she's extremely sexy and performs in at least 4 hot sex scenes. my favorite is when she has sex during a picnic or something like that. she has this short dress removed and the rest you can go figure it out! renee rea also has a sexy sex scene where again, she demonstrates that beautiful cute faces can also perform great in soft core sex movies.the most memorable scene in my opinion comes near the ending. it's a double sex feature that has to do with hottub sex, intense sex! and kelli mccarthy receiving it real hard so loud that the couple in the hottub feel interrupted. the scene is long, steamy, very explicit, and fun. my favorite from 2001.the other good scenes include keli getting it on the woods (really kinky); then dressed as a bride. renne rea, always super gorgeous, dressed like a skater girl has a steamy sex scene. nice!please, watch this movie if you enjoy b-soft core sex. it's among the best from the new millennium. i had a blast with it.

this was a very nice soft-core movie for both men and women. plenty of nudity/sex, but without the overall raunch you'll usually find. they could not have done a better job in casting as the entire ensemble was stunning. trust me guys, if you want to get your woman in the mood, get something with bobby johnston in it! and i'm sure lovely monique parent, samantha mcconnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual male. unfortunately, bobby and monique do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do, please pm me! i'd love to know. the photography was much better than usual. so was the story. predictable, but nice, sweet natured and romantic. at the very least it was not one of those annoying predictable murder mysteries full of bottle blonde women with huge fake breasts. i give this 7/10!

don't know what film or version jeff saw, but this entire film was awesome, not just poitier and going. the story was riveting, suspenseful and engaging. and for the guy complaining about historical accuracy, get real. yes there were some black deputy marshals in the indian territory, but they had no authority to arrest whites outside of indian territory. as a rule, they did not "patrol" but exercised warrants on criminals only. i did find it odd that corby didn't seem to have "any' indian friends. i know their numbers were diminished but it still strikes me as strange. even as corby returned to his people, his indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless.

a milestone in cinematic history, 'bronenosets potyomkin' is one of the handful of great films out there that richly deserves to be called a classic. it was the picture that made sergei m. eisenstein a figurehead of film-making at the time. and today, it is still remembered as the wonderful piece of cinema it always has been.'potyomkin' is a film that needs to be seen as one entity, not to be picked at. don't just watch those clip shows where they only present the 'odessa steps' sequence and then move on to 'citizen kane' or 'the godfather', see it all in it's glorious 75-minute running time to really understand and enjoy it. don't expect every infinitesimal detail to be perfect though, i mean the acting of the '20s silent era makes 'scooby doo' look like a master of understated realism, certain plot points may seem illogical and some of the battle sequences look dated, but it is still an immensely enjoyable movie.the most memorable moments in the film are the mutiny on the battleship, vakulinchuk's body falling off the ship, the sailor under the tent at the end of the pier, the mother holding her dead child, the baby carriage on the odessa steps and the lion rising up to roar as further carnage ensues. for each new pair of eyes that look upon it, 'the battleship potemkin' comes alive once again.

battleship potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece. the direction ofeisenstein is truly a sight. the film chronicles a ship of disgruntledsailors who are tired of being mistreated by their superior officers.eventually, the sailors finally have enough of the abuse and send theofficers packing. during this time period, there was a shortage of filmstock in the soviet union. the goverment wanted to get their messageout to the people so they started a national film company and one ofthe members was sergei eisenstein. the films were shot on minisculebudgets and the shortage of film stock forced eisentein to be carefuland selective with the footage that he shot. in the end, eisenstein hadto reuse footage in order to make a feature length picture.the most famous of the action set pieces in this film is the muchtalked about massacre on the steps. this scene was spoofed in bananas and most recently in brian de palma's the untouchables. if you want tolearn film-making, i strongly advise you to watch battleship potemkin.it's one of the essentials.a+

quite a lot has been said about this film and its landmark importance in forming the language of film. if you are interested in film history, to truly understand the innovations eisenstein brings to the medium you might try viewing potemkin along side most any film made before it (those of d.w. griffith offer a good contrast). it should be allowed that eisenstein was not the only montage theorist and the principles of montage editing would likely have been discovered by another given time. however, even today, few directors have approached the skill with which eisenstein created meaning through the combination of images at such an early point in the evolution of the medium.if you are not interested in that sort of thing, potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made. you should see it, buy it, and tatoo it to your chest.

if you're a film student, or were one, or are thinking of becoming one, the name battleship potemkin has or will have a resonance. sergei eistenstein, like other silent-film pioneers like griffith (although eisenstein's innovations are not as commonplace as griffith's) and murnau, has had such an impact on the history of cinema it's of course taken for granted. the reason i bring up the film student part is because at some point, whether you'd like it or not, your film professor 9 times out of 10 will show the "odessa stairs" sequence of this film. it's hard to say if it's even the 'best' part of the film's several sequences dealing with the (at the time current) times of the russian revolution. but it does leave the most impact, and it can be seen in many films showcasing suspense, or just plain montage (the untouchables' climax comes to mind).montage, which was not just eistenstein's knack but also his life's blood early in his career, is often misused in the present cinema, or if not misused then in an improper context for the story. sometimes montage is used now as just another device to get from point a to point b. montage was something else for eisenstein; he was trying to communicate in the most direct way that he could the urgency, the passion(s), and the ultimate tragedies that were in the russian people at the time and place. even if one doesn't see all of eisenstein's narrative or traditional 'story' ideas to have much grounding (kubrick has said this), one can't deny the power of seeing the ships arriving at the harbor, the people on the stairs, and the soldiers coming at them every which way with guns. some may find it hard to believe this was done in the 20's; it has that power like the passion of joan of arc to over-pass its time and remain in importance if only in terms of technique and emotion.of course, one could go on for books (which have been written hundreds of times over, not the least of which by eisenstein himself). on the film in and of itself, battleship potemkin is really more like a dramatized newsreel than a specific story in a movie. the first segment is also one of the great sequences in film, as a mutiny is plotted against the captain and other head-ups of a certain ship. this is detailed almost in a manipulative way, but somehow extremely effective; montage is used here as well, but in spurts of energy that capture the eye. other times eisenstein is more content to just let the images speak for themselves, as the soldiers grow weary without food and water. he isn't one of those directors who will try to get all sides to the story; he is, of course, very much early 20th century russian, but he is nothing else but honest with how he sees his themes and style, and that is what wins over in the end.some may want to check it outside of film-school, as the 'stairs' sequence is like one of those landmarks of severe tragedy on film, displaying the ugly side of revolution. eisenstein may not be one of the more 'accessible' silent-film directors, but if montage, detail in the frame, non-actors, and bolshevik themes are your cup of tea, it's truly one of the must sees of a lifetime.

written by science fiction veterans gerry and sylvia anderson. this space fantasy is aptly directed by robert parrish. experienced american astronaut colonel glenn ross(roy thinnes)agrees to a manned flight to the far side of the sun. the mission is to be controlled by jason webb(patrick wymark)and his euro sec space agency scientist john kane(ian hendry)will accompany ross. the two will explore a newly discovered planet that is in the same identical orbit as earth...except it is always hidden on the other side of the sun. ross is the only one to make it back to earth and has a very incredible story to tell. special effects may be better than the story line. nonetheless fun to watch. the cast also includes: lynn loring, loni von friedl, george sewell and herbert lom.

this movie is a gem...an undiscovered gerry anderson classic.the origins of both "ufo" and "space 1999" are obvious from this movie, including the cast list which includes the late ed bishop and george sewell who both went onto "ufo".it is unfortunate that anderson, despite his many tv successes, did not get a chance to develop his talent on the big screen. just think what he could have done with the movie version of "thunderbirds" (which he quite rightly disowned himself from!).i'm sure if you give "jttfsots"/"doppleganger" a fair chance you'll appreciate it's good qualities.

this movie has been a favorite of mine and is entwined with the christmas holidays for me for two reasons: (1) growing up in the 1960s, everything was space-related from advertising to television programs and even santa claus found himself in spaceships during that era; and (2) i saw this movie during a christmas shopping trip when i was ten years old and it brought back fond memories of my favorite tv shows when i was even younger ("supercar", fireball xl5", and "stingray",). therefore, i am a tad biased when it comes to this movie for personal reasons.that said, as a long-time student of film, this is mainly a movie for fans of gerry anderson (and barry gray; oh, that gorgeous score!) whereas the casual movie-watcher will be put off by the future-vision-from-the-past (dig those wild cars, commercial aircraft, clothes, etc.) and the so-called "plot twist" which will cause some to groan. however, if you can look past the post-"2001: a space odyssey" desire to make a science fiction film with a "far out" story line, and if you enjoy imaginative special effects, then you will enjoy this gem from an era when man had just walked on the moon and people were still looking up at the stars in wonder and hope for the future rather than looking down at the banal trappings of the actual 21st century.

i'm a huge space buff, and at nearly 44, i've just discovered this flick for the first time. i came at it in a roundabout way from space 1999, then ufo. i went hunting for other anderson creations and found this was their first live-action work. what a home run! i actually heard about this movie many years ago, but never knew what it was called, so i'm happy to have found it by accident.these andersons were nothing short of amazing in their writing, the execution of the completely believable and realistic-looking models, the quality of acting, etc.i don't think it looks dated at all. let me tell you... i'll take good old models over the fake-looking cgi crap of today any time! seriously, most of the rocket scenes looked pretty real. they had it down to a science! if you choose to think of what you are looking at as real, it isn't hard to actually believe it.also, the amount of detail in set designs, the beautiful photography, the whole look... man, i wish i could go back to that time! they knew how to make great movies in the 60's. personally, i've lost all interest in hollywood movies today. anybody with a budget can do cgi. i hate it! bring back the models! think of all the people that style employed! anyway, i am ranting. :-) if you like good sci-fi that's very well-done, you will do yourself a service by watching this.

i first saw this in the 70s on syndicated tv and admired its production values, which were high tech for the time. the remastered video is rich and colorful, far more intense then the pale 35 mm tv prints. this movie deserves more attention: it paved the way for ufo, space: 1999 and even star wars with its detailed miniatures and cleverly conceived gadgets. sure, the story of an alternative anti-matter planet earth has been recycled a hundred times since star trek, but the beauty of this film is its self-conscious european flair for design: from the rolls royce space engines to the "euro sec" letterhead business paper, jfss or dopplegangers as it was called in europe is enjoyable for the imaginary vision of europe in space in the shadow of the superpowers. gerry and sylvia anderson's ambitious epic gets a little tedious when the american astronaut finally realizes that he is on the doppleganger earth, and everything is literally downhill after the poetically graceful shuttle boarding sequence. a mediocre story is helped along by a grand and lyrical classical score by the late great barry gray, the john williams of britain.

i have fond memories of watching this visually dazzling film as a child in the late 70s/early 80s on wor-tv (now upn-9) in ny. though a product of the swinging 60s, this film has hardly aged. the effects are just as wonderous as 2001, and in some ways superior (the model work is flawless). with an attractive cast, great color photography and set design, and an evocative score, jttfsots is a winner!

more and more french cinema demonstrates that's the only one able to confront hollywood's, and to spend high amounts on money in their movies. if bon voyage had been made in the usa no one would be surprised. perfectly set in france, in the 40's, when the nazi invasion, technically irreproachable, and with some of the most international french actors (depardieu, adjani, ledoyen...). bon voyage centerers on two parallel stories: an scientific and his disciple (ledoyen) who tries to hide one of his discoveries (a kind of water that may work as an atomic bomb) from the nazis; and a poor guy in love with a well known actress (adjani), which ends up in prison accused of a crime he's not committed in order to protect her. bon voyage seems to have been made in the old style, without unnecessary camera movements and effects. without big turns in the plot. as i said before, regarding to the production itself they've made a great job. but the main problem with this movie is about the script. is it a spy-movie? a romantic comedy? a spy comedy? a comedy of intrigue? it's not clear. that makes bon voyage a little unbalanced. when you think you're watching a comedy, suddenly changes to another story-line, a more dramatic one, more slow... i think they should've focused in one of the lines of argument (the one about the spy plot) and left the romantic parts in the background.my rate: 6.5/10

an interesting pairing of stories, this little flick manages to bring together seemingly different characters and story lines all in the backdrop of wwii and succeeds in tying them together without losing the audience. i was impressed by the depth portrayed by the different characters and also by how much i really felt i understood them and their motivations, even though the time spent on the development of each character was very limited. the outstanding acting abilities of the individuals involved with this picture are easily noted. a fun, stylized movie with a slew of comic moments and a bunch more head shaking events.7/10

when i went to see bon voyage, i expected a good, skillful multidrama on the order of grand hotel (1932) and les enfants de paradis (1944). it was better than that. with few exceptions, none of the characters were totally good or totally evil--just as in real life. the acting was wonderful, especially those who played frÃ©dÃ©ric, raoul, and camille. the photography was amazing, as it recreated the period perfectly and managed to be shot in/around bordeaux during a time of new public works but managed the "look" of june 1940. costumes and make-up were accurate. there is so much in this movie that it's worth a second viewing. it's exciting, funny, and, ultimately, touching. n.b.--be sure to see it in a theatre with good quality projection. it's in wide-screen, and in the theater where i saw it (the clairmont in montclair) the first 30 minutes had the subtitles at the bottom in focus but the actors' faces slightly fuzzy! this was ultimately corrected but detracted from the pleasure of the film.

on its surface, this is one of the most classically entertaining action/comedy/romance films i've seen in a long time, reminding me of pleasurable old "saturday-afternoon" movies that had just the right balance of unexpected twists, well-timed humor and integrated action. beyond this, though, there is our knowledge of this film's context. it has the same elements of "casablanca," but is set just before many of the characters would truly understand the seriousness of what was happening to their country (and the world) and the consequences of some of their own behavior. this adds a strong note of irony to the humor (we sense that one of the female characters has a radical change of hairstyle in her future). this is a film that you will not regret watching.

"bon voyage" has the fast pace that in some ways reminds me of the indiana jones/star wars films -- it's as if you're on a fast train or roller coaster.it's billed as a romance, mystery, thriller, and farce; it's all of that and more including candid observations on the reactions of french society during the nazi invasion at the start of wwii. and it's also an exhibition of juggling that involves 7 main characters. the scenes all seemed historically accurate (to my eyes) and gave an excellent feeling for the period.all of the actors were well cast and gave great performances but imo the most superb was that by isabelle adjani who played the role of an opportunistic, self-centered french movie star; not only did she quite convincingly play the role of a young actress perhaps half her age but she also played her amorous wiles convincingly yet in such a way that the audience sees she's only half serious and more complex as a person than just a gold digger. her character and energy propel the film through from beginning to end. it wasn't until i read roger ebert's review that i discovered she was 48 years old at the time of the film. what beauty!!i appreciated the ending -- it's satisfying but lets you write your own conclusion as to what happens to the main characters. as another user commenter observed -- do not arrive late; you need to be there from the opening scene. good advice.i gave it 9 of 10.

director and auteur jean-pierre rappenau was 8 years old during the spring of 1940 as france's third republic disintegrated in a matter of a few weeks. it was a time, he says, when "all the adults were a little bit insane." he and the production staff have lovingly and meticulously recreated that world in a film where all the characters are essentially fictional. the structure, a classic farce, is ideal for the period as multiple plot lines zip and intersect only to come together in a logical, satisfying conclusion. the peg for this plot is frederic, played by brilliant newcomer gregory derangere, who is fully up to playing opposite adjani, depardieu and ledoyen. the real strength of the film is in its supporting performances. m. rappeneau has cast the film exquisitely with actors who volunteered ideas for both action and dialogue and who know and prove that it is possible to fully realize a character with just two short sentences of dialogue. though not yet as widely influential as renoir's 'rules of the game,' 'bon voyage' richly deserves to be a companion piece to that classic. though it demands a lot of the audience, it gives much back. one of its demands is tolerance for a certain coyness and misdirection as to the exact genre we are watching: a crime melodrama, no, a spy thriller, ah, a romantic comedy. recommend it to cinemaphile friends. just be sure to let them discover for themselves that it is a romantic comedy.

in paris, a few months before the nazi invasion, the manipulative actress viviane denvers (isabelle adjani) uses her former sweetheart frÃ©dÃ©ric auger (grÃ©gori derÃ ngere) to hide the body of a man killed by her. frÃ©dÃ©ric hits the car, the dead man is found and he is sent to prison. when the germans invade france, frÃ©dÃ©ric escapes with another prisoner, raoul (yvan attal), and they become friends. in the runaway to bordeaux, they meet in the train camille (virginie ledoyen), the young assistant of the physicist professeur kopolski (jean-marc stehlÃ©), who is trying to leave france with his research of heavy water. once in bordeaux, the group meets viviane with her new lover, the minister of state jean-Ã©tienne beaufort (gÃ©rard depardieu), and is chased by a german spy, the journalist alex winckler (peter coyote), while paris is falling and the population is confused. what a delightful and magnificent romantic adventure "bon voyage" is! the excellent and complex screenplay has action, romance, war, comedy, espionage, drama and lots of characters, played by a fantastic cast, indeed a constellation of stars; the direction is stunning; the music score is wonderful. i really loved this marvelous film, and i have to finish my review due to my limitation of adjectives to describe such a gem. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "viagem do coraÃ§Ã£o" ("travel of the heart")

it's wartime drama - wwii, with french and jews and germans, but this one is somehow fun, earnestly so. director jean-paul rappeneau co-wrote the script to his well-received film "bon voyage" (2003). unlike director bertrand tavernier's "safe conduct" aka "laissez-passer" (2002), w-d rolf schubel's "gloomy sunday" (1999), or w-d claude berri's "lucie aubrac" (1997), "bon voyage" is as chipper as its title sounds - c'est la vie (whatever) - and we have the beautiful talented isabelle adjani to thank for. it is her delightful performance throughout as the center of attraction (and attention), the cause and effect of it all, that made the film so enjoyable as it is. hell, what's another derailment of her plan and expectations - will worry about that another time. the backbone of the story does revolve around a pair of young enthusiasts: grÃ©gori derangÃ¨re as frÃ©dÃ©ric and virginie ledoyen (from francois ozon's "8 women") as camille. the incomparable gÃ©rard depardieu, the witty yvan attal (of "my wife is an actress") and versatile peter coyote (juggling french, english and german here) are some of the stellar cast involved. there are many characters coming and going in this plot of a movie, and how it's all juggled is a skilful knack that requires no analysis - rappeneau is simply a genius. the story just builds upon itself, one episode after another, or even with overlapping events, but never confusing - that's the delight of it all, somehow every detail turns out right on the screen and we just lap it all up like a tastily presented french dessert, literally so. there's thrills, trills, tender hesitant moments and taut ominous escapes, all playing out in front of our eyes.  from reading the director's note on the sony pictures classics' bon voyage official site, rappeneau indicated this is his most personal and successful work ever. depicting bordeaux 1940 from memories of his childhood years is very much close to his heart and he "had worked and reworked the script for almost 3 years." this film is a labor of love all round, the cast and crew complementing the director's passion and a formidable script by collaborative writers along with the director and his son julien - adaptation efforts by gilles marchand, patrick modiano, and jÃ©rÃ´me tonnerre.music by gabriel yared (varied in tone from his previous film scores like "the english patient" or "talented mr. ripley"), who provided a befitting theme that kept the pace and rhythm of the plot going - almost like a train going non-stop, reflecting adjani's viviane's vivacious energy (even when she's tired), keeping her going as she meets whatever comes, walking on with head held high and stylish attire always, no looking back, let alone time for regrets. ah, mustn't forget the wonderfully translated, skilful subtitles by ian burley, who also did subtitles for films in italian: "bread and tulips" (2000) aka pane e tulipani, "the last kiss" (2001) aka l'ultimo bacio, and tom tykwer's "heaven" (2002).if you find this much too light a wartime relationship drama, try w-d mÃ¤x fÃ¤berbÃ¶ck's "aimÃ©e and jaguar" (1999, in german, based on a true story) with brilliant performances from juliane kÃ¶hler as aimÃ©e and maria schrader as jaguar.

this movie travels farther on 8 gunshots, 2 kisses and 100 clichÃ©s than should be possible. yet it still works. brilliant.as i was driving home from the theater, i tried to figure out how it got away with movie staples like the pages of a novel manuscript blowing across a beach or the impossible series of fortuitous coincidences without the entire audience standing up and screaming, "i've seen that a million times before! and you've pushed beyond the edge of believability!" but the actors were so enchanting and the screen so filled with believable extras that i forgot to care. a friend who saw it with me said it transported him to paris so perfectly that he was disappointed when we left the theater and realized we were still in indiana.overall, a romantic-comedy-thriller with subtlety, wit and elan.

giant robot was the most popular japanese tv serial ever seen on indian tv. it was targeted to children and we saw a robot for the first time in our life. many indian children must have even seen a machine for the first time outside the school textbooks. the serial also showed a child in an adults organization fighting evil. no doubt, many of us who have seen giant robot in our childhood long for our own robots and as a stopgap arrangement look upon our computers in the same way. this show also portrayed ideal adults, (referring at jerry, johnny's buddy friend and unicorn chief azuma). we grew to respect japanese progress and still view japan as the ideal asian nation.btw, at that time, there were no satellite tv channels in india and the govt owned broadcaster did not show much of disney cartoons. i guess that was how child serials like giant robot got appreciated. nowadays there is pokemon etc but they are no so fascinating or alluring as giant robot.

i have noticed that people have asked if anyone has this show. i have all 26 episodes that aired in the u.s. and will be willing to share these with anyone interested. all i require is that you supply the vhs tapes or blank dvd's i have them on both formats and pay for shipping. my email is creator67@pipinternet.net, just send me an email and your request and i will notify you and we can make the arrangements. the quality is very good and they are very enjoyable to watch especially if you have not been able to see them since they aired in the 60's. it was one of my favorite shows as a child and hold a very special place in my heart because it brings back a lot of memories of my childhood as well as other shows like ultraman and astroboy.peter

i'm doing a thesis on blurring the boundaries: the female cross dresser and am using tipping the velvet the book as my main text, any comments on gender and sexual identity, gender and sexual confusion, gender as a performance, gender as a fiction, gender imagery, cross-dressing as an erotic fantasy and as revolution, the effect of the male costume etc etc would be much appreciated! but a bit off the point has anyone seen sergio toledo's 1987 film vera? its about a young lesbian possibly transsexual cross dresser..i'm dying to see it because i think it'd be really helpful...does anyone know where i might get a copy of it? i've tried amazon and a few other sites but no luck...

this was recommended to me by a friend that said it was cute and cuddly for a "lesbian sexuality flick". boy was he wrong. i guess he just didn't get it. growing up not understanding and then discovering yourself thru trial and tribulation is more like it.the characters are full and vibrant and the story has enough fun thrown in thru the theater performances to keep anyone interested.rachael stirling as "nan" goes thru so many tries at finding the love she desires only to find it was the one person she was scared to reveal all too, and ran out on. johdi may as "flo" was remarkable. spent a couple hours trying to recall where i've seen her before, only to discover she was the quiet sister "alice" in "last of the mohicans" luckily,i was raised in a liberal family and had no issues with trying a movie like this. so many people are missing out on flicks like this. i'm glad i took my friend's advise and tried it. but, i'm sure i enjoyed it more the he.

i have to say it is a sign that this film appeals to all ages if somebody by right should be shielding themselves away from anything remotely homosexual absolutely loves this thing.i thought every last bit of this film was amazing and the casting was superb, but i have to say anna chancellor...where have you been all my life.having previously seen anna in several other things i was completely blown away by how magnificent she was.diana letherby may not be the most lovable of the characters but she could certainly take me home if she fancied...

this drama apparently caused a bit of a stir six years ago when it debuted on television - not taking in much tv news myself, it passed under the radar; but after having seen it, i'm not surprised that it did cause a stir. not particularly because of the content (although it is a bit more 'offbeat' than the usual tv fodder) - it has more to do with the reactionary media in this country. anyway, this three part series is based on a book by sarah waters and puts its main focus on lesbians - although the plot also has room to explore some other 'dark' sides of sexuality. our main character is an oyster girl named nan (short for nancy) from winchester. she is bewitched by female to male drag performer kitty butler after seeing her at a theatre show and soon begins attending all of her shows - eventually catching the eye of the performer and becoming her dresser. it's not long before kitty is offered a chance to play on bigger stages in london and having become good friends with nan, she invites her along for the ride. the act gets bigger when nan takes to the stage also and the pair becomes a stage duo...but kitty breaks nan's heart, leading her into an odyssey within london's seedy underbelly.i must admit that my dvd collection contains no shortage of sleazy and sordid films so there wasn't anything in this one that was enough to shock me. despite being rather jaded to it, i have to say that i'm still surprised at anyone who says this film went too far; naturally there is some lesbian sex and other stuff, but it's never exploitative or overused and the film really couldn't have been made without it. the main focus is always on the story; and the story is really well done. the film is almost three hours long in total, but if anything that isn't long enough to get everything across. sarah waters is obviously an inventive writer, and the film remains interesting for the duration. the acting is solid as you would expect, but i must admit that i found lead actress rachael stirling awkward and hard to get on with at first; although she grows into her role well as the film progresses. the execution is a little bit of a problem and director geoffrey sax is a bit too gimmicky for my liking. the story does get a little bit sappy towards the end also, which is a shame because this film is at it's strongest during the dark moments (episode 2 being the high point of three for me). there's not really a defined point to the film - or at least not one that i could see. that's not important as far as i'm concerned; however, as tipping the velvet tells a good story and more than surpassed my expectations. worth checking out, for people that like this sort of stuff.

this is a superb tv series, it's sympathetic and for once realistic! portrayal of lesbian women is delicately handled and well done. on top of that the directing is wonderful and the settings sumptuous and rich, a real treat. if you missed the first one i advise you watch next weeks, 9pm, bbc 2

so far only the first episode has been shown, and a great fuss has been made about the lesbian sex scenes. but for those who bother to look past that they will find an incredibly beautiful love story and one that has in this episode ended in an upsetting climax/cliffhanger. i have found the story so powerful that i have been inspired to read the novel on which this fantastic series has been based.

the andrew davies adaptation of the sarah waters' novel was excellent. the characters of nan and and kitty were superbly portrayed by rachael stirling and kelley hawes respectively. the whole series was a total joy to watch. it caught the imagination of everyone across the board, whether straight or gay. i wish there could be a sequel!

this is one of the best lesbian films i have ever seen! this series brought joy and sadness of true love. being set in the 1800's was an amazing look at lesbian lives and desires of lesbian women. the cast was beyond expectation! rachael stirling is an amazing actress, i have never seen her other works but her portrayal of nan made me connect with her feeling her heartache and pains and love. the one thing i feel most important is connecting with the characters in anything i watch. if anyone has doubts on seeing this film...think twice! this is a must see series. well done again to bbc! we need more lesbian films that portrays real love and hurts, like this one. living in canada i had this dvd imported and i am so thrilled to have purchased it.

the bbc surpassed themselves with the boundaries they crossed with tipping the velvet. in the past they've been 'daring' with dennis potter's works but this mini-series (as it was screened in the uk) is superb. andrew davies work is top notch - i've not read the sarah water's novel but i can imagine he's done it real justice. i comment on the bawdiness - most men have watched it for that - proved to be a main talking and selling point when originally advertised. the fact is, it portays the lesbian side of society in the 1800s - a time when most thought it was old men and rent boys - well it was - lesbianism took place mainly behind closed and often respectable doors.you can also look at tipping the velvet as a 'love story' - it actually is - as well as 'self discovery' that many gay/bi and straight people go through and comments on this occur and repeat all the time.if you've not seen it yet - either repeated on tv or on dvd - get it - you'll be in for a treat - and even the production and filming of it is perfect. just try to hide your blushes in parts - like i said - 'bawdy' is the order of the day - and beware a 'phallus' or two!enjoy!

this was one of the most emotional movies i have seen. passion, pleasure, pain, despair, sorrow, healing, cleansing and love.the entire movie was spellbinding. everything was done so well; the adaptation from the book, the actors, the sets, the camera shots.this movie touched me deeply in so many ways. it reminded me of the despair that loosing your love can have, and the time it takes to heal that wound. you may love again, but will always be risking the pain that comes with separation. is this not one of the most important age-old questions?"is it better to have love and lost? than to never have loved before?" -ascension

over the weekend i watched the movie tipping the velvet and if i was to have to score this movie out of 100 i would have to give it 100 no question asked. i am a true believer in true love and this movie moved me in alot of different ways and the actors fit the parts without a doult. but i have to say that the ending was not so great for i did not see that spark in nancys eyes when ever she looked into flo's eyes, as her eyes sparked each time she looked at kitty, kitty only had to be in the room or in nancy's thought and nancy would just glow fron that spark. kitty told nancy that she could not find her and that she looked for her, but could not find her. kitty was ready to give it all up to get nancy back. in kitty's eyes you could see kitty's pain. i believe that nancy should have let kitty see that thier love is true and strong and that she would not let her go that easy. you need to make a part two and have the two make it together, but you must not let anyone else play the roles it has to be the real kitty & nancy or it'll never work. my mother once told me that true love is just not real. i am no fool i know that we all have a true love out someplace just waiting for each of us and i believe with my life that nancy's true love really is only kitty and kitty's true love is only nancy. come on lets play the game the right way, the only way. let nancy's eyes shine again.... kitty lost her everything, by losing nancy. and kitty is not to be the only one to blame. i am gay myself and being gay is not easy!! wake up!!! in 1889 i'd not want to be gay, kitty was lost deep inside herself and in 1889 maybe the right thing to do was to be married to a man. even though you love a woman. kitty needed nancy to stand up to her needed nancy to fight for her. myself i remember how deeply i loved this girl and i let her get away because i thought i was doing something wrong and i went back to my ex-boyfriend. i thought i was doing the right thing, but i know i was wrong to let go of her and i will pay for the rest of my days,for like kitty i could not find her anyplace. i heard that she is married to a man in the u.s.a someplace. i even heard that he beats her. i guess in the end we both lose. give the two girls one more chance life can be very lonely if you are not true to you and your loved one.thank you, kristen ann

the andrew davies adaptation of the sarah waters' novel was excellent. the characters of nan and and kitty were superbly portrayed by rachael stirling and kelley hawes respectively. the whole series was a total joy to watch. it caught the imagination of everyone across the board, whether straight or gay. i wish there could be a sequel!

both the book and the film are excellent in their own right. they do differ slightly but that enhances and not detracts from what is an excellent script and acting. the historical atmosphere, the young girl looking for love, the amazing background of music hall and the voyage into the lesbian world of london early twentieth century make this an exceptional movie. andrew davies as the scriptwriter excels himself as he writes this lesbian love story with such sensitivity. rachael sterling and keeley hawes are both excellent actresses and give these parts their best. the rest of the cast are very good. if there was higher than 10 out of 10 i would give it!

this bbc series is astonishingly good fun. i'd only seen a few minutes before i knew i had to own it and watch it again with all my friends. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone prudish, but almost anyone else is going to enjoy it--from the cinema snob to the entertainment-hungry masses. the lead character is a lesbian, but it's still worth watching if that's not your thing.rachael stirling is incredible in a lead role that stretches her into a dazzling assortment of emotions and situations, some of a bizarre nature. no one who saw this series would ever say she can't act. she makes us laugh, cry, get turned on and slap our foreheads in amazement.you can't really compare this story to anything else. it's not a rehash of style or plot. it's entirely it's own beastÂ—part comedy, historical drama, erotica, coming-of-age tale, musical and more.gotta praise the bbc for making this story. i can't imagine anyone in the (overly prudish and formulaic) u.s. ever doing it. so, stop reading about it and go buy it.

when i rented this movie, i half expected it to be a low budget, plot less indy film, but thought i'd give it a try. i started watching part 1 and couldn't pull myself away till it ended 3 hours later. it was by far one of my absolute favorite films of all time. from the writing to the directing to the performances, i was laughing, crying, and singing all the way through nan astley's rite of passage from innocence to adulthood. rachael stirling is phenomenal in this film. i had never heard of her before, but now i will forever remember the vulnerability and strength i felt in her performance. she, keeley hawes, and jodhi may are incredible as they guide you through the emotional turmoils that most feel as they deal with an alternate form of sexuality. the fact that the film is set in the 1890's not only educates the audience about homosexuality in that time period, but makes a statement about our society today. you must see this film and, probably like myself, you'll be making a trip to the store to add it to your collection.

i love this movie. i watched it over and over when i rented it from netflix.it had a lot of substance and meaning for me. i think many people will enjoy it.i have read and seen quite a few lesbian stories over the years and am happy to say they are getting better and better in how they are presented.they tend to have a more positive feel for the life style and feeling's of gay women.its nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this society.i think it is apparent that more and more movies with this theme will grace our theaters and tv screens.many producers and directors are realizing that lesbians live very full and wholesome lives and that we have wonderful stories that should and can be seen by individuals as well as families without hesitation.

a young woman leaves her provincial life for a new one in the city and there she meets another woman with whom she falls in love with. their relationship turns physical quickly and they both believe that they are soul-mates, until one day, the provincial girl comes home to find a man in their bed. her lover then reveals to her that their relationship was just an experiment and she really likes men. um, kinda like the anne heche and ellen degeneres thing. so, anyway, the provincial girl, broken, torn and shattered by this discovery moves out and begins to discover what the real world is all about as she falls into the hands of all sort of vindictive and salacious people in 19th century england.

i loved this movie. not because of the romantic story lines between women, but for the visualization of human strength, despair, and liberation. this film is a must see. entertaining! emotional! captivating! all the characters are very well written and portrayed by some very talented actors. this story is a story of self discovery and sexual awakening. a journey of the mind, body and soul. you find yourself identifying with the characters and at some points, even the storyline. i do have to say that i recommend watching the movie first, then read the book. if you read the book first, you will be slightly disappointed. the screenplay adaption cut out a lot and some things were changed. some for the better and some for the worst.

tipping the velvet (2002) (tv) was directed by geoffrey sax for bbc television. the basic plot is a coming-of-age story for the protagonist, nan astley, played well by rachael stirling. as a teenager, nan works in her family-run oyster house. everyone expects her to stay at home, then marry an appropriate husband, and settle down to family life. nan expects this too.everything changes when nan meets kitty butler (keeley hawes) a beautiful and talented performer who dresses in men's clothes and captures the hearts of her audience. the audience includes nan, who is sexually attracted to kitty in a way in which she's not attracted to her boyfriend. the remainder of the film follows nan to london and through her ups (sort of) and her downs (horrible) as a lesbian and sometimes male impersonator. as is typical for the bbc, every role, no matter how small, is performed by an excellent actor. the bbc has a depth and breadth of performing artists that is truly marvelous. none of the supporting actors stands out in my mind--they were uniformly good. both stirling and hawes are wonderful, and their acting carries the film along.it's always sad to be reminded of how difficult life can be for someone who doesn't fit society's mold for what is normal. i know it isn't easy for lesbians even in the u.s., even today. imagine the obstacles to love and happiness for lesbians in victorian england. we've come a long way, but we still have a long way to travel.

all you need is great house, a babysitter and a phone. simon west directs this thrilling and chilling remake of the 1979 original. this version is more of a thriller than a horror flick. emotionally tense with an escalating fear factor. jill johnson(camilla belle)needs to work off an excessive cell phone bill; she takes on the task of babysitting the two children of dr. and mrs. mandrakis(derek de lint and kate jennings grant). the house is a beautiful 1970ish wood and glass masterpiece. secluded and peaceful. the kids are already in bed, the wind builds and is joined by down-pouring rain. the phone begins ringing, ringing, ringing. the babysitter is soon in a frantic mode of survival in fear of the creepy stranger on the other end of the phone.belle is great as the innocent, smart and strong teen babysitter. the voice of the stranger on the phone is that of lance henriksen, while the physical stranger is played by tommy flanagan. also featured are: katie cassidy and brian geraghty. kudos to james dooley for the atmospheric original music.

people say that this film is a 'typical teen horror movie'... well it's a horror movie with a teenage girl in it.. what do you expect! it's a good film, i counted 3 actual screams in the audience whilst the film was on and it was a very jumpy scary film. i wasn't bored in the film at any point and i was even on the edge of my seat at one point. the only thing that was slightly bad was that it was a tiny bit slow in getting into the actual storyline but this all led up to why she was where she was and why what happened, happened. the acting was good, the scenery was good and the storyline was good too, i hope to see a 'when a stranger calls 2' in a few months! good film!

if you have ever babysat in a house you didn't know, or if you saw the original and enjoyed it then this will be a good choice. ignoring the reviews and what was posted here, i went ahead and rented this movie because of the memories of how the original scared me as a teen. this movie has (of course)changed some of the original story to relate to todays teens, such as the babysitter is in trouble for going over on her cell phone minutes and has to take on a babysitting job to pay her bill. however, it sticks to the original story line pretty well. if you can relate to the babysitter, not knowing the house and it's usual pops and cracks it is quite suspenseful. when the killer is shown he is very creepy and you find yourself yelling at the girl to "get out of the house". if you have never babysat or been in a situation like this then you probably will not be able to relate and will not like it. it's all about understanding her fear.

i haven't seen "hardware wars" in years, but i remember it as one of the most hilarious events of human experience, and it was over far too soon. every aspect of this movie was hilarious, and it was even better than "star wars." i laughed. i cried. after watching it, i asked a family member for a moment with three dollars just so i could kiss it goodbye (i'm kidding about the last one). i love it when ham salad's sidekick/co-pilot tries to eat princess anne droid's cinnamon hair buns, and the darph nader character is just hilarious! this film would be great to watch back-to-back with "thumb wars," and i sincerely wish there could have been a "hardware wars, episode ii: the umpire strikes out." (was there?)

nothing is sacred. just ask ernie fosselius. these days, everybody has a video camera, and a movie is hardly out before the spoofs start flying, quickly written and shot, and often posted directly to the internet. spoofs are hot these days, and we go out of our way to make sure filmmakers don't get off on their own self-importance. 25 years ago, when the first star wars was made, it was a different world. filmmaking was the playground of a select few and spoofs were very rare. then god gave us hardware wars. it was shot to look cheap (or was it just cheap?) and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact. does that take away from the experience? heck no! that's what makes it so great! it was raw and unpolished, and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie. from fluke starbucker waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber (i did that when i was young!) to chewchilla the wookie monster, to auggie ben doggie's "nah, just a little headache" remark, this film short is as much a part of the phenomenon as any of the actual star wars films. rent it. buy it. borrow it from a friend. and may the farce be with you. always.

i just want to say that this movie was excellent .i loved it from the beginning until the end. the acting was great .the director did an amazing job and i would like to see it again.jennifer tilly did a very good performance , the guy that interpreted his father (manny) was another great actor but i can not recall his name .i can't wait for el padrino ii.damian chapa looks so good and i think he is one of the most talented actors out there. there is pleanty of latin actors that do a great job like it is shown in this film!rent it!!! rent it !!! rent it !!!

i am finally seeing the el padrino movie, from what i can see it is an incredible film, and lots of action damian chapa is good director, but i must admit i love his acting the best.also i saw the behind the scenes it was edited by some lady named kinga, she needs to go back to school and learn how to edit.however the film el padrino is a pure 10 action epic. why cant most people who direct put together films that keep you wondering what the plot is? i am so happy to see someone i know to be a real great actor become a great director also.i am one of those people who love to see artists make it.b.s.

this film was one that i have waited to see for some time. i was glad to find it has been everything anticipated. the writing of this film has been so finely crafted and researched far beyond what is seen by the audience. i found it amusing that so many people watching will not read between some very important lines but indeed if not the movie will make sense in a different way and is very brilliant. the film has many stories and characters woven together around this one character kilo , a man whom has rose from the streets amidst many woes and become a very powerful criminal. after spending some time in prison kilo finds a loophole in the justice system and through a disturbing turn of events is released only to find everything is not at all what it seems. kilo finds himself going up against the higher realm of society and political royalty in order to make clear how important a man's word is and stands for. a war begins as the street is in arms against lords of wealth and corrupt power.a build up to explosive and powerful non stop twists and turns. this film will leave you riveted. i found the cast of this movie to be outstanding and is not a movie to be ignored. excellent. go rent it today!!

this movie was simply amazing.the writing was incredible as well as the directing and acting.the story instantly gets you interested.this movie is one of those movies that has your heart pounding the whole time.as always damian chapa is brilliant,his on screen acting is as powerful as any hollywood actor.the cast in this film is perfect.each character made the story more complete.the cinematography was captivating and it uplifted the movie.i was totally stuck to the screen and couldn't stop watching it,there was no getting up for popcorn or anything.this movie is one of the best all year,maybe even the best.definitely rent this movie,i recommend it this movie if u want to see great filmaking or just for pure entertainment.

or maybe not. whatever anyone thinks of "broadcast news," good or bad, almost all the credit for that "thinking" belongs to writer-producer-director james l. brooks. as a screenwriter (of which he has long been one of the best), it is not easy to savage an entire business -- in this case, the "business" being television news -- but to do it with a smile, a wink, a knowing nod and a laugh practically every step of the way. to do all that takes real talent, something mr. j. brooks has in abundance.one user on this website, in his summary, asked the musical question -- "did walter cronkite act like this?" answerve: no! of course not! and the reason for that is in walter's -- uh, mr. cronkite's -- day, the only thing that mattered was bringing the news to the people. same goes for john chancellor and chet and david and douglas edwards and howard k. smith. sure, they had to pay lip-service attention to their ratings, if only to please their bosses. but all they really cared about was the news itself.now, of course, all that has changed. for the last 25-30 years in the network news business, the only thing that has really mattered is ratings, ratings, ratings. the bottom line. how many bucks will our news division deliver for the network? don't believe that?let's consider "the big three": tom brokaw, dan rather and peter jennings (aka "stanley stunning"). all three have now been on the job at their respective anchor desks for the last 15-20 years (peter actually got his first shot at the national anchor desk way back in the 1960s but was totally unprepared for the job). of the three, dan is the one with the greatest in-the-field training as a reporter. personally, i think all three do terrific jobs as news anchors and are deserving of their positions. all of which has nothing to do with why all three are actually in those jobs. all three are now in their 60's (dan is pushing the big 7-0) and all three are still very good looking. and if you think they're still good looking now, imagine how good looking they were in their 40's, when all three were hired for (let's say, "put in") their current jobs. but do you honestly believe that any one of these three would have been "put in" had he looked like, let's say, fred gwynne ("herman munster"). or like -- heaven forfend -- me!!! not only that, if dan were retiring tomorrow, a younger (than he is today) walter cronkite would not be able to get his old job back. why? not pretty enough. and it would matter not a whit that he is, or once was, "the most trusted man in america." and this is what "broadcast news" is all about. tom grunnick (william hurt), the next pretty-boy-national-news-anchor-to-be who has trouble with a few minor things, such as thinking for himself, being able to write and knowing stuff. jane craig (holly hunter), the brilliant news producer with news business standards and ethics, all of which get thrown to the wind when even she falls for pretty-boy-tom. and aaron altman (albert brooks, no relation to james l.), a top-notch newswriter and field reporter who has no hope for a national job because he "flop-sweats" behind the anchor desk. and many other such flawed characters whom you know really do exist in the news divisions of the various networks."network" blazed the trail. eleven years later, "broadcast news" carried the torch as a worthy successor. in the new millennium, what will be the next movie to savage the business of network "news you can use" ..... maybe. or maybe not.

spoiler alert i have never seen comments on a movie, that i disagree with more then the comments people made on this. one could learn from critical viewings of this movie. as an educational film, i rate it highly because it teaches "how to succeed"! we do not watch movies to learn; we generally watch for entertainment. as entertainment, i rate it low: the ending is downbeat and cerebral/intellectual. this conflict results in my eight star rating. the movie follows jane craig (holly hunter), a television news producer. the network executive introduces tom grunnick (william hurt), to study for the on air news anchor position. tom immediately charms people with humbleness. another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity, aaron altman (albert brooks). altman knows all news stories, inside and out.the network executive wants grunnick on the air and jane argues, saying grunnick is not ready, he doesn't know the news. they do not listen to her. forced to place grunnick on the air, jane contacts altman to get information on the news story and relays altman's comments through an earpiece to grunnick while grunnick speaks. we watch the sharp contrast between altman's/jane craig's words and grunnick's, as grunnick skillfully rewords everything altman and jane craig say in his ear, in order to make it understandable, likable and entertaining the audience. altman gets a chance on air and the network execs require him to seek coaching from grunnick, the new guy. this new (news ingnorant) guy coaching him? this is something altman does not see justified, but agrees reluctantly. grunnick coaches altman and gets excited noting hundreds of altman's shortcomings in appearance, audio and vocabulary. altman never considered these things before, when he became an expert on the news itself. the complexity of understanding what grunnick taught him, causes altman to have a panicked sweating attack ("flop sweat") when he is on the air. grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and altman resigns prior to being fired. but grunnick fails in his attempt for a romance with jane craig, because she finds out from altman, that grunnick sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him. this turns her off of him. this sends the message that in relationships, we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them. this movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job, but it is especially true in broadcast news. there are many people commenting on how this is the dumbing down of tv news and how grunnick represents a good looking, but dumb guy or all style, but no substance. the opposite is true, grunnick possessed skills and very complex intellect, to get people to like him, including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds, when he is on camera (he coaches altman to punch a word in every sentence). grunnick's flaw that costs him the relationship with jane craig, is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation. many people are calling altman very intelligent or brilliant. altman played by brookes is not as intelligent as grunnick and the "flop sweat" scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that grunnick handles when on the air. altman is angered by this fact that he knew the news and grunnick suceeded more by getting people to like him. there are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the tv news industry. the concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job, is obviously, not popular, but my experience indicates it is true in most jobs. as an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, albeit unpopular. educational, yes, but it does not have an uplifting ending.

i was geared up to not like this movie, and the first 10 minutes or so did nothing to allay my fears. it starts off with 2 high school gangs squaring off against each other with bad kung-fu. a scenario found in countless other korean films. ho-hum. add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote "he was cool" (which was barely passable) and, well, i thought i was in for a nondescript 2 hours.but don't give up so quickly! "a romance of their own" was directed by tae-gyun kim, who also did "volcano high" (which i thought was loads of fun). anyway, "romance of their own" soon takes a turn much for the better. a high school girl, just having moved to seoul, finds herself in the middle of attention from two prospective suitors. each guy has his own merit, and it is not clear which one (if either) would be the right pick.what follows is not your usual teen love triangle. the emotions are complex, and while you may not agree with certain choices or actions as the film develops, you can certainly understand why the characters make them.the movie asks questions of the characters and the audience. who does one choose? at what point is one obligated to even make a choice (and is it unfair to one if it seems he is being strung along)? after you (or your heart) has made a choice, how do you react (and how *should* you react) when new information comes up that sheds new light on the situation? there is one scene, near the end, that is very subtle but perfectly captures what i think would be a real-life reaction instead of over-the-top "movie reaction." the subtlety is in a character in the background of the scene. recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed. basically, he doesn't know what to make of things. instead of having him "act out" something, or look all gape-mouthed dumbstruck, he just stares off at some fixed point unable to react or say anything at all. it's like someone just pulled the plug on him. his reaction rang true to me and i appreciated the scene.like most korean films, there is a mix of action, bravado, slapstick, and melodrama. korean films often take abrupt turns (see, "sex is zero" for a great example), which can be quite a shock for the uninitiated. go ahead and initiate yourself with this one. like it, love it, or hate it, i think most viewers will be able to relate to and appreciate the characters' actions and reactions.

let's face it.this movie is incredibly clichÃ©, as korean romance dramas and movies go. first of all, there's a pair of long-lost siblings, one of which falls in love with the other. second, there's a not-so-popular girl and two gorgeous, popular guys who fall for and fight over her. third, one of the characters suffers from a tragic disease, which, eventually, takes his life.still, i like this movie.without the right actors, this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel. but because the actors fit the roles perfectly, the movie is engrossing--i honestly couldn't stop watching. kang dong won, despite his pretty face, gives an awesome, heartrending performance, not to mention lee chung ah and jo han sun, plus all the supporting actors.i'd definitely recommend this movie to everyone.

i watched this because a friend told me it was damn good, and i watched a video on it, so i was really into watching it. i watched it, and, damn, the fighting scenes are really good. if the guys can't fight like that in real life, they sure fooled me. there isn't as much fighting as i would like, i have to say, but the fights that are in the movie are pretty spectacular. they don't show much, but you can tell it's violent and cool. but there's also the plot, that goes around a love triangle between the main characters, though it's a bit twisted. tae-sung is a carefree guy who seems to love getting into trouble, as well as fights. he's the leader of his school, and is the rival of hea-won, who's the leader of his own school - a bit of a playboy, hot-headed and a rich boy. then there's han-kyung, a girl with not a lot going for her - her father just passed away and she moved back with her mother, the guy she liked is dating her old friend -, and then she meets hea-won, who goes to her school, and tae-sung, who calls her "nuna" (older sister). eventually, she discovers tae-sung is her brother, fruit of one of her father's affair, and he loves her despite of their blood relation. meanwhile, hea-won falls for her, and takes her as his boyfriend. but she is torn between her boyfriend and her little brother, who confesses her love to her. overall, it's a wonderful movie, but if i was really depressed after the end, and i just couldn't help but think, damn, are all korean movie i watch about fighting/death/depressing stuff/incest?? 'cause that sure was the case with old boy, and temptation of wolves. it's a very good movie, but people have to be ready to cry at the end.

it's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead, this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little clichÃ© you cant help but like it.i think the story was a little rushed at the end, but extending that would have made the story even longer. superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with mr arrogant, and possibly tied with my tutor friend.it would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema, not as great as my sassy girl, but still good.

glorifying not glamorizing world war ii.we've had quite a few documentary series about world war ii on the regular television programming. without looking up any information in some encyclopedia or film book, it seems that this old memory can recollect most names entirely on it's own.there was crusade in europe,which was the title of the war memoirs of one general of the army and later the 33rd president of the united states of america, dwight d. eisenhower. it told the story of the conflict in europe as viewed by the supreme allied commander.then there was a crusade in the pacific(subject matter self-explanatory),which i don't remember much about. newspaper man/author, jim bishop was the host/navigator of battleline.and there was the excellent winston churchill, the valiant years.* the series was a co-production of the british broadcasting corporation and the american broadcasting company. it first aired in 1960-61 season here in the states and boasts of having richard burton's speaking the words of sir winston.it is the 1952 nbc television network's production of our subject matter today, this victory at sea that wins the cigar, hands down.to begin with, this had to have taken the production several years of carefully and literally sorting through thousands of hours of film. the movie footage referred to here was the official filmed record taken by members of the armed forces of the united states, independent newsreel film, motion picture record of our other allied partner nations,as well as captured axis pictures from nazi germany, fascist italy and imperial japan.once that was accomplished, the various corresponding film had to be cut and edited into a series of 1/2 hour installments. this was done with great skill, being that there were so many scene changes, whether done abruptly or as a dissolve. the look of ever episode appears as smooth as if it had been a single motion picture project.the writing of the spoken word to accompany this finest of real life film was no less amazing and unique. the highly polished and meaningful eloquence wastes not a word and at times even understates the description of action, rather than exaggerating it. the narration goes to mr. ralph graves, who was a talented actor of stage, film, radio and television. he certainly gained a measure of immortality by way of his golden toned voicing of the written episode descriptions.lastly, victory at sea enjoys the luxury of having an original score, both opening theme and incidental music, penned by richard rodgers of broadway fame.(rodgers & hart, rodgers & hammerstein) his compositions are intricate, full, variable and even "classic" in the true sense.the classical arrangement was played by the nbc sympphony orchestra under the direction of robert russell bennett and as a soundtrack record/cassette tape/compact disk, it has been continually available and in demand ever since its first release, 55 years ago! and, really small wonder, for it is this musical score that is so mesmerizing to the viewer/listener. it truly puts the frosting on this cake.* sir winston churchill, the valiant years also had a beautiful and highly memorable original score. this also was composed by mr. rodgers.** we had in additional "ace in the hole" in our house in the person of our father, the late clement j. ryan(1914-74). dad had been in the u.s.navy during the war, being inducted in 1943 or'44. our pop was always on hand to explain and further elucidate any of the situations that were depicted in the series.he and our mother the now 90 year old bertha (nee fuerst)ryan already had my older sister, joanne(1942-90)as a dependant.

i recently got the movie and all i can say it is a good movie. there's a lot of famous rome monuments and historical locations.it is from the same writer and director from the da vinci code. tom hanks stars along with ewan mcgregor and ayelet zurer. the movie starts out with the space and time experiment in sweden until one of the canisters is stolen by the church's most hated enemy the illuminati. the plot is hard to discuss about without spoiling anything. its a race all of rome following the illuminati trail to get to the illuminati secret meeting place. while racing against time to find the path of the illuminati. over all its a movie worth seeing hell i watched it 3 times and i still like it so in the end go buy it. it is a lot better than the movie 2010. and the ending has one awesome plot twist.

first i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than the da vinci code. sure, you have the religion vs science problem but it doesn't try to make a big statement about it. its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well. one scene particularly (that involves fire) i found extremely well done. second, the changes from book to film. although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others, i gotta admit i was wrong. it was refreshing that the film didn't follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in da vinci. if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though. however the big twist is still there so don't worry about that. finally i'm glad they removed some silly sub-plots and didn't even try to hint at the possibility of langdon and vittoria getting together. the performances are really good, but nothing out of the ordinary. that's okay for a film like this. i'd give it a 9/10, mainly because it delivers what it promises, entertainment, pure entertainment

so first things first..angels and demons is a much better and very different film than the da- vinci code.following the recent slew of comic book movies, remakes and questionable resurrections of aged franchises. it is refreshing to watch a very solid and entertaining film that is devoid of shaky cam filming techniques, lens flare, excessive gci and over the top action sequences.in this respect angels and demons almost feels old fashioned.it offers a good and considered debate on the age old subject of religion vs science, offers an insight in to the parallels between the grand houses of god in rome (beautifully shot by the way) and the temple of modern science that is cern's large hadron collider facility.hanks is hanks pretending to be the smart guy and he fits the role much better second time around than his wooden performance in da-vinci. good support is offered by a rock solid cast, with a particular highlight being armin mueller-stahl's stoic cardinal. but the films main saving grace is it's pace. for the entire running time i was totally engrossed in the story and the film never really gave me time to sit and pick apart its faults in logic.my only serious criticism is that some of the science depicted is at best debatable regards real world authenticity. but that is not the fault of the film makers, rather an observation of the old adage that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story..speaking of which the story is a cracker, mixing adventure and a race against time with a good sprinkling of intelligence and a nice twist or two along the way.overall i would highly recommend this to fans of either of the national treasure movies (which this clearly mimics but with a much more serious vibe) and fans of ripping adventure tales in general.

as i sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity ron howard and tom hanks call the da vinci code, i could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is angels and demons.hanks and company are back for the sequel-prequel angels and demons, and they have learned their lesson.acting wise everyone is much better. aylet zurer is very good as vittoria vetra, and better than the girl who played sophie neveau. tom hanks is very good as always, he is better in this though, because he works harder at giving the movie the feeling that it is a thriller. i think ewan mcgregor does the best job of any of the actors. he might even deserve a nomination come march, but doubtful. he had me convinced right until the very end. he's dynamic and faithful, but rational, and realizes that the church needs to put their past behind them. the minor actors also do very good jobs.technically and visually the movie is much improved. the cinematography is much...much better, and the visual effects are superb. the final explosion sequence at the end is excellent. howard does a masterful job, taking you through a tour of rome.pacing wise, ron howard does an amazing job this time around at keeping the story moving, and not boring us with a history lesson deemed at denouncing christianity. the movie also makes you feel like more is at stake. in our feeble minds discovering whether or not jesus had children, is not as high up on the list compared to a cataclysmic explosion killing thousands including the roman catholic church. part of the reason i think the story is so fast paced is due to the excellent score. i cannot say enough about the score. it was epic at times, like something from lord of the rings, but then sometimes it felt like a bourne movie, which is a nice mix.my only complaint about this movie is that it is ridiculously far fetched. the chances of the carmelengo being someone of ewan mcgregors age are highly improbable, and the chances of a cardinal with an adopted son getting elected pope are even more ridiculous. not to mention the whole antimatter thing, which has yet to be created, and dan brown wrote the book in 2003...overall angels and demons is much tighter knitt, faster paced, more exciting, and more important movie than the da vinci code. this is must see thriller for anyone who loves history and mystery combined into one.

as a child i was never in a situation where i could be introduced to dr who and though i had heard of the series in passing, i never really realized exactly what it was. it was, then, with some hesitation that i sat down to watch the ninth doctor and his antics having be told that he was something like arthur dent (from the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy) but cooler. i can't believe what i've been missing out on, seriously, why had no one told me about this before? my entire childhood was deprived of doctor who adventures; me being a tremendous fan of most sci-fi and fantasy adventures. honestly, i thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to any future episodes.i have to admit that at first i was not so sure that billie piper would be the best actress but i'm happy to say that she did very well, i thought, and added a very realistic touch to the series. i think, actually, that was one of my favourite aspects of the series; the contrast between great alien conflict scenes contrasted with the infuriating normality of the south london council estate life. i'm always interested in instances where people's ideas about the world are drastically challenged and how people can take any situation and edit it in their minds so that it may fit in with their mundane lives. i also loved christopher eccleston. i haven't seen many of his films and i've never seen another actor as dr who, but i thought his portrayal of the doctor was brilliant, immensely likable and yet dark enough to make you wonder. i find that many other characters with his sort of character history tend to be a bit two-dimensional; they have all the right emotions and actions, but they always seems slightly shallow. this doctor, on the other hand, earned my loyalty with his stratified personality. i agree with some of the other comments that a higher budget for the special effects, aliens and whatnot, might have been a bit more effective. but then again, this isn't about special effects (though they help) from what i've read and heard from long-time dr who fans; it's the spirit of the whole things that really counts. and i don't think they did a bad job with what they had. i quite liked all the aliens but my favourite had to be the daleks; if i ever knew anything about dr who before watching the series, it was that there were things in it that looked like upturned dustbins on wheels. previous to watching, i was quite sceptical about these pepper-pots threatening the existence of humanity but some of them were quite scary! which i loved,of course.overall, a good show. i look forward to future episodes with delight. the doctor has a new fan.

i get a kick out of the new who fans who call it, excellent,their entitled to that opinion but the new series isn't quite there yet, it's getting there. it's definitely good.first the good things. the special effects are obviously better nearly 20 yrs later since the last episode of doctor who "battlefield" was aired.one thing the bbc has always liked is doctor who (except when they tried to cancel in the 70's and 80's). however, the anticipation and the pressure was great but i think the new series has passed the test it's good, it's still not excellent because it does have it's flaws. some of the stories "dalek" were very poor. i assume it was written in a couple of minutes by some idiot who never bothered to remake the dalek character or never bothered to watch the old series."aliens in london" was by far probably the best episode so far, it started a new storyline about aliens which has lasted across several episodes including "boomtown".now the other bad things, the companion, rose, billie piper, isn't great. she's actually quite annoying but as is dr. who a young teeny bopper had to be eventually chosen and she got the part.christopher eccleston is pretty respectable, he's started to catch his niche. he tried to play the character, straight then funny always missing the right punchline but he's taken it much more serious and it shows.continuity wise there still some issues that didn't get resolved well, paul mcgann was still the doctor before this but he didn't get put back.aside from that though the series overall is pretty good, i haven't missed an episode and it never gets boring, so i recommend any doctor who fan to check it out and see the new doctor who series.

2005 will go down in 'dr.who' history as its most incredible year. everything seemed to click; a first-rate new doctor and companion, big audiences ( 10 million for the first episode and christmas special ), major awards, critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years giggling at the daleks' seeming inability to negotiate stairs were well and truly silenced. but then christopher eccleston dropped a bombshell, quitting after just one series. it looked like the honeymoon was over. luckily, the public appears to have embraced his successor, the excellent david tennant. on top of this the show boasts fine s.f.x., like the spaceship crashing into 'big ben' in 'aliens of london' and superb story lines such as 'tooth & claw', 'army of ghosts/doomsday'. the new 'dr.who' is basically the same as the old, only updated for the 21st century. some fans have accused russell t.davies of 'ruining' the show. they need to remember that there was no show for sixteen years until he came along.

so many of us who are devoted to the "art" of the motion picture will disregard or forget that movies are also business ventures. most of the time, they are far too costly to produce to be anything else. in light of this, it often seems a miracle to me that really great ones do get made every now and then. once in a while, the film-makers will go so far over budget in producing a film that the businessmen responsible for funding the enterprise will be badly hurt financially and will of course become very angry about this. i'd like to know precisely how it happens that this has often led to both the big studios and some major critics "gunning" for the picture when it is at last released. terrible expectations are generated and often what people expect to see clouds their perception of what they are viewing.you can see this phenomenon at work in the imperfect, but magnificent '62 re-make 0f "mutiny on the bounty", and you can definitely see it in the reaction to "heaven's gate". cimino took too long and cost united artists way too much money in making this picture. the company was fatally wounded by his excesses and, no doubt, powerful people were out to see his reputation forever ruined when this strange, mammoth epic was finally released. there are always many film-goers who dislike long, weighty pictures. the storytelling in this film is not accomplished with great economy or a brisk pace. like stanley kubrick, cimino often chooses not to spell out the particular statement he is making with a given scene. rather, he draws it out in such a way as to make the viewer feel like they are living in the moment, providing time for his own imagination to participate deeply in what is being presented. a lot of folks don't react all that favorably to this approach. they want the story to move quickly and clearly and they easily become impatient and confused by this sort of film. these factors doubtless contributed to the box-office failure of "heaven's gate".by nature, a film editor, i am deeply frustrated by two problems with this film. here and there, a scene is clearly too long and could easily have been trimmed without harming its effectiveness. then we come to the massive, drawn-out battle scenes at the end of the picture. where these are concerned, the clarity of the storytelling is indeed damaged. if you liked the film up to the point where these occur, your understanding of what is supposed to be happening is likely to become unclear and this is indeed a frustration. not having seen all the rough footage, i can not tell if actual re-shoots would have been needed, or whether some critical plot elements might have been made clearer by careful re-editing of some moments. given the time and money that were poured into this picture, more care and thought should have been given to this problem.there are other problems, some occasional weak acting, some dialog that doesn't ring true, but these are really minor concerns. the reason i am so troubled by the problems stated above is that, like so many these days, i too feel that in all "heaven's gate" is so splendid to behold and so magnificently deals with major historic, political and sociological issues that it is just short of a masterpiece. despite its shortcomings, it is so dramatically and visually powerful that it stands head and shoulders above most other hollywood films i have ever seen. i'd like to re-mix a lot of the sound. i'd like to re-direct and re-edit the scene where ella is killed, but the greatness of this picture is such that these considerations really do become trivial when compared with the value of the total production. i should add that it should always be seen on a giant wide screen to achieve the glorious effect that it is so capable of delivering.

i only saw this film once a quarter of a century ago, yet it's impact has never left me and i can still remember even now my reactions to it.i was mesmerised by the breadth and the sheer beauty of so much of the photography. i was astounded that an american studio could produce such a european film with it's slow pace and its unfocused plot. the lack of any strong characters felt like a flaw but i raged at the completely unnecessary ending on the yacht which seemed as though it was bolted on to give some kind of plot cohesion and which was entirely at odds with the style of the rest of the picture.it was also refreshing to see a western which made no pretence about the brutality and exploitation that so often was the unfortunate detritus of the american dream.the western scenes and sets also had an authenticity which was entirely new to me and which prefigured the recent deadwood series.the film was massively cut for the american audience and its my very real wish that in these days of director's cuts that michael cimino is given the opportunity of a fresh edit in the light of reflection - a cut which could turn this ill fated movie into the masterpiece it had the potential to become. i have now seen the original first cut and the network of relationships makes so much more sense,although christopher walken is responsible mainly for carrying this off. if only de niro and not kris kristofferson had played the main lead!there was still a massive preoccupation with creating the reality and atmosphere to the detriment of a good script. nevertheless, the camera work was so cleverly handled that at times you could almost believe you were inside the action yourself.and there were many special moments. everybody arguing in the hall in different languages trying to overcome their national differences and seek some unity of action in face of the impending disaster gave a real insight into the difficulties facing the welding together of the usa: especially when the threat came from a combination of the old elite and money.nate's faltering approach to ella when she first visited his cabin stood in stark contrast to the violence that was to follow and was another one. i had a special showing with a large group of mates to see the new cut and we all enjoyed it whilst having varying reservations.this revisionist and much closer to the truth version of events was probably too much for americans to take when the film was first released but we all felt it had enormous merit and that its place in cinema history was also due for major revision

i'ts like going around in a museum. you can appreciate the great talent of the main composer, michael cimino & this fabulous art desinger of light ..vilmos zsigmond. as i said i'ts like being in heaven discovering all the creation this man can applied to a single frame. imagine when you can look at a moving picture of this artist. i can say: this film is one of the best.

by the time it opened, "heaven's gate" had become, to its detriment, more a cultural phenomenon than a motion picture. at a time when concern about excessive budgets and directorial arrogance were growing, it was a convenient target, as it was a far-over-budget work by the latest "auteur" to hit hollywood, who had not yet established the track record that would have given him the benefit of the doubt among critics and the industry alike. as someone pointed out at the time, no one was going to jump on warren beatty's even-more costly and dark "reds," because beatty was "one of us," while michael cimino had not achieved that status.but "heaven's gate" was also affected by a cultural change taking place at that time, the political move rightwards and toward a more unquestioning patriotism and enshrinement of the myth of the west (and the western). a few years earlier, cimino's demythologizing of the frontier might have seemed timely, fresh, and a necessary corrective. but by 1980, in the wake of the reagan revolution, it was thought of as nearly un-american.which is a shame, because the film, seen from the vantage point of several decades away, is a fascinating and thought-provoking look at that particular time and place as a world where life was, in hobbes's words, "nasty, brutish, and short." kristofferson plays james averill, an upper-class easterner who, in search of adventure, becomes a sheriff in wyoming, where he finds himself having to lead a resistance by the settlers and squatters against an attack by a mercenary death-squad hired by wealthy landowners, including averill's lifelong best friend. in a more innocent time, averill and his rag-tag "army" of poor farmers would emerge triumphant; but this is anything but a traditional western, and when the u.s. cavalry joins the fight here, it isn't on the side of the "good guys."much like "the deer hunter," cimino's previous film, "heaven's gate" spends a great deal of time building up the details of the lives of its principals, giving the film an at-times leisurely pace that nevertheless leads to a gripping conclusion. with excellent acting, a fine musical score, and the visual texture that makes one believe one is actually seeing the "old west" through new eyes, "heaven's gate" is a film that rewards repeat viewings. i only wish that mgm would put out a new dvd, with an improved transfer and a commentary by cimino. nonetheless, the current version is satisfactory enough to let viewers see what critics in 1980, possibly blinded by the film's cultural subtexts, managed to miss...that "heaven's gate" is a great film.

i watched the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen. 219 minutes passed and yet it seemed like only an hour had gone by. the characters were very believable and entertaining, and the photography was excellent. the story pulled me in and held my attention. i will definitely watch this again and again. this true story telling at it's best... not hollywoods usual cheap thrills and skin deep glitz. i've seen a quite a lot of reviews on this movie. most seem to pan the film or give it faint praise. basically, it's a great film that received unfairly harsh reviews. watch it for yourself with an open mind. if you like westerns, historic period pieces, albeit historically inaccurate you'll enjoy the movie. superb!!! 10/10

"the deer hunter's" success with critics and publics alike led united artists to give cimino carte-blanche on "heaven's gate," an epic western about the 1892 johnson county warsÂ… the elliptical story, about the persecution of lowly european-born farmers by wyoming's cattle-barons, was a muddled mixture of class-conflict, sumptuous pageant and underwritten, stereotypical charactersÂ… however, cimino's fetish for authenticity and his sweeping sense of scale ensured that the film running at nearly four hours Â– was rarely tediousÂ… its undeserved status as a cause cÃ©lÃ©bre, with critics divided as to whether it was a masterpiece or a fiasco, derived from its inflated budgetÂ… blamed for the studio's financial problems, cimino became a scapegoat for hollywood's general decline, and the film, edited into an incomprehensible short version after its initial release, was a commercial disasterÂ…

i've been a fan of heaven's gate since its first release. i've seen it at least half-a-dozen times and have long thought of it as a masterpiece. so, it was with excitement and a sense of anticipation that i took myself off to see the restored director's cut.to my surprise, i was disappointed on seeing it again and have since revised my estimation of the film. heaven's gate touches upon greatness in parts, but overall, lacks the thematic and narrative consistency and the passionate urgency characteristic of a truly great film.firstly, two technical problems: the sound quality is diffuse throughout the film, verging on inaudibility at times. some of this, perhaps, is intentional - a way to mimic the chaos and confusion of history as it is unfolding. but at key points, one is unable to register what it is the characters are saying.the cinematography is similarly diffuse. the images lack sharpness and particularity of detail. the result is a certain graininess and lack of pictorial sharpness which succeeds in blurring foreground and background.structurally, the narrative is off-key throughout, as if cimino can't quite make up his mind as to the effect he is after. he wanted an epic, for sure. but a pastoral or dramatic epic? the film sits uneasily and unconvincingly between styles, and perhaps even genres. at times it reminded me of terrence malick's 'days of heaven' or even 'elvira madigan' in its languid pace and elegant scene painting. at other times it threatens to turn into a robust 'western' more akin to 'the wild bunch'. in fact the latter film offers an instructive reference point for an assessment of 'heaven's gate' as it shares the same period concern and employs a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for a darker yet more heroic america. this structural and thematic uncertainty isn't helped by the poor-quality script which often sounds forced and jarring to the ear. the result is an inauthentic sense of period speech. the near-greatness of heaven's gate resides in its set pieces. the roller skating sequence, in particular, is astoundingly beautiful, one of the most evocative scenes ever put to film.another set piece which works very well in terms of unifying theme, mood, and setting occurs when kristofferson and huppert go riding in the new rig to the lake and she washes herself while he naps in the shade. the languid pacing, evocative music and monumental scenery combine in this scene to convincingly portray the love story which might just lie at the heart of the film - and which could have been its saving grace if pursued more convincingly.some critics have complained about the length of the film. this in itself doesn't bother me. a good film can't be long enough. the restored minutes are critical in restoring the motivation and characterization absent from the cut version, and they are full of pictorial interest.perhaps the chief glory of heaven's gate lies in the achingly evocative soundtrack. the repeated waltz motif and its different scorings throughout(full band, guitar, solo fiddle etc,)lends a haunting quality to the foreground action and establishes a thematic consistency lacking in the narrative itself.despite its obvious flaws, most notably the absence of a compelling narrative, there is a sense of grandeur about the film. one leaves the cinema with a rueful sense of missed greatness and a wish that cimino could revisit the film -with the wisdom of time and hindsight, to put right what is so badly amiss.

i was expecting this movie to be a stinker but i wanted to see for myself, but i was surprised how good of a movie this was. i know longer movies often don't do well at the box office but why this was pulled and not allowed to be viewed by the public is beyond me. it maintained my interest throughout and the scenery and photography is breathtaking at times. the plot was good and the morality play was a good one. i liked the realism which was along the lines of "unforgiven". i had to rent this movie to see it but it was definitely worth it.

i first saw this film when released in 1980. from other sources, i've learnt that the only release of the 219-minute cut was in new york city, after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes. so, i guess i saw the shorter version first which, at the time, i thought, was a very interesting anti-western, if a trifle confusing...so, it was with even more interest that i finally obtained a dvd of the full-length version. i'm glad i did because this second viewing has confirmed for me that the movie is a true classic, and the critical vitriol poured on michael cimino was unwarranted, to say the very least.yes, it's a long movie, but so have been many others. for example: once upon a time in america (1984) at 227 minutes; cleopatra (1963) at 320 minutes; the ten commandments (1956) at 220 minutes; spartacus {restored version} (1960) at 198 minutes; gone with the wind (1939) at 222 minutes and others. so, it can't be the fact of running time that made so many froth at the mouth way back, when heaven's gate came on the scene.but note this: all of those above movies have everything to do with reinforcing myths about history and heroes.not so heaven's gate: in this narrative, the american west is shown in all its grim and unrelenting harshness, injustice, and poverty. and that's probably the first reason why so many disliked this film: it laid out the circumstances of the johnson county war of 1892 in wyoming, showing how the wyoming stock growers association hired 50 assassins to hunt down and murder a large group of european immigrants accused of cattle rustling; and all with the assistance and conniving of authorities, right up to the president of the united states. for an essay on that war, with the background and what happened, there is a link at wikipedia under johnson county war.very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in their country's history, and which fly in the face of what the country is supposed to be. had it been a documentary, it would have been barely palatable for most; as entertainment, it was almost bound to fail commercially and be torn to shreds by the shrill and infamous.leaving aside the socio-political diatribe, for a moment, that cimino launched herein, what about the narrative Â– the story of the three main characters? well, it probably wasn't unusual for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute, just as it's probably not unusual now. it's a fairly standard love triangle whereby ella must choose between the two men, and ultimately decides upon the younger man, nathan, who, although not above resorting to cold-blooded murder when it suits him, shows more spirit and commitment than the older james (or jim, as most people in the film say). for some, that part of the story threads too slowly, perhaps; in the context of the wider narrative about the war, however, it is, i think, entirely appropriate.and that war is depicted graphically, viciously and cruelly with scenes of carnage that are exquisitely staged and edited flawlessly Â– although in the final massacre between the association and the immigrants, i'm certain that some scenes of wagons blowing apart are repeated. a minor point and perhaps brought about when the 219-minute cut was restored? any way you look at it, though, it hits you in the face with the noise, dust, chaos and confusion of war...which brings me to another criticism by others: the noise and dust is such that it's often difficult to hear the dialog and even see clearly what is happening. i'll admit that i found that to be a trifle annoying at first, even backtracking to replay parts to try to catch the image or the words Â– until i realized that really wasn't necessary if you accept the director's intent: life is chaotic, it is difficult to hear and see in crowded situations and, in war, it's the sine qua non of this mise-en-scene. in short, it's as though you truly are present in and within the scenes...and what of the title? from shakespeare, it refers to a figurative nearness to god and so, if you equate god with the natural world, the stunning scenery that pervades the movie Â– and it is stunning, hauntingly equal to that of david lean's doctor zhivago (1965) Â– is a useful metaphor. i tend to think, however, that cimino had something more to say, namely the idea that the brave immigrants Â– the god-fearing salt of the earth Â– were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for themselves in the land that espouses to be freedom's champion.was that cimino's intent Â– to gut the myth of the american west? to show how, in america, only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred, one way or another, throughout history? is that anything new? not really, as we all know. where it really hurt, however, is in showing how america was not and, by implication, is not the land of the free and the home of the brave. instead, after absorbing this narrative, we are left with an impression that the underpinnings of america have more to do with a land of dispossessed slaves and a home for knaves...

until today, i thought there only three people, including me, who considered heaven's gate (1980)to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western, (since the 1970), after, little big man (1970), jeremiah johnson (1972), the outlaw josey wales (1976) and the long riders (1980). i was stunned and pleased to see that 22.5% of those voting at imdb rate this movie a 10, as do i. a recent book, the worst movies of all time, includes heaven's gate. through it's production and release it was vilified, as no movie since cleopatra, almost twenty years before. at one time it was considered the most expensive over-budget movie of all time, surpassing even cleopatra. it was blamed for the downfall of its studio, united artists, until everyone finally saw all the studios were falling. michael cimino, fresh from his glory with the deer hunter was hated and despised for his success and movie making excess, but clearly, that was petty jealousy at its worst. cimino ended up fashioning one of the great expositions of the american experience. this film is not to be missed but any serious student of american filmmaking.

i seriously donÂ´t know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released. sure, itÂ´s overlong and somewhat gratuitous in its depictions of sexuality and violence but so are lots of well regarded movies. i seriously donÂ´t think that the people who hated "heavenÂ´s gate" really understood it. "heavenÂ´s gate" in its uncut form, much like "the deer hunter" shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life (like the immigrants and averil in wyoming) and living in comfort and privilege (like the settled "americans" in wyoming and averil in the prologue and epilogue). living a hard life is painful but it can also be invigorating as opposed to the dull life averil leads in the epilogue. also, as michael cimino took great pains to make the picture historically accurate , it is fascinating as a document of (and maybe indictment of) american life in old west wyoming. the dialogue is often genuinely clever and emotional. combined with great music and cinematography, the movie works like a truly poetic work of art. granted, "heavenÂ´s gate", with its refusal to patronize the viewer, is not for all tastes. however, hollywood turns out so much commercial dreck each year which is so much easier to dismiss as mindless eye candy (even when an example of it becomes a blockbuster) that "gate" and cimino really do deserve more respect. all people should see the uncut version at least once and then they should make up their own mind.

'heaven's gate' is not a masterpiece, which apparently was what it needed to be upon first release to justify its great cost, and, more importantly, the continued uneasy reliance of hollywood on the auteur model of film-making. yet 'heaven's gate', seen today at last on dvd in a cut of 229 minutes, is a superb film. it is a touch lethargic in pace. but at least it is paced. quite apart from the incompetence of construction that marks many films today, there have been many films which, deliberate in form, have been severely damaged by being hacked down with no care for rhythm so the films become shapeless and confusing. beyond this, the criticisms leveled at the film have become in retrospect quite lame. if the good guys and bad guys are too obviously pronounced for a serious film, and yes sam waterston's mustachioed, fur-clad villain is comic-opera (and not in the multi-leveled manner of bill the butcher from 'gangs of new york'), and yes, the townsfolk do seem a touch 'fiddler on the roof' on occasions, then a few dozen serious films made since then, including 'titanic' and the graceless 'cold mountain' (which bears certain similarities and is a notable failure in convincing qualities compared to this film) can be castigated for exactly the same reason. also despite accusations, the film has a plot, quite a well-essayed plot at that. it simply does not bow to standard-form 'epic' quality, by providing titan heroes, rafts of sub-plots and confusion. it experiments with telling in a manner more like much smaller, modest films, by carefully-caught moments of character interaction, and well-textured pageant-like explosions of communal action, as with the opening at harvard and, most specially, the wonderful scene where the johnson county folk, following the lead of a brilliantly physical fiddler, make celebration on roller-skates.'the deer hunter' was a critical and commercial success but abandoned the first half's inspired, mosaic-like accumulation of detail, and i think in a manner similar to criticism of robert penn warren's novel 'all the king's men' and its dictionary of jacobean stunts, if cimino had not had such a strong grasp of the conventions of hollywood epics, he might have made a special rare work of art based in honest visualisation of people within their milieu. in contrast, 'heaven's gate' succeeds in screwing its narrative momentum and tension upwards in a slowly expanding arc, until the finale explodes, whilst not abandoning the mosaic approach.the central romantic triangle, for instance, resists standard inflections; a decent, intelligent, but psychically defeated man, james averill (kris kristofferson) competes with a hot-shot but identity-challenged young gunman nate champion (christopher walken) for the hand of a young madame, ella watson (isabelle huppert); there is no self-conscious bed-hopping, no slaps in the face, recriminations, or typical sad-sack moments, but more a sad and distanced decision by ella to choose the younger man whom she loves less because he is ready to make the commitment. ella emerges as the film's true hero (huppert's performance, though initially awkward, is really quite excellent, balancing a dewy emotionalism with a hard-hammered spirit), attempting first to rescue nate and then mustering the resistance party of immigrants into an enterprising defence. subsequently, averill is stung into action as friends die. indeed, in the process of overcoming so many traps of clichÃ© and style, 'heaven's gate' successfully and willfully throws off the defeated outsider-heroes grace note of so many '70s westerns and portrays an eventual, vigorous, cheer-the-heroes rallying to a compromised but still relished victory. the social conflict of so many '70s westerns at last hardens into a fully-fledged war; where capital attempts a crushing final victory over the miscreants who stand in their way, suddenly they find a massed and more-powerful people's army, led by the man who played the thoroughly-destroyed billy the kid a decade before. this is what led the film to be described as the first marxist western, but really it simply deflowers a theme of the genre extant well before the '60s. such various and classic old-school works as william wyler's 'the westerner', and even 'shane', tell awfully similar stories. it is simply here that the romantic myth of the gunslinger has been replaced by the romantic myth of the people's revolt. in a spectacular, exiting, but realistic and thus chaotic finale, the marauding cattlemen's encampment is attacked, ringed by dust clouds punctuated by fallen horses, writhing bodies, and gunfire. averill puts his classical education to work finally by stealing a roman trick and bringing the cattlemen to the brink of annihilation before they are rescued by the cavalry (another distinctly seditious touch, but surely not so offensive after 'little big man's unrelenting depiction of native american massacres). really, it's hard to think of a more heroically american vision of grassroots resistance. the film's only real dead spot stands as an unnecessary coda indicating averill's eventual relapse, a rather potted piece of tragedy. despite then certain failings and a slow mid-section, 'heaven's gate' is a supreme piece of work, a genuine attempt to create a contemporary western and a new kind of epic. if one has to still join the chorus that reckons cimino was absurd in his behaviour on set and expenditure, it is regretfully. when, today, flops like 'the adventures of pluto nash' and 'k-19 - the widowmaker' see nearly a hundred million dollars sink down the drain, and yet a tag of infamy still hangs on this film, one ponders what exactly its grim death signified. the attempt at original style, the bawdy sexuality, the very hard-won sense of detail, the breathtaking rigor of the film-making and what is being filmed, all throw into contrast what is sorely lacking in so much contemporary hollywood product.

i saw heaven's gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago. tickets were sold in advance based on the great anticipation of seeing cimino's long in the making follow up to his 1978 masterpiece "the deerhunter." the reviews came in and critics trashed the film with vehemence. an influential new york film critic led the way and most critics followed suit, and the 3hr. 40-min. film was pulled from distribution. united artists had cimino shorten the film by about an hour and it was re-released many months later to equally horrible reviews and to dismal business. the film at that time cost about 40 million dollars (now considered low budget) making it one of the most expensive in history and cimino had free rein on the project with endless retakes despite it being only his third film. "the deerhunter" had also received a negative backlash based on a perceived political ideology, which was not popular. i mention all this to present a possible bias building up against cimino. at the time i thought the film was very good and when i saw the shorter version it was still very good only less so. the film showed up again in a museum in the early 1990's. they were supposed to show the long version but they could not find an existing print. nevertheless, seeing the film years later i now thought heaven's gate was a masterpiece. finally, the long version started to appear in a few select cities, i got to see it recently and it was well worth the wait. heaven's gate begins with the graduation ceremony at harvard university. two of the graduates are kris kristofferson and john hurt and we some of the flaws in their characters early on. despite the mandate joseph cotton gives in his speech to the graduating class to use their education to enlighten and improve their country, many of the graduates behave as if they are part of an elite country club. the film flashes ahead 20 years to johnson county in wyoming. a cattle company called "the stockholders association" has hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants claiming they are cattle thieves. kristofferson sides with the immigrants while john hurt is part of the association. although hurt is totally against this insane action he is too ineffectual a character to do anything about it. a massacre takes place but the immigrants do well in defending themselves. a united states cavalry comes to the rescue of the association to allegedly arrest them after most of the damage has been done when in fact they sanctioned the mass killing. kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss and the film ends with him years later as part of the elite class of his harvard days married, bored, on a yacht, living but dead on the inside.this is a very complex film which is brilliant in every department such as it's themes, structure, direction, cinematography, writing, music, editing, set designs, and acting. kristofferson, walken, hurt, huppert, dourif, bridges, waterston, and cotton are all excellent portraying very complex characters. some of the major complaints i read about this film state that is ugly to look at, incoherent, too long, that the characters make no sense and that the words are often unintelligible. in its defense, heaven's gate has the look of photographs of that period just as "mccabe & mrs. miller" did. some of the scenes are smoky looking to suggest the industrial revolution or sometimes horses, wagons, people are passing by from all sides creating a sense of reality.(the critic who called it one of the ugliest movies ever made likes to use his thumbs a lot.) but in spite of all that, the composition of each frame and the cinematography are impeccable. the film makes a great deal of sense if you pay attention to it. everything is not spelled out for the viewer and one has to observe closely to understand the motivations of the characters or its themes. as to its length, it is a beautifully structured piece, at times moving, poetic, exhilarating, or devastating with virtually one great scene following another. at times some of the words are unintelligible especially in some of the scenes bustling with activity. but one could understand such a cinematic film as this through its use of film language, the glances between characters or their actions. one day soon this film should be re-released in its full length so that people and critics could give it a second chance. do not let michael cimino become another orson welles- under appreciated in his lifetime and not able to make the kinds of great films he is capable of making.

thursday june 15, 9:30pm the egyptiansaturday june 17, 11:00am the egyptian"he spent most of his life in pursuit of a good time, and he caught it." - eric idleharry nilsson left brooklyn, "Â…feeling like holden caulfield. i was fifteen." eventually, he ended up working as an usher at the la paramount and within a few years fell back asswards into one of the greatest songwriting careers in the history of american music. 'who is harry nilsson (and why is everybody talking' about him?)' chronicles the legendary life of "Â… the best songwriter of our generation." writer/director john scheinfeld produces a 'who's who' of musical royalty, from brian wilson and al kooper to paul williams, randy newman and ray cooper, "his voice was a medical instrument. it would heal you." assorted archives include his 1969 appearance on 'playboy after dark' and nilsson's bbc special. the john lennon, brandy alexander, smothers brothers at the troubadour comeback-show heckling debacle is one memorable recounting among so many they seem to virtually squeeze nilsson's enchanting music out of this comprehensive and bitter-sweet bio-doc."he was a wonderful perpetrator."" Â… i woke up three days later, getting a massage in phoenix."

i saw this movie in santa monica on aug. 23 and it has stayed with me. i want to thank the filmmakers for digging into the details of harry's enigmatic, eccentric, life. and also for showing the flaws and failings of nilsson the man. thanks for showing the good and bad, the ups and downs, and for uncovering that amazing bbc footage. the film is also a great showcase of a vast amount of nilsson's music, really well placed throughout the film. i recommend this movie to anyone who likes good documentaries, especially if you are interested in harry nilsson or the music scene of the early 70's. some reviewer at the ain't it cool website wrote that this was the best movie movie they saw at the santa barbara film festival, and i believe it. the film is informative, funny, sad, touching, and full of awesome music. it succeeds on all levels. really, really good.

this tough-to-see little picture played at the mods & rockers 2007 festival. it is a wonderful and loving look at harry nilsson, using many famous faces who sit for interviews, rarely seen tv performances and behind-the-scenes footage of nilsson at work. there's even a few shots from "son of dracula". this movie is the final and fitting tribute to one of the finest voices, the most clever songwriter and the funniest man in popular music. it's a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and/or performed. his friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented hulk with a subconscious wish for self-destruction. as a bonus, you even get eric idle performing the song with wrote for nilsson's final album during the closing credits. it's funny, it's sad. it's not in general release. if this picture plays anywhere near where you live, see it!

i was lucky enough to have seen this film at it's seattle film fest screening, and was blown away by how great it was. this is without a doubt one of the best music documentaries i've ever seen, (and i've seen a lot!) this is a loving look back at the life and times, music and relationships of one of music's true legends. harry nilsson deserves to be up there with the likes of gershwin, cole porter, and all the other great song writers of 20th century standards. he was considered a peer by all four members of the beatles, who all called him a 5th beatle, and one the same wavelength as themselves.harry refused to tour, so many today don't remember him, and those born after his heyday, are unaware of who he was. this is tragic. everyone should have the opportunity to be exposed to this wonderful talent. this film is a step in the right direction, to finally give the man his due. unfortunately, the film has yet to have wide distribution, or even a dvd so for the time being, good luck in getting to see it.if you are someone with the power to put together a dvd distribution deal, please contact the film makers. this film needs to be available. hey vh-1, how about screening it on air, then maybe putting it out on dvd? harry nilsson deserves nothing less.

biodoc on the enigmatic singer/songwriter who, according to friends' accounts, spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life seemingly on a mission of self-destruction. he died at 52, overweight and dissipated, of heart disease, after a protracted rampage of virtually non-stop overindulgence in alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and cocaine, raucous partying, and flagrant misuse of his vocal instrument (he confided to a friend that he shouted out his lyrics at one performance with such force that spattered blood was left on the microphone).all of this despite the fact that he was: (1) widely considered to have perhaps the most gifted pop singing ability of his generation; (2) successful, after years of effort, in terms of industry acclaim - a grammy, an oscar, a decent recording contract with a top label, and at least two stellar albums - 'nilsson schmilsson' (originals), and 'a little touch of schmilsson in the night' (standards); and (3) very happily married (for the third time), with a lovely young family that he seemed to adore.the film's strengths begin with the completeness of its account of nilsson's life, including fine use of archival film footage and many stills of nilsson; the editors do an especially good job of bringing movement to the stills. we learn of his close ties to john lennon and, later, ringo starr (lennon often said that nilsson was his favorite american musician).even more impressive are the talking heads, often a documentary's weakest aspect. here we get people like perry botkin, jr., ray cooper, mickey dolenz, terry gilliam, mark hudson, eric idle, rick jarrard, randy newman, van dyke parks, jimmy webb and robin williams, all telling amazing stories about nilsson Â– many uproariously funny, others deeply pathetic - and everyone conveying their deep affection for him. equally informative and moving are interview segments with nilsson's wives Â– annie and una, his son zach, and cousin doug hoefer. best set of heads i can recall in a biodoc.the most glaring deficiency of the film is that it crowds out nilsson's music. even the performance of his greatest hit, "without you," is cut short after about 8 bars. arrrrgh!! there is no excuse for this, not given that the movie runs a full two hours as it is. lose a few head shots and we could have heard at least that song through, and perhaps one or two more, like "one," or his oscar winning cover of "everybody's talking.'" the filmmakers are simply too intent on plumbing nilsson's psychological mystique and not attentive enough to his music. my grades: 7.5/10 (low b+) (seen at the nwfc's reel music series, 01/07/07)

saw this film during the mod & rockers fest in august. i was so inspired and touched. harry had an amazing life and one of the best and distinct voices ever recorded. for those of you who don't know about harry nilsson do a little research and you'll see that harry has probably found his way into your life in one way or another - maybe it was his 70s special "the point" or "everybody's talking" from midnight cowboy. for me it started with "people let me tell you bout my best friend" - the theme song from "the courtship of eddie's father." watching this film you can really feel the love and admiration from harry's true friends and peers. don't shed a tear for harry - he had a ball...brett

i saw this superb documentary at the santa barbara int'l film festival. it is extremely absorbing and very well crafted, drawing you into the life and career of harry nilsson, one of the most overlooked musical talents of the 1960's and 70's. while i was familiar with his better known compositions ("one is the loneliest number", "without you"), i learned about this man's brilliant writing and beautiful singing. if you love music, you'll find plenty to draw you in to his world, which unfortunately spiraled out of control as his success increased and his past haunted him. however sad, he nonetheless was completely devoted to his family and you will find yourself so glad to have met this man. the profile is effectively told through nilsson's own words and those of his friends and colleagues (a virtual who's who of rock)who loved and respected him. don't miss this!

sony pictures classics, i'm looking at you! sony's got the rights to harry records -- you need to distribute the film and you'll get radically increased sales of his back catalog! anyhow, this is a great study of a fascinating musician, woefully underknown, full of great stories, greater music, and it could have been 3 hours longer and i'd have loved it even more. saw it at the american cinemateque mods & rockers festival at the aero theatre in santa monica, where it played to a packed house. they were turning people away at the door! i went to many of the mods & rockers festival films, and let me assure you that no other film came even close to selling out, let alone turning people away. see it in the theatre, buy the dvd, and make sure some slow-on-the-uptake company [*cough sony cough*] picks it up asap!

more exciting than the wesley snipes film, and with better characters, too. the last vampire hunter must save los angeles from a coven of vampires out to conquer the city, aided by a tabloid journalist. lost of fun... and the names of the characters are great!

hard justice is an excellent action movie! the whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it does have a very good vampire plot! for the people who say they don't make shoot em ups and fighting films like they use to. well, this one is really hard-core! don 'the dragon' wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie. nicholas guest was very good as well and he arguably steals the show! he really performs as a fantastic villain! melanie smith was also good. i think that this very fine looking actress is very underrated. michael cavanaugh was good. it was really cool to see vince murdocco in this film! as for the action, it is truly awesome with all of the gun fights and the super cool fighting scenes. the fighting in this picture is really some of the greatest i have seen! there is so much that happens in the 86 minute run time. for the action fans you will be blown away by all of the fire power and superb fighting that this film has to offer! night hunter is a movie that isn't easy to locate and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it up because this movie is big keeper and plus the box is cool! there is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed! look and see if you can find some good deals on ebay, half.com, amazon.com's z-shops and market place sellers! in my opinion night hunter is one of the greatest fighting films that i have ever watched and the characters are so neat. if you like don 'the dragon' wilson and want to see nicholas guest in a great performance then i strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves shoot em ups, fighting movies, and vampire films and has been disappointed by other movies that has the look of a true non stop action flick but fails to deliver it to get and buy night hunter today!

yes, indeed we have a winner- a winner in best dumb-action-movie!the only reason i chose to vote a 10 for this movie is because it's so incredibly bad-made that it actually becomes funny."night hunter" is basically about jack cutter, a vampire hunter (vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries, apparently), and his mission, being that he has to kill the last remaining vampires.this movie contains one of the cheesiest scenes i have ever seen in my life. not to mention the really bad gun-shooting scenes. when people are shot in this movie, blood splatters- thick as ketchup all over the place, this makes the movie seem so cheap and lame that you just lose interest. a constant shaking of the camera is what annoys me the most during the fight-scenes. this is, i suppose, done to create an "action-effect", though in my opinion it gives no effect whatsoever. its completely ridiculous! all stunt-scenes are done extremely badly. e.g a scene where the dead vampire-leader gets thrown off a roof. when the corpse hits the ground, it bounces like a wobbly rubber-doll. a scene where jack sniffs the ground, getting a vision was so lame it got me laughing hysterically.lame music, cheesy scenes, bad acting and plain dumb filming techniques are obviously the functions that make this movie such a malfunction. to state that this is a good movie would be the same as stating that nuclear bombs are good for humans. clearly those of you who say that this is one of the best action-movies, haven't seen many in your life.this is basically a b-class vampire-action-movie that deserves 0/10 but which i'll give 10/10, just for its ability (being the lousiest action-movie i have ever seen)of making me laugh and because i just can't live without it.

night hunter is a sold b style action movie. get a life and grow up people. don "the dragon" wilson is a kick boxer, (hall of fame) and not an actor. if your looking for an oscar, it's not here brother. looking for kick ass action movie with lower then low budget, this is it.the plot line may have been a little thin, but what b movie isn't. i understand everybody is a critic and how one man's junk is another man's treasure. get real people, judging every movie like it is an oscar contender, just silly. awesome fight scenes, mixed with a new twist on vampire moves. see it if your a fan, rent something else if your a hater.

night hunter starts in '1968' as a young jack cutter (chris aguilar) is unexpectedly handed the family tradition of becoming a vampire hunter when a fellow vampire hunter sid o'mack (sid haim) betrays his family & hands them over to the vampire's, to aid jack on his quest he is given a book that contains the name of every vampire alive, or dead whichever way you look at it... jump to 'june 1995' & los angeles where the now adult cutter (don 'the dragon' wilson, also credited as co-producer) has but four names left in the book including, argento (vince murdocco) & carmella (sophia crawford) together they are the last of the american vampires. as they all dine in a restaurant cutter crashes the party & kills them, job done right? wrong as king of the vampires bruno fischer (nicholas guest) calls in the last four remaining vampires from around the world, the french tournier (maria ford), the asian hashimoto (ron yuan), ulmer (david 'shark fralick) & sangster (vincent klyn) to track cutter down & kill him. meanwhile detective's hooper (marcus aurelius) & browning (cash casey) don't have a clue & a nosey reporter named raimy baker (melanie smith) becomes involved in the battle between cutter & the vampire's on which the very fate of earth rests!directed by rick jacobson i thought night hunter was quite a fun way to pass 85 odd minutes. the script by william c. martell mixes martial arts & horror with a fair degree of success, it moves along at a nice pace & is at least never boring & thankfully doesn't seem to take itself too seriously. the character names that reference other horror film director's/actors are a little tacky though. some may be surprised at how closely night hunter resembles blade (1998) yet was made a couple of years prior, the lone moody long coat wearing vampire hunter who happens to be an expert in martial arts, the scene set in a nightclub & the innocent woman drawn into the world of vampire's. night hunter doesn't really stick to traditional vampire film law, for instance sunlight only irritates their eye's, they can only breed on a solar eclipse (why?), stakes through the heart & garlic is no good as the way to kill a vampire in night hunter is to break it's neck. i could have done with a bit more horror & a bit more blood as it leans more towards the martial arts side of things. the dialogue is suitably cheesy & the character's are just about likable enough in a silly way.director jacobson does his best to ruin the film, the actions scenes are ok but lack a certain something & for some bizarre reason whenever an action sequence takes place he shakes his camera constantly, it's like the camera is placed upon a washing machine full cycle! hey rick, mate, it's not clever or stylish it's irritating & annoying. the gore is disappointing with a few gory gunshot wounds & a few splashes of blood, breaking vampire's necks don't involve much blood unfortunately.with a budget that probably didn't amount to much night hunter is competently made throughout. the acting was bad most of the time & what's with 'the dragon' thing in don 'the dragon' wilson's name? has he legally changed his name? does he sign cheques don 'the dragon' wilson?! does he get mail addressed to him in that name? i think i might do something like this, from now on i want to be known as paul 'the killer klown' andrews...night hunter is one of those crap films that transcends it's limitations & awfulness to become pure golden entertainment. if you like your films fun then night hunter might be for you, if your looking for big-budget thrills in a similar vein (! vampire's, veins & blood get it?) then blade & it's sequels would probably be a better choice. what the hell, i liked it so sue me.

check out the first 20 minutes even though the suspense hasn't yet kicked in. we get a pretty good look at super-secret los alamos just a few years after the big bomb test that helped end wwii. except for the tight security, it looks unthreatening enough. note how it's a tv repairman, an obvious regular guy, who takes us through security. once through, it's like any-town-usa, nice homes, quiet streets, kids going to school, and a family tv on the blink. later on we see little tommy and little peggy frolicking along streets lined with impressive looking facilities separated by locked gates. the movie appears to be saying, "okay, we're tough, only because we have to be. but, basically, we're still just folks."now, i expect that was a comforting message to cold war audiences still not used to government's "dooms-day" research. it's a clear effort at popular reassurance. the one darker note is when tommy's mother (clarke) worries about her son's mental state. he doesn't say, "when i grow up"; instead, it's, "if i grow up". that note of doubt not only reflects a los alamos reality, but also a national one that in 1952 had just seen footage of the apocalyptic h-bomb. note too, how professionally fbi agents are portrayed, a standard feature of mccarthy era fare. when brute force is needed, it's not they, but private citizen gene barry who thrashes out the informationÂ—an early version, i suppose, of modern era "rendition".once the kidnapping occurs, the suspense doesn't let up. the intrigue is nicely handled with colorful la locations that keep us guessing. the climactic scenes around the cliff dwellings may not be plausible as a hiding place, but the view of northern new mexico is great. then too, the ancient stone apartments amount to one of the more exotic backdrops of the decade. note also the extensive use of the police helicopter just coming into use as a law enforcement tool. among an otherwise subdued cast, nancy gates remains a sparkling presence as teacher ellen haskell. never hollywood glamorous, she was still a fine unsung actress and winning personality. i also expect this was one of director hopper's more successful movie efforts, and though people have since gotten used to the nuclear threat, the movie remains a revealing and riveting document of its time.

here is a much lesser known 50's sci-fi with a little different twist. an atomic researchers son is kidnapped and held for a ransom of the the father's atomic secrets.this is a tightly knit atomic sci-fi thriller with great production values and above average acting, even from the kid. the atomic city actually has a movie feel to it unlike a lot of other 50's sci-fi of this time which which came off more like an episode of a tv show.the atomic city was also actually nominated for an academy award for best screenplay - how many other 50's sci-fi can tout an academy award nomination?great pacing, tight direction and some superb location filming in the 'real' atomic city of los alamos, new mexico make this one worth hunting down. the collectors print in circulation is an above average transfer and makes for a great double feature with the atomic man!! recommended.

just watched this movie and it's not bad; there are a few tense moments and not a lot of long dialog strings. comes off as fairly intelligent; fastpaced almost like 'documentary style'. this movie will evoke some nostalgia and a bit of cold war paranoia with cars,street scenes,and life in the 50's. the acting is fairly solid and at 85 minutes run time it goes by at a good pace. an atomic era film buff shouldn't miss this one.

don't get me wrong this was fun to watch. it has some nice animation with exception of an odd looking bugs, and some nice music. and the standout scene was definitely elmer, bugs and daffy's dance on the floor, that was such a nice and fun touch. as a matter of fact, the whole cartoon is nice to watch, but all in all it is not what i call exceptional like carrotblanca. there are some very nice gags, but they have been used before i feel, and there wasn't much that i would deem hilarious. and daffy joining forces with elmer? somehow seeing as he was a target of the hunter, didn't it seem odd that he would be friends with him. though i will admit it was nice having daffy there. the voice acting was above average too, but somehow i missed mel blanc.all in all, unexceptional but very nice cartoon. 7/10 bethany cox

i loved the film "eddie monroe". the film had all the components that kept me interested while watching it. i especially loved the plot twists along the way and the surprising ending. craig morris has brad pitt potential both in looks and talent. his blue eyes reminded me of paul newman's. fred carpenter took this movie to a new level.i loved the cast. the music score, cinematography, talent, locations and script were awesome. i loved seeing some of my favorite actors in eddie monroe. fred carpenter is an incredibly talented and gifted director. he gives his work 200%. the film has great texture. i hope that there will be an eddie monroe 2. i would love to see how nicolette turns out after getting her windfall of money. fred carpenter's eddie monroe is hollywood level.

i viewed the movie for a second time on september 30, 2006 and thought that it was even better than the first time i saw it. i thoroughly enjoyed the acting, especially "uncle benny". i thought that fred carpenter did an excellent job of writing and directing this film. the story line definitely kept your interest and i hope this movie makes it all the way to the top. i felt it moved very smoothly between scenes and the surprise twist at the end, well, lets just say i didn't see it coming. i also thought that craig, the actor who played "eddie monroe" did an excellent job and i hope that this movie will help him to go further in his acting career. from start to finish, i thoroughly enjoyed it.

i was at a friends house for thanksgiving and watched a dvd of the movie, eddie monroe. i've been a fan of indie films for almost 20 years, (i loved the brothers mcmullen), and was impressed how good this movie is. my friend, who works at magno sound, told us that this movie was shot on super 16. the photography was so good, it looked as though it was a 35mm shoot. furthermore, the music combined with fred carpenter's direction, was art. the storyline was original and led up to an ending that surprised all of us watching...very cool. the acting by the entire cast was good, especially the actor who played, uncle benny. he was amazing. this film was a nice holiday treat, and i was delighted to be one of the first to view a movie that many will be seeing in the future.

as a long island independent film maker myself, and having have had two theatrical releases under my producing/directing belt i had always been told of how much i could learn by viewing a fred carpenter production so i was lucky enough to have his "eddie monroe" as my initiation to his superb budgeting, production, casting, settings and masterful directing talents. my heart went out to it's characters, it's story and was totally won over by the trick/switch ending that brought the film's plot to fruition! location's were marvelously chosen and human emotions in it's characters brought a realistic link to my bonding with all the elements that mr carpenter utilized throughout, to his and his film's benefit!

i found the movie very interesting. i really enjoyed the film the actors were great. it was entertainment. benny the uncle was wonderful he was real at his character. the ending took a wonderful twist. i would recommend you seeing it. eddie mores girlfriend reminded me a little of sandra bullock she was sharp as a nail. i also like the little girls acting in the movie she was very convincing. benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in brooklyn. i loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pot because thats how most people cook lol. i actually watched the movie 2 times and learned more the second time.

i've been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now. when a writer develops a story he always has a character/actor in mind to bring the story to life. last weekend i found a new one in paul vario playing uncle benny in eddie monroe. this was a slick film highlighted by vario's presence both on and off the screen (as his voice-over narration is also heard). i also especially liked the actress playing benny's niece and eddie's ex-wife, although everyone did a fine job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the double-crossing that goes with it. a nice job all around ... and mr. vario shined brightest. he's gotta be my tony gangi someday ...

one cannot help but be impressed with the intelligence and scale of this film, and simultaneously disappointed by the lost opportunities.i found the script to be excellent, and the vocal talent of edmund purdom quite impressive. however, as an artifact of its time, the film suffers from too many hollywood-isms, especially poor casting, too much lushness of the sets, and too much pretentiousness. edmund purdom (who plays the title character) is so obviously awkward with physical acting, i suspect he had primarily been in shakespearean theater before this.so if movie people are reading this, i propose this as an excellent candidate for a remake, especially if you cast real egyptians as egyptians!

i had the pleasure to view this film when i was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in egyptology). i know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.the film only approximates mika walteri's "the egyptian", in plot. a good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.the music score by b. hermann and alfred newman is beautiful!!! performances as follows. the late edmond purdom gave an excellent performance as an orphaned child adopted by parents past their child bearing years. he states that he keeps to himself,has the best education available and lets' face it is a rather emotionally distant person, given his upbringing and high intellect.jean simmons is fine as a humble tavern maid; honest loving and sincere. bella darvi, people complained about her accent, well she is a babylonian. it is not that apparent in the film as to why sinhue is so insanely obsessed with nefer nefer nefer. her correct name. in the book sinhue is enjoying her carnal fruits and gets his revenge early in the plot by leaving nefer nefer nefer's drugged body with the "house of the dead's " workers.gene tierney as baketaten, is brilliant! when she tells sinhue that he is pharoah, she looks like she could devour him (in his weakness). she is intense, brilliant and coldly beautiful.michael wilding is heartbreakingly tragic in his mission to bring all people to know his one god. i believe that we are viewing ankhnaten thru the lens of egyptologist a. weigall. a view at the time that had a pre-messiah feeling about ankhnaten's vocation. did his monotheism influence the jewish people? note psalm 104. and other egyption imagery in the psalms?mr. peter ustinov provided the alter ego to sinhue. he is street wise and cunning a survivor. excellent acting as always.mature never thought much of his acting personally, his horemheb is fine as an ambitious "super patriot" who ultimately has sinhue murder more than one person in his quest for power, (walteri's book).i felt that the ending to the egyptian was confusing as sinhue's personality changes too easily. he has a living son (toth dies in the novel), power is handed to him through is half sister baketaten, he world savvy now and has a grip on international affairs. so he became enlightened? he could have modified the amon priesthood as he was capable.but no! sinhue gives everything up, everything including his son's future to become a ragged beggar preaching monotheistic love?this change was too immediate and the major flaw in the script!again the look of the film,colour, most of the costumes(nefer nefer nefer's gold dress was too over the top as she is more richly dressed than the royal family), music is beautiful.i will watch this film again easily.p.s. i know that you porbably know that horemheb did not directly succceed ankhnaten, but i could not resist stating this fact.

the philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. i'd give it 10 stars for that alone. that being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what i take, possibly incorrectly, to be its art direction. many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated munsell color model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. this makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself. i think this movie is genuinely unique for this quality, and if for no other reason, earns it a full, careful, digital restoration. fox, are you listening?

when this film gets it right it really gets it right. and when it goes wrong... i'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. i can even isolate the bad bit. it's everything that has to do with the romance. everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. i'd recommend skipping that section if you can. it does nothing except explain his exile. it should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside. fortunately, the period from about 0-30 and 1:00-2:19 (the end) is excellent.there are a number of excellent performances in this film, and an equal number of terrible ones. just like everything else in this movie the acting is either perfect or terrible. peter ustinov as the slimy one-eyed slave kaptah is perfect. it is one of his best performances, up there with his role in spartacus. victor mature as the ambitious horemheb is also perfect. again, one of his best roles. jean simmons is wasted as merit, the perfect girl in love with our hero john carradine gives a nice supporting role as a philosophical grave robber; and michael wilding is excellent as akhnaton, the idealistic pharaoh who tries to bring peace and monotheism to egypt only to see it fall apart due to his unwillingness to fight. now for the bad. edmund purdom as sinuhe is sadly miscast. this is doubly unfortunate as he is the main character. the entire film revolves around him. he actually does rather good as the disillusioned exile and the wise old man. this is because of his sorely limited range. he doesn't seem able to put any passion into his words. this is especially apparent during the love scenes which are beyond awkward. he spends the last half of the film as an old man, a performance at which he is decent enough at. he does have the perfect voice for the character. the less said about bella darvi as nefer, the treacherous babylonian woman, the better.the costuming and sets are magnificent. this is the only film that i know of that attempts to depict life in egypt that isn't overshadowed by jews or romans. the film takes place in the 14th century b.c. which is before even exodus. the only monotheists are the pharaoh akhenaten and his followers. there is the same strong element of religious zeal that can be found in most epics, but it is done differently and it only shows up at the very end. an interesting note: by having akhenaten followed by horemheb as pharaoh, the film completely skips over the most famous pharaoh of all: tutankhamen. seems kind of a strange thing to do when using that name could increase awareness of the film.be warned: this is a 1950s epic film. if you don't like that type of thing then don't expect this one to be different. it is different, but it is still an epic. i appreciate this film, and i appreciate what it did and what it tried to do. this is a film that should be better remembered than it is.

although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. i saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...i just had to live in new york. it has great opening shots of the manhattan skyline with johnny mathis crooning "romance is still...the best of everything..." that rival those of west side story. there is a rather stilted performance by the world's real first supermodel, suzy parker (sorry about that, janice d.), but it's great eye-candy! it also offers a bit of insight into late 1950's american mores--our obsession with (and repression of) sex (in the workplace, no less!), romance, and marriage before women's lib. it represents an era in which new york was at it's finest and a super-bitchy performance by joan crawford is just the icing on the cake.

this 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. this follows the same idea as three coins in a fountain a few years before. this takes place in new york while coins takes place in rome, italy. our three beauties are hope lange, in her first starring role, suzy parker and diane baker. lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely joan crawford. suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau. hard to believe that anyone could reject this beauty for any reason, but louis jourdan, her heart throb, does just this. sort of takes you back to paul neuman rejecting the gorgeous elizabth taylor in cat on a hot tin roof, doesn't it? diane baker, the third damsel in distress, meets and dates robert evans, before he became the producer, and husband to ali macgraw, he is known for. hope's boyfriend from home, played by newcomer brett halsey, is promising to marry her. she also meets stephen boyd, a fellow worker, who has interests in our hope. all three ladies have their drama ahead of them. crawford almost steals the film. her presence and her usual strong bitchy self is fun to watch. veteran actor brian aherne plays one of the bosses with a yen for pinching our leading ladies' back side. he's delightfully charming. also in the cast is martha hyer, wasted in a thankless role never really explored. too bad as i like this actress who never seems to get that one role to distinguish her abilities. she has a crush on a married man in the office played by donald harron, whom i had the pleasure to work with in a couple of shakespeare plays in nyc. he is a distinguished actor that is wasted in this film also.all in all it's great fun, in technicolor and cinemascope, directed by jean negulesco.

having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. good afternoon fare. i understand that louis jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential gorgeous suzy parker. everyone wanted to be in and i believe it has done well and held up over time. best on screen kiss between hope lange and the late stephen boyd.it may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment. i thought the movie was well cast except the awful acting of evans. what a grease ball but he found his niche someplace else. other than that, all stepped up to the plate.

i watched the first few moments on tcm a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. i saw it listed on the schedule at the stanford theatre in palo alto, and i vowed i would make the 40 minute drive. the stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut yes, they have curtains. they opened as the fox logo fanfare began to play. when "the best of everything" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the new york city skyline, i knew i was right for waiting.i lapped this movie up. there were so many little moments that added to the look and feel of the movie: when hope lange walks into the publishing office for the first time, the titles of the magazines published there are etched on the glass (the teenager and elegance); joan crawford's swanky apron that she wore so she could serve her guests at her party without mussing her outfit; the way the camera tilted to indicate how crazy suzy parker was becoming (it was almost sideways at one point); how hope lange kept living at that dumpy flat she shared with the others even though she obviously was making a lot more money than at the beginning of the film (guess it was too scandalous for a single gal to live alone).hope lange was so beautiful; so was suzy parker. and how about mark goddard in a non-speaking role. i fell in love with him when i was a kid watching lost in space.seeing this gem on the big screen prompted me to plan another trek down to the stanford to see the old dark house. incidentally, i bought a small soda and popcorn at the concession stand, and i was taken aback when the worker asked me for two bucks.

this is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. in many ways, it's like a 50s version of valley of the dolls--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of valley polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in the best of everything does have aspirations of broadway).the film begins with hope lange coming into the company for her first day of work. she's assigned to tough-as-nails boss, joan crawford, who is appearing in her first supporting role in decades. despite how nasty crawford seems, lange is determined not to give in--to make it in this job. and, over time, she quickly moves up the ranks from secretary to editor. at the same time, her two new roommates also try to move up the ranks--one through the stage and one through a relationship with a rich playboy. like valley of the dolls, all of them have their ups and downs (mostly downs) but by the end of the film there is some hope that at least some of them will make it--battered and bruised, nevertheless.in this film, men are mostly pigs. the only guy who seems decent is played by stephen boyd, so naturally hope lange neglects him for a ne'er do well ex-boyfriend. as for the guys played by veteran character actor brian ahern and the rest, they are sexist scum and eventually you understand how crawford became so bitter and nasty.this film has it all--adultery, premarital sex, abortion, etc. and is certainly not an artistic triumph. however, thanks to excellent production values and a juicy script, this one is a joy to watch. just don't expect shakespeare!!

caroline bender (hope lange) is just killing time getting a job. her real ambition is to marry eddie and have a baby. april (diane baker) is too innocent to stay that way for long and falls in love too easily, a dangerous combo. greg (suzy parker) is a go-getter and wants to be an actress. all three are doomed for dramatics in 'the best of everything', a 1959 soap opera/morality play/sometimes solid movie that is aging by the second.set in the cut-throat world of paperback publishing, its not as trashy as "valley of the dolls" but not as vanilla as "three coins in the fountain."the men in the mix - brian aherne, stephen boyd, louis jourdan and robert evans - are slick, well-dressed and no good, for the most part. aherne is the resident sexual offender - will pinch anything walking by, and makes unwanted advances right and left. his character is offensive as hell, but its not played seriously at all. harassment hadn't been discovered yet, i guess. boyd works there, too, although you never see him actually doing anything. he's too busy being older, wiser and drunker. evans is abroad just so diane baker can suffer in style - he's a rich kid who's gotten her in 'trouble' so instead of marrying her, as promised, he's taking her to get an 'operation.' jourdan is a director who mistakenly has an affair with parker. they share a fight scene which is fairly no-holds barred, in a movie like this anyway, but the scene is ultimately ruined by parker's histronics. she ends up nearly stalking him, and she really didn't deserve such a lousy fate, her bad acting notwithstanding.joan crawford breathes fire as amanda farrow, the resident 'witch' who is automatically rude and dismissive of any of her legion of secretaries. well they are younger, aren't they? isn't that sufficient reason to hate a person? caroline doesn't think so, as she admirably stands up to miss farrow every chance she gets. crawford only gets to let loose once, when she tells her married boyfriend 'you can your rabbit-faced wife can both go to hell' and slams down the phone. you never get to see the poor soul who dare crosses her. martha hyer's 'storyline', as it were, is extremely weak, and she is painfully over-the-top as an unmarried mother. short of wearing a huge "w" (for 'whore') on her cardigan, she walks around like a pathetic mess for most of her screen time. even worse, she is not given the courtesy of having it all 'tied up', one way or the other, at the end. it won't matter that much, but still..its painfully obvious this all took place in a totally different world. people were nicer to one another for the most part and work was not a drag but something exciting, for a girl from outside nyc anyway.one unconvincing drunk scene aside, hope lange helps it seem reasonably real as caroline, who at least has more than one side to her character. i admire that women are seen having an opinion, a chance and a choice. not that its not wrapped in a nice bow, but it makes some points for equality. in 1959 that was probably noteworthy and possibly controversial. 7/10.

it's rare that i get the opportunity to review a film for imdb that relates to my own life in such a close way. however, as someone living with cerebral palsy (albeit less severe than michael, one of the main characters in the film) i don't wish to give this film a 'free pass' just because it tackles a subject that's rarely approached; and when it is, is normally treated with po-faced seriousness. there were minor problems i had with the film; and i'd like to address those first, so that people are clear that it isn't my situation which has clouded my judgement of this overall excellent film! * parts of it i felt were unashamedly crowd-pleasing, at the expense of realism. if i had a pound for every time a well-meaning member of the public has mentioned electric-wheelchair racing to me, i'd be much the richer man; but speaking personally, that fits more into the public perception of how we deal with our disadvantages, rather than the reality of what actually goes on. same thing with spending time watching disabled people go to the pub - it's not a big deal to those of us who actually do it, as much as it might be admirable for outsiders looking in. i appreciate that this is from the previously sheltered perspective of michael; but i still think he'd be concentrating more on enjoying the experience, rather than reflecting on what a big deal it was that he was actually there, in the first place. as such, the amount of time we spend seeing them have fun felt like a bit too much.* i felt that the terminal nature of rory's illness was brought to our attention far too late; meaning that it was just used as a cheap sentimental device to come between the pair, rather than something everybody knew all along was going to have to be dealt with.to balance those criticisms, i have to dish out a heap of praise, as well. although i thought some scenes showing them getting to grips with normal life were a touch overdone; the script also ventured into some tricky places i wouldn't have expected, and comes out with a lot of credit for doing so. for instance raising the issue of love and relationships; and showing the daily apparatus often used to aid and assist the lives of non able-bodied people. also, despite the blunt emotional shock tactic of death being sprung upon us, the movie as a whole is far less sappy than anyone has a right to expect these type of films to be.brenda fricker can and has been performing variations of her role capably on autopilot for what seems like years; but robertson and mcavoy share a special interaction that must be noted. inside, i'm doing cartwheels that a group of people somewhere have finally made a film doing justice to the lust for life of many disabled persons.

if you want a film with the full range of emotion, look no further; dramatic and funny, and scenes of wrenching emotion; i can safely guarantee very few will be able to view this warm and very human film without shedding a tear now and then. the acting by the two leads is hard to believe; you would swear the two young men really do suffer from muscular dystrophy (rory) and cerebral palsy (michael); quite simply, two of the finest performances i have ever seen; these are two very believable characters as well, and you never have the feeling things have just been "tossed in" for dramatic purposes or to evoke sympathy. in the dvd release as "extras" they have "deleted scenes" (including an alternate ending) and an "extended party sequence"; why these clips were not included in the final film is hard to understand, as they tie in with the rest of the film perfectly and are in no way superfluous. but without reservation i can heartily recommend this film to anyone; one of the very best i have ever seen.

this is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you. i found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability, this was represented in a great performance by both two michael and rory. whether the story is based around a true story i feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human. on the whole this film reach into my soul and i too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity. the whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience, but i feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama. certainly one not to be missed!

i got some free tickets via the times to see this little know irish movie called 'inside i'm dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.the film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. michael (steven robertson) suffers from cerabal palsy and rory (james mcavoy) suffers from muscular dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). they form a bond, as rory seems to be the only person who can understand what michael is saying. they eventually leave the home to live in a flat in carrigmore by themselves. they immediately employ the help of an attractive girl (romola garai) to look after them. the two friends eventually both fall in love with the same woman. thats the story in a nutshell, but there are lots of laughs and tears along the way... in fact... being unprepared as i was.. i found the tears were flowing way too often! in fact! i don't think i've cried so much watching a movie since the elephant man!!! this film is a huge drain on the emotions... both in the fun stuff, and the sad stuff. the acting is absolutely spot on! james mcavoy is my tip for greatness... he's a great irish actor and i think he has a great future ahead of him. steven robertson who plays michael was superb too... and it wasn't until today that i found out that he doesn't suffer from cerabal palsy and it was just some superb acting! brenda fricker is also in this film, and plays the part of the home's manager very well. the other great part has to be romola garai, she was wonderful as the love interest, and i reckon we'll be seeing more of her on the big screen in the near future!the thing that makes this film work, is not only the synergies between the two leads, but the script... which is just so #### witty it literally is on fire! i still can't help repeating some of the lines in my head even now.the photography is good, although very bleak, but then it is capturing a certain type of area of ireland. the music is great in this film too, as well as the choice in songs... the use of the johnny cash cover of the nine inch nails track 'hurt' is inspired!! if i had to sum this film up in one word... it would be 'emotional'. this film is very very funny... and then on the turn of a coin its very very sad! i still can't believe that still two days after seeing the film, looking back on it i both laugh and almost cry! this film is amazing... and i hope it goes far! although i can't see that, as its advertising budget is probably very small! so go see it! i urge you... you wont regret it...

i went to the pre-screening of "rory o'shea was here." i like this movie better than i expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. it's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his duchenne muscular dystrophy. he can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. i guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. well, it is. but with inspiring messages and deeply moving performances. it made me looking at my life for things i take for granted. what would i do if all i can do is to move my two fingers? i should feel grateful for what i have and what i am capable of doing. this is a good flick, although it could have been better.

i've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since i first caught the trailer, and i'm so glad now that i have. it's truly a wonderful film. the actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. i love james mcavoy in this, and i can't wait to see him in "the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe" movie this december. romola garai is wonderful too. be sure to check her out in "i capture the castle" or "nicholas nickleby," two of my favorite films. overall, i think i liked this movie because it didn't chicken out. it's a difficult subject matter to tell a story about, in that you're very likely to offend a lot of people or mess up and make it into some overly-sentimental-sugary-sweet love fest. but they avoided doing that completely, and instead made a film that's real, honest, and touching, yes, but never over-the-top. very well done. amazingly well done. go out and see it, and you'll know exactly what i mean.

until i saw this film, "life is beautiful" was my favourite film of all time. this film is everything a great film should be. great script, unsurpassed acting and direction that neither approaches the sentimentalism the subject tempts nor leaves it without the emotional impact it demands. this film contains the taste that could not come from hollywood and lacks the pretencion that would come from france. a wonderful movie even above the calibre i have come to expect when i see the handmade films logo come up. i need not go into detail as the previous posts encompass everything why this movie has to be seen by everyone on this planet.

surprisingly effective british drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the "flowering" of one of them. an embittered, "spike"-type youth (mcavoy) with deuchennes md is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (robertson) with cerebral palsy. robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but mcavoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings. the two leads are terrific, especially robertson, who must surely have spent some time studying the disabled to pull off this tricky role. he appears in almost every scene, and acts up an absolute storm. to anyone who doesn't know, they might think he really has cb. highly recommended.

i think i was recommended this film by the lady in the shop i was hiring it from! for once she was bang on! what a superb film! first of all i was convinced james mcavoy & romola garai were irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film i was utterly convinced steven robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure james mcavoy was also! when i watched the special features on the dvd and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say i was blown away would be an understatement!!! i can remember all the acclaim dustin hoffmann got back in the 80's for his portrayal of autism in the film 'rain man' - quite frankly (in my opinion of course!)steven robertson's performance/portrayal blows dustin hoffmann's right out of the water - and he deserves recognition as such!! all in all one of the greatest portrayals of human friendship/love/relationships ever - and it was made in britain/ireland with home grown actors - stick that in yer pipe and smoke it hollywood!

let's get it clear from the start: i am an asshole with the emotional sensitivity of cubic stone. therefore i consider dramas of people with disabilities, social stigma or whatever ailments they have and cry on and on about it as stupid movies with poor taste. i mean, if you have a message, you can tell it without the help of sick or pitiful people.however, i liked this movie. it is about people with incredible bad luck as personal health goes, but they don't cry about it, quite the opposite, they try to live and people try to "protect" or "take care" of them by actively removing them from real life. the message is live life to the fullest, even if the ending is as sad as possible.my conclusion: as sick people dramas go, this one is a keeper. it is sad, yet hopeful. i like james mcavoy, even if he does seem to always play the arrogant rebel. i also say that steven robertson played very well. either that or he really has partial paralysis. :)

i knew nothing about this film until i watched it... my brother in fact suggested i take a look. normally, his suggestions aren't much cop however, but i was stuck for something to watch so i watched it.well, to cut a long story short, i give it 10/10.the film centers around two people, that meet whilst lodging at the same place. one is initially very dependant upon the institution around him, the other is a rebel. one does what he likes, the other as he's told.from the first moments of the film we quickly see the friendship between the two building, and see how they rub off a little on each other. it's a remarkable piece of work, that manages to tell a good story without twist upon twist, people leaping out of bath tubs, or superheros coming to save the day.there's a fair amount of grit and reality in there, not everything can ever go just right - not all gulfs can ever be spanned - and this film delightfully shows the lot.if you watch this film, and are not impressed..... i'd suggest that you don't watch anything again.

damien o'donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.this is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. tell everyone you know to go see it now- fantastic!the acting is excellent, and dublin plays a starring role. this film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. i can't wait til it comes out on dvd.

inside i'm dancing (rory o'shea was here)is the story of two handicapped young men, rory o'shea, who is almost completely immobilized and confined to wheelchair, and michael connelly who is debilitated by ms and also confined to a wheelchair.set in ireland, the film opens with rory arriving at a assisted living center. he eventually befriends michael but only after a few tense scenes where rory rebels against the staff and other patients in the usual "movie way" playing loud metal music, using profanity, and general obnoxiousness. his budding friendship with michael is cemented by the fact that rory seems to be the only one who understands michael, or is at least willing to try.eventually, through some trial and tribulation the pair petition, and are granted, the right to live own their own in specially adapted apartment. the apartment is paid for by michael's father who had essentially abandoned him do to his disability. the two also hire an attractive assistant named siobhan (played by romola garai)to help them with their day to day living. this is essentially where the crux of the film develops as both develop feelings for her. michael is struck particularly hard. unfortunately, for both, but michael especially, siobhan does not feel the same and it results in her having to leave. as michael temporarily regresses and wants to return to the asst. living center, rory convinces him to continue to live on his own. the film ends on a sad note, that many viewers may have seen coming, but ultimately, we are left feeling that michael has truly become independent and the future is his, as rory pointed out to him towards the end of movie.you know, i can't say that i've seen a lot of "handicapped films" and i don't know if they could be considered a specific genre. but there is a type of formula to them. one person is unwilling to live beyond his illness until some liberating force compels him/her to do so and inside i'm dancing is really know different. what works however, is it probably is more subtle about the peaks and valleys the two men go through then what you might expect. there are no intentionally gratuitous moments and no "stand up and cheer" manipulations. the sad parts are sad and the funny parts are funny. some viewers might recoil a bit that rory is the spiky haired punk type with the earing in his nose as the too perfect "rebel" clichÃ©, but the actor, james mcavoy, somehow makes it real. the same can be said for steven robertson, who plays michael. when michael's heart is broken it doesn't seem to be invoked by a poor script trying to get the audience worked up, but rather a young man genuinely in pain over unrequited love. the kind of pain many can relate to whatever their physical condition. again, these are the types of things that make the film work and make it poignant without being overbearing and enjoyable on many levels.recommended.

okay. you saw the film and i saw the film. true? if not, there are plenty of plot summaries out there, and there is absolutely no reason for us to waste time on any feeble attempts of mine to create another.the most stunning aspect of the film is unquestionably the performances by the two young men and the young lady in the leads. their emotional honesty was as compelling, if not more so, than any performances i've seen in recent months. i found i laughed, cried and cringed right along with them, and that's saying a great deal because i'm often called a jaded and cynical jerk.as one would expect, the story is rife with clichÃ©s and i suppose that's the achilles heel of the picture. it's a story we've all seen many times before; we all know how it will end from the moment they introduce rory. though you may not know exact mechanics, you know there will be a transformative friendship, a bittersweet romance and a gut-wrenching conclusion. if it weren't for the strong cast and directing, this film would be nothing more than the soporific swill that comprises eighty percent of the hallmark channel's program schedule.

gerald (richard carlson) and kitty (veronica hurst) have just finished celebrating their engagement announcement in france with family and friends, when he receives a letter asking him to visit an ancestral castle located in scotland. gerald's uncle reportedly has fallen ill and has requested gerald, the sole heir, be present. gerald goes off to scotland, leaving his future bride behind. a few weeks pass and he doesn't come back. concerned, kitty sends out telegrams but doesn't hear back from her fiancÃ©. four more weeks pass and kitty finally receives a weird response from gerald, calling off the engagement and telling her to move on with her life. not ready to give up on her relationship and looking for answers, kitty hops on a plane and decides to pay gerald a visit. accompanying her on the trip is her level-headed aunt edith (katherine emery, best known for her starring role in the classic chiller isle of the dead). when kitty and edith arrive at the macteam estate they immediately suspect something strange is afoot. for starters gerald seems to have aged twenty-years in a matter of weeks. secondly, this once nice and charming guy has turned into a complete jerk who repeatedly demands they leave the castle and never come back. when edith comes down with a mild cold, kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom of things.why is gerald being so cold and cruel to the woman he was just about to marry? why is gerald so opposed to having company? why do the house rules state that guests must be locked inside their bedrooms at night? why are guests forbidden to enter certain areas of the estate, such as gerald's bedroom and a large hedge maze out back? and what's making those strange dragging noises every night? these are just some of the questions the maze poses. the movie actually does a fine job building up mystery and intrigue. you genuinely become interested in what's going on and patiently await the resolution to explain the weird events that are taking place. and then it happens... i definitely don't want to ruin the finale of this film because you're better off not knowing, but it takes one of the most unbelievable and jaw-droppingly strange turns i've seen in any movie. it's wonderfully ludicrous in a way, but it also takes a pretty solid little b/w mystery and sends it straight into z-grade schlock territory. and yet, this ending seems so out of place, you're not likely to forget it once you see it.despite the ending (or maybe even partially because of the ending), i really enjoyed this odd bird. it's extremely talky and slow moving for the duration of the run time, but it managed to keep my interest throughout. director william cameron menzies (who made the much more famous invaders from mars the same year) is best known as a two-time oscar-winning art director and his set designs here are also really interesting. there's almost a silent movie feel at times, with model work for some of the exteriors, some painted backdrops and sparsely decorated interiors with very high ceilings. as with any good castle set there are also secret passageways and long staircases. this one also throws in a few rubber-bats-on-strings for good measure.a few of the actors are a little stiff and awkward, but i liked most of the cast. hurst is one of those obscure and mostly unknown actresses who unfortunately never seemed to catch on despite being both beautiful and talented. emery, who also gets to play narrator in framing shots at the beginning and end of the film, is decent enough as the overly mannered and cautious aunt. my favorite however was michael pate as the silver-haired sinister servant who does this hilariously upright zombie walk every time he ascends the stairs. also on board in smaller roles are hillary brooke (who played the title role in the sherlock holmes mystery the woman in green) and lilian bond (whale's the old dark house). of course carlson also starred in it came from outer space, creature from the black lagoon and some other horror flicks, so you've got yourself a pretty decent cast for genre fans right there. i say check it out!

i recently saw this film at a 3-d film festival in hollywood. it was in polarized 3-d (gray glasses not red & blue) it was so much fun to watch this film with an audience, the print was excellent and the 3-d perfect. the performances were over the top and that added to the fun, the surprise ending (that we aren't supposed to share with fellow movie go'ers, at least according to the movie trailer and poster) had people howling with laughter. by today's standards this is probably more comedy than horror but with the added dimension of 3-d (complete with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen) this film was an entertaining romp into 50's horror.

is this a good movie? it's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when "the old gentleman" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.yes, what lurks in the maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. but the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact. not that it would ever result in what we see in the movie, of course.but working on what must have been a very low budget, one of the greatest production designers -- and the person for whom the term "production designer" was invented -- creates a very eerie mood that was strangely compelling. at times, of course, the movie is very silly, but it has its moments.

a woman and her aunt go to scotland to locate her evasive fiancÃ©. this is a much-maligned film because of its denouement, but up to that point, it's interesting, well-acted, eerie, and with fine set design (by william cameron menzies, developed for 3-d projection). veronica hurst is captivating and genteel, sort of a chic british marilyn monroe, still in love with richard carlson, who is hiding a family secret in his forbidding castle; there are even bats in the belfry! it moves leisurely until the final extraordinary set-piece, when hurst and her aunt (katherine emery, also the narrator), sneak out of the castle in the night to venture into the maze and find what they're looking for in its center. as a kid, i always remembered this sequence - there's nothing scarier (or claustrophobic) than not finding your way out of a 10-foot high maze of hedges. naturally, the two women get separated, setting the stage for engrossing suspense with horrific music. the final result is mildly disappointing really, since carlson's epilogue at the end makes some sense to all the goings-on, even provoking sympathy. worth seeing.

i remember this film of old. it's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. and there are even stranger events taking place out back, in hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including "the shining." but the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. i certainly didn't see it coming. this is a fine example of how good and convincing a movie can be even when the premise is utterly loopy, bordering on laughable. i'd recommend it to anyone.

i liked it better than house party 2 & 3. the cast was hilarious and cool at the same time. chris stokes, who directed the film, has a very humorous cameo in it as a car repairman; look for his mom who plays the lead character, john john's grandmother. and you can hear her rap the title song "down to the last minute" at the end of the film as the credits roll. she's very funny and a really good actress, as well. the young actors who star in it (the main trio), and who in reality are part of the music group imx, did a superb job. before this film i had not paid much attention to this r & b group. now i'm a fan. the music number in the house party scene alone is worth checking out the movie. i was pleasantly surprised. i loved it.

the main reason i loved this movie is because imx (formerly immature) were in it. they were in house party 3 when they were 11, but they are all grown up now! i was a little shocked at some of the things they were doing in the movie (almost ready to tear my hair out), but i had to realize that they were not my little boys anymore. i think chris stokes did a pretty good job, considering that is was his first movie.

here in germany it was only shown on tv one time. today, as everything becomes mainstream, it's absolute impossible, to watch a film like this again on the screen. maybe it's the same in usa, or especially gb. the message is a brutal truth : find friends to make your ideas come a bit closer to reality, or you become a loser, if not an asshole instead.the whole film is not particularly as simple, as it may seem here. every little scene, every sentence, every behavior of the characters show a sharp look at what could happen, when one person is not accepted in a sadistic crowd, which calls itself normal.very well played by all this is a must seen. who is the main character? john (not cox, folks, remember ;-) ore niles (who still is bimbo) decide and you will get the plot as it is intended.a bitter look at what society becomes in a repressive system. kind of salingers catcher in the rye and goldings lord of the flies thought to the very end.the final maybe change your own mind. word

this is the ultimate of horror movies this year. "house of wax" is one of the scariest movies i've ever seen. this version really puts the vincent price version of the movie to shame. i only know a few of the young cast in the movie. the ever troublesome paris hilton; the pain in the you know what seems to be more seductive than ever. at least, she didn't try to copy her infamy. well if she likes to do horror, she's better than "wheel of fortune's" vanna white. she beats vanna hands down! and the scene of where "house of wax" was made was no joke. the house was made of wax, and the victims were able to get out of there before the get waxed like their friends. those two twins bo and vincent(the deformed twins) were maniacs from the get-go. the parents raised them well, except for vincent. and i think they became equally warped. how come the the one in the other pick-up happen to be creepy, but not as bad as the other two. that's another story in the book. i guess he had to follow his heart, and not the other twins who turned ambrose into a tourist "trap" for unsuspecting victims. this movie is like "the phantom of the opera" meets "the rocky horror picture show". and this movie is one of the scariest one in 2005! rating 4 out of 5 stars.

i think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car "to get stripped" deserves whatever happens to them.the guy, wade who "went to a barbershop and asked for the he-man haircut" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. that's a little too high-maintenance for me. also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks "like elton john only gayer," but that whole plot goes nowhere! blake was hot,i could see myself with him if he wasn't so into his girlfriend, who is a phony paris hilton in a bad wig (no chihuahaua in her handbag,though but that would have been really precious). i don't think girls who look like that go to football games anyways. nick the car thief is the sexiest! one of the best parts is where a football lands by him, and instead of throwing it back, he chucks his cigarette down and it burns the football. see, that's just the kind of guy he is. he has a sister who looks dumb borrowing his white wife-beater. her bra straps are showing for, like 1/2 the movie!mostly you will just want to wax your legs and not ever go to football games after seeing this.

people are stupid.you shouldn't cheer when paris gets killed in the head with a pipe! it is plain rude!what did paris do to you? what if that was you? you wouldn't want people cheering for your death!anyway it was really gory, which i liked and it was cool when elisha's finger gets cut off.it was weird with that twist that they didn't have 2 sons they had tree and all, it makes way for a house of wax 2: ressurction or something.paris was great acting in the chase scene.elisha and chad chemistry is great, they deserve an oscar.my friends and i were cracking up when that guy said that's hot when paris and the guy from cousin skeeter making out.lol.k bye.

i saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. i probably would have enjoyed it more if i hadn't been sitting by my father. my father saw the original (unfortunately, i have not seen it yet) and kept talking through the whole thing. he kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. the thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. in every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted. if they weren't in the movie, well, you might not really like it too much. the trademark characters are:"the lead character": carly (elisha cuthbert) "the lead character's boyfriend": wade (jared padalecki) "the lead character's sibling/(soon-to-be)reformed jerk": nick (chad michael murray) "the annoying sluttish character": paige (paris hilton) "characters who are just around to look pretty": dalton (jon abrahams) & blake (robert ri'chard)with those characters, it makes it slightly predictable who will die and who will live. obviously, you know who will with what i just typed. the movie may be predictable (in fact, i had a pretty good idea who would die just by watching the trailer), but it was still enjoyable. it may seem stupid (why is there a sugar mill in the middle of a deserted camp-site that wasn't there in the beginning?) at times, but it is very easy to watch. the comedy and gore were the perfect amount for weak-stomached movie-goers it does get gory, don't get me wrong, (less than "final destination 2) but it works very well. so in conclusion, this movie wasn't as hot as the fire the set went up in, but the temperature could still burn the "wax".

ok so paris hilton sucks in it (typical malibu barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! i watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. chad michael murray is sooooooooooooooooooo hottttttttttttttttttttt and he's just a ace actor. total hero man. the main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. thumbs up. i think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax! i totally got creepers out by the wax models in the house although they looked so real. i still haven't got the story with the twins at the moment, i am just waiting to get the dvd then watch it all over again. thumbs up to such a great film! 11/10. all those people who don't like it, please don't bother 2 criticise my opinion as mostly everyone thinks its cool to do so. also i think the paris scene when she strips to her underwear is totally inconvenient. why not just get a dog shagging some cat.. be more entertaining then that. when paris death scene came up, i thought it was poor as she still kept running although a knife just went up her foot. hmm.. interesting. !chad all the way!

this was the greatest movie i have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore which made it great, i would see it 1,000 more times, and paris hilton, d*mn she fine in that movie. but anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) adults like it to. you would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, it is awesome, i cant stop bragging about it. ever sine augest when i heard about it i bragged and bragged and in school i gave out flyer's saying may 6 house of wax see it. i got my whole school into it. but anyway, i would definitely saysee it may 6 house of wax, be there it be slayed.

this is one of the best horror / suspense films that hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades.even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts, it has everything that a good film in this genre should had chill, thrills, and yes a lot of gore!! house of wax sure delivers!!! in parts it was sort of far-fetched,the acting was not that great,but my overhaul rating for house of wax is an eight out of ten......if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats, this is just the right movie for you,i have to admit,it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax...... i myself enjoy these museums, but after seeing this film i will now look at them in a whole new different way!

i usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. house of wax was by far the best horror film i have seen... even better than the amityville horror.paris hilton was quite good in this and i must say, has a good future ahead. her death scene was probably the coolest. i'll just say how she dies...she gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. gory, eh? brian van holt was very good as both the killers, bo and vincent (vincent had the long hair). usually he plays a mean cop or soldier, but he did very well in this.eliza cuthbert and chad michael murray also acted very well as carly and nick jones. nick took the spotlight in the first half of the movie, then eliza stole it back by enduring a lot of pain in the second half like getting the finger clipped off, ripping her lips apart after they got glued together, and getting a straight forward punch in the face by bo.overall, i give this movie an 8/10. fans of horror films must see this.

probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because paris hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the spoilers of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - paris hilton's! after finding her boyfriend blake laying on the ground with a knife sticking out of his neck, paige starts to run. well, speed walk is more respectable. she finds this like garage with all these cars in it. then (one of) the killers cuts her ankle from below (this whole time shes holding a huge metal spike)so she drops it and runs and hides behind this car. the killer picks it up and as she looks through the window he throws it through the window and it shoots through her forehead.. i've never been so excited or laughed so hard in my life.2. paige's boyfriend blake gets a knife stabbed into his neck and then the killer walks up to him (while hes on the ground) and steps on it pushing it farther into his throat.. then he dies.3. elisha cuthbert (carly)(one of the hottest chicks ever) doesn't die phew but she does get her lips super-glued together, punched in the face, and gets part of her index finger chopped off (yeah, i felt like heaving) 4. carly's twin brother nick also survives, but not without getting his ass kicked and a stab wound to the leg.5. nicks best friend dalton gets thrown down a flight of stairs, and then is decapitated. his body is dragged away and we see his eyes blink.. then he gets covered in wax.6. wade (carly's boyfriend) gets his achilles tendon snipped by a massive pair of scissors, and then is attacked by the same scissors. he doesn't die, but hes covered in wax, and on 2 occasions his skin is accidentally removed, revealing his nasty bloody flesh. yummy...so there it is. definitely worth your money.

admittedly, before seeing house of wax, i assumed it would simply be a second tier low quality teen slasher film following in the footsteps of such movies as the darkness or amityville horror. after catching an advanced showing at my college campus, i can honestly say that the people at dark castle have done an excellent job with the task of making a slasher. starting with the usual staples of a teenage horror film such as the small group of friends departing on a road trip, coming across an odd detour taking them through country back-roads, meeting creepy locals, after the slow but mandatory back-story this movie really reaches a fast clip. paris hilton appears in this film as many already know, but i really have to give it to her for her ballsy performance. clearly her acting wasn't worth an oscar, but the filmmakers use her appearance to its fullest by squeezing two blatant satires of her, let's just say, less noble media appearance into this film. ms. hilton also claims the title for the greatest death scene in the movie, and not simply because it was her death scene.this movie is full to the brim with jumpy moments and cheap scares, but jaume serra has definitely created quality suspense and tension between the characters. the causes for the horror are in part based on making the audience care for the characters, which we do. by making the usual buildup followed with a loud noise and jerked camera some other scary moments. these standard movie techniques adopted from many movies past are almost perfected with this film, and provide many good scares. in fact there isn't a slow moment after they get to the small town where the dreaded house of wax museum is. this film owes a lot to many previous movies of this and other genres, though i'm not too sure how much came from the original 1953 movie of the same title. references to such movies as both texas chainsaw masacres, saw, and even titanic, (see paris hilton's big death scene and you'll know what i mean) are common, but in the end the payoff will leave you scared and fulfilled if you are looking for a good scare with a few laughs. not bad.

carly jones (elisha curtberth), her bad boy brother nick (chad michael murray), her boyfriend wade (jared padalecki), and her friends paige (paris hilton) and her boyfriend blake (robert richard) and dalton (jon abrahams) travel to another city to watch an important game. they decide to camp in a field halfway and proceed their journey on the next day. however, the fan belt of wade's car breaks and he stays with carly to buy a new one in a close town, where there is a house of wax. when they arrive in the place, they realize that the place is a ghost town, and two deranged former siamese brothers have transformed people in wax statues.i liked this "house of wax", indeed a worthwhile teen horror movie. the story follows the standards of "the texas chainsaw massacre" and other slash movies, and it is well made, has a good team of actors and actresses and special effects and the death scenes are amazing. even if the movie were not good, watching the sexy and delicious paris hilton is worth. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "a casa de cera" ("the house of wax")

i recently saw house of wax and must say i really enjoyed it.it's been one of the better horror/thriller films in the past few years, if not one of the best and most entertaining.i've heard a lot of people bashing the so-called slow start and character development which takes up the films opening 45 minutes.yet if the film dived straight into the deaths, audiences and critics would have criticised the film for not having decent characters who they couldn't care less about.well as for the character development, i think it worked amazingly well.taking into my own response and others (from reading posts off the message board), a lot of people ended up wanting the characters to live, one of which i've noticed many people mentioning being paige edwards (paris hilton). taking into consideration warner. bros. have been marketing her death, its a surprise turn around that many audiences ended up cheering her on for survival.speaking of the chase/death scenes, they were some of the most inventive and suspenseful i've witnessed in a while, and enjoyed each one very much.the acting in the film was absolutely fine, i couldn't fault any of them, especially paris hilton, i thought she was very decent and i was hoping for her the get more than a mere 25 minutes screen time in a 120 minute film, yet her chase scene made up for that, and believe me when i say paris can act scared, (watch the scene where she's hiding in a car from vincent and he walks past her .... the look of terror on her face comes across as very real).overall i give house of wax maximum stars, for entertainment value and suspense and even gore ...... only criticism is i wish that during the marketing for the film, they hadn't revealed the death list and who dies and who survives, as it would have been ten times better not knowing if the character being chased was going to live or die and horrible death.can't wait for the dvd, but go see it at the cinema while you can, it won't be the same in your own front room, yet if you do wait for the dvd, watch the film in the dark with no interruptions, trust me you wont be disappointed.

ok, why complain about this movie? it's fiction. deal with it. if you want to see the biography, go watch it. this is an original, fictionalized version of what happened in wisconsin. people who are obsessed will complain about this, as they do every other deviation of the facts. sad but true. i think making kane hodder the man in which the film is named after was a great idea. i thought it wasn't so good at first, i'll be honest. but that just made it even scarier. if you like kane hodder, ed gein or movies based on real events, i think this is a good movie. but if you're obsessed (like some other people) stay away from this movie and all others.

league of gentleman has been the most disturbing british sitcom to be on t.v and how can a funny movie be so bad rated,they just have no taste this film will make you want to watch over and over again and still find it funny.it is surprising that it has done bad but it is british the cinema do crap most of the time but this time it (in my words) a boost with comedy with a giraffe spunks over lady's, this is a top british comedy and better than dodge-ball, so by this and it won't prove you wrong as i don't really laugh through films but this film was amazing through comedy with the best characters but i was a bit disappointed of how much edward and tabb's were in there for back to typing buy this film and it won't disappoint you.

now i myself had previously seen a few episodes of the leauge of gentleman which i found hilarious. when i brought the film i was not sure if i knew enough about the series to get it, boy was i wrong. this is one of the best comedy films i have seen ever and the clever acting of the leauge makes the film. it has a very good and funny plot as well as using only a few characters at any one time helps because it doesn't make it too confusing which would have wrecked the film. even if you have never seen the leauge of gentleman get this film it will make you laugh and this is a film that can be watched more then once and is an excellent film to watch with your mates. it truly deserves it review a definite 10 out of 10.

having only seen five episodes of the show before this, (i've been watching the repeats on bbc two) i haven't really had much experience of the league, but as a fledgling fan as well as a massive fan of british comedy, i can say this film is hilarious. seeing herr lipp, (who i had not seen on screen before the film) briss and geoff on the big screen was a great comedy experience. being on screen is something that the league take full advantage of, with heads blowing up, (it'll come as a surprise who it is) and gruesome murders with random middle ages style battles all the way.geoff is easily the funniest character of the three protagonists in this film, because he has the best one liners and overall behaviour, just like in the series. one of my only disappointments with the film was not hearing geoff shout "well now i've got this gun" even once, (even though there is a build-up to it in one part of the film.) the film itself overall is, to use the phrase everyone else does, pythonesque and it's very reminiscent of films like "life of brian." appearances from tubbs and edward were welcome, but papa lazarou's line "hello daves" cracked me up more than anything said by them, (lazarou's probably my favourite vasey character after tubbs and edward.) it's got quite a poignant ending with one of the main character being killed off and i can only hope this is not the league's last on-screen vasey venture. with gatiss mentioning the possibility of another series or film, i'm now very excited. this is a film i will see again, partly because the projector died towards the end, leaving out 10 minutes or so of the film, but mainly because it's inventive and hilarious. i'm not really bothered if it's not as good as the tv series, because i loved it.one thing though, if you've never seen the league, you'll still love it, but dave knows what you'll think about the people who make this stuff up. as tubbs or edward might put it, it's a local film, for local people, and a precious thing at that.**** out of ***** (4/5)

okay, i'm not sure if this counts as a spoiler so i just ticked the box anyway to save the hassle.i've noticed that the opinions on this film seem to be a fair split. personally, i loved it, although i must say that i think that some of the cameo's were there for the sake of having a cameo. (peter kay?) personally, i am just thankful that it wasn't the edward, tubbs and papa lazarou show, and that they chose the 3 best characters in the series to headline the motion picture, especially sir goeff tipps arguably the funniest of the bunch.actually, this is less of a summary more of a fairly obtuse blog-like thing, but what the hell, the film was awesome, and i guess that's all that counts.

whether you're a fan of the series which inspired it or not, there's no denying this is a patchy piece of work. but in the best possible sense. keen to get away from the trappings of old sitcoms which made an uneasy transition to the big screen, messrs pemberton, dyson, shearmsith and gatiss have gone down a different road, addressing the problems of dealing with their success along with adding other creations and, inevitably, rehashing some of their best-loved characters. it's a pity they didn't stick to just a more consistent league of gents movie because as inventive as including themselves in the screenplay is, it weakens the finished movie. well worth renting though.

i am an addict of the tv show, the live shows and everything they do. and this was the last piece of work they have done on tv/film as 'the league of gentlemen'.if you love the series then you will absolutely love the film. it is a nice ending to their tv series. it is clever and funny.although it does not focus on some of the most popular characters, it is still great to see all the characters together and with the writers. a must see for any league of gentlemen fan.watch it!

i originally watched this because i thought it was going to be the sequel to the league of extraordinary gentlemen and this movie is a whole different thing entirely going on here-a comedy! however, i loved it anyways! the league of gentlemen is apparently some british tv series with some rather odd characters and some sharp humour. this is british comedy so it revolves around being very silly, dressing up in costumes and making lots of fun of germans and french, homosexual references- in short it's very very funny!the plot revolves around the writers of the tv show deciding to cancel some of the characters and the characters coming out of their dimension into the writer's dimension to stop that from happening. it's a fun twist and there's plenty of great scenes in this idiotic adventure. i laughed out loud numerous times and applauded the brazen style of humour. this makes mr bean look like the watered down wimp he is.(rowan is much better in black adder series btw)this is not monty python, but you can never escape the comparison when you are talking british humour, and there are a few similarities but not so many as to keep it from being it's own thing and being fresh. it leans more towards the young ones and guest house paradiso in its' comedic style.if you liked this, check out the young ones series and guest house paradiso movie, and of course, i assume the tv series league of gentlemen must be rather funny as well.

as an american fan of the league of gentlemen i had to wait months to finally see this film when it came out on dvd, but it was well worth the (excruciating) wait. "apocalypse" is fantastic- funny, freaky, clever as hell, full of in-jokes and cryptic references to the television series; basically everything you'd expect from the gentlemen.the plot has already been discussed in other reviews, so i won't bother re-capping it, although i will say when i first read it i was a bit hesitant. obviously this device- fictional characters entering the real world to confront their makers- has been used before, notably in wes craven's underrated "new nightmare" and stephen king's "dark tower" books (where king himself was a character). the gentlemen have fun breaking the fourth wall, though, and even add a new element: a second fictional world ("them days"). soon all three realities have weaved together, and the result is exhilarating: geoff tipps being knighted in the middle ages (and trying to court queen victoria wood); the real league of gentlemen in royston vasey, being confronted by characters like pauline and dr. chinnery; david warner summoning an homunculus outside of bernice's church. i've heard that some people disliked the "king's evil" sub-plot, but i found it hilarious, especially reece's character (who seemed to be channeling judith the "witch" from series three).speaking of the characters, i was relieved to find that, although hilary briss, geoff, and herr lipp were planted firmly in at the film's core, other, more familiar characters were given their due. bernice's confessional in the beginning was hilarious, hearkening back to the quicker, more sketch-oriented feel of the first series. pauline and mickey have cameos (no ross though- strange), although i would've loved to've seen more of ms. campbell-jones. papa lazarou is accounted for, as are tubbs and edward. all three are used very sparingly, giving their meager screen time an almost magical feel (and just what the hell did papa hack up, like an obscene hairball? according to the dvd commentary, a "wad of greasy pubic hair").the film looks incredible, but then, what's new? the music, as always, is breathtaking. i was thrilled to hear joby talbot's new interpretations of the theme music, and his slight re-working of the majestic, lovely piece that closes out both "apocalypse" and the last episode of series three.i have some minor complaints- it would have been nice to see more of the old, familiar royston vasey, and i felt the stop-motion creatures (beautiful, by the way) were a bit underused. both of these issues, however, can be justified by the film's budget, so they're understandable. still, as much as i loved bernice's new church, it would have been cool to see the final battle in the high street (the gentlemen's original vision, according to the commentary).overall, "apocalypse" is astounding, especially if you're a fan of the series. i can't recommend it highly enough. 10/10.

i never saw any of the league's work until early last year - although when channel hopping one night i caught the end of one the series three episodes. but last winter i fell in love with the show and its dark, eccentric and sometimes downright sinister characters. so when i learnt they had made a film in which the show's lovable creators met their own characters, i couldn't order the dvd fast enough and near on tore it from my postman's hands when he delivered it. i was so excited to see what the gents had done and how they'd done it.and it was excellent! from the beginning where jeremy (michael sheen) is terrorised by edward, tubbs and papa (dyson, why didn't you play yourself? he's perfectly capable as viewers of the infamous highgate house of horrors know!), to bernice berating yet another one of her flock, to geoff, herr lipp and hilary discovering that they are characters, which is a great scene. the scenes set in 1690 are very enjoyable, with the gents turning their hands to yet more characters and an all new plot. david warner's turn as doctor pea is fantastic, slightly camp and very funny.the league have always been brilliant at blending humour with sadness and emotion - and the climax of this film, where herr lipp is struggling with the idea that he and the other vasey residents are just fictional people who will never be able to change who they are or their purpose - and to witness how it's breaking him down, is really sad and beautiful to watch at the same time and that really shows the gents' talent - something for which they are terribly overlooked for to this day.and then you have that rather clever ending - where you sit in wonder - with joby talbot's beautiful theme music playing. and you know you've enjoyed a very clever and funny film.

the best british comedy film ever! for years english comedy television programs have turned into films and have flopped, 'are you being served?' 'dads army', the list goes on. however the popular dark humoured bbc television show; 'the league of gentlemen' has managed to not only create a film which has managed to not be a flop but has also managed to be the best british comedy film ever! with its dark and horrific twists and turns the league of gentlemen's apocalypse is british talent at its best! its intriguing demonic storyline written by the league of gentlemen (mark gatiss, steve pemberton, reece shearsmith and jeremy dyson) matches with the gents (and guest cameos) superb acting! this i hope is not the end of royston vasey, not after this great success anyway! don't think that if you have not seen the league of gentlemen on the telly that you will not understand whats going on. its all well explained and by the end of the film you will be happy with the result but you are still left hungry for more... mmmm, special stuff.

after three outstanding bbc television series' and a christmas special, the bizarre and grotesque (yet perversely lovable) characters of bleak fictional town royston vasey make the jump to celluloid, along with their creators - the league of gentlemen. mark gatiss, steve pemberton and reece shearsmith are the more familiar three-quarters of the foursome, with the central roles shared between the trio. in an added twist, the final member of the team - jeremy dyson - is portrayed by actor michael sheen. where to start? dyson (sheen) is in conversation with his writing cohorts, when - horror of horrors - he is paid a visit by two of his grisliest characters. both tubbs (pemberton) and edward tattsyrup (shearsmith) are unhappy at the league's decision to kill off the vasey inhabitants. "you're not real!" screams dyson in vain, as the local shopkeepers from hell exact their revenge. mayhem ensues, as reality and vasey converge with the vast array of characters entering our world to save theirs. confused? you will be, as the camp, innuendo-ridden teutonic, herr lipp (pemberton) is forced to take on the daily guise of pemberton (pemberton), while pemberton (pemberton) is kidnapped by cannibalistic butcher hillary briss (gatiss) and geoff tipps (shearsmith). with shades of an even more demented misery, briss attempts to force pemberton to rewrite the film - thus continuing his life - but leaving geoff in charge is never a good idea. the erstwhile comedian becomes embroiled in the league's latest, post-vasey adventure - the king's evil - entering a typically twisted 17th century england, complete with cameos from victoria wood, peter kay and david warner. known as george of asda (due to his select line of clothing), geoff saves the day and is treated as a hero, but for the denouement of the film, he joins characters old and new at the church of royston vasey to meet with their makers. for fans of the series, the film is a must-see. and yes, it does feature papa lazarou (albeit a little too fleetingly). pen-loving pauline, mickey, barbara and cursed vet matthew chinnery are some of the other favourites on show, and the league's portrayal of themselves (plus sheen's as dyson) is also a fascinating insight. the league of gentlemen are the radiohead of british comedy - they are ambitious, groundbreaking (witness the excellent series three) and not happy to rest on their laurels. they also divide opinion accordingly.certainly, their macabre sense of humour is not for every palate, and while not written exclusively for 'fans', a grasp of the storyline would benefit those who have previously viewed the series. nevertheless, apocalypse is a film in its own right and the league will no doubt manage to attract a new breed of fan, as well as appeasing and pleasing existing ones.

i have to admit that when i first heard about the apocalypse film it was a worry.i mean, they have a lot to live up to, don't they? when they first did a stage show they won the perrier award and when they did radio they won a sony award. when they ventured onto our telly's they won a bafta award, a royal television society award and the golden rose of montreux.when the first series aired in january 1999 it was mind-blowing! a real breath of fresh air in british comedy, and when the second series aired a year later it built on that foundation and sealed the shows cult status around the world, our web stats show that we have received visitors from every single country on the planet! the 'local show for local people' showcased the gents talent for live performance and opened doors for the gents to do more live performing such as 'art' in the west end.the fans favourite has always been the christmas special, less of a sketch show and more a tribute to classic horror films yet still wrapped up in the delicious league style.and then of course there was the 'difficult' third series, still a hit with the loyal hardcore fans of course, but maybe a little bit ahead of its time for a mainstream tv audience.as i say, a lot to live up to.so now we have the film and...well a film is different isn't it? it will be seen by much larger numbers than the radio or tv shows and with the third series in mind i was worried.well as you know i was lucky enough to get to see the film yesterday at a press screening in london and all my doubts were blown away (literally) in the first few minutes! i am not going to give plot lines away as some reviewers have done, nor am i going to tell you the catch phrases (although there is really only one) but i will try to tell you what they have managed to achieve with this film! leaving the cinema on monday night i could only imagine writing 'oh my god, it's brilliant, its amazing, its the best thing they have ever done, better than the first, second and specials all rolled into one!' of course i owe my visitors a much better explanation than that! so, why is it brilliant? this is a film for everyone, the casual fan, the obsessive fan the occasional fan and even for someone who is sat in the wrong cinema! you don't have to have watched the series to enjoy this film; it works on so many levels.this film reminded me why i am a league of gentlemen fan! you can tell that filming was a true labour of love too; the attention to detail is incredible. the sets for the tv show were always detailed but i am going to have to watch the film again just to look at the background! the story moves at a swift pace, the action carrying us from royston vasey to the real world where we meet the 'creators' who are of course the league themselves! along the way we manage to bump into favourite characters from the show but always within the central story unlike the tv sketch show.i was glad that the film was dark in places, a little scary and a little strange...only fitting for the league of gentlemen. the gents also managed to get their revenge on the bbc censors, not as much slipping in the word 'mongoloid' as screaming it from the roof tops! some may think the gents portrayal of themselves a little indulgent but that's the joke and with that comes my only worry, the in jokes i mention below may puzzle some viewers and they might come over a little too clever...but i shouldn't worry, there is always a poo joke waiting just around the corner and speaking of jokes, they come thick and fast, and in a mixture of clever references, wig jokes, bum jokes, visual jokes and cock gags! i haven't laughed out loud in a cinema since...well, i can't remember! the fans that have been 'with' the league since the beginning are rewarded with loads of 'in' jokes, some that work on two levels, a mainstream audience may laugh at a reference to a compact disc for one reason whilst fans of the local show will laugh for another reason altogether! the cameos are genius! peter kay and simon pegg form the strangest double act you have ever seen, simon getting one of the films biggest laughs just by making a noise! i was a little worried about the 1690's aspect of the film when i first heard about it but as a story within a story i was just getting into it when...but that would be telling! all i need to say is that it fits wonderfully and adds to the overall feel of the film! i am not a professional reviewer of films, so i am finding it difficult to put into words how much i enjoyed this film but for now i will just say that if the supposed benchmark for british comedy films in recent years was the excellent 'shaun of the dead' then i am sorry but a new benchmark has just been set by the inventive, hilarious and sometimes a little scary...the league of gentlemen's apocalypse.jason kenny 2005

for many the hit series was ten years of pitch black humour loaded with affectionate parodies of classic films and a hilarious assortment of over a hundred characters with instantly recognisable catchphrases. few shows have survived transition from radio to tv to stage show to film but the league of gentlemen have achieved it with suitable aplomb.the talented writer/performers had initially envisioned a monty python style medieval adventure, but as soon as writing began they soon realised that the characters they have lived with had become very real and deserved better. with that, the royston vasey folk realise their very existence is under threat as the writers decide to disregard the fictitious town and work on a 17th century romp instead.with the exception of michael sheen playing much unseen league member jeremy dyson, the league play pretty unlikeable caricatures of their real life personae as well as the familiar faces of tubbs ("i made a little brown fishy"), nightmare inducing sexual predator herr lipp, butcher hilary briss and an unlikely hero - irate businessman geoff tibbs. new faces appear when the third reality appears, it's here we are treated to charming and funny cameos from veteran actors and popular tv stars. for many this will be a really enjoyable 90 minutes.'apocalpse is not going to please everyone though. working on this level of post modernism has been done a few times before now and may seem all too familiar to audiences raised on irony drenched teen successes kick-started by the likes of wes craven having a new nightmare. it also takes a lot of confidence in an audience to keep up with a high concept story so there are moments of exposition and dialogue that serve only to confirm what most in the audience already know. comedy as a genre is formulaic but it's now unheard of for a british film not to fall back on the huge back catalogue of tv stars to fill short amounts of screen time. it's also hard to believe the creators ever wanted their offspring killed off, which is perhaps why some of the role reversal doesn't always quite hit the mark. would hilary briss have wanted to try save royston vasey in the series?however, while the show's deliciously dark vein has almost all but disappeared but is arguably more accessible for it. much will be said about the character development and efforts to humanise the likes of previously one joke incarnations like herr lipp. it is here an impossible level of depth can be found along with a harsh streak of biting satire and throwaway put downs. sentiment is there with a lump in the throat but not sugar coated thickly enough to intrude on the action. the music is good, performances exemplary and the animation is wonderfully seamless; a nice throwback to terry gilliam and ray harryhausen's work. in short, there's a lot to like about the apocalypse. like so many tv to film transfers it was never going to be easy finding the line between preaching to the converted and introducing the uninitiated to the league's slick and distinct voice. but no matter what your preference is, this last trip to the town which 'you'll never leave' is oddly lined with hope and ultimately very, very touching.

just saw 'the league of gentlemen: apocalypse' at a special screening in manchester, with mark gatiss and reece shearsmith of the league in attendance.at the back was peter kay (who has a brief cameo in the film) affectionately heckling at the back during the q & a session after the film.the film was complicated (in a good way) and very very funny. it follows geoff tipps, hilary briss and herr lipp as they try and save fictional rosyton vasey from the disinterest of their creators.the league play a wide range of their characters and themselves (or character based on themselves) and are ably supported by the cream of british character and comedy actors such as bernard hill, victoria wood and david warner.warner is a particular stand out reminding me of his smooth and cutting turn in 'time bandits'.the film swims in and out of various realities and allows some of the denizen's of rosyton vasey some space to grow beyond their usual limits of their comedy shtick.steve pemberton's herr lipp has a great bretchian moment near the end of the movie and has to make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life which brings a lump to the throat at an unexpected moment and surprises you with its tender affection for the characters.this echoes something mark and reece said in the q & a afterwards, that the plot of the league being tired of their famous characters is spurious and that the whole film is really a love letter to them.for a format that started as a radio character-based sketch show, these guys have really evolved the idea so far as to sustain a movie which takes you on a journey through fiction, 'reality', comedy, tragedy and a pleasing journey for two of the less obvious characters to carry a long form story from their 70 odd existing creations.the fans of the show will love it. it pays off dedication and attention to detail in spades, the uninitiated may be a little lost, but the joy of the log was always the ability to almost instantly tune into their acutely observed characters and take the stylistic leap into farce and expressionistic movie homage.there are homages a plenty in this one including 'the shining' and 'la belle et la bete', to name but two i spotted and they ably demonstrate their love for cinema and history with a segment in 1690's england that makes perfect sense when you're engaged with the movie.what can i say, i marvelled, boggled, emoted and snickered throughout and they have definitely pulled off what many have failed at. a successful british tv comedy to cinema translation.if you've watched and enjoyed 'the league of gentlemen' in the past, go see it; you will enjoy.if you haven't, rent/buy a dvd and then go see it.well done guys and thanks for the charming and humorous q & a.

there are two ways to turn a tv series into a film.the first, most common, and least successful, is to basically make a feature-length tv episode- see the disasters of the steptoe & son movie. the second is to do something else- something quite different, Ã  la monty python.thankfully, the creators of the cult tv series have gone for the second option, and they've come up with something unique, clever and funny- it couldn't feel less like a tv episode.try to get your head around this- the writers, playing themselves, are confronted by their royston vasey alter-egos, played, of course, by them, and told to continue writing the series, otherwise apocalypse will befall the village.high-concept, contrived and easy to screw up? yes, but somehow they managed to pull it off. not for every taste, perhaps, and the ending does drag, but fans will be delighted, and it might even win over the uninitiated.

the film was apparently spawned from an idea one of the writers had when he 'saw' one of his creations in a supermarket. the inhabitants of royston vasey head into 'our' world to persuade the writers not to stop writing about them and thus destroy their world.if that sounds a bit too serious, don't be put off. within the first few minutes we get: bernice (the vile female vicar) letting rip at an unfortunate penitent during confession; chinnery (the vet who inadvertently destroys every animal he touches) attempting to collect semen from a giraffe; mickey (thick beyond belief) being, ah, thick; and tubbs (inbred sister-wife and local shopkeeper) being sweet as ever - but still disgusting.some of the regular characters are missing, but a new idea by the gents introduces some 16th-century characters - and we have the gents themselves in the action too. if you're new to the league of gentlemen, this is an easy introduction and a lot of fun. if you're a long-standing fan, this has everything you've come to expect - including the joys of jeremy dyson spotting.all told, it's got the same faintly surreal humour that's the hallmark of the series, plus some moments of quite touching 'introspection'. herr lipp, for example, maintains a gentle dignity on learning that he's regarded by his creators as a 'one-joke character'. while most of the characters stay as they are, some develop in unexpected ways that are perfectly natural when they happen.this film is a 'swan song' for royston vasey, but it's also a showcase for the gents who prove that (gasp!) they can write other stuff - and it can be very funny. (but you knew that anyway.)

a tight-knit musical family, cranky-benevolent father and four vivacious adolescent daughters, is up-rooted by, first, the appearance of felix, a dashing young composer, and, secondly and most profoundly, mickey, his insolently attractive orchestrator friend.it takes a while for michael curtiz to get this piece of americana floating. the first part looks almost like a paraphrasing of a cereal commercial, not without a certain quaint, highly bourgeois charm, and then john garfield enters the scene as the doomed mickey, making his first appearance in motion pictures, with mussed-up black curls, sleepy, hung-over eyes, rude and disheveled, the absolute opposite to jeffrey lynn's smoothly persuasive, madly charming felix. garfield is in complete, and direly needed, counterpoint to the rest of the household ("nothing i would do would surprise me", he muses), and suddenly the movie becomes interesting, although i agree with critics that find the plot-turns insufficiently motivated.the four sisters are rather blandly played and seriously underwritten, but claude rains as the pater familias has his moments.watch it for garfield, though, he is the only really lasting thing about it.

this movie was made 20 years before my time. its introduction of john garfield in the supporting role of mickey borden makes it a classic. he slumps onto the screen and your eyes are glued. garfield was an original and his portrayal of fate's whipping boy is a must see.

one of warner brothers best and highest grossing films during the thirties was this charming family drama about a widower who lives with his maiden sister raising four daughters. but not four every day type daughters. all of them have been trained by their musician father on instruments and one as a singer. they do make some beautiful music together even if it is for the long haired set.you can watch the infinite variety of roles that claude rains played over the years and still marvel as he shows you yet another aspect of his creative personality. the opportunistic vichy captain in casablanca is as different as the scientist gone mad in the invisible man, as the patient and wise job in mr. skeffington. all the same man and all so incredibly different.here he raises the four girls with love seasoned with a little grouchiness at their willingness to accept modern music. the lane sisters and gale page may know beethoven, but they're hep cats as well and can beat daddy eight to the bar every time. and if rains gets a bit too testy than aunt may robson can put him in his place.with four daughters unmarried at the time you know that's going to change. all the sisters develop romantic interests in dick foran, frank mchugh, jeffrey lynn, and john garfield. of course the mating process does get a bit complicated and one of the sisters suffers a tragedy, but it does promise to work out as the film ends.four daughters is also known as the debut film of john garfield. other than a tiny bit part in footlight parade years earlier, garfield had no other film roles. but he'd been acclaimed on the new york stage for his performance in golden boy and warner brothers signed him and found the perfect film debut role as the cynical musician who just can't quite get a decent break in life. it earned him a best supporting actor nomination in 1938, but he lost to walter brennan for kentucky.this film was so popular that it practically spawned a small cottage industry for jack warner. sequels with cast members like daughters courageous, four mothers, four wives all cleaned up at the box office before world war ii. and warner brothers remade it with frank sinatra and doris day playing the parts that john garfield and priscilla lane originated. now those two made some beautiful music.still a timeless mold was created in four daughters and the film holds up 70 years after it was first seen.

although a "woman's story," i found this still fairly interesting. it is unusual in that is has three real-life sisters playing sisters in the movie! i am referring to priscilla, rosemary and lola lane.why national critics loved this movie was the presence of bad-boy-rebel john garfield. in their twisted liberal-dominated minds, all-american characters are sickening but sour-on- life, poor-attitude types like garfield played here are people they can identify with. despite that, this movie still has an overall feeling of goodness, which is why i liked it. some of the characters may have done stupid things, but they good hearts. whose heart was bigger than "ann's" (priscilla lane) in here? i agree with the imdb user comments critic in here who says this is priscilla's film as much as the beloved (not by me) garfield's. with a director the caliber of michael curtiz, the film is better than it might have been under someone else. curtiz made sure no scene, soapy or otherwise, went on too long.in addition to the lane sisters and garfield, we have claude rains (who adds much-needed humor to the story), jeffrey lynn (the main love interest of the girls), gale page, dick foran, frank mchugh and mae robson.apparently, this movie must have been a hit because there were several spin-offs from it, neither of them approaching this one in content and box-office success.

lovingly crafted and terribly interesting to watch garfield's gritty, breakthrough performance (introducing a new kind of rebellious acting style that would carry over to the brandos and clifts and so on after the war) but all that sisterly affection is a bit suffocating. priscilla lane is a bright, engaging performer but the other sisters don't really register (though they're all allowed to be tart and witty) and i just had a hard time buying any of the other male characters besides garfield. jeffrey lynn is a pleasant enough actor, but he lacks the movie star weight to match up with garfield's hard luck mickey borden and that throws the film a bit out of whack. (imagine a jimmy stewart or someone in the part.) also, i was not convinced that garfield would make the pivotal (to say the least) final decision that he made. the film needed another half hour of running time to better explain that action; it feels awfully rushed and under-motivated.still, it's not hard to understand how anybody who grew up with this picture would remember it fondly. it falls short of being a classic, but it does contain a few classic moments. the two gate swinging scenes are pure movie magic.

"four daughters" begins as just another clone of "little women" type melodrama. a single father with four musically talented eligible daughters has his hands full trying to keep them in line and guide them in their courting rituals. what turns the film around is the sudden appearance of a new hollywood star, some critics say the first anti-hero long before james dean graced the big screen. from the time the dark, foreboding figure of mickey borden (john garfield) appears at ann lemp's (priscilla lane) gate splashing his self-pity and doomed philosophy on the rest of the cast, "four daughters" becomes much more than just a chick flick.though garfield is the main reason to watch "four daughters," there are other flashes of brilliance to enjoy. hungarian-born director michael curtiz, later responsible for such gems as "casablanca" and "mildred pierce," pinpoints certain images with his camera (aided by cinematographer ernest haller of "rebel without a cause" fame) that sticks in the viewers mind, for example the screeching gate that ann's first suitor, felix deitz (jeffrey lynn), swings on so merrily becomes symbolic of the shifts in moods and affections by those who use it.that garfield delivers the standout performance is obvious, but the rest of the cast keeps up with him most of the way. the underrated jeffrey lynn plays his role to perfection, as the neglected suitor whose love for his cherished ann never falters even when she's with another man. claude rains, somewhat miscast as the father of the four coming-of-age young women, gives a fine portrayal of a set upon doting family head who gets lost in the shuffle. the three lane sisters, already famous for their musical abilities, turn into accomplished actresses, playing their parts well. a raft of supporting actors, including dick foran, frank mchugh, may robson, and eddie acuff, makes it all believable.how opposites attract is part of the ploy for touching the quick of the viewer's imagination. ann is the eternal optimist, even when she and mickey are down and out. she always looks on the bright side and like so many caught in the pliers of the great depression in those days, she saw prosperity just around the corner. mickey recites an entire list of bad things that have happened to him seeking company in his misery from ann, which ann refuses to do. mickey expects to go out with a bolt of lightning striking him dead as he rounds the corner of life. mickey has meager talent as a composer; ann has talent to spare as a singer and musician. ann is big on beauty; mickey is big on personality in a warped sense of a way. and the differences go on and on. how all this is reconciled in the end is an important part of the movie, not to be missed.see "four daughters" for john garfield's doozy of an acting debut on the big screen. the only time he was better came seven years later when he again mesmerized the film goers with one of the greatest screen performances ever, as frank chambers in "the postman always rings twice," opposite the equally charismatic lana turner. but also watch "four daughters" to catch important elements that may be missed if too much concentration is placed on the star of the show.

i am appalled and dismayed that the network has canceled talk show with spike feresten !!what is wrong with the fox television network, canceling talk show with spike feresten and replacing it with wanda sikes? for those at the network with a short attention span, wanda at large was canceled because the audience grew tired of her nasty insults that would make the audience cringe, and wanda sykes spewing out her very own brand of vindictive mud slinging jokes is not humor, it is nasty and repulsive.apparently the fox television network has rewarded wanda sikes because she has garnered a self important appearance front of president barak obama. there is no doubt that wanda's recent ill tempered in front of the president of the united states are not funny and the audience laughter was only to patronize and please barak obama.talk show with spike feresten has a genuine sense of humor and has never deliberately or vindictively insulted any guest or performer. spike's well rounded personality always gleefully, poked fun of life and himself.and his filed pieces during the first two seasons with aftra actress mary mae atwill, as the mae west of the 21st century were absolutely hysterical with spike feresten's skits:judge joe brown, trading spouses and last season's james kyson lee episode where spike chats with erica via the internet on the show. despite the network's budget constraints for elaborate field pieces and the second season's wga strike, spike feresten did not waiver his sense of humor or show integrity. talk show with spike feresten always had up in coming new talent and his comedy for stoners spoofs of nanny 911 and idiot paparazzi were considered cutting edge and had excellent production value. on a professional level, spike feresten, was the best executive producers, and set producer, brett webster along with his fabulous production crew were one of the best production teams that i have worked for in my aftra career .it would really be very foolish and sad shame to cancel talk show with spike feresten. unfortunately, its success could conceivably be taken to comedy central or another network and financially speaking, that would become a valuable revenue loss for fox television..on behalf of the late night saturday fox television audience, supporters of talk show with spike feresten, including all cast and crew, we beseech the network to retain the talk show with spike feresten franchise and give the crew a second opportunity to become a successful fox show.

spike feresten is a comic genius. 'talkshow' demonstrates a fresh take on the kind of odd ball irreverence that have made shows like letterman and the daily show successful. his likability is palpable. he seems to find the unique angle of the joke, not the predictable sitcom path...thank god. his comedy is reminiscent of the award winning arrested development (cross your fingers that 'talkshow' has a longer life span). the topics he highlights tend to be those things that pass by unnoticed by everyone else, yet when he creates a joke around them out you wonder how you missed it the first time around. i particularly enjoyed the sketches..."unfair target" will be a cult classic in no time. set your tivo's people...this is a show not to be missed.

this show was a pleasant surprise after watching mad tv on a saturday night. spike is an excellent host that you can tell is still getting used to it but he is doing great adjusting to his new job. i can imagine it being a difficult transition from writer(seinfeld) to host however, unlike a lot of new talk show hosts he does not let airtime ride while trying to figure out what to do next. he is quick-minded and each segment and section rolls into one another smoothly. it also doesn't hurt that he's kinda sexy in a nerdy type of way so he's not hard on the eyes like leno or letterman. i can't remember the exact episode date that was my favorite but i especially loved the idiot paparazzi skit with a fake j-lo and katie holmes. great new show!!

i say remember where and when you saw this show because i believe if fox gives talk show a chance spike will be right up there with conan in a few years because like conan he is incredibly funny and seems to be just grateful at having his own show which adds to the humor.the funniest bits spike has had so far are the idiot paparatzi and comedy for stoners and if your not high and get cfs what does that say about you. in summary this show is funnier in 25 minutes than snl in an hour so lets hope talk show gets the attention it deserves such as an extra half hour, more money and a band.

after watching the series premiere of talk show with spike feresten i took a moment to really think wow there are actually good shows on after 12 besides snl and i was also sad to see that it was only 30 minutes long. his great writing skills helped this show overcome a series lack of money and helping hands. electronic lincoln was hilarious and i really think this will be a good dark horse talk show.i was very happy with the way he handled it and gave andy richtor some good lines to work with. as you would have suspected it was a little shaky but for that kind of time slot it was very good.overall if you are not someone on weed or even if you are and you don't have something more important to do than watch this great piece and have a fun time doing it.

i saw the movie at the nashville film festival on may 1, 2003! it was amazing! all the things that i had read about stuey were portrayed incredibly well by tony vidmer (writer, director, producer, editor), michael imperioli (incredible job as stuey), and all the others involved in this. i'm glad he (vidmer) didn't go down the "leaving las vegas" routine with stuey's bad habits, but instead put us inside his life, family, and his gift. tying the whole story from the motel room where he died was a great vehicle and showed his screenwriting skill. a big "thumbs up" on this one!

the basis for this dynamic docudrama is the true story of one of the most extraordinary card players ever.stuey is a tight, cohesive biopic of a true poker ace whose life is a one-way trip down the highway to hell with few detours.this dramatic feature stands wide apart from other films about poker. it represents a rare and earnest attempt to bring to the silver screen a true story of ultimate gambling compulsion. the complete obsession that annihilates any proximity of spirituality and nullifies any chance of redemption. this is the least likely movie a vegas casino executive would recommend. and it is the sole poker dvd you are likely to find on the shelves of gamblers annonymous.there are scenes in this movie that poker buffs are sure to refer to as some of the best gambling scenes ever. stu reading his opponent's hand and, particularly, a texas hold'em bluffing scene.prophetically, early on in the movie we see a young stu bullied out of his pocket change by a bunch of neighborhood hoodlums. poker is for loners seeking revenge. it is a game of patience which bullies lack. 'you can't bully me!' may very well be an underlying sentiment of the punishing force that a champion poker player unleashes upon his adversaries.conservatives will look upon this film as a cautionary tale of a soul lost in sin. they may evoke mark twain: 'the best throw at dice is to throw them away.' the young and liberal masses will inevitably have a more simplistic and sympathetic outlook. they may not have heard of twain's quote, but will sure remember a remark made by stu's stunned pal who learns from up-and-coming stuey that he'd won a car from a local character in an overnight game. 'you tell'em to go to hell and they look forward to the trip'.the mosaic of las vegas vignettes that we see in stuey will long linger in memory. frank sinatra, the most generous tipper? forget about it! nobody tips as extravagantly as a hot-shot gambler. and for vegas visitors who may not know the impact of tipping on the quality of their stay, check out the scene of stu checking in a vegas hotel!'this is what i was meant to do, this is where i was to be. movie stars in hollywood, politicians in washington and gamblers in vegas.'

by many accounts, stu ungar was not a very nice guy. he spat on dealers, stiffed people he owed money to, and was verbally abusive. many filmmakers might choose to sugarcoat the man, making him into some sports hero that would triumph despite adversity. but high roller doesn't do that. and that's a tough row to hoe.instead, we have to look very closely to see a man that never matured passed the frightened little boy from the streets of new york, despite all his successes. and the only real approval he ever gets is from death himself. very brave (because people won't get it) and very touching (when you do).what is also brave is the use of a scorsese feel. "aha! how derivative," people will say. really? but there's virtually no violence. and stuey loved gangster movies. maybe the feel reflects the man stu and not the director marty? and if it really is a low budget film and looks that good, bravo!finally, the linear flashback structure. wow, will that get hammered. yet, not only does it work, it works exceptionally well, even for those who don't see the connection to the "seventh seal." (proof: in ss, knight plays game of chess with death: in hr, stuey says "we can play a hand of cards for, ya know"... death says "never much good at cards.." damn great last line.)no tricky effects or camera moves. no shaky camera. nothing trendy at all. just solid, tight storytelling.maybe that makes the movie too basic and somehow flawed. but then again, so was the guy. and that makes it just about right.9/10

this movie has a "big production" feel that i was not expecting from an independent film. the characters are each developed and dealt with in a way that not only helps to tell the story, but left me with a satisfied viewing experience.

i thought this was a really great movie especially since it was jut filler for me. i was bored, i got it from the library and i really enjoyed myself! i've watched it twice in the two days and the more i watch it the more i like it.i thought that the plot was going to be really corny but in the end it really could be said that it would be true. i liked the main characters and i thought that they were well cast and you could see true friendship. i thought they all did an excellent job. the ending was good.and you really hate the bad guys and you really like the good guys. which is what a movie is supposed to be like.

hoot is a nice plain movie with a simple message. it seemed like that this film was for young children, but i know that adults will like this film. the storyline is pretty simple. a kid who moved to florida must help a soccer jock and an outcast save burrowing owls from construction of a pancake house. the message in this film is big especially for animal activists and lovers. the message is about doing all you can to save endangered animals. the acting in this film is decent. all the three kids looked like they had good chemistry. the music is not too shabby. i liked jimmy buffet's songs in this film. overall this is a good family film. i rate this film a 9/10.

saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids. a bit predictable. the book was better, gave more plot details, ore about the environment and how the kids uncovered the conspiracy. i think hiassen's warped humor comes across better in the book than the movie, but there were lots of funny moments in the movie as well. it is probably a bit too slow paced for kids under 6 yrs of age. loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher. and those baby owls were adorable. i wonder how they managed to film them. the movie showed a lot of florida at it's best, made it look very appealing. am i imagining it, or did the author carl hiassen make a brief appearance?

hoot was terrific. the owls are adorable and the movie highlights an interesting environmental issue i didn't know existed. florida is full of so many fun characters and the film does a great job of bringing that to the screen. my kids particularly loved all the different animals, from snakes, to owls to alligators. it's really a simple story, but also one that they need to hear at this age. when kids are young that's when they really develop their sense of values, and yes one of those must be caring for our environment and all the creatures that live in it. i think it was great that the film even sparked a conversation with them on the ride home about animals and how to help them. it was just truly sweet and enduring to hear my little girl talk about how she wanted to save the baby birds. anyway, overall it was really a great time and i'd recommend the movie to anyone looking for something entertaining and meaningful.

i must confess, i was surprised at how good this movie was when i first watched it. i had planned to see it in theaters during the summer but found out unpleasantly that it had already been and gone. therefore, i expected it to have been removed from theaters because it was bad. then, today, i rented it and watched it and really enjoyed it. the speed that events were occurring was questionable, it could have been a little longer. i found it was very true to the book, however it left out some crucial parts: mullet finger's real name, etc. i felt as if i hadn't read the book i wouldn't have really understand what was going on. the acting was quite good, another thing i had expected to be poor, however the cop, sorry i can't remember the actor's name, could have done a little better. all in all, i found this to be a very entertaining movie and would recommend it to all audiences!

in "hoot", mullet fingers is engaging in sabotage to stop the pancake house. the problem is that the builders just start over again, and he has to take more drastic measures. when he is confronted with the dogs, he scares them off with snakes, not before he is bitten by a dog and has to go to hospital.roy at bedtime asks his father, who works with the department of justice, how he deals with crooks. his father says it involves the tedious steps of looking through papers, because sooner or later, they all slip up. you can see this with enron and worldcom. roy looks at documents relating to the pancake house, and finds a suppressed document (he does have to break in to the company trailer), so when the police see it, he has the law on his side. unlike when he evaded the police.mind you, as mentioned before, roy is not always law-abiding, and when the company man is killing owls (illegally), mullet fingers takes direct action. he can't wait for the law (mullet fingers is in hiding). the movie does suggest that one should work in the system.

this is a delightful gem of a movie, unfortunately pigeon-holed as "just for kids." the plot revolves around a young man, roy eberhardt, newly arrived in southwest florida from the montana mountains. trying to fit in with the other kids at his middle school, roy discovers a brother-sister team trying to protect endangered burrowing owls at an illegal construction site. look for carl hiassen, the author of the book upon which this movie is based, as the male secretary to the evil boss at corporate headquarters. writer/director wil shriner is also the clerk at the public records office where the intrepid teen-detectives discover that the incriminating environmental impact report is missing. luke wilson nearly steals all the crucial scenes from the charming teen actors who have most of the best lines. wilson is the bumbling police officer, in his three-wheeled electric police cart complete with blue light and funky siren. as officer dave, he tries so hard to do well, but usually ends up falling in the muck, literally! several times! jimmy buffet is pretty low key as the tacitly supportive science teacher. but, young actors logan lerman (roy), brie larson (beatrice the bear), and cody linley (mullet fingers) are superb as the teens who finally put officer dave on the right track, following the paper trail left by the evil corporate boss. i hope you come away from this movie feeling as good as i did. just plain fun! one small complaint, though. i hope all non-floridians realize that not everyone from florida is as surly to newcomers as depicted in this film. we're really a friendly bunch! just ask carl hiassen and jimmy buffet!!

i highly recommend this movie to everyone. my son and i read the book first and then saw the movie. while the book was better (in my opinion) the movie was still great. my son and i agree that while we like the book version the best, we liked the ending of the movie better than the book ending. the scenery is just tremendous and the soundtrack is a must have. the fact that jimmy buffett has a small role and provides music is an added plus. luke wilson does a decent job in his role of officer delinko and is pretty much what i had mentally imagined delinko would look like when i read the book. i'm surprised that this didn't do better in the theaters, and i'll be waiting for the dvd to come out.

this is a movie that really makes you think about your life, our culture, family structures and situational actions. i will not give the plot in this post, i think others have beat me to it already. i hope that despite reading opinions on this site, you will take the chance and see this movie for yourself. i went to see this movie with my husband and a friend and i must say, after the movie was over there was total silence in the theater. after a few minutes i looked behind me and everyone in the theater was staring at the screen, lost in thought. this will make you delve deep into your psychological abyss to ponder several things:how much does society influence my life and the lives of my generation?how long does someone have to pay for mistakes that they have made?if there is a second chance given, is it ever realized?is it better to live in a box or to not live at all? my questions are not intended to show my approval or disapproval of leland's actions. i do not want my opinion of them to in any way dictate what you will take away from this film so i am not giving it. see it for yourself. i am still lost in thought, attempting to answer my many questions from the film. i enjoyed it greatly and hope that you will too. this film is not trying to answer questions, condone any action or promote any punishment. this movie is trying to make us all evaluate our lives and take off the rose colored glasses that most of us view the world through.great movie. 9 out of 10 stars

every role, down to the smallest, has been cast and acted with bravado.the extraordinary jena malone never takes a misstep. her two co-stars are equal to her in this film. ryan gosling may be the best actor of his generation. chris klein gives his best performance to date. this is a thought and conversation provoking film that should be seen by teens and young adults. you'll think and talk about this film for days. highly recommended.

there are subtleties in this film that i think a lot of people may miss if they're not careful. you really need to follow what leland says and read his character to figure out the intended "why" the movie presents at the end. nothing it solid, it's not definite, it's about what the individual viewer takes out of it. i think that was the plan from the get-go, people aren't meant to all understand it in the same way, it's almost about forming your own personal relationship with leland in order to maybe feel him a little better.the storyline is interesting but its summary could never explain what the movie really is. it's dramatic and thought provoking, a lot of heavy ideas, but the pace of the movie is almost soothing, even with its more intense scenes with yelling. i think it's probably leland, he's just calm and almost serene, even for all of his sadness. the movie personifies leland in a way.of course it is captivating and draws you in if you let it, but there are some recycled ideas. i mean, leland has a lot of impressive dialogue, he is anything but typical, but he's not a prophet. everything he says is not a revelation, many people i know have mentioned things he mentioned, even i have observed a few things he's observed. leland is the unique and attractive character he is probably mostly for ryan gosling's portrayal.in the end the acting is all exceptional, there are no real bad guys, there is no way to psychologically evaluate leland, only to maybe understand him and life a little better.comparable to igby goes down i think, not comedic, but similar in its general outlook on life.

before i saw this film, i read the comment of someone who wasn't very fond of it. this i must admit made me apprehensive to dedicate 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life to it, but i'm glad i did. ryan gosling is a fantastic actor, i especially loved the believer. don cheadle was also fantastic. the film presented an interesting view on life and death. it was very touching and very sad, yet it kept me interested, which most touching stories cannot do. it is a film that reckless of whether or not you like it, you should see it. it was unique,and i don;t think that anyone will ever be able to duplicate it. all of the young actors did surprisingly well given the subject matter and the emotion that must have gone into it. i was pleasantly surprised.

i am no ebert. what i am is a compassionate and i have never felt more compassion for a fictional character than i felt for leland p. fitzgerald. sorry if i do not offer a critique, but i see nothing but perfection in this film. i am sure that many who watch this film will never see the same things i do, but if you look hard enough maybe you will see something you weren't expecting. i've read that the character of leland was flawed. it seems to me that who wrote this was not able to see past the question this movie presents. i feel sorry for anyone who doesn't see the answers this movie delivers. open your heart more than your mind and you may be able to let this leland p. fitzgerald show you a world that truly has a meaning. excepcional story with extraordinary acting. ryan gosling deserves to be talked about.

when we are young, we all pick out an ideal occupation for ourselves: artist, actor, writer, rocket scientist, etc.. while most of us grow out of our pipe dreams, the main character of american movie, mark, has yet to let go of his(and at a thirty-something age too): to become a wealthy acclaimed director. despite the fact that murphy's law won't leave mark alone and something always seems to go wrong, mark is able to persevere during each deterring incident with an even greater drive to reach his goals. his desire to be a director so controls his character that he sees any person or thing in his life as something to exploit to reach the goal. while i noticed other imdb commenters are lambasting mark's selfishness, i think it's an almost justified sort-of selfishness because for mark, not becoming a famous director is equivalent to death. he talks incessantly about leaving some kind of mark on the world, and he sees filmmaking as a way to do this.unfortunately any viewer of this movie picks up early on the fact that mark has a near-zero chance of ever achieving his dream. is he aware of this? no, not in the slightest, and none of his family or friends want to let him in on the secret(in fact even some of them believe in him). strangely enough though, the disappointing future the viewer feels is sure to occur for mark doesn't impede the ability to find humor in the film. this is a very very funny documentary. most of the laughs come from when mark is filming scenes for "coven". there's a scene where an actor has to have his head break a cupboard, and it's just not working. another scene has mark's very old uncle bill saying a few lines to the camera; needless to say, after 20 takes of a lot of headscratching and line-stumbling bill finally decides he's had enough. a lot of humor sadly comes from mark himself. his screenwriting, which he seems to think is worthy of a pulitzer, is laughingly bad: "it's alright, it's ok, there is something to live for; jesus told me so.""american movie" is, contrary to what people might think, a documentary that anyone can enjoy(even though my sister, who watched some scenes, seemed to think it was downright bizarre). the fact that chris smith can successfully bring to the screen a film that inspires both sadness from mark's depressing lifestyle to hilarity with scenes with bill(who unfortunately passed away before the film was released) says quite a lot about him. i wonder how the dreamer mark regards this documentary. does he realize that it casts him in a bad light? or that it sets up to show him as a fool in many scenes of the film? or does he see it as something that will be shown prior to his own a&e biography segment? it's an intriguing subject of wonder, and i hope the latter comes true for him some day.i highly recommend this movie: 9/10.

for me, the best & most memorable movies are often those which on first viewing i know nothing about. american movie is a perfect example of just such a gem. watching tv late one evening, i spotted the one & only good review among the dross - thankfully i settled in for a real treat. american movie is a documentary following the unforgettable mark borchardt (pronounced "orchard", i believe), a highly articulate & charismatic wisconson lad, as he struggles to write, direct and produce "midwestern", a gritty, low-budget horror movie on which he has been working for years. in mark we discover a young man filled with contrast. his appearance is of the classic trailer-trash stereotype - skinny, bum-fluff mustache, '80s heavy metal styling, mullet hairdo, etc. to camera however, mark reveals startling wit & insight as he philosophizes upon life, love, movies & the american way. as the movie unfolds, it sadly becomes clear that mark's lack of discipline & heavy drinking are relentlessly sabotaging his creative efforts. american movie is a charming watch, filled with hilarious moments & vivid characters. chief among these is mark's lovable buddy mike schank, a soft-spoken reformed stoner who, having conquered an addiction to scratch cards, is now dependent on soda pop. i absolutely loved american movie. it generates real empathy between the viewer & principal characters, and provides hilarity without feeling exploitative. i would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.

looking for proof that real life is more entertaining than fiction? you just found it. this superb documentary about an aspiring feature filmmaker (mark bortchart) who refuses to admit defeat is the funniest film i have ever seen -- probably because it's also one of the most tragic. oddly enough, the more i watch the film the more inspired i become.

this documentary is the most hypnotizing film i have seen in a long while. i must have had it on for an entire day. the selected material included in the piece flow amazingly well and develop three characters that are impossible to ever forget. the different layers of these people peel back to make an oddly moving film about perseverance, loyalty and determination. these characters ended up suprisingly fascinating and the film is unforgettable.

okay, so i'm a sucker for a good documentary, particularly where it tells a modern-day don quixote story. a caveat: i met mark borchardt in the winter of 1995/96 while he was still working on coven. but i'll save that story for later. american movie, which commenced production not long after, accurately portrays the person that i knew, although in greater depth than i expected or believed existed. this is simultaneously a very funny and very sad film, and is brilliantly executed. mark comes across as his own worse enemy: his childlike ambition and optimism -- which i admire -- is undermined by his apparent artistic ineptitude as well as his bizarre fiscal expectations. but he's also a charismatic guy. his loyal sancho panza sidekick is equally likeable: loyal, if frazzled, to the core. like don quixote, american movie presents an often-ignored inefficient aspect of freedom -- that people will be drawn toward professions to which they are not particularly well-suited, irrespective of repeated failure. it is a great film.

this depiction of forlorn japanese forces in the philipines is a tour de force in the utter meaninglessness of war. it is an effective representation of japanese pacifist views after ww ii. in the movie, japanese soldiers have been left to fend for themselves in the jungles of the philipines. faced with impending starvation they resort to cannibalism and gradually lose what little humanity they have left. to call this film depressing would be something of an understatement. the viewer is left with an utterly despairing sense of life's lost value in modern combat. the final scene is almost too nihilistic but the film is a worthy statement none-the-less. highly recommended.

they are hunted and starving. they are completely demoralized and yet they press on through sheer inertia. this film tries to answer the question "how far will human beings go to survive?" hopelessness emanates from every of this film and like so many japanese films of this time, it condemns the blind military loyalty that pressed the japanese people into war.

one of starevich's earliest films made in france is possibly his only political satire. the story of the frogs who wanted a king mirrors its title as a group of high "croakers" feel that democracy has gone flat so they demand a king from jupiter to rule their land. when he sends down a stump, the frogs ask for another king, saying the stump is but "political timber." jupiter sends down a hungry stork this time whose frog lusty eyes devour the town's residents. as the original "croaker" is about to slide down the stork's beak, he speaks his moral: "let well enough alone." this film features a few beautiful crowd scenes of dozens of puppet frogs. starewicz tricks the audience into believing they are all moving at once by keeping the background in constant motion and animating only about six frogs or so at one time. the slightly corny dialogue and problems with lighting in a few places diminish the quality of repeat viewings, however its historical significance in starewicz's life make it of importance to watch. his feelings towards government immediately following his flee from russia are likely expressed in this film. in addition, the technical accomplishments of animating so many characters at once in a stop-motion film is astounding.

wladyslaw starewicz was a russian-born animator living in france who did incredible things using stop-motion. i've seen a couple of these films before and they feature his favorite subjects--insects, frogs and various animals. they are extremely realistic and lifelike and even today are amazing to watch--the quality is simply fantastic.this one stars lots and lots of frogs. they appeal to their god, jupiter, to give them a king. why do they need a king, wonders jupiter--their lives are perfectly fine now. so, to teach them a nasty lesson, he makes an egret the king and one by one it starts eating its subjects! then, the frogs once again appeal to jupiter, who states the obvious moral that it's best to be happy with what you have! while the animation quality is incredible, this is a very creepy film for kids. i would think this would terrify them both by how real the animals look as well as the story itself which is not for the faint of heart!

the frogs who wanted a king or frogland is ladislaw starewicz's most cautionary tale about people wanting government to solve their problems that i've ever seen. the ironic thing is that they pray to the god jupiter for their answers. jupiter responds first by sending a tree stump and then a stork. neither works out and the stork is especially dangerous to the amphibian creatures! the frogs have some human qualities when we see them dress in the latest fashions of the day and we see some take pictures or use a movie camera when the stork arrives! like i said, this short is very much a political allegory more suitable for adults than children. in fact, i first saw this on the rhino vhs that had bambi meets godzilla. that alone should tell you what to expect here!

many animation buffs consider wladyslaw starewicz the great forgotten genius of one special branch of the art, puppet animation, which he invented almost single-handedly . . . and, as it happened, almost accidentally. as a young man starewicz was more interested in entomology than the cinema, but his unsuccessful attempt to film two stag beetles fighting led to an unexpected breakthrough in film-making when he realized he could simulate movement by manipulating beetle carcasses and photographing them one frame at a time. this discovery led to the production of starewicz' amazingly elaborate classic short the cameraman's revenge, which he made in russia in 1912, at a time when motion picture animation of all sorts was in its infancy.the political tumult of the russian revolution caused starewicz to move to paris, where one of his first productions-- coincidentally? --was a dark political satire variously known as "frogland" or "the frogs who wanted a king." a strain of black comedy can be found in almost all of starewicz' films but here it is very dark indeed, aimed more at grown-ups who can appreciate the satirical aspects than children, who would most likely find the climax upsetting. (i'm middle-aged and found it pretty upsetting, myself.) and indeed, prints of the film intended for english-speaking viewers of the 1920s were given title cards filled with puns and quips in order to help soften the sharp sting of the finale.our tale is set in a swamp, the frogland commonwealth, where the citizens are unhappy with their government and have called a special session to see what they can do to improve matters. they decide to beseech jupiter for a king. the crowds are impressively animated in this opening sequence-- it couldn't have been easy to make so many frog puppets look alive simultaneously --while jupiter, for his part, is depicted as a droll white-bearded guy in the clouds who looks like he'd rather be taking a nap. when jupiter sends them a tree-like god who regards them impassively the frogs decide that this is no improvement and demand a different king. irritated, jupiter sends them a stork.delighted with this formidable-looking new king who towers above them, the frogs welcome him with a delegation of formally dressed dignitaries. the mayor steps forward to hand him the key to the commonwealth as newsreel cameras record the event. to everyone's horror, the stork promptly eats the mayor and then goes on a merry rampage, swallowing citizens at random. a title card dryly reads: "news of the king's appetite spreadeth throughout the kingdom." when the now-terrified frogs once more beseech jupiter for help, he loses his temper and showers their community with lightning bolts. the moral of our story, delivered by a hapless frog just before he is eaten, is "let well enough alone."considering the time period when this startling little film was made, and considering the fact that it was made by a russian Ã©migrÃ© at the height of that beleaguered country's civil war, it would be easy to see this as a parable about those events. starewicz may or may not have had russia's turmoil in mind when he made "frogland," but whatever prompted his choice of material the film stands as a cautionary tale of universal application. "frogland" could be the soviet union, italy, germany or japan in the 1930s, or any country of any era that lets its guard down and is overwhelmed by tyranny. it's a fascinating film, even a charming one in its macabre way, but its message is no joke.

the ascent is a very worthwhile addition to recent re-releases from the soviet union. director larisa shepitko's 1977 film examines the moral ramifications of allegiance and honor in german occupied russia during the second world war. on foot and in a blizzard, two members of a partisan soviet group leave to locate supplies, and are captured by nazi soldiers. the focus of the movie is on how each man handles or internalizes his moral alternatives. one chooses dignity and integrity, while the other opts for collaboration with the enemy. however, in the end, he cannot abide by his selfish decision. the film makes much use of slow, wide-angle pans which shift to extreme closeups, and highlight the spiritual quandary within the souls of each man. this is not a great film, but it does effectively portray an intense moral dilemma against the backdrop of a harsh and frigid soviet wilderness.

i missed the beginning of the film. i came in when the partisan's were in the farm house. i can truthfully say that it was horrifying. the moral ramifications are staggering. my fear of pain and torture leave me unable to see myself other than cowardly. i see the christ like ability that was depicted by the brave patriot, and i can only pray that i could or would have the moral turpitude to follow his example.i see that a main theme of the film is to show the weakness/strength of the tortured, but what a dismal decision to have to be confronted with. all because the soul of man can be distorted in such a way that, pain and suffering being brought to bear on a fellow human being is in some way satisfying. be it mental or physical. i found the film very thought provoking.

during world war ii, two byelorussian (soviet russian) soldiers try to avoid being captured by occupying nazis, as they trudge through snowy terrain, searching for food and safety. if you happen not to like black-and-white "foreign" films, you may still enjoy "voskhozhdeniye" (retiled in english "the ascent"). director larisa shepitko paces the film extraordinarily well, despite its being a largely introspective piece of work. her untimely death, in a car accident, made this ms. shepitko's final film, unfortunately.after the opening mission is declared, there doesn't seem to be much that could happen in the snowy woods, but shepitko and a changing setting make it unexpectedly exciting. leading players vladimir gostyukhin (as the spiritually wounded "rybak") and boris plotnikov (as the physically wounded 'sotnikov") successfully avoid being crushed by the ever increasing symbolism. their allegorical performances, under shepitko's sharp direction, provide a memorable and thought-provoking take on a familiar story.******** voskhozhdeniye (4/2/77) larisa shepitko ~ vladimir gostyukhin, boris plotnikov, lyudmila polyakova, anatoli solonitsyn

reading the comments i am struck by the obvious effect this wonderful film has on viewers. but, how can you watch this movie and not reflect that the artful dialog was a subtle and oh so daring rebuke to the authorities "in control" in what was then the ussr at that moment in history? it wasn't the souls only in the time and place of the action being revealed. the questions, superficially asked, are nakedly provocative when directed to the here and now. who are the real "collaborators"? i marvel that the writer stayed out of prison. i read somewhere that great stress can be a catalyst for producing great art. this film is a masterpiece of misdirection, apparently pointing one way, while asking the audience to "look over my shoulder, at what i'm really talking about." what courage.

it comes as no surprise that larisa shepitko was married to elem klimov, who would later direct the most harrowing war film ever made, 'come and see (1985).' 'the ascent (1977)' Â– shepikto's final completed film before a premature death Â– is built in very much the same mould. set during wwii, the film follows a pair of soviet partisans who try to secure food for their starving army while evading the occupying german forces. the first forty minutes are agonisingly tense, as the two men drag themselves though the harsh, snow-covered landscape, the world around them completely sapped of life, warmth and colour (indeed, so monotonously drab is the scenery that it literally took me this long to realise that the film was shot in black-and-white).following the partisans' capture by german soldiers, the film becomes a cold meditation on loyalty and morality. whereas sotnikov (boris plotnikov) refuses to betray his army, even under extreme duress, the less resolute ryback (vladimir gostyukhin) attempts to save himself. is he wrong to do so? ryback's betrayal is disheartening, but the film doesn't immediately condemn his actions are treacherous; instead, the viewer is forced to consider what their own response might be in such a situation. shepitko pities ryback as the bible pities judas. both men betrayed their allies to the enemy, and were forced to watch them executed. however, whereas judas committed suicide by hanging (at least according to gospel of matthew), ryback finds even that option closed to him Â– in an excruciatingly taut climax, the belt around his neck becomes unfastened.'the ascent' draws its emotional power from shepitko's astonishing pursuit of realism. i have no doubt that the two principal actors spent days on end clambering across the snow-covered earth on their hands and knees, and, indeed, so convincing is their misery that i actually developed a cold while watching the film (seriously, i did). interestingly, the film interjects on this reality on several occasions, as ryback imagines himself making a bid for freedom, and then being gunned down by his german captors. this device, though unusual, works well with its biblical allegory; ryback is facing a trial of his worthiness, and, faced with a new dilemma at every turn, he consistently chooses the selfish alternative, his own life the only deciding criteria. at film's end, he is still alive, but the nightmare of war and guilt persists.

if you have a chance, see this russian(how should i call them: gems, masterpieces,hidden treasures?), war movies like this one, or the dawns here are quiet, or proverka na dorogah... and , right after that, watch again the american war movies, or the international productions, those one with the allies and the germans,etc. or, even worse, watch the italian war movies. everything from the west will seem shallow, contrived, ridiculous, in comparison with the russian movies. i am sooooo stunned by the quality of the aforementioned russian war movies that i cannot find the words to praise enough their shattering superiority over anglo-saxon war movies.

fantastic russian wwii movie. like most russian wwii movies, the ascent is incredibly harrowing. it's also dense in its symbolism. the story follows two partisans, sotnikov and rybak (boris plotnikov and vladimir gostyukhin), who go on a mission to search for food. on their trip, they are spotted by german soldiers, who wound sotnikov. sotnikov, in turn, kills one of the germans, which leads to trouble for the two partisans and everyone else they later run into. the greatest success of the film is its vivid sense of place. russia is frozen and snowy, and it's hard not to feel that cold go straight to your own bones. shepitko keeps her shot close to the characters, examining every crag of their faces. it was probably not the choice, but the film is framed 1.33:1, which gives the film a sense of claustrophobia. while the entire film is quite an achievement, i did feel that the first half was stronger than the second. my main complaint about the movie is that it develops into a very unsubtle christian allegory by its climax. i just don't think the symbolism adds much to the proceedings, especially when i was already intrigued by the debate between the two partisans. it's not quite fair. i was weighing the pros and cons of their argument. i began to lean toward the point of view of a certain character, and then the director pops up and tells me that he's judas! despite some heavy-handedness, this is still a must-see.

i agree with another reviewer, this is such a shattering film, that will be tough to watch again soon, though for quality alone, it deserves repeated viewing. the complexity of the characters, the incredible cinematography and superb direction make this movie worth the emotional price of watching.there is one scene, of the two partisans dragging themselves through the snow to escape a patrol, that's perhaps, for sheer physicality, the most amazing performance i've ever seen. in fact, though not episodic -- the story flows -- this is a movie of memorable scenes. there's the passing of rations amongst the partisans, the snow scenes, the ruined farm scene, the encounters in the houses, the interrogation, the "basement" scene, the "ascent". all stand out like jewels in a necklace.for me, the religiosity isn't overt. frankly, i don't think it would have been permitted in a soviet film. i do see this as an existential parable about the value of life. here is a tale where the hero -- and he is a true hero -- becomes the villain, and the weaker one becomes the stronger one. is this a mystical process or one dictated by circumstances? there is a transfiguration, but does it come from within or without? you must see the movie to understand the issues, for they can't be discussed without giving away too much of the story. i can't say enough about the acting. it's hard for me to choose which of the leads is more affecting. i'm not familiar with soviet film of the 70s and am not familiar with any of the actors, but they are all superb. i also note how director larisa shepitko uses children. they remind me of giotto's child angels.there is a little muddling in the end. there is apparently a prior relationship between the soldier sotnikov and the interrogator portnov, but this is left dangling. and the final scene is a bit ambiguous. but compared to the total experience these are quibbles. this is a movie that will mark you for life.

the ascent (1977) larisa shepitko is a name very few are familiar with. her bright career as a director only lasted a single decade, ended abruptly by a tragic car accident. despite her short career, she however managed to create some of the best soviet films of her time. her last film, the ascent, is widely regarded as one of the finest soviet films of the 1970s. nevertheless, her work remained in obscurity throughout the years that followed, usually only available on rare and poor copies on video. that has now changed thanks to the folks at criterion. they've released two of shepitko's best works through their eclipse department - wings, and her penultimate masterpiece the ascent.set during the darkest days of wwii in snowy rural russia, two partisans trudge their way across the land in search of food after their party is attacked by nazi patrols. they're originally only to go to a nearby farm, but when they arrive they find it razed by the germans. not wanting to return empty handed, they continue on deeper into enemy territory. along the way they must confront not only enemy soldiers, but the harsh conditions of the russian plains, potential betrayal and their own souls.the movie does not fall into simplistic plot devices or destinations. it addresses difficult questions with painful rationality. it never takes the easy road or gives us comforting answers. the second half of the film is filled with moral dilemmas. shepitko shows us the intimate horrors of war through the internal conflict between fellow russians - those who collaborated and those who fought back. while she does show the collaborators as the clear heels, she nevertheless also shows why many turned to such tactics - survival.the film contains a number of religious references, particularly to the lead up to the crucifixion. this is a spiritual journey, into the hearts, souls, and minds of the two partisans and those they encounter. shepitko and her cinematographer capture the journey in beautiful black and white photography. the camera moves in long shots, similar to the camera-work of another of russia's greatest filmmakers, andrei tarkovsky. shepitko, like many others, was clearly influenced by tarkovsky's style, and the ascent takes some of its rhythmic notes from ivan's childhood. it is a stunning film to look at, and does a fantastic job of capturing the cold and terrifying atmosphere of occupied russia.shepitko's husband would pay homage to her great film a decade later. elem klimov made his own war masterpiece with one of the greatest films i've ever seen - come and see. the story and themes of that film were clearly influenced by the ascent. though that film is also a fairly obscure one, it received far more attention that any of shepitko's films. that however acted as a bridge to shepitko, and has been one of the best helps to keeping her work alive.the ascent is a truly magnificent film, and rightly should be considered one of the best films of the 70s. it's stunning cinematography is inspiring; its mood is frighteningly authentic; and its lessons are unforgettable. it is, in any definition of the word, nothing less than a masterpiece. how unfortunate that shepitko's career was cut short just as it was hitting its peak.

this greatest movie gives us clue to the depth of our souls in most deadly moments of our lives. my heart is shrinking every time i saw the scene of hanging. i have no words any... you must see this brilliant picture.

i saw this film many years ago (along with another of shepitko's films, wings) as part of a soviet film series at a local film archive. but none of shepitko's films, as far as i can tell, have ever made it to video or dvd in the united states. ascent is a great film by any standard, with stunning black and white photography, hypnotic direction, and actors so deep into their roles that you have no sense of them merely giving a performance. although the period details of russian resistance to (and collaboration with) german occupation are very telling, the story is timeless. two russian partisans are captured by the germans, and the interrogation tests their integrity as well as their courage. i suspect the reason why it has not been released on dvd by the russians (here comes the spoiler) is that the jewish intellectual (and not the tough russian peasant) is the partisan who resists both threats and temptation, goes serenely to his death, and sets an heroic example for the villagers.

even if voskhozhdeniye was your favorite film it would only be possible to watch it, at most, every ten years. its just too emotionally strenuous.widely regarded as shepitko's finest film, the ascent is the story of partisans operating in the byelorussian forest in the dead of winter in german occupied soviet union.while assaulting the audience with the sheer physicality of the wartime experience, particularly the privations of cold and snow, the actual struggle for survival against both nature and the fascists, there is always a subtle, barely inferred sub-text of moral judgment and the question about whether a man can be moral or immoral in one context but otherwise in another.a partisan group hiding in the woods is attacked by a german patrol and loses their food supplies. two men, rybak, who knows the area, and sotnikov, a jewish schoolteacher, are assigned the task of going to a small village for food. they find the village burnt to the ground with nothing edible and nothing more than charred timbers and foundations in which in one cubby hole there's a children's mirror hidden. the overwhelming feeling is that whoever brings the brutality of war to a land and a people become truly cursed. i thought of the war that the americans and british brought to iraq and about how bringing the horrors of war to people is the act of a degenerate nation.the two move on to a nearby larger village where they obtain, under duress, a lamb from the collaborator headman. the german's arrive and the two partisans escape under fire. sotnikov is hit in his foot and holds off the german's as rybak gets away with the lamb. sotnikov becomes so desperate that prepared not to be taken alive he removes his boot in order to put a bullet into his head. just then rybak returns and drags sotnikov out of the line of fire.rybak drags sotnikov through the forest, bloody meter by meter all done in one long take. each meter is an agony and yet he still pulls him through deep snow, up ridges, across depressions, over black bush stumps which crack as they snap under the weight of the men. there are several similarities to the cinematic vocabulary of tarkowsky here - the long takes documenting a process, the effect of using repetition, and the resulting emotional stress which builds the longer the shot goes on. in the background, unnoticed because of the action, there hangs a question- did rybak commit an immoral act by going back for sotnikov? whether under the moral standards of marxist-leninism or merely the common imperative of the survival of the group, wasn't his duty to get the food back to his starving band and leave sotnikov to cover his escape? to sacrifice one man in order for the group to survive? which leads to the question - can a man who is immoral under one philosophical system be expected to be moral under a different moral system? the partisans come as if another curse of war to a farm house containing a woman with three small children. she is embittered by the scourge of war and barely hanging on with her three children. they are barely rested when more germans show up. they make their way to leave and are directed to the loft to hide.sotnikov's cough gives them away. when a german pops his head in to have a look and no one responds he threatens to fire across the loft and rybak's nerves break and they are captured. now who has the moral responsibility here? sotnikov for coughing or rybek for cracking? the two partisans and the mother are trussed up and taken to a nearby town passing ominously under a wrought iron arch at the entrance. they find the headman and a small girl already in custody. they are interrogated by a turncoat byelorussian played by tarkowsky favorite anatoli solonitsyn. sotnikov keeps his head during interrogation and torture and only asks what the interrogator's prewar profession was? he doesn't answer but from his ease standing behind a desk the likely answer was 'schoolteacher'.rybak on the other hand begs for his life and even offers to join the police. the previously unnoticed character defect, making a 'wrong' moral decision, the ambiguity (sentimentality) of which disguised it from judgment, now becomes obvious, unsettling and very ugly.the five sit in a dark cell. they are all scheduled to die the next day. from here the elements of a christian parable become stronger. genuine rembrandt lighting and compositions are used as other old master poses of christ are represented. he decides he can save everyone if he takes on the guilt for everyone. he must be kept alive until morning so he can save everyone. he asks the mother for forgiveness and the headman knowing what is taking place doesn't feel such despair at dying uselessly as he did before.morning comes. the germans don't care if sotnikov takes on all of the sins of his companions or not. they will all be hung. they trudge up a steeply inclined street which is a virtual via dolorosa. a bench is taken up to the site of execution which is the gateway to the town. five ropes hang from it. the bench only stands three, so sotnikov stands on a tree stump which rybak kicks out from under him. they all are hung.as rybak descend the road with the germans, someone in the crowd calls him a judas, an unnecessary allusion, shepitko's only misstep. rybak imagines several times being shot in the back trying to escape, dying an honorable death and tries, unsuccessfully, to hang himself in the shithouse, but leaves with the germans as the beaten dog he is. however if rybak was morally right to go back and save sotnikov's life, is he wrong to try to save his own life?

having just seen this, i find it hard to believe that it is not better known. this and the slightly-better-known, but almost-as-shamefully-neglected come and see (klimov, 1986) must be two of the greatest war films. they are meaningful, powerful, incisive. the ascent is also gifted with a sparingly-used, but brilliantly trenchant score by schnittke.

shepitko is the wife of russian filmmaker elem klimov, who directed the more commercially known 1984 film come and see, generally regarded as one of the most realistic war films ever, bar none, notable for its searing poetic intensity, but i believe it lacks the inner complexity of this even greater russian film, which examines not just the graphic outer horrors, but she finds truly inspiring images focusing on individuals or small groups of characters that reflect the absolute insanity taking place inside these human beings, the ending of which is simply awe-inspiring. bullets are flying and bodies are dying in a gun skirmish over the opening credits, where the intensity of the film never lets up throughout the duration, focusing on grim faces, worn out soldiers with next to nothing to eat, a terrified population under occupation, starving children with petrified mothers, all cast in an immense landscape of endless white snow. like cranes are flying (1957), this features a russian army in retreat, a traumatizing shock early in the war when they were nearly wiped out. the russian countryside has been overrun by german nazi's who are terrorizing the citizens, stealing what food they have, forcing them under duress to become their informant eyes and ears. what russian soldiers are left hide under cover of forests, but are forced to send food expeditions to neighboring farms. this film follows two soldiers that from the outset are on a near impossible mission, as there's little food left anywhere in the dead of winter. one is healthy and fit, vladimir gostyukhin as rybak, while the other, boris plotnikov as sotnikov, is slowed down by a tubercular sounding cough and eventually a bullet in his leg that nearly leaves him for dead, but his partner heroically rescues him. as they step through knee deep snow drifts, crawling at some points with insufficient protection against the harsh elements, like so many other russian films, nature itself becomes their toughest foe.spoilers!! everything is reduced to a matter of survival. when they reach their destination, the farm has been demolished and left in a state of rubble, pushing forward into german occupied territory where the next farm is manned by an elderly soviet collaborator who fears nazi retribution. the partisan soldiers think him a coward but move on, where they are eventually captured and brought to a nazi camp in a nearby town and held as prisoners, along with a proud and protective mother (lyudmila polyakova) who helped hide them. tarkovsky stalwart anatoli solonitsyn appears as portnov the interrogator, a russian teacher from a nearby academy turned nazi sympathizer. russians torturing and executing fellow russians is the depth of war depravity and solonitsyn is brilliant in the despicable role he's perfectly suited for. from what we can see, as nazi officers chat jovially in close proximity to one another, he is an outsider even among this group, seen instead as a kind of gruesome black-cloaked undertaker who routinely sends men to their graves. the audience is not spared from witnessing acts of torture on sotnikov, who offers nothing but contempt, while rybak speaks freely, hoping to save his life, but both are condemned to die, though rybak is offered a chance to serve the german reich as a police agent. the mother, the elderly collaborator, and a child are added to this group, spending one last night together alive where together they discuss the merits of a soldier's mission, of being a patriot, a mother, a coward, or a collaborator. each seems individually driven by a desperate need to survive, but sotnikov offers himself as a selfless example, attempting to confess his guilt to spare the others, where the aptly chosen title reflects his spiritual redemption.by the next morning, portnov seems mildly amused, mocking them at their sudden willingness to talk, but spares no one except rybak, who changes sides to keep his life, rationalizing in his thoughts that if he's alive, at least he has a chance to escape. but there is no escapeÂ—not from this torment. what happens is shown with exquisite delicacy and poetic grace, as we witness the treachery of war without a single shot being fired, as the execution by hanging is turned into a public spectacle, where the villagers at the point of a gun are forced to witness. the pace and harrowing intensity of this film is relentless, as there is never a moment without impending menace, gorgeously shot by vladimir chukhnov (who died in the same car accident as shepitko), featuring perfectly composed landscapes and plenty of camera movement, much of it at close range using portraitures, especially that of a fierce young boy at the end who eyes the condemned men, who makes a surreal connection to the next generation without any words being spoken, accentuated by the psychologically horrific music of alfred shnittke which resembles the transcendent yet furiously disturbing monolith music from kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey (1968). the sound design of this film is highly advanced and uniquely modern, where the use of off screen sound continually exposes the raw nerves of each moment, dogs barking, wind blowing, bullets firing, nearby nazi's chattering in untranslated german or laughing sadistically at their helplessness, which only ratchets up the hideous tension to insane heights. in many ways resembling dreyer's the passion of joan of arc (1928), utter insanity is exposed here, the relentless realization that you have no choice, yet you are forced to make one anyway. the nightmarish inner thoughts at the end are expressed wordlessly, where the nobility of the dead speaks volumes, where voices continue to reverberate inside the heads of the living like an explosion of neverending echoes, yet only silence fills the crisp wintry air with a mournful reverence and a profound sense of loss.

larisa shepitko's the ascent (1976) is an extraordinary, gruelling account of the partisans' fight against the nazis in german-occupied belorussia, the ascent reflects the russian obsession with the horrors of the great patriotic war, but unusually is both steeped in religious symbolism and ready to acknowledge the existence of the less than great russian collaborator. the true battle is not with the nazis, who hover in the background as mere extras, but between the russian nazi investigator and sotnikov, the captured partisan who finds the spiritual strength to go to his death unbeaten. with its many references to the crucifixion, the story takes on heroic proportions glorifying the sufferings of the martyr and his influence on future generations. a remarkable piece of work.

this is one of the very, very few films that are so overwhelming that you are very unlikely to watch it more than once or twice in your lifetime (other examples are claude lanzmann's documentary shoah and come and see by the director's husband elem klimov - which covers much the same unbearable territory but in a very different way).i suppose this is just as well given the difficulty of ever seeing a print.apparently it's extraordinarily overt christian symbolism and admission that there were active russian collaborators, ensured that it was hardly ever seen in the ussr - and of course post-soviet russia has very little interest in films of that era.the one time i saw it in london was in a festival of russian movies shown during the glasnost era (i.e. probably c.1988) - however it apparently has been shown several times in the uk more recently so at least one subtitled print must exist here.as far as i know it has never been released in the west on dvd or video so if you haven't seen it, your best chance is probably to join a film society and endlessly nag them to find a print and screen it.

a stunningly harrowing account of two soldiers plight in wwii. set against a freezing backdrop of, not only the fight against the nazis and traitors in belorussia, but the harsh natural elements, this film tells a tale of two soldiers of polarized morals, one who survives, but finds it somewhat impossible to deal with his own circumstances, and one who dies, having done all that can be done in the face of intimidation and everything possible to break one's spirit, in fact, the "ascendant" of the title. a film that should be seen by all, particularly for the phenomenal performances of the main characters, and shuddering set pieces (the incarceration and hanging scenes, in particular. an absolute must see.

in the belarus of 1942, two soviet soldiers are captured by nazi-friendly belarusians. in captivity, the attitude of the two men toward their fate differs greatly. one of the soldiers manages to find an inner strength and spirituality, incomprehensible to the other man. larisa shepitko's last film is one of the most beautiful war films in cinema history. the cinematography, by vladimir chuchnov, is incredible - particularly in the opening sequence, where long, slow, tracking shots depicting the solitude and almost desperate nature of winter landscape in rural belarus set the mood perfectly. it is easy to draw comparison to tarkovsky's films, even more so since tarkovsky's alter ego anatoli solonitsyn has a small but important part in the ascent. the acting is overall brilliant, especially by boris plotnikov, in the part of sotnikov. the film reveals an old-fashioned belief in the strength of religious passion, which feels related to characters such as dostoyevsky's prince myshkin, or tarkovsky's stalker. however, this is not a weakness of the film, but rather one of its greatest strengths. the religious content seems so honest, and human, that it is impossible not to be moved. the emotional richness of the film cannot be overstated; the answer is not as simplified as a short summary of the plot would make you think. the slow development of the characters, and the emphasis on their complicated relationships to each other, are somewhat reminiscent of the commissar, another great soviet film. the ascent deserves a second watching, as well as a third, and a tenth. it continues to provide interesting ideas, beautiful images, and emotional complexity.

this is one of my favourite films; a delightful comedy; so i was thrilled to learn it is about to be released on dvd in the uk, september 2007.romuald, played by daniel auteuil is a rich company president of a dairy firm. juliette, played by the excellent firmine richard, is a cleaner of the company's paris offices.juliette, a black mother of several children, discovers a plot against romuald who initially ignores her attempts to warn him. slowly he grasps what this charming lady from the parisian underclass has been trying to tell him. 'he seeks shelter in her crowded apartment as his marriage and career fall apart. an unlikely love blossoms. cultures clash in what is a truly delightful light-hearted comedy.

this movie is a gem! it is the story of juliette, a perfectly ordinary cleaning woman who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company, and romuald, the president of same. he takes no notice of her, he takes no notice of anyone until several plots to wrest his company away from him all hit at the same time. he is lost, no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers juliette. as the cleaning woman, no one pays any attention to her, so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to catch on to and use to help her helpless and hapless boss.i have been keeping an eye out for years for the dvd of this and to see a previous comment about it being released in sep 2007 raised my hopes. alas, i cannot find a dvd, does anyone know if there is/was one?

i would not compare it to le placard, which imho had more comic moments, but romuald & juliette while being a slow starter certainly kept your attention going throughout the film, nicely paced and reaching a heart warming conclusion :) there were many marvellous comedic moments, some brilliant pathos and realistic situation acting by all actors.it was a typically french film, in which while confronting prejudices and phobias, which in turn the made the viewer confront his own shortcomings! i am certainly pleased to have this in my library, and will no doubt watch it time and time again, which to me is a mark of a great film.

i first saw this film when i was about 6 ish - my grandma thought it'd be a nice kiddies film to entertain me and keep me occupied....however, every time i watched it i had nightmares the same night. yes it masquerades as a kids' film, but even now i find it really dark in places, particularly the haunting music that is played each time the guardian angel woman is on the screen, and her rather hypnotic eyes and voice. the actual "baddies" of the film, ie the sharks, mr grimes etc didn't scare me at all, i just always found the whole film rather creepy and dark. this is obviously something i can appreciate now that i'm 21 years old, but speaking from experience there is no way i would show it to my kids!

like many, i first saw the water babies as a child/young teen in the late seventies/early eighties. it has remained with me since then with its catchy tunes, memorable portrayals, less-then-successful animation, and a story full of heart, coldness, and ultimately good vanquishing evil. recently i sat down and saw it again after at least two decades passing, and i noticed this time around its striking similarities to the wizard of oz. no, these aren't blatant likenesses but hear me out. in this one we have a boy and his dog - having personal problems at "home," running away from something and in the scene right after they run away, changing the substance of their appearance. in this one, the boy and dog become animated. in the wizard of oz, dorothy and toto are in color. in this one, the boy and dog are told they must find the water babies for answers and then ultimately the kracken for guidance and he has the ability to let tom go home if he shows he has courage, etc... in the wizard of oz, dorothy must also find an authoritative figure that tests her before he will allow her to return home. in the water babies, tom meets three characters that will help him on his journey to the water babies - dorothy has three helpers as well. when each helper is met, we are entertained with a rendering of "hi, hi, hi, hi, hi cockallorum...we're on our way." in the wizard it is "we're off to see the wizard." dorothy has a good witch sort of look after her; tom has a woman with many roles(billie whitelaw) do the same. if you look closely at the two, there are many other likenesses. that being said, the water babies is not a knockoff in any way, i was just commenting on the eerie likes between the two. this film has some solid performances from bad guys bernard cribbins and the always fascinating james mason. the kids playing tom and ella are good. the supporting cast of joan greenwood(love her voice!), david tomlinson, and the vocal talents of john pertwee and lance percival add greatly to the mix. i must confess that the animation is less than sterling even for its time but is adequate enough to the challenge. the three animated characters that help tom get home are all likable. i always have trouble picking my favorite between the french swordfish and the john inman/mr. humphries like seahorse. the scene where we hear this guttural, maniacal laugh from a shipwrecked vessel only to see a seahorse with a huge polka-dotted bow-tie bob out always has me rolling! the water babies is a lot of fun. sure, it is more of a children's film, but it has and always shall have a fond place in my heart. the bulk of the credit for what successes the film does have must go to director lionel jeffries. jeffries is a wonderful comedic actor and his sense of humor is clearly evident throughout.

the 1978 adaptation had all the ingredients of a potentially wonderful film. it is based on an absolutely charming book by charles kingsley. it has a truly talented cast from the likes of james mason, bernard cribbons and david tomblinson, not to mention the vocal talents of david jason and jon pertwee. there is also lionel jeffries, the director of wonderful classics such as the railway children and the amazing mr blunden, and while the film is good on the most part, it was also a little disappointing. i had no problem with the performances, particularly those of mason and tomblinson as grimes and sir john harriet respectively, and tommy pender and samantha gates are believable as tom and ellie. the voice cast is also commendable, especially jon pertwee, voicing charming characters in their own right. i also liked the incidental music it is so haunting and beautiful, and the script was fairly faithful and in general well-written, particularly at the beginning. the characters, especially the water babies are very charming, and the villains are sinister and funny at the same time, i loved the part when tom and his friends help the water babies escape, seeing the shark chasing the electric eel with an axe was very funny. however, i will say the film does look dated, especially the animation sequences, the live action parts weren't so bad, if you forgive the rather dark camera-work. the character animation was rather flat, and the backgrounds sometimes were a little dull, though there were some nice moments, like the scene with the krakon and of course the first meeting with the water babies. i also had mixed feelings about the songs, the water babies's song was beautiful, but i found the first song forgettable, when tom ends up underwater. hi-cockallorum is an example of a song, that is like marmite, you either love it or hate it. i personally don't know what to make of this song, it was fun to listen to at first, but once it's in your head, it is perhaps annoying. as much as i like lionel jeffries and his films, his direction just lacked the wonder and the magic it usually does. all in all, certainly not a terrible film, but could have been better artistically. 7/10 bethany cox.

in 1850 in yorkshire, a boy chimney-sweep is falsely accused of theft by his crooked master and runs away. he falls into a treacherous local river and is transported into an underwater realm, where he makes many friends and rescues the mythical water babies from an evil shark.based on a book by charles kingsley, this is a lovely children's film, half live-action and half animation, which is both a grim and evocative depiction of victorian times and a terrifically enjoyable undersea adventure. it really is two films in one, which somehow complement each other and combine into a much richer whole. the animation by tony cuthbert, jack stokes and miroslaw kijowicz is wonderful, as is the photography by ted scaife and the music by phil coulter and bill martin. pender has a great rough-diamond quality as the (literal) fish out of water - i love the moment when he's on top of the mansion, sees all the chimneys and shouts "blimey !!" at the top of his voice. mason and cribbins are the filthiest, nastiest bullies you could hope to see in a costume drama (if you want to see real victorian values, don't watch sense and sensibility, watch this), and whitelaw, pertwee (who does umpteen voices) and percival are all excellent. this is how a good children's movie should be - good old singalong fun, but also just a little bit thoughtful, sad and frightening. high cockallorum !!

this is a movie that i watched when i was a young girl and never forgot. it is certainly not the best movie ever made, but there is something very special about it that i can't quite put my finger on. i love it. i am the kind of person who likes everything explained to me though and for that reason alone this movie drives me crazy. exactly what/who is that mysterious witch-lady and what is her relationship with tom? why and how did he become a water baby ... why was he raised on the earth? it is questions like these that are just eating at me! i thought if i read the book i would get answers, but i just read an article that the book from which this story is "based" is a lot different. so i guess i'll never know what the writer was thinking! i still love this movie though and i recently watched it with my two year old niece. she loves it too although she insists on calling it "baby water" for reasons unknown to me. she loves the part where he jumps in the water and then declares "i'm all clean." (you have to understand that my niece is the cleanest 2 year old in the world!) we watched that scene over and over. i am so glad that we can enjoy this film together! there should be more films like this. (but what is up with the gay seahorse??!!)

for years i've had a distant memory of watching this film , i looked on the net to find it somewhere and couldn't find it anywhere so i thought it must have disappeared.until...my gran showed me a box set she sent off for in the daily mail and i though nah there wont be anything decent in there, but to my great surprise there amongst other gems was the water babies! i hadn't been that excited ina long long time! its a great light hearted film, the songs aren't memorable probably if i was a child during the time it came out i would have stuck in my mind more. sadly it was just a film i watched at my grans 10 years ago when i was a little spud. and watching it back now the animation is terrible! and the re-recored voices they do to get a richness to the sound in films is totally off! but who cares when your a kid you never think of those things, even if they lead boy is about 10 and sounds like a boy in the middle of puberty.great classic kids film!

an orphan boy named tom (tommy pender), who works for a pair of shady chimney sweeps, is falsely accused of stealing from the mansion where he is working at by mr. grimes (james mason) - the real thief - and goes on the run. tom's only alibi is the niece of the mansion's owners (samantha gates, a slender, blue-eyed blonde, with long, wavy hair, who i'm sure was the primary reason why i repeatedly watched this as a boy). he and his dog jump into a river and a witch turns them into water breathing cartoon characters! while underwater, he befriends and rescues a group of water breathing children known as water babies from a shark.a very interesting and always fascinating fable, set in 1850, that should appeal to all children. the animation (42 minutes of the 85 minute hbo vhs print) is just average, but it's preferable to most modern day animation - even computer animation! my only real gripe is a plot hole caused by a deleted scene. at 42:06, after the first verse of "high cockalorum", the film cuts to a scene with octopi swimming, followed by tom and jacque's encounter with terence. this leads to a scene in which the killer shark (voiced by mason) leads our heroes into a trap. the shark then greets tom with, "young tom, so nice to see your ugly mug again" - but this is the first time in hbo's print that tom meets the shark! most reference books list the running time as 92 or 93 minutes, and it was previously available from sultan entertainment and nelson, so it's very likely that hbo's print is edited and / or time-compressed. adding insult to injury, mgm released a fullscreen, 76 minute print on dvd in 2002! let's hope a restored version appears in the near future.the film is copyright ariadne films 1978. "ariadne" is the water baby voiced by samantha gates. bernard cribbins, who plays mason's partner in crime, also voices the electric eel. a.k.a. slip slide adventures.

i absolutely loved this movie as a child. i can't seem to find it anywhere! i was mentioning it to some friends just the other day, and not a single one of them remembers it! can anyone help me out? my older sister vaguely remembers it. there was also another movie i remember that was half live action and half animation, but i can't remember the name of it. the characters were animated and the background was real...i seem to remember it being about a kangaroo, and i believe the setting of the film was in australia. i'm going out of my mind trying to obtain copies of these films that were such a memorable part of my very enjoyable childhood. edit: i searched imdb for this other movie and found out it's called dot and the kangaroo! all i had to do was type in "kangaroo" in the search bar under characters, and the name of the movie in the list was like a bell going off! man, i love imdb! thanks!

i saw this movie as a child and fell in love with it. it has a sweet sensitive story. something children can appreciate. i loved so much as a child i had to find it for my daughter. it is definitely a movie i would watch with kids. it reminds me a great deal of story's of a disney nature like pete's dragon and mary poppins. both because of the live action and cartoon features but on its premise. it is also a good story to show kids that if they tell the truth they can be trusted and adults will listen to them. i think all kids should see it and would enjoy it. it is such a break from the violent movies of bad taste so many kids watch these days. it has all the charming qualities so many of today's movies don't have.

wonderful songs, sprightly animation and authentic live action make this a classic adaptation of a classic tale. a nice british feel which sets it apart and above from the standard, saccharine sweet disney cartoons.

i was wandering through my local library, browsing vhs tapes, when i saw a movie that made my mouth drop--waterbabies. i have been hoping to see this movie again--it's been over 22 years since i saw it (cable-movie channel around 78-79). i had recalled a good many of the details--grimes in particular. my son, who is 4, and i watched it.he agreed with me that grimes was "not nice", and the best way for me to describe it was that he didn't love tom. he accepted that. it was amazing that i still recalled some of the songs, too! they had stuck in my head for 22 years--which means they had to have some memorable-ness, eh?it's a good child's movie, with parental guidance in case of questions about what children had to go through that were not nobility/society in the time-frame. this is what all the children faced daily (except for a few lucky ones), and while we try to disney-coat movies, making them more pc for children these days, it doesn't mean that cruelty didn't exist--or even still doesn't. i enjoyed the animation. it wasn't disney, no. i don't think don bluth touched a paintbrush on this movie.there's a lot going for it, though. david t plays two roles! (i really like him!) james m does too. the waterbabies themselves are cute. you feel sorry for tom, and root for him. then billie herself is extraordinary in the multi-role part she's playing--it's as if her eyes are magickal! i'm a huge fan of woo, tlw&tw, and company (and looking forward to hp!), and i filed this along with those kind of movies. yes, he jumps in the water, but not because of suicide. he jumped because he trusted the lady in black--she'd been appearing to him all along.i think it's a good movie! if you have kids, pick up a rental copy. if you happen to locate a buy-able copy, let me know where! ian liked it! :)dee

i read the above comment and cannot believe it! of course its a children's movie, its an adaptation of a children's book!! this film is easy to get a hold of, try play.com or amazon and its very easy to gain a copy! the jokes are hilarious for kids and adults alike, and the adventure is clean with no violence! its completely suitable for children of all ages! the songs are fab, and yes, a little repetitive but thats what children need and whilst watching it my little ones were heard singing "hi hi cocalorum" all night! they loved it, a story of innocence and friendship! very lovely and well worth watching for kids and adults of all ages!

when i first saw the ad for this, i was like 'oh here we go. he's done high school musical, but he can't coast along on that so now he's making appearances on other disney shows'. personally, i love the suite life and i'm a big fan of ashely tisdale. but for some reason, i'm not too keen on zac efron, although all my friends think he's the best thing since jesse mccartney. but he really annoys me. anyway, i watched the show (taking a break from english coursework) and was pleasantly surprised. the performances were good all round, especially from the regular characters on the suite life, and zac efron wasn't as bad as i had anticipated. all in all, a pretty good show.

i am so glad zac was in 'the suite life of zack and cody' because that is my favorite show and he is my favorite actor. it is a really funny episode and a funny show!! i love everything about the show and the characters. all of the performers are great. keep on acting zac, and i am so happy that nearly all of my favorite actors (including high school musical characters) are in this show. zac efron is so 'hot' and i have an autographed picture of him! it is not a photo copy, and it came all the way from america to australia and it nearly did not arrive in time for christmas. also, i got a high school musical mug with my name printed on it.

if it had been made 2 years later it would have been banned! the number one must see recommendation of the day!. the best rouben mamoulian film i have seen this far (have but have not yet seen j+h).there's no wonder why this film got less than 200 votes. a bigger greyzone that could not care less about what's proper would not be seen again until the 60's. as morally ambiguous and dark as 70's grit but with a certain charm as well. of course this had to lay low in the later 30's and sadly it does not appear to have been re-discovered.seriously. this got it all. great actors: gary cooper, sylvia sidney and the this time not so lovable guy kibbee. and a mighty good director. this far i haven't been rm's biggest fans but i have liked his films a lot and with this he steps into a new league. one of the best 30's films i have ever seen! this is something i never thought even existed! 9.5/10

city streets is amazingly modern technically speaking for a movie made in 1931. also who could not be mesmerized, enthralled by gary cooper's powerful magnetism, galvanizing the audience attention. the plot is quite elaborate and clear. the scenarios, decor, are exceptional in every detail. all the actors are above average. i keep guessing how the director and his staff, including editing, sound, lighting, photography, could have been so brilliant. i couldn't find a flaw, understanding that the scenes in the road(bumpy ride) with the large motion pictures screen on the background was the best they could get in 1931. all in all i found this movie superb and so much alive thanks to gary cooper charisma.

i thought i'd witnessed every wrinkle the crime/gangster flick had to offer, but the garrett-marcin-hammett combination pull off some genuine thrills and surprises here, thanks to the inventively forceful direction by mamoulian, the atmospheric photography by lee garmes, plus remarkably sharp film editing and flawless special effects. brilliant acting helps too. coop gives one of his most convincing performances as the reticent hayseed-turned-fearless bootlegger (the sort of character progression he was to repeat in other roles such as sergeant york). miss sidney (pictured center) in her first major role is also an eye-opener. the principals receive great support from paul lukas, wynne gibson and stanley fields as the heavies, and even from robert homans' hard-as-nails detective. the movie has obviously been realized on an extensive budget which is brilliantly deployed in its realistic, crowd-filled sets.

i saw this film last night at a "pre-code" film festival, and i have to tell you that when gary cooper turned his head for his introductory close-up, the entire audience gasped. he was just that beautiful.cooper's looks aside, this film displays rouben mamoulian's directorial artistry to perfection. wonderful scene-fades, creative camera angles, symbolic allusions--mamoulian just keeps exploring the directorial medium and coming up with innovation.this was sylvia sidney's first role in hollywood, after her success on the new york stage, and she is just as lovely as a gary cooper leading lady ought to be. it's nice to see her in a role with a harder edge than many she was given--so often she looks like she's afraid she's about to be hit by someone.there are lots of familiar faces in this film, including the wonderful wynne gibson. most striking is guy kibbee, best known for playing fatuous rich men, as a grinning and mendacious hit-man.there aren't nearly enough of these pre-code films available on vhs or dvd, so if you can't find a pre-code festival near you, try campaigning turner classic movies for a broadcast! as for the reviewer who believes gary cooper was too stupid to have dialogue more complex than "yep" or "nope," he should perhaps consider coop's performance in films such as "mr deeds goes to town" or "meet john doe." although heaven knows anyone who looked that good shouldn't have to be smart as well.

clearly patterned after the first gangster movies that warner produced the same year,little caesar (1931) and the public enemy (1931),this gangster movie is one of the better efforts i've seen. although not quite in the same league as the previous mentioned classics, it has a powerful performance by young sylvia sidney.she's magnificent and delivers her lines more natural than perhaps anyone did at the time.gary cooper is better than usual at this stage in his career and shows signs of what would follow the next few years when he rose to the top. the movie has some fascinating villains in paul lukas (never seen him this detestable) and guy kibbee (what a shock to see him act the hoodlum).the direction of rouben mamoulian is very inventive,probably the first voice-over to show a persons thoughts appear in this movie. if you get the chance to see this little gangster flick, don't let the chance go by.

a gritty look at new york city and dock workers. this is a classic film, realistic, brutal at times, always believable. it was originally shown live on tv,also starring sidney poitier. john cassavetes was a fantastic director and actor.

i first saw this film on cable in the 80's and it rocked me to the core. it showed up again on tv about six months ago.filmed on location, the black and white cinematography graphically portrays 1950's new york as the gritty "urban jungle" at a time when there was far more industry and port activity in the city, particularly in manhattan.john cassavetes always brought a special intensity to his acting, and is magnificent in the role of the army dodger. his brief 1959 tv series "johnny staccato" is also a joy to watch.sidney poitier and (later in the film) ruby dee bring freshness and vitality to their roles. but it is jack warden's superb acting as the vicious, brutal shift boss that grabbed my attention. to get an idea of warden's versatility, watch this film, then check out a 1962 episode of the tv series "naked city" entitled "specter of the rose street gang (available on video)." if you are a fan of film noir, this is a must see. enjoy!

axel nordman (cassavetes) shows up on the new york dockyards looking for a job, but with a hidden past. he gets one on condition that he pay a kick back to surly crew boss jack warden. while there, he strikes up a friendship with black man sydney poitier that unfortunately leads to a gut-wrenching moral dilemma for a man who, we learn, typically runs from his problems.the movie looks like oscar winner on the waterfront, feels like on the waterfront, and most importantly, plays much like that 1954 kazan production. however, its racial theme is ground-breaking for the time. the black poitier and the white cassavetes are treated as equals in every respect. it might even be called the first of the black-white "buddy" pictures that would later dominate so many action films.it helps that the two leads play so well off each other. nonetheless, the movie's central flaw is failing to indicate why crew-boss poitier pushes a friendship with the dour cassavetes in the first place. he really goes out of his way to befriend the newcomer. but why he would cross racial barriers to do so is never really suggested. one possible explanation is that poitier wants to use cassavetes as a pawn in his rivalry with other crew-boss warden, but then comes to genuinely like the guy. there's a hint of that in some of cassavetes's suspicious reactions, but beyond that, the relationship appears unmotivated.if there's a single stage shot in the entire movie, i couldn't spot it. everything is done on seedy new york location, without the usual movie extras. in that sense, it's an anti-hollywood production, carefully deglamorized even down to the night club scene which itself looks like a real after-hours crowd. i suppose sociologists would dub this rather raw slice-of-life "a glimpse of the working poor".yet, for all its virtues, which are many, the film remains too close to the brando-kazan movie for comfort. here, a fine unknown actress kathleen maguire gets the role of the redemptive girl friend, warden the role of the corrupt labor boss, while cassavetes, like brando, must suffer a bloody beating before regaining his moral standing and doing the right thing. still and all, despite the derivative nature, the gritty urban drama retains enough of the original force to merit a look-see.

highlighting the acting of sidney poitier and the brooding on-screen presence of john cassevetes, the edge of the city is a highly-watchable film from the fifties, directed by martin ritt. there is great acting and stunning on-location photography in black and white.poitier is a delight at this point in his career and tommy tyler, the character he plays is happy and outgoing. he befriends axel noordman, played by cassevetes, who is a young man suffering from poor self-esteem and a past that he wants kept under wraps. tyler, a black man, brings his friend out of his shell and introduces him to his family and a new girlfriend.tyler and noordman are employed on the new york docks at a time when the workers were expected to tow the line, if they knew what was good for them. the boss charles malik, played by jack warden, in one of his many hard-bitten roles becomes the focus of discontent, which leads to a climactic showdown with noordman.at the end of the movie, we are left with mixed emotions. however, the two main characters have left the audience with a story of friendship between two different men in a hostile world.

the reason why this movie isn't any better known and more appreciated to me seems because of its subject. because of its controversial subject this movie never got a proper big release and still remains a fairly unknown one to this very day. not that it's subject is that controversial now anymore though.basically in essence it's a movie about a white man befriending a black man. the friendship does not seem forced or unrealistic but the way it gets portrayed in this movie makes it all feel very real. we see these different ethnics mingle in with each other, as if it's just completely normal. unfortunately of course back in those days it really wasn't regarded as anything normal. seeing a black man talking to a white girl and just having fun with her as a friend must have been an hard thing to watch for instance for some proportions of its 1957 audience.you can really understand why sidney poitier has always been and still is being respected so much by the hollywood society and the black-community in general. of course it's one of the reasons why he also received an honorary award at the oscar's, in 2002. in his movies he often fights against discrimination and prejudiced issues, with of course "in the heat of the night" as the best example of this. a real role model, that certainly has inspired many afro-american actors, to this very day. but on top of that, he also was a great actor. yes, he is still alive but he has pretty much retired completely from movies now it seems, since his last credited role is from 2001.this movie was martin ritt's directorial debut and he also wasn't given too much movie to spend on his movie. the studios were probably also a bit reluctant mainly because of its concept and/or because it was ritt's first movie. or perhaps it was simply due to the fact that mgm just wasn't that big anymore and it had left its best days behind them. ever since the '50's on metro-goldwyn-mayer sort of had the reputation of making not too great and cheap movies, while in the early years before that it was really one of the biggest studios with lots of stars and acclaimed directors attached to it, who made many award winning classic movies. luckily for them their reputation is starting to change again and whenever the mgm-logo appears at a movie people are no longer expecting a lesser-movie anymore.anyway, even with its restrained budget and limited resources they managed to make a great movie out of this one. the movie is very simple, with only a few characters and a simplistic plot in it. the movie however still manages to capture you with its story and subjects, without ever starting to become preachy or anything about it. it makes the movie an effective one as well with its subjects.really a movie that deserves to be seen.8/10

this is a powerful film which seems to have never re-arisen after the joe mccarthy censorship period. it influenced me as a jewish teen-ager who had friends of various colors and whose father's family had suffered under the fascist regimes in europe during the second quarter of the twentieth century. unlike the later rip-off, "on the waterfront" which seemed to take some of the same themes and twist them to fit the enforced hollywood political correctness of the time, it told its story direct and with respect for the characters and for the reality it fictionally reflected. it was an antidote to "gone with the wind", "birth of a nation", "triumph of the will" and so many other glorifiers of hatred and violence. i would place it alongside the recent german film (also virtually hidden in the us), "rosenstrasse."i remember that the tv version, also black and white in format as well as story, was blacked out by some stations because the black hero's wife appeared white. as a young civil rights worker, it produced a conflict for me because on the one hand i was opposed to smoking cigarettes and on the other opposed the boycott in georgia of a sponsor of the tv show, a major tobacco company (i no longer remember which one -- does anyone else?).i would love to find a cd of either the film or the tv show to let my sons see something that informed my opposition to racism universally (as opposed to only fighting racism against jews) and recognition of the inherent connection between racism and militarism.

1957's edge of the city, directed by martin ritt, stars john cassavetes, sidney poitier, jack warden and ruby dee. it's the story of a troubled man, axel, who has a mysterious past that gradually comes out during the film. he has a connection that gets him a job on a loading dock working for charlie (jack warden), a real meanie who takes kickbacks from his workers and rides them hard. charlie has an intense dislike for a black man, t.t. (poitier) who holds the same position. t.t. invites axel to work on his team; axel defies charlie and does so. axel finds a place to live and socializes with t.t., his his wife (dee) and their son's white schoolteacher (kathleen mcguire). when tragedy strikes, none of the men on the loading dock will talk to the police, and axel has to come to grips with his values, what he stands for, and the meaning of friendship.this is a really excellent black and white film that curiously isn't really about being black or white! it's really about the limits one puts on oneself and knowing who you are. charlie is a bigot and hates that a black man has a good position on the dock. t.t. teases charlie and gives as good as he gets. there's no discussion of t.t. and axel spending time together or of t.t.'s son having a white teacher with whom the family also socializes. what axel, a loner, finds difficult is accepting any friendship or confiding in anyone - these things he learns through t.t.poitier absolutely shines in "edge of the city" - he's warm, energetic, loving and smart, a man with a real enthusiasm for life, afraid of nothing. cassavetes is excellent and plays a character totally opposite - hiding in the shadows, chronically depressed and always nervous.the film leaves open what happens to axel. whatever does, he's a different man now.strangely underrated and unknown film, possibly in the shadow of a lot of the angry young men films that came out in that era.

i cry at a lot of movies. call me sentimental. call me one of those viewers who always likes to see a happy ending. this movie, though it has a sad ending, was great! of all of the actors that i would love to have lunch with, it would be sidney poitier. his acting, along with john cassavetes and jack warden (of 12 angry men fame)is stellar. his character, who befriends a man on the run (cassavetes) and helps him out in every way possible is incredible.this is another one of those forgotten noirs made during the end of the noirish era. it is well done, has a superb cast, extremely talented acting, and great cinematography. it is a film worth watching over and over again. i highly recommend this one! this is just another truly great film done by mr. poitier and should be sold on dvd. even though i cried, kudos to such great art!

this is an excellent movie that tackles the issue of racism in a delicate and balanced way. great performances all round but absolutely outstanding acting by sidney poitier.he makes this movie breathe and alive. his portrayal of a guy who struggles against discrimination and violence is simply mind blowing. his acting is forceful and delicate and subtle at the same time. truly worthy of an oscar, poitier had to wait (because of his skin colour) for many more years before the sheer brilliance of his acting was recognised by the academy.cassavetes turns in a great performance too, withdrawn, troubled and realistic as it has become his hallmark. he and poitier contrast inimitably the forces of cowardice, courage and human transformation through friendship.the movie is enjoyable and at the same time deeply haunting in its portrayal of racism in the us. the irony is that it somehow mirrors the realities under which poitier had to work.

although this small film kind of got lost in the wake of on the waterfront, edge of the city can certainly hold its own with that star studded classic. it's another story about the docks and the code of silence that rules it.next to the corrupt union that lee j. cobb ran in on the waterfront, jack warden is really small time corruption. but he's real enough as the gang boss on one of the docks who intimidates the other workers by being handy with his fists and the bailing hook and he gets the rest to kickback part of their hard earned money. and it's all hard earned money in that job.one guy warden can't intimidate is sidney poitier another gang boss and when he tries to intimidate newcomer john cassavetes, poitier takes him under his wing. the two develop quite the friendship and poitier and his wife ruby dee even fix cassavetes up with kathleen maguire.warden is truly one loathsome creature and it's sad how by sheer force of personality and physical prowess he cows almost everyone else into submission. in that sense he's tougher than lee j. cobb who did have to rely on an impression collection of goons to enforce his will in on the waterfront.edge of the city marked the big screen directorial debut of martin ritt who did a great job with a good cast of new york based players and spot on location cinematography. the film's low budget does show, but you're so impressed with the ensemble cast you don't really care.cassavetes as the loner with a past and the hip and tough poitier are both fine, but my personal favorite in this film is ruby dee. she should have gotten some award for her performance, her final scene with cassavetes is outstanding.catch this one if ever possible. i wish it were out on dvd or vhs.

this is one of cassavetes' best performances. the entire cast is outstanding, as is martin ritt's sublimely understated direction. the anger, angst, and desparation of urban labor battles is magnificently told in a fashion that is neither obtrusive nor patronizing. in a way it is dated with its era, but in many ways, it is gloriously timeless.

this film marked the end of the "serious" universal monsters era (abbott and costello meet up with the monsters later in "abbott and costello meet frankentstein"). it was a somewhat desparate, yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the wolf man, frankenstein's monster, and dracula one "last" time.i say desparate, because in the previous film, "house of frankenstein," both dracula and the wolf man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be (dracula by the sunlight, and the wolf man by a silver bullet). yet somehow they return in house of dracula with no explanation. this movie could have played as a kind of prequel to house of frankenstein if the frankenstein monster plot wouldn't be continuing chronologically into house of dracula from house of frankenstein, and if the wolf man didn't get cured. then there'd be no plot holes. but since this is not the case, the plots of dracula and the wolf man make no sense.however, ignoring these plot holes, house of dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film that's fun to watch. it has many high points. especially seeing the wolf man get cured. i know i just said that this shouldn't have been included, but it was nice to actually see him get cured after all this time. and the scene with the lady playing "moonlight senada," on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under dracula's spell was very eerie. dr. edleman's transformation into the "dr. jekyl/mr. hyde" type character was also done very well.and it's great to see dracula, frankenstein, and the wolf man together, one "last" time.*** out of ****

peter strauss, by nature of appearing in mini-series and made-for-tv films, often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews - usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film, having channel-hopped into it half-way through. well, i've just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about the jericho mile - that should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film!!peter strauss won an emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much.... looking to be objective, i attempted to criticise this film. instead, i found myself arguing down every one of my possible nit-picks. this is what true, realistic film-making is about. this is not your typical hollywood sensationalism, where everything is overacted - it's so realistic and true to life that people have thought it's based on a real event!!

i really enjoyed this movie - i like prison movies in general (i'm not sure why -- i'm sure some shrink could make something out of it!) i spent one night in jail more than 20 years ago, and i knew then i would never go back - i got the individual version of "scared straight"! (i did get locked up in an isolation cell on alcatraz for a couple of hours, compliments of a park ranger, but that's another story!) anyway, the genre really interests me. the soundtrack, specifically "sympathy for the devil" by the rolling stones, was the perfect backdrop for the film. to this day, i think of "the jericho mile" every time i hear the song.

an interesting and involved film about a "lifer" just trying to live out his days peacefully. elements of the main character appear in michael mann's later films, like thief (1981), heat (1995), and so on. you can see this one at the ucla instructional media laboratory-- one of the only places in the country that has copies readily available to the public. it's a great one!

i've never given a movie a ten out of ten before but this is the closest i have ever come (i gave it a 9). there are very few movies that i truly love, this however is one of them. with it's gritty realism, fantastic on-site locationing, and it's great soundtrack it literally blew my young mind when i first saw it in 1979. at that point i didn't know about prisons, violence, racial tensions, or the struggle to survive & live free. i doubt that anyone who is an adult, or for that matter anyone who is growing up in todays world could be impacted by this film in the same way i was all those years ago, but i will say this: "if you haven't seen this movie i envy you"; this is because you have the chance to see this great film for the frist time. for each of us they're different, but here's to the rarest movies of them all: the ones we actually love...

i watched the this the other night on a local station because i didn't feel like watching tripe like 'american idol'. peter strauss gives a great performance as a convict named 'rain' murphy who keeps to himself. he admits to his crime and makes no bones that he feels no shame for it. his cell is bare of any comforts that other inmates have like books and pictures. the only time he feels in another zone is in running. he does it often and can run a mile in under four minutes. when a college coach hears about this, he wants to prime him for a shot at the olympics. at first, 'rain' wants no part of this, but when his best friend is killed, he shows interest.this is a good movie, period. strauss is very good (what did you expect, anything less?) and michael mann shows hints of greatness that would come full bloom years later. this movie had that bit of realism (probably because it was filmed among convicts). it almost feels like this was a true story. the additional casting is good. there is a lot of notable names like brian dennehy, roger e. mosley, and richard moll as well.my heart sank when some pompous board of directors wouldn't let him run because he didn't feel bad for his crime. his final act made me stand up and cheer. when they took his dreams away, he took them back hard. this was back when tv movies were actually good. 'the jericho mile' is a gem of a film. espn classic, please show this film!!!

i watch a lot of movies - dvd, features, and classics, you name it. the night i watched jericho mile, my wife (who had ordered it on the internet) said she remembered it from when she was in high school, that it had stayed with her all of these years. somewhat reluctantly i sat down (with our daughter & son), and was riveted from the opening sequence to the end titles. we all were. she, who remembered the original, and our kids (18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was about couldn't believe it. our favorite scene? bar none, when peter strauss so passionately bangs his fist down and says, "i'd do it again!". it didn't advocate violence because it was a defense crime, but evoked such intensity we couldn't believe it...when his fellow cell mates gave him their food in support of his efforts, there wasn't a dry eye in our house.someone please make more movies like this one. unbelievable!!

the film is not for everyone. some might think the acting is bad when it is actually understated and natural. there are no obviously evil acts and there are no stunningly beautiful moments. there is a lot of indecision, an lot of conflicting feelings.actually this film takes a very honest look at a very complex subject, sex with minors. it is complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when her body and hormones are still developing and both of their minds and personalities are still developing. complex also because society has very simplistic views of sex with minors, and complex, because the characters don't know if society is right or if their instincts are right.some will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions. questions such as who was really in charge of the relationship, who was damaged, did good come out of it, was it art, who was damaged more, did some of the problems with their relationship stem from it being forbidden by society, did some of the problems stem from their own immaturity, and probably most important, was this truly a crime?the film is resolutely neutral on all of this, and it is this neutrality that is its strength. it is the reason for the understated acting, the simple sets, the lack of background music, soft lighting, and the general "flat" presentation. the message is clear. we don't really understand this kind of relationship today, and quick judgments are bound to be shallow.

jennifer montgomery's "art for teachers of children" is a stunning, disturbing masterpiece. montgomery's gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking, raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old jennifer's seduction of her married boarding-school guidance counselor. the scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing jennifer (caitlin grace mcdonnell) and jennifer's mother (actually voiced by ruth montgomery) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful i've ever seen captured on film. the lesson ultimately learned here? "there's nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art." well, i would highly recommend this remarkable piece of "art" for anyone interested in thought-provoking independent cinema.

to summerize this movie: nice for tv but too small for the theatre. i enjoyed watching this movie at home but i wont watch it a second time. the concept is good, but what ends up in the movie is just a summary. the end had a 'nice' twist but is still unsatisfying. maybe it was the intention of the director but it wasn't worked out like a it should be. but then again, it's an ok kind of movie.

if you enjoy riddles and suspense, you will enjoy this movie. truth be told it was mostly the adrian paul part that got me to pick it up, i knew almost nothing about the movie beforehand. plot is: sarah (carly pope), a student of philosophy and metaphysics, starts playing a mysterious riddle game trying to figure out "the reason" and gets involved in "the game" by solving riddles. vern (adrian paul) is a shop owner, also a riddle fanatic, and also gets entangled in the game. myth has it that if you solve the game, the meaning of existence (referred to as "the design") is revealed. brendan fehr's character is a "village idiot" type hanging around the shop who turns out to be more than he seems. all in all, i thought the movie was pretty well done. and it's definitely an original concept, a rare find these days! i personally happen to like riddles and puns, so while most of them weren't very difficult, it was still a fun movie. well worth the rental. so, if you haven't seen it -- get it! :-d

this is a cult classic for sure!!it is tricky to follow at times, but then again, so is a film like jacobs ladder or even say fight club. if you want standard fare, then i figure go rent the care bears movie or perhaps an old disney classic. but if you want " to view the world differently" then i would say open yourself up to enigma's and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and think.for me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout. so while i have seen some complaints, all in all i would say take the film for what it is and enjoy.

i watched this film not knowing anything about it. i had presumed it was a sci-fi b movie of some sort. how wrong i was. the plot is enthralling and intelligent, the cast are all charismatic and the whole film just makes you think for a change. some of the riddles stumped me completely but in the end the answers were rather simple. i am quite baffled at the low scoring of this film as i thought it was quite unusual. if you liked the film se7en (seven) with brad pit or the matrix then you will like this. there is no major special effects or fancy gimmickry here at all. it is all about the plot, about building the characters and building an atmosphere. it is a film however than ultimately provides no answers which may irk some people but i thought the ending was great. i am still not sure if the film is based on an true story or not.......

set mostly in the back streets of toronto ng is a dark , mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman ( vern and sarah ) , each of whom has a fascination with riddles and a disastrous incident in their past . fine dialogue and first-rate casting propel this low key, noirish journey into the girl's search for the meaning behind the word puzzles that keep appearing in her life. aided by her , anything but enthusiastic, male friend, the two of them reach the end of their quest , but with a price to be paid. the film never intends to answer all of its mysteries , but does an excellent job in the exposition of several plot twists

i have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind. the trauma, the suspense is just amazing. i ended so wound up in the psychological fear and philosophy of it, and relating it to reality. movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don't forget, those that make you doubt your reality. a problem could be the quality, but that doesn't bring down the essence of the movie.the idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer. i just totally loved it! so many clues and twitches and puzzles. one of the best movies ever, hands down.

this film was probably the best "scary film" i've seen in years. chilling might be a more accurate description. the ending was unexpected and therefore took me by surprise. if it has any flaw it would be the overuse of the whole meaning of life concept. since noone truly knows that answer, you definitely sail into murky waters when you incorporate that concept into a movie. put that aside and the movie is quite enjoyable. carly pope should emerge as one of the next bright young stars in the film industry. the rest of the cast were somewhat shaky, however since the focus was on sara novak (carly pope), her performance anchored the movie. the, at times poor acting abilities of her costars were not an issue since it was not their performances that fuelled this movie. (thankfully). watch this movie you should enjoy it.t

what can i say? not as bad as many here have made it out to be. the only reason i even watched this film that i had previously never heard of before, was strictly for ian mcshane.i was not disappointed in the least. ian mcshane was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role. he's always great to watch and for my money... an extremely underused actor.as for the rest of the film.... every other actor in the movie delivered strong, solid performances. these people certainly weren't being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation (as this was a fairly low budget film) but this did not mean that any of them "mailed" their appearances in. everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them.i was even pleasantly surprised at adrian paul's performance though i must admit i have only ever seen him in the highlander television series before this movie.the plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life, not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film. anybody who expected a clear-cut, by-the-numbers, connect the dots "conclusion" or "answer" at the end of the movie... clearly wasn't watching the film closely enough! this film is not going to tell you what the "meaning of life" is! the idea is that after seeing the film, you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee. i certainly did.no car chases... no explosions... no bar room brawls.... (sounds pretty dull, huh?) but the reality is that i was completely absorbed by the film and it's just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved.****** warning...****** if you're the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous "question" as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly...you might not enjoy this film.

a raw edgy thriller that aimed for great philosophical heights it couldn't quite attain. i did still enjoy the film immensely. it had great elements of suspense, leaving me with that delightful spine chill i expect from thrillers, and it achieved this purely psychologically, without resorting to escalating blood and gore. the soundtrack and setting added to the suspense perfectly. at times, it was a bit unpolished, particularly the acting, and character development. it could only have been a better film if we had known more about the nightmares from the past the characters see when they close their eyes, and why they felt this desperate need to seek the "answer" that is so integral to the storyline. after all they seemed to continue to seek it, despite knowing or at least having an inkling of what might happen when they found it. i would recommend seeing this film if you are prepared to look beyond the grit to see the potential of a diamond in the rough.

i saw the movie while i was in a class a few years back in high school. i thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles. i think the type of people that wouldn't like this movie would be those who don't like solving things, or those who get frustrated when they can't solve riddles. its a good movie, based on a true story that happened in my home town of toronto, ontario. so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there, watch this movie. and for those who only watch movies to point out plot holes and character flaws, realize that in real life, this same stuff does happen. but thats all i want to say on that. the riddles are good, some are hard, some are not. but the movie also leaves you wanting more, more riddles, more explanation, just plainly, more. something more i want to add, is that the ideas within this movie, the underground riddle world, does exist, but there is a lot more to it. to find it, you can not look for it. to never look for it, would be no way to find it. leave your mark, and it will find you.

it could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you don't have to throw cartloads of money at a movie to make it good, nor will it guarantee that it is worth watching) but i think that is totally missing the point. if your expecting fast cars, t&a or a movie that will spell itself out for you then don't watch this, you'll be disappointed and dumbfounded.this movie was thoroughly enjoyable, kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think. the writer obviously put a lot of thought and research behind this movie and it shows through the end, just remember to keep an open mind.note: the school scenes were all filmed at mcmaster university and most of the rest was done in toronto.

nemesis game is a mind-bending film filled with riddles, death, mystery, and philosophy. in it's simplest sense the film is about seeking answers and what happens when you've finally found them all. the search for answers leads sarah novak down a path that gets darker as it gets more compelling. the final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth, yet sarah is so close to understanding it all. what would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life?the movie was written and directed by jesse warn. while this was warn's first feature length film, the movie doesn't reflect that at all, but instead shows polish and an artistic approach to telling the story. carly pope was powerful in the lead role and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to watch. i would definitely love to see more of her work.being based on riddles, this is a very cerebral movie. it's that's your thing, as it is mine, then i totally recommend seeing nemesis game. rating: 4.5/5

as a late-going patron of the drive-in thearers (1970's-1980s), there are many movies that i have seen & forgotten. this is one i could never forget. despite its low-budget, exploitation-style of movie-making, the story was very well done. the isolated therapy-asylum, where patients act out their fantasies in order to help cure their phsycosis, the accidental murder of the head doctor just as the new nurse arrives on the scene, the (supposed) assistant doctor taking over, the various crazy paitents, the revelation that the assistant doctor is actually a patient herself, and, finally, the rescue of the young nurse by the simple-minded sam, who killed everyone else in the house so she could escape unharmed, made for a great story, which held the film together. i emphasised the word story because that's what makes a good or great film. no matter how much blood, gore, nudity, sexual matter, or outrageous behaviour you put in a film, if the story is not good, then the film is not good. the film credits show clips of all the actors, including the old hag with the final line telling you to get out & never come back, which is a great ending to this film. if it is out on video/dvd, see it & enjoy it.

sweet young nurse charlotte beale (a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout rosie holotik) goes to work at a remote rural asylum run by dr. geraldine s. masters (the excellent annabelle weenick). among the motley assortment of colorfully crazed patients are insatiable, aggressive nymphomaniac allyson king (the luscious betty chandler), loopy judge oliver w. cameron (a gloriously hammy gene ross), paranoid vietnam veteran sergeant jaffee (nicely played by hugh feagin), gentle giant sam (the amiable william bill mcghee), and nutty old hag mrs. callingham (the supremely irritating rhea macadams). said patients are dangerously encouraged to act out their fantasies by dr. masters, which of course results in a rash of brutal killings. director s.f. brownrigg, working from a clever and suitably overwrought script by tim pope, does an expert job of creating and sustaining a suffocatingly dank and brooding atmosphere of seething madness and oppressive claustrophobia. robert farrar's spooky score, the grimy set design, a few wild grisly murders, bruce b. alcott's grungy no-frills cinematography, plenty of deliciously robust, scenery-scarfing histrionics from a game no-name cast (ross in particular is a total eye-rolling hoot), and the genuinely shocking surprise bloodbath conclusion further add to the overall infectiously seedy fun of this choice trashy chunk of 70's low-budget regional horror exploitation cinema.

this film, also known as "don't look in the basement" is actually not bad. it is a little known film even to die hard horror fans but i found this movie pretty entertaining. don't get me wrong, it's certainly not without its problems but do think more people should give it a look. the story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanitarium is certainly an appealing one to me. i thought the acting , which seemed forced at first, somehow got better as the film went along. it seems like the actors really got into their roles. there are some good, colorful characters, including a guy who thinks he's still a soldier, one who thinks he's a judge, an adult with a child's brain, and an attractive girl who craves attention so bad she drops her clothes when any man gets near her. the title "don't look in the basement" has about as much relevance to the story as "the last house on the left" has on that film. if you like movies with creepy characters in a mental ward like i do, check this out.

don't look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and bad acting. sure, it's not a masterpiece by anyone's standards but it is a very fun little b-film with a lot to offer and even a lot of creepy scenes that will stay in your head.as i said, the acting could have been a lot better but that's the case with most exploitation so i can't really complain. the story is clever and has some great plot twists that will keep you guessing. i thought the gore was a lot of fun too. there's just something great about older gore films because they didn't have cgi back then so they had to actually set it all up themselves. see this one for a good time!

i just discovered this obscure '70s horror movie while browsing on youtube. for a low-budget effort, it has plenty of compelling moments in gradual pacing in leading to the surprisingly shocking finish. while there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly, the fact that she's a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important to the story and there's one scene with the curly-haired young man as he attempts to seduce her that turned me on before his pulling back made her screaming mad. the young nurse who comes in and gets hired is alluring herself and i'm not surprised she posed for the cover of playboy. some characters are very irritating and some scenes do seem ridiculous. for the most part, however, don't look in the basement (that's the title i saw on youtube) provides enough drama and chills for an entertaining b-movie.

clearly my rating for this is not to suggest it compares with the classy horrors of the likes of argento but with other 70s low budget, drive in fare and in that department it truly is a classic. the lack of money shows, (does anyone care too much?) the acting is adequate rather than professional, (does that make it more realistic?) but unlike so many other movies, and not just low budget ones, this does not drag for a moment. crap it may be but non stop crap, in your face crap and although inevitably a bit campy at times, this is a must see for anyone who has any idea what i'm talking about. at times quite delirious, this crazy little film filled out with crazy characters is clearly made for fun and fun indeed it is to watch.

widely known as "don't look in the basement" - this is pure 70s horror, b-movie goodness that could actually pass as the genre's version of "one flew over the cuckoo's nest". though the movie seems to go nowhere throughout the first hour+ of it's runtime, i enjoyed this particular batch of quirky crazies and their various personalities and deficiencies - such as the former army sergeant, a chick obsessed with caring for a plastic doll, a lovable man-child, and a loony nymph. after their head-doctor is murdered by a patient, a small sanitarium hires a new nurse onto their under-staffed facility, who becomes immersed in the resident's different "ticks" and outbursts. things gradually become stranger, however, when patients start acting far more abnormal than usual... you never really know, or care, where the movie is going, 'cause it still entertains up until it's completely whacked-out ending! several of the "twists" felt a little too forced and i could have used a tad more blood, but i really dug this much too under-rated blend of humor and horror. check it out...

back in the 70's, a small-time texas filmmaker named s.f. brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget drive-in horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years. before viewing his first film, don't look in the basement, i wasn't too sure what to expect, but i sure as hell didn't expect it to turn out to be the only texas horror i thought was better than the chainsaw massacre. i don't know, this might actually be my all-time favorite horror movie.we begin in an isolated insane asylum. at first, it seems like a rather laid-back place to get mentally healthy, considering all the patients are allowed to roam around freely and whatnot, as if it were their house (i guess it is). none of them seem all that dangerous, only delusional. the residents include a love-nympho, a 700 year old woman, a man-child, a spaz, a guy who thinks he's in a war, a woman who thinks she has a baby, and a guy who thinks he's a judge. one day, out of nowhere, judge kills the doctor with an axe, shortly thereafter, the wanna-be baby mama kills the nurse. ten minutes into the movie, and things are looking really ugly. perhaps the new nurse will know what to do, then again, perhaps not. giving away more would do more harm than good. it's best to plunge head first into this one, knowing as little as possible. if you can appreciate honest-to-god, untampered with horror, then you will not be disappointed. if you liked scream, if you liked wrong turn, if you go for that unoriginal, over-produced, over-scored digital hollywood garbage, then chances are high you just wont see the beauty in this one. don't look in the basement, being a first attempt makes the quality all the more shocking. the atmosphere and the graininess fit into the location and the score like a glove. unfortunately, good ol' s.f. used up most of his good ideas on his first movie, although, the next entry in his texas-sized quadrilogy, is somewhat of a masterpiece, that is, if you're into extra sleazy, mean-spirited, hixploitation like someone i know. if you fall in love with brownrigg's first two, and absolutely must find out what else he had to offer, check out don't open the door, and the house where hell froze over. don't look in the basement has everything that successful horror needs, no stars, no budget, no digital effects, just an original story brought to life in an insane asylum, with a dozen cast members, and a somber, subtle score, and of course, the twist. this is real horror for the real horror fan. 10/10

terry and june was one of the classic british sitcoms in my opinion. you knew what to expect - and ain't that just so typical! :) unlike modern sitcoms with utterly contrived plots, this show is still a breath of fresh air. how lovely not see or hear remarks about bodily functions or not to see a family perpetually late for breakfast or a family with impossible teenagers. and therein is the secret: terry & june was based on a middle class couple living in relative harmony in stead of today's strained plots with the 'de rigueur' dysfunctional family (made to look hip).personally, i vote the "bridge to far" episode as one of the best. in a way, terry's antics reminds me of basil fawlty - both sometimes getting almost impossibly embarrassing!terry & june comes highly recommended. have your tea and biscuits ready!

when the long running 'happy ever after' came to an end, its characters- 'terry & june fletcher' were revived for the longer running and more popular sequel- 'terry & june', although their surnames were changed from fletcher to medford.terry has received a new job and as a result, he and june move to purley where they end up in all manner of scrapes- unwanted guests dropping by to visit at an inconvenient moment, the boss inviting himself to dinner and terry trying to chance his arm at d.i.y but cocking it up each time. a fellow imdb user branded this show as 'not clever' and 'never well written'. fair enough, it wasn't clever, but that was the whole point. as for 'never well written'- some of the episodes were pretty substandard, i will admit, but overall i found it to be extremely well written, highly amusing and very well acted.it was warm hearted slapstick, not dissimilar to the later b.b.c sitcom 'keeping up appearances'. eight different writers contributed to the nine series, giving the show plenty of scope. terry scott was a comic genius, as he well proved in productions such as 'hugh & i', the 'carry on' films and of course, here! june whitfield likewise was a comedy legend in her own right.i enjoy some modern shows- i.e 'still game', 'the catherine tate show', 'legit' and 'empty'. i even enjoyed the 'alternative comedy'- 'naked video', 'the young ones' and 'the comic strip presents' but i am more inclined to enjoy vintage comedy, such as this. humour that you don't need to think about is excellent for when you are feeling down and want to lift yourself up. for the record, 'terry & june' was wonderful stuff. special note should be made of the catchy theme tune which caught the mood of the show tremendously well!

terry and june in my mind, is a all time classic, along the ranks with bless this house with the late sid james and the late diana coupland, but terry scott will be sadly missed even tho he passed away in 1994. i have all the dvds upto press and i look forward to getting all 9, also would be nice to see "happy after ever" released on dvdjune whitfield is still going strong and terry scott will always live on in my memoryterry scott r.i.p. there aren't many comedies today that i can think of that will stay in the legends list and yes the middle class bit does get on some peoples wicks but i don't mind, i think it would be brilliant to see some celebration of the life of terry scott

one of the most unfairly maligned programmes of all time, 'terry & june' was also one of the most popular sitcoms of the '70's and '80's.it started life as 'happy ever after', but when eric merriman decided he didn't want to write any more, it changed into this, hence the dropping of 'aunt lucy' and the fletcher's becoming the medford's. yes, it was cosy, domestic, middle-class stuff; the plots ran the gamut of clichÃ©s from the boss coming to dinner, the vicar organising a jumble sale, and unwanted relatives coming to stay for the weekend. it was certainly not 'dreadful lazy comedy'. as for it being 'not clever', it was not meant to be. it was funny and well performed, and that was enough! i too loved the 'alternative' boom of the '80's ( 'spitting image', 'black adder', 'the young ones' etc. ) but also enjoyed conventional stuff such as this. if nothing else, it provided alternative comedy with something to be an alternative to. i found it sad though when the likes of ben elton took against both this and benny hill. well, family oriented comedy has all but vanished from our screens, but where has it left us? take a look at the latest t.v. schedules. all soaps and reality dross. the few comedies left are aimed at teenagers, meaning they are jam packed with swearing, bodily function jokes, and explicit sexual references. and they are not remotely funny either.the 'alternative comedy' boom was good in many ways, but had a dark side. it made conventional sitcoms appear old fashioned, drove away talented writers and performers such as spike milligan, and ultimately led to such unspeakable drivel as 'little britain' and 'tittybangbang' ( heaven help us ). if it ain't broke, don't fix it!

i used to enjoy "happy ever after", but was absolutely hypnotised by "terry & june". with aunt lucy gone, the emphasis seemed to fall more heavily on the relationship between terry and june, a middle aged, middle class english couple, and i thoroughly enjoyed it, losing myself quite happily in each episode.the 1980s were the era of alternative comedy, but they were also the decade of choice - and terry and june certainly suited more traditional tastes. and mine - and i was a huge fan of "the young ones", too! each week, terry got into a silly situation and june got pulled in herself and usually ended up having to bail him out. how dated the shows seem now - it was a different world, but it's great fun to see trends of the 1980s featured - such as the cb radio storyline of 1982 (cb radio was legalised in england in november 1981), which saw terry imprisoned in his car in the back of a lorry! i've been watching the shows again recently on dvd, and i still think they're terrific! not loved by the enlightened elite - the chattering classes, but a huge hit with the masses! wonderful!

a true comedy.the dialog is fast and very witty.eleanor parker at her physical peak .flynn as only flynn can be"the charming rogue'..although now past his prime.. most of the scenes between the principals are short so the movie moves well. if you haven't seen this movie please give a look.you will be surprised at flynn's comedy timing.the scenes between him tucker, parker and "cudddles" sakal are hilarious.just on the basis of the outfits worn by the most attractive parker,this movie is worth a look.the romance of this 40's movie will not be lost on those so inclined to watch movies from hollywood's golden past. my bet is that never say goodbye won't disappoint.

a fine romantic comedy. errol flynn shows what a deft touch for comedy he possessed. a talent that probably shows some of his true prankster self. the comedic writing on this film is excellent. eleanor parker does a nice job as flynn's ex wife whom errol is trying to win back. eleanor is also easy on the eyes. the sets exude 1940's glamour and style where appropriate.flynn's comedic timing and wit are displayed to full effect here, watch his double takes, his ability to verbally counter punch with a snappy comeback or act the straight man, and his total believability and sincerity where required, this guy could act! it is a shame errol did not get a chance to do more roles like this throughout his career, he was multi-talented to the extreme. if you enjoyed "it happened one night" with gable and colbert or some of the william powell and myrna loy comedies you will enjoy this.well paced and lots of laughs. a lost diamond of a movie.

this movie is a hidden gem. i can't understand why this movie doesn't get more air time. errol and eleanor parker make for a real attractive and dashing couple. and their chemistry is impeccable. i really liked the touch of his daughters reference to him as being her robin hood. i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys errol flynn. it's nice to see errol playing a father as well. by all accounts from his very own children, he was a very attentive and loving father in real life. also, the supporting cast is wonderful as well. you can't go wrong with supporting players such as hattie mcdaniel and lucile watson. hattie mcdaniel makes a movie that much better from the get-go. this movie has now become a holiday tradition in my home. enjoy!!!

this was the third time i tried to watch this film. the previous two times, i found the beginning so sickeningly sweet and "schmaltzy" that i just stopped watching. however, now that i am a little older and more compulsive, i forced myself to watch all the film and i was very surprised to see that i actually liked it quite a bit. so, i look at the movie much the same way i would look at swimming in the ocean when the water temperature is 70 degrees (that's about 21-22 degrees centigrade for all those metric-lovers out there). sure, the water is terribly cold and shocking at first, but if you force yourself to stay in the water, you'll get used to it--so resist that urge to jump out right away!! the film begins with a lengthy exchange between flynn and his daughter, played by a lispy patti brady. some may find there conversations very cute and endearing, though others may find them a bit hard to take since these moments are so gosh-darn sweet! in a way, it was some amazing acting by flynn because it's hard to imagine him in real life having kids or acting domestic especially that he wanted to be faithful to one woman in this film--now that's acting!! never say goodbye concerns the divorced couple, flynn and parker, and their mutual desire to remarry. since they both love each other as well as their lispy kid, it seems like a foregone conclusion that they will once again tie the knot. however, there are some serious problems standing in their way: lucille watson (who plays her usual over-bearing and controlling mother-in-law character), flynn's girlfriend (after all, he is errol flynn and he is divorced, so you gotta expect him to have a girl somewhere) and a marine (played by forrest tucker).not unexpectedly, all this does get worked out by the end and everyone lives happily ever after. however, despite it being formulaic and predictable, the film is a winner because it is so much fun to watch. flynn, despite his reputation as an action-adventure hero, is very good with comedy-romance and it's just a lot of fun to watch him. also, the film has the ever-scene chewing cuddles sakall--he's just so gosh-darn cute and sweet that he is perfect in this type of film. and, despite the sweetness, the film is pretty well-written. the bottom line is the film is fun.so my recommendation is that you do watch this film and force yourself not to retch at the sickeningly sweet aspects of the film. once you've gotten over this, the rest of the film is a picture that is well worth your time.

a young girl becomes a war-time marine's pen-pal, and when he visits at war's end expecting someone a bit more "available," comic complications ensue. all ultimately works out well, naturally, but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery. errol flynn's dead-on impression of humphrey bogart from "casablanca" is a highlight, as are various send-ups of his own swashbuckling image (the "jumping" scene in the kitchen with forrest tucker is a riot). it is tucker, though, who "tucks" the movie under his arm, lowers his head and barrels over the goal line. he demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in "f-troop" and imparts a liveliness and energy that flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance. eleanor parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued, and little patti brady charms as tucker's actual pen-pal friend. a fine, lightweight "coming home" comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining.

errol flynn had quite a gift for comedy that was sadly rarely exploited. given the right material this film demonstrates that he could have happily been quite at home in cary grant style, gentle comedies. out of his various forays into the genre this is certainly the best. patti brady gives a fine performance in the child part and eleanor parker looks simply stunning throughout the film. an added bonus is the wonderful hattie mcdaniel who is sadly underused in this film- a welcome presence none the less. flynn carries off his comedic duties with the same easy style that he brought to his swashbuckling roles. the fact that he makes it look like it's easy doesn't mean that it is. a super little family comedy, great for the christmas period or any other time you feel like being cheered up.

this movie is based on the game series: final fantasy. this one particularly is about ff7 or final fantasy vii. i loved the game, and i was very happy to see it be transformed into a movie, i loved the cg, that was awesome. lot's of great fight scenes, action, and characters to make the movie memorable. if your a die-hard fan of the game you will love this movie. personally, i'm not a die-hard fan of the games, but i am starting to become one.my favourite character out of final fantasy vii besides cloud, would have to be cid. i love cid, i think he's cute. i was amazed how real the cg images were, it was amazing, it's the game in 3d. i had a great time watching the movie, and by the way, i love the aeons to, especially bahamut, he's great! overall i gave this movie a 9, because yes, i loved it. i thought it was a really really good movie, and yes it's on my list of movies to get. the characters were amazing, loved the cg, story was wonderful, with lot's of action and fight scenes. all-in-all, it's the best movie i've seen yet, based on a video game.

i am an avid ff7 fan, for instance i have the game then sell it(bad mistake) but then buy it again (good mistake...erm)anyways, yes this film is very good, the fights are very cool, music very good, and the cgi you cant falter.only thing disappointing with the film i felt was the lack of other character involvement, it was almost all cloud which although is a great character, u cant beat a of cid and barret.but despite that the film was great in my opinion, and a must watch.overall a great film give and will give it 9/10 squaresoft, make more films like this and you'll be worshiped more so than you already are!!!!

o m g!!! did you ever think they would make a movie about it?? well i knew they would, but i didn't know when!! and now its here at last!!! when i received it yesterday through the post i put it into my (wicked) stereo that plays dvds and instantly had this huuuuuuuuuuge grin on my face as cloud appeared (looking well....gorgeous!!) and they followed by all the other fascinating characters from final fantasy the game! including tifa and aeris, my favourites....(they are pretty too in this) the graphics knocked me out!!!! they were truly amazing. so real down to the last hair!!! the story line is ok bit confusing, especially as my version of the film was in japanese, but of course - being a long time final fantasy fanatic - i did not mind a bit - i just read the subtitles!!! all the characters talk the way they would do in the game, and reno and rude are still ridiculous. the dragon scene is wicked too. just looks so good!!! anyway.... the graphics were, amazing....the storyline , fantastic....and the basic idea of even having a ff7 film.......genius!!!

i still can't believe that computer graphics are able to create 3d images. the moment i heard it from my friends over at a forum, i swear to myself that i am going to make myself watch it.i managed to watch parts of it at a fellow shopping centre where they had many advent children dvds and showed it at a few laptops for sale. obviously i was overjoyed but it was still not enough. then i headed off to youtube.com to search for the movie. all i came up with was music video dedications. until that fateful day...i found it. i watched it despite all the distractions because i knew that i have to watch or else i will be called a loser.enough about me more on the movie. as if final fantasy vii wasn't enough, they made a movie about it! my most favourite part was the end of sephiroth's life. cloud's omnislash couldn't be better. but i wouldn't entirely spoil the show for you. you have to watch it for yourself!!! get the dvd now!

as i stated earlier this year, in my review of swordfish (which was scripted by this films writer/director/producer skip woods) this is a good film. it ranks very high up there in my crime flick list among lock stock & two smoking barrels, pulp fiction and snatch. basically i think this film is for me what reservoir dogs was for many people - a cult classic - although i prefer to compare it with pulp fiction. i mean i never liked tarantino's first effort a lot, but i sure as hell liked this one as much as i like pulp fiction, for it simply has everything a classic needs. a great story and good actors. ok the budget might be not as big as in for instance godzilla, the avengers of mission to mars but it sure as hell beats the living crap out of those films (and numerous others).the story of this film, is about a man named casey (thomas jane), who has settled down with his wife in houston. unexpectedly an old friend of his comes by disrupting his life, revealing his secrets and basically making his day a living hell (and a bloody one too).the film is very original and quite bloody / sexually tinted. so based on that first and that last quality i can assure you that if you like this film, you'll also like swordfish, which of course has a much bigger budget and more famous faces than this one but is just as good (though not as bloody and not quite as sexually tinted). i saw this film for the second time last night and i really enjoyed it (again). i mean all the characters and actors are good, although i must give very big credits to thomas jane and paulina porizkova, who were the best actors (and had the best characters) in the film. also i'd have to thank skip woods for being so imaginative and original. brutal, sexual, offensive??? maybe, but sure as heck enjoyable and a thrill ride to the end.8 out of 10

for those unfamiliar with paddy chayefsky, this is a very good introduction. while chayefsky deals with the reality behind the myths of many things including medicine, this work is surprisingly prophetic of the way medicine is going today, two decades after the movie was made and over a decade after his death. beyond that, some insights into chayefsky's view of life in general are 'slipped into' the movie as well. the 20th century may well turn out to be the first and last century of the united states in the history of the world. if it turns out that the contribution to the arts by the united states was in the dimension of the 'movie,' this is a prime example of that art.

the best screen performance ever by george c. scott. the screenplay by chayefsky, the irony-freighted dialogue, is near perfect ('just where do you train your nurses, dachau?'). rigg is wonderful as the rescuing angel who saves scott from doom, as is the whole cast. it's a hilarious and serious movie. it is a movie of the period, the 60's, but it is not in any sense dated. what it is about, the chaos and irrationality of the system vs. the sanity of the individual, is timeless. and the "we heal nothing. we cure nothing" monologue (delivered, shouted actually, as no one else but scott could) with its references to cloning and other 'wonders' of modern science could literally have been written this morning.

36. the hospital (comedy, 1971) a series of emergencies has gripped manhattan hospital. patients are dying left and right due to overcrowded conditions, and a ineptitude staff. when a resident doctor is caught up in the death count the chief medical examiner, dr. bock (george c. scott), is called in to investigate. having worked as a doctor for too many years, and going through a mid-life crisis of his own, dr. bock finds the going tough. he decides to commit suicide. but then he meets barbara (diana rigg), a young-hippie beauty. whose keen insights on life help the depressed bock.critique: black comedy features a 'tour-de-force' performance from veteran actor george c. scott. he's good at playing high-strung, serious characters whose strict morals are severely tested. first half of the film unfolds like a melodrama, giving a pretty good account of hospital life, and the shambles they sometimes are. but then, as things look set for a dramatic climax it skews into slapstick comedy. if paddy chayefsky's script had maintained its dramatic feel i wonder if scott would've walked out with another best actor oscar (he had previously won it, 'in-absentia', the year before). his breakdown (suicide) scene is one of the most gut-wrenchingly real in cinema history.quote: dr. bock: ". . .last night i sat in my hotel room reviewing the shambles of my life and contemplating suicide. i said 'no bock don't do it. you're a doctor, a healer, you're a necessary person, you're life is meaningful'. then. . .i find out that one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses. . .how am i to sustain my feeling of meaningfulness in the face of this?"

i had to get this movie, since it didn't come to where i live. i waited patiently and it was worth the wait. i totally fell in love with this movie. the chemistry between walters and grint you could see, since they also worked together on the harry potter movies.the woman who plays his overbearing, righteous mother really had me convinced all right and how much of a hypocrite she is, i think she did a great job playing the role. i only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it. lol, but of course we just have to use our imagination on how it went down. (snickers) i totally thought the movie was worth the wait and if you want a good movie to watch. rent this movie. i do have to say that rupert really did a great job and it's nice to see that he's doing movies outside of harry potter,even though i totally love him as ron weasley. the whole cast did a great job and i hope rupert continues to act outside of harry potter to broaden his skill!

i had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as i was perusing the shelves at a local rental store. having just watched the latest harry potter installment, i was intrigued by rupert grint and wanted to see more of his work. reading the description on back about "an overzealous, evangelical christian do-gooder," and identifying as an evangelical christian, myself, i thought, "ooohÂ…this should be interesting." and so it was. i found mr. brock's story beautiful in both words and images; and sadly enough, all too familiar. the contrast he drew between ben's parent's interpretations of what it means to be a christian was a poignant commentary on how christians view themselves and the impact that perception has on those around them. on the one hand, we have ben's mom stating, "whatever happens behind these walls, ben, we're god's ambassadors. we show the world a smiling face." on the other hand is ben's dad discussing truth in his sermon at the beginning of the film. at the end of his monologue, he states, "the more a person parades their christianity for the benefit of others, the less i am inclined to trust the christianity they claim. god tells us true faith is the freedom to choose truth. now, how you express that, the way, the manner, the means at your disposal, these things are of no consequence, be you christian or atheist, unless in your heart you are true." if only our churches were full of christians who ascribed to this latter definition of what it means to be a follower of jesus, rather than the former. what a difference that would make! as a christian and a psychologist, i would want an imperfect yet authentic faith over a perfectly polished image any day. what a tragedy Â– to feel like i always need to play a role when, really, i just need to rest in the freedom of being completely who god made me to be. i think mr. brock provides a refreshing glimpse of what this freedom in christ looks like. i recommend this film for anyone who desires a fresh look at faith.

i thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted. its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoyment.rupert grint played the part marvelously, and has a general knack for the acting business. the almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot, and was a character one could almost instantly loathe. this reminded me, in a way, of the divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood. not by means of actual content of the film, but the premises, and overall tone to the film itself. "driving lessons" is a coming of age story, which many might find very easy to relate to due to the overpowering mother, the lack of freedom, and the discovery of oneself.

i thought it was going to be a lousy movie, honestly, i mean, rupert grint, ron, acting in a movie different from harry potter, was actually really difficult to picture it. but as the movie started, it showed that this guy does have talent, i mean, is the best actor of the hp trio, for reference, have you seen emma watson trying to act? or what about daniel's acting? both lack experience even though they have acted in a million harry potter movies. ben, his character is a very shy boy, incapable of showing his true feelings about everything, his despise about his over ruling mom and the resentful anger towards his father who is unable to step up and confront his unfaithful wife. julie walters was absolutely brilliant! her interpretation of an old retired actress trying to live with the shadow of her past, while she tries to remember shakespearian sonnets is absolutely wonderful! also, it appears that many youth is wasted in religious nonsense acts.

once a wise man from india once said, "first they will laugh at us. then they will hate us. then they will fear us." know that yes this film's budget was a bit off, but even then with its story still takes our interest many yrs later, regardless of how it may have looked. but know soon, in due time "masten thrust" will arise to the big screen once again. then he and the new redesigned t-rex will more then shock you. it will scare many for centuries to come!! this film is in current pre-production and will be nothing like anything you have ever seen before! this will be beyond thx format.....right into 4-dx format. "be afraid, be very afraid!"

i was 9 when i first saw this on tv. on a friday night. i remember the full page ad in the tv guide with the picture of the rex. amazing how some things stick in your mind after 30 years. anyway if your a kid who likes monster movies this one is entertaining enough especially with boone and keats raging at each other. special effects are no harryhausen but its worth the hour and a half if you find it somewhere on late night tv. haven't seen it in a few years for some reason these classics fade from cable tv. if you do catch it on late night don't be too critical just grab some snacks and enjoy it. it might be cheesy but i thought it was a lot better than the kong remake that came out in the theaters a year before.

the last dinosaur is a film that is meant to be fun and exciting. it succeeds at doing both.maston is a big game hunter who hunts big game(go figure). owning a company he is planning on going on an expedition with a group of people including a photographer named frankie, a japanese scientist, a guy who works for his company named chuck, and an african guy who has aided him on many safari's named bun ta. the point is to study what is believed to be tyrannosaurus rex, dinosaur that killed the last expedition to the area. they will be getting to this prehistoric area taking a drilling vehicle that travels underwater called the polar borer. after getting to the area they soon find the tyrannosaurus, which maston tries to shoot but his gun gets jammed. chuck immediately senses that maston wanted to hunt the dinosaur all along to add it to his collection of "stuffed animals". while they were away, tyrannosaurus invades their camp and takes the polar borer away from their camp. upon returning the group realizes that they may be in the area longer than they expected and maston states that he will kill the tyrannosaurus.the story is great for a science fiction film. drilling to a prehistoric area is something that seems could really happen. the scenery is beautiful and it looks like a place where dinosaurs could still reside.also i liked the characters in this film. maston is the typical big time hunter who wants to get anything that could be a trophy kill. also great was bun ta, played by luther rackley formerly of the nba, who really looks and acts like an african tracker. jackie is the typical female who causes problems for the group and seems to not belong in the wilderness. chuck is the former employee of maston who has his view of his boss change when he is in the wild with him.the tyrannosaurus in this film is one of the best in a film. it stands a little too up-right like godzilla does and it drags its tail, so it is a guy in a suit. but the suit looks good, especially the head and the tail, and the tyrannosaurus looks good and very scary. i have seen plenty of other films where dinosaur suits look way worse. tyrannosaurus in this film sometimes emits a roar sounding like godzilla's and other times roars like king kong from "king kong escapes" and "king kong vs godzilla". so a great tyrannosaurus.there is plenty of action in the last dinosaur. of particular note is a great fight between tyrannosaurus and triceratops. also a great scene where bun ta tries to spear the tyrannosaurus. there are other great parts that i wont give away. you have to see for yourself.i recommend this film to everyone. watch it and you will not be disappointed.

stupidly beautiful. this movie epitomizes the 'so bad it's good' genre of films. the only two talents in it are richard boone and joan van ark, and only boone is any good. it's kind of sad that the man who rose to fame as paladin should wind up in this ugly pile of celluloid. while he turns in a fantastic performance, i couldn't help but feel that he so outclassed all his fellow actors in this piece that he shouldn't even have been there.the effects in this film are laughable, but fun. the idea of a dinosaur being buried in the wall of a cave and suddenly coming to life is b-movie gold. when the 'triceratops' gets killed, watch how it falls. it's clear that the stunt performer in the front of the costume knows the timing best. he falls to the ground, well before the back half of the dinosaur follows suit.speaking of 'suits', there is nothing good to say about the purple tyrannosaur, in this flick. it seems to have some kind of stealth technology, since bunta (reputed to be the best tracker in the world) twice fails to notice it until it's within biting range of him. i don't know how all the prints are, but in the version i own, the tyranno's roar contains godzilla's trademark bellow.this is loads of fun, to watch, if you like bad movies. i love them, and especially bad monster movies, so i consider this the gem of my collection. if bad movies are your thing, definitely get this one.

the last dinosaur was one of those "out of nowhere" movie-of-the-week films in the 1970's that was pretty exciting for the time especially to fans of japanese tokusatsu films. originally slated for a theatrical release (around when the dino king kong was out in the previous december) it was suddenly pulled and made into a friday night abc movie of the week. rankin bass-who were no strangers to japanese co-productions were the guns behind this production, co-produced with tsuburaya productions of japan-the people who brought us ultraman in various forms. starring mostly an american cast including the late richard boone, joan van ark and the late steven keats, it told the tale of a prehistoric pocket of time in what was a superheated volcanic caldera somewhere at the frozen arctic circle, containing dinosaurs. it plays a lot like the films the land unknown(1956) and the land that time forgot(1975) in feel and pace. sure the dinosaurs were guys in suits(a triceratops with front knees!) but they were filmed in such a way, the music and score was so well done, and the cast did a fine job that this didn't matter much to many of us brought up on godzilla. the film has a lot of class to it, from the opening score by nancy wilson "the last dinosaur" to the overall "big" feeling of the film-the locations at hot springs in northern japan were excellent and lush- and the undeniable feeling of kaiju eiga to it. there are some amazing set pieces-the t-rex's "bone yard" and a tracking shot that takes us deep into the jungle to see the t-rex eat a giant fish from a stream. tsuburaya's fx people did their job in style here and aside from a few dodgy matte shots, they do their job well. this film is considered the best 1970's "kaiju" film from japan, even over the five godzilla films made during that decade. rankin bass did several other co-productions with tsuburaya providing the creatures or miniatures- the bermuda depths(1978) and the ivory ape(1980)-but neither measured up to the epic look of this film.

this movie is a great film. the movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film. driving lessons centers around ben (rupert grint) a shy 17 year old who is coming of age. the movie goes on about how ben is sick of his dominating mother and how he just wants to be himself. ben then meets evie, who he makes a very special bond with. the two take a journey and in the process ben finds himself and what a relationship that he and evie share. this is the movie that you watch by yourself, or with someone else. no matter what, you will all feel what ben goes through in the movie. it is a very heart warming film that just makes you think whether your driving lessons were ever as emotional or as much of a journey as ben's lessons.

prepare to meet your messiah - they call him masten thrust. male role models have become increasingly difficult to find in today's overexposed society. every other day an apparent role model is forced to tearfully apologize for a youthful indiscretion or he innocently gets a few youngsters drunk on his ranch. the last dinosaur is the story of the last great hunt of masten thrust, an old, grizzled, big game hunter who serves as role model supreme. despite his haggard features and bulbous nose, the females, including joan van ark, are attracted to him like meatloaf is to cheesy lyrics. thrust is openly sexist and makes no apologies for his elaborate lifestyle, which includes a red kerchief and a private jet with a working fireplace.thrust embarks on a mission to find and hunt the last dinosaur on earth when ironically, after a rich full life, he is truly the last dinosaur. despite his propensity for yelling at everyone in his presence, his employees and lady friends are unwaveringly loyal to him. he may act as though he's perpetually drunk, but make no mistake, if he calls you a 'ding dong' you are a 'ding dong'.not to be denied his own ballad, thrust's song shamelessly praises him and his manliness. a sampling of lyrics includes: "few men have ever done, what he has done, or even dreamed, what he has dreamed/few men have even tried, what he has tried, most men have failed, where he's prevailed/the world holds nothing new in store for him, and things that startle you and me, are just a bore to him/few men have ever lived, as he has lived, or even walked, where he has walked'. even bmtg banned artist clay aiken could belt out those lyrics and become an rump-kicking machine.thrust and his crew of scientists strap themselves into the 'polar borer' wearing mini bike helmets, though thrust affords himself the luxury of the red kerchief around his neck. the giant human filled drill bit digs through the earth and ice to come popping out into a lagoon. dinosaurs from the air and land soon descend upon the scientists forcing thrust and crew to run for their lives. after narrowly escaping a charging dino, masten lays back and blasts out a hearty laugh, not so much to celebrate life but to acknowledge 'the game is afoot'.soon after, it is little surprise that we see a few slightly hunched over cavemen sneaking peeks at their visitors. thrust, not content with simply killing a dinosaur, decides then to make it his mission to bag a cave broad. throughout the movie, the lone t-rex contradicts the belief that dinosaurs have a brain the size of a peanut. despite its enormous size, the local t-rex is able to sidle up next to its victims virtually unnoticed. with the element of surprise, t-rex simply crushes a scientist or two and loots the campsite. every so often the bloated and cagily faced thrust is seen yelling at someone, shooting at something or flirting with a primitive j-lo in manly fashion.thrust is like james tiberius kirk, not only in his addiction to love, but also when is comes to making complicated weapons using limited natural resources in a short period of time. thrust and the remaining crew members construct a highly accurate catapult that flings a large boulder into the skull of the cunning t-rex. upon realizing that even he, masten thrust, cannot top this addition to his trophy case, thrust decides to stay in his prehistoric surroundings. the ever-dwindling crew then leaves thrust to live out his days with his lovely, although a bit gamely, cavewoman and introduce her to his personal collection of stds. this is only a brief synopsis of a movie so complicated and rich in bmtg tradition that it takes several viewings to absorb its message and realize that masten thrust is the answer. the press conference, complete with a yelling thrust, mumbling reporters, and the introduction of the great bunta, is a classic moment. also look for a body, resembling a dead ricky schroeder, lying on some logs, and the most powerful use of someone being called a 'ding-dong' in cinematic history.

i have read a couple of reviews of this film, which has recently been released on dvd by eclectic. apparently, the opening titles are letterboxed, but the remainder (most) is full-screen. the first release, in 1982 by planet video, is completely letterboxed. though it was a primitive release, it did get the compositions right. later releases had sharper and better picture quality, but they were fullscreen as the dvd is. any release of this film should be letterboxed, as it adds significantly to the visual experience of the old planet tape.

i, being a fan of rupert grint, rented this film a few months ago. i thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors. it was entertaining, and showed that rupert grint could play more than his most well known character of ron weasley. his subtle portrayal of ben and everyone else's great acting made this film very likable.ben, a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. he finds one and becomes the, i guess you could call "assistant" to evie, a retired actress. at first, it is just a way for him to earn some money. but after a while, he and evie seem to develop a friendship. evie helps ben break out of his shell a little and gets him to have fun and be happy with himself, and in the end they both seem to need each other.whether you are a fan of rupert grint or not, this movie is a really entertaining one with some very cute and moments. i highly recommend it to anybody who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors.

i'd heard about this movie, but didn't see it until my daughter, who saw it on a flight to australia, told me it was a great movie. i was interested in seeing whether rupert grint, away from harry potter, was showing the promise you see in the potter movies. i wasn't disappointed. he's become a fine actor, showing a range in driving lessons from a shy boy being beaten down by an over-bearing obsessive mother, to a young man finding himself to be worthy of his own, and other's, esteem. going over lines from plays and poetry with his aging-actress employer, it's obvious that he's ready to take on much more complex roles in films and the stage. but the jewel of this movie was julie walters. i'd seen her previously in the potter movies, billy elliott and calendar girls, and loved her. in driving lessons, as she does lines from poetry and shakespeare, i was awed by her timing, command of the language, and body language. i'm hoping it was make-up/costuming, as she portrays an older woman with osteoporosis, though no mention of it is made in the movie-- as a nurse, i can say that she did this perfectly, portraying a woman on the brink of old-age, but clinging to the sparkling past that she reveled in. this is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time, and i wish i'd seen it in a theatre first-- but i doubt it ever played anywhere here in albuquerque. we miss out on so many of these types of movies here.

i really only watched this movie because it had rupert grint in it (who i knew as ron from the harry potter movies). i had never really appreciated rupert as an actor until this movie. i loved the entire film. rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious, quirky movie. i think the movie could have been fine without the sex, but it worked somehow. i can't wait to see more of rupert's films in the future. julie walters also did an amazing job. in the harry potter movies, she has a very small role, so i didn't quite know what to expect from her either. but she was wonderful as dame evie. the part where she swallows the key was absolutely hilarious. overall, an amazing movie.

ben marshall, a teen ager from a religious background, is made aware about the financial situation at home by his domineering mother laura. she suggests him to find a temporary job in order to contribute to the household. in fact the family has taken a widower, to board with them. robert marshall, the father, is a pastor at the local church; he'd much rather be in the country watching birds than tending to the souls entrusted to his church.the job ben applies is with an older actress, evie walton, who wants him to do things for her around the house. "dame" evie, as she calls herself, is a woman of a certain age whose career has died maybe because she was not that great. in fact the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera which was popular but she'd rather forget about it. evie, who is a compulsive liar, tells ben she's dying, only to forget it conveniently, later on when she comes clean to the boy. ben is obviously in awe of the larger than life personality of his employer. he has been taking driving lessons. evie asks him to take a camping trip, which he does against his better judgment. he knows that it will provoke his mother's fury. not content with that, evie decides to go on to edinburgh, where she has been invited to read at an arts festival. it is this trip that solidifies their bond. ben gets to meet and taste the pleasures of the flesh with a sympathetic bryony.when ben gets back, everything crumbles at home. his mother, who has been having an affair with a parishioner, decides to leave the family in favor of the young man she has been having an affair with. ben and evie's relationship survives the test of time. he also begins to see his own father in a different light. jeremy brock, the writer of "driving lessons" and other memorable english films, takes his first directorial job with this engaging comedy. the mixture of show business and religion, loyalty and friendship, are explored in his screen treatment making it a fun time at the movies. we have seen the similar situation before as in "billy elliott", where julie walters plays a nurturing role with a younger man. we had read the film was based on mr. brock's own experience while working dame peggy ashcroft when he was young. julie walters, who plays evie walton, is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie. she always delivers. ms. walters is a welcome presence in any film she appears and she does wonders with her fake "dame". laura linney, a luminous player herself, doesn't quite get our sympathy with her icy mother. rupert grint, famous for his harry potter's movies plays ben, the young man who sees in evie a kind soul. nicholas farrell is the betrayed father. michelle duncan has a small role in which she shines.

lovely. i just love the movie. i want to see this movie because rupert grint is a fantastic actor. his expressions are great, spectacular. the movie was excellent. julie walters it was perfect too. i think that rupert is the only boy with red hair that i love. rupert have a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. i think that the movie was great and was great see rupert in another thing but harry potter. and its a very good actor, so it deserves that and more. he just have a golden globe but probably it deserves an oscar academy award. there are some actors that do not act very well but have a oscar anyway. it does not matter. but he is perfect, brilliant and beautiful

driving lessons is a little film that sneaks up on you. what at first seems to be a bit of fluffy nonsense comedy british style is at its base a very fine story about coming of age and the needs for significant friendship of both the young and the elderly. writer jeremy brock ('mrs. brown', 'charlotte gray', 'the last king of scotland') here directs his own screenplay and the result is a cohesive, progressively involving tale filled with fascinating and diverse characters, each performed by sterling actors.ben marshall (rupert grint, standing firmly on his own as a developing actor post 'harry potter' series) is a quiet, plain little poetic seventeen-year-old living with his bird watching vicar father (nicholas farrell) and his obsessive compulsive, rigid, evangelical do-gooder mother (laura linney) in a home where 'needy people', such as the murderous cross-dressing mr. fincham (jim norton), take precedence over family matters: the mother is by the way having an affair with priest peter (oliver milburn), using ben as her cover! sad ben is among other things attempting to learn to drive a car. his mother is a poor teacher and decides he needs professional lessons and needs to get a job to help pay for poor mr. fincham's needs. ben follows an ad and meets dame eve walton (julie walters), an elderly has-been actress who is as zany as any character ever created. she hires ben and the fireworks begin. through a series of incidents, including a camping trip evie demands they take, the two learn life's lessons missing from each other's natures: ben learns self respect and self confidence and evie finds a true friend who will allow her to drop her stagy facade and be the dear human being she has been hiding.julie walters, always offering the finest skills of acting in every character she creates, finds a role like no other here: she is outlandishly wild and lovable. rupert grint is exactly the right choice for the challenged coming of age ben. the chemistry between the two is as tender as that in the classic film 'harold and maude'. laura linney is as always a superb actress playing a role quite different from her usual repertoire. and the supporting cast is a panorama of fine characterizations. this film is a delightful surprise and one sure to warm the heart and entertain those who love fine writing and direction and acting - and message! grady harp

i found the episodes to be fascinating and well written. as a tv show, it was entertaining which is what i expect from fictional entertainment. i like the "relationship" between the professor and his female security guard ... although sometimes her scottish accent makes it a bit difficult to understand what she is saying. i was hoping that there would be more than just four episodes. i recognize that one commenter/reviewer of this series had comments relating to his opinion as a physician. i understand this gentleman's comments; however, this is a fictional television series which is meant to entertain ... not present precise facts like a documentary. patrick stewart performs well and makes his character believable. if you want to watch a documentary, then this is not the series for you. but if you want to watch unique scientific-based theories in an entertainment-based medium, then you will enjoy the four episodes.

i've just seen a couple of episodes of "eleventh hour", but i must say that they were enough to impress me. this series is just so impressive and interesting... i'm definitely going to follow it.first of all, i must say that the acting is top-notch. patrick stewart plays his character - ian the scientist - believably and coolly, and he makes the audience believe in the character. other characters, such as rachel, are also believable, and, although they sometimes are a little cold - due to the way the series is filmed - they're interesting.the stories told by this series are also interesting. for example, one of the episodes i saw was about cloning, and a man who was trying to clone humans. the way the episode was developed, and how ian - stewart - kept following clues and saving people was amazing. in addition, it made you think about ethics and how good or bad could this be.anyway, i think this is one good tv shows. i just hope it keeps going on like this - interesting, thought-provoking and with good acting. even though it's filmed in a kind of cold way - little lightning, cold photography, lots of close-ups - it never stops being interesting. highly recommendable.

first of all i'd like to start by saying it's a refreshing start to see a british drama that finally looks and feels believable. patrick stewart does the role justice as (ian hood), the government science adviser, with his constant and unwavering views on authority and thoughts about the future of "real world" science and how he feels it's either being used or abused by others. not only is the casting thoroughly maintained all the way throughout the series, but it makes it's characters seem more believable than most other british drama's. ashley jensen also delivers a first rate performance as dr. hood's appointed bodyguard (rachael young), she brings a refreshing take on the unscientific, uninterested everyday views of science, and her constant battling with hood makes for some very funny and memorable moments between them.the way the series keeps all the scientific elements more realistic i find positive and more engaging than the psychobabble we are so used to in other fiction or science fiction tv shows. there are however notable disappointments with the series, every time an episode ends i find myself disappointed that they didn't seem to cover all aspects of the plot and sometimes leaving open-ended stories unclosed. although bearing in mind that this is still the first series, i hope that we see a return to form in the near future where these open ended stories can finally be given a significant conclusion they so rightly deserve.for those who enjoy more slow paced science related plot lines, this is the ideal show to watch as it always manages to stay believable and more importantly to the point.

watch the beguiled because it's a good place to begin when you study the femmes fatales in clint eastwood's filmography.the smothering gothic sexuality of the beguiled has already been discussed. what everyone missed is the synchronized sexual physiology that occurs in a group of females living together, especially when a man is introduced into the group. they all become horny and then bitchy at the same time.femme fatal filmography for clint eastwood: inger stevens, hang 'em high, 1968; jean seberg, paint your wagon, 1969; shirley maclaine, two mules for sister sara, 1970; geralding page, the beguiled, 1971; jessica walters, play misty for me, 1971; sondra locke, sudden impact, 1983; genevieve bujold, tightrope, 1984; marsha mason, heartbreak ridge, 1986; burnadette peters, pink cadillac, 1989; and the best heart-breaker of all, meryl streep, the bridges of madison county, 1995.

"the beguiled" is a strange work among clint eastwood's oeuvre. by 1971 he had become well known as the star of action movies, not only westerns (the genre in which he first made his name) but also war films (such as "where eagles dare") and cop thrillers (such as "coogan's bluff"). yet although "the beguiled" takes place during wartime (the american civil war), and was made by don siegel who had earlier directed eastwood in "coogan's bluff" and was later the same year to direct him in "dirty harry", it is not an action film in the traditional sense. in most of his previous films eastwood had played an active role, but here his role is largely passive- his character, sergeant john mcburney, is a wounded fugitive forced to rely upon the charity of women in order to survive. even while serving with his unit, mcburney played no active part in the conflict; he is a quaker, whose religious principles forbid him to bear arms, and was serving with the union forces as a medical orderly. the film is set in louisiana towards the end of the war and starts with the injured mcburney being discovered by a young girl named amy and brought back to her boarding school. the school is a small one, with only two teachers and a handful of girls. although some of the girls are ardent supporters of the confederate cause and want to hand him over to the authorities, the headmistress, martha farnsworth, decides to shelter him and tend him, fearing that his injuries are likely to prove fatal should he be sent to one of the confederacy's notoriously harsh prison camps. although mcburney scrupulously follows the teachings of his religion as regards pacifism, he is not so scrupulous when it comes to following its teachings on the sin of fornication, and as he starts to recover he makes full use of his opportunity to exercise his charms on both the staff and the older girls, and he wins the affections of number of them, including miss farnsworth, her assistant edwina and carol, one of the older girls. even twelve year old amy appears to have a sort of childish crush on him. in the sexually repressed atmosphere of the all-female school his presence gives rise to jealousy and hatred, and miss farnsworth, rejected in favour of the sluttish carol, plots a terrible revenge. (interestingly, the one female to resist mcburney's blandishments is hallie, miss farnsworth's black slave, even though he tries to win her round by pointing out that he is fighting to free people like her). "the beguiled" has been described as an anti-war film, but this seems to me to be a misconception. the film is not really about the rights and wrongs of the civil war or of war in general. the only acts of violence we see are perpetrated by non-combatants, and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge, not by zeal for the confederate cause. it would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about the psychological stresses that can be caused by the peculiar circumstances of war. at the beginning the school, set in a beautiful old antebellum mansion, seems like an island of peace amid the war. the building is in the classical style, associated with order, harmony and restraint, but the story that unfolds within its walls is one of disorder, passion and violence, qualities associated with the gothic school of writing which in the 19th century was often regarded as the antithesis of classicism. the film can be seen as falling within what has been called the "southern gothic" tradition in american film and literature. the film was not a great hit at the box office, possibly because eastwood was cast so much against type. it is not perhaps his best film, but it did show that he could expand his range and play something other than action heroes. (in "play misty for me", his first film as director made the following year, he was again to play a "passive" character in danger from a vindictive female). there are some very good performances from the female members of the cast, particularly geraldine page as martha farnsworth, outwardly a respectable middle-aged spinster but inwardly a woman of strong passions. (there are hints that she may have been having an affair with a man whom she passed off as her brother). there are also good contributions from elizabeth hartman as the shy, repressed edwina, who falls in love with mcburney and rejects the idea of revenge and from young pamelyn ferdin as amy. (amy is an animal lover- a key moment in the film comes when mcburney kills her pet turtle- so it is interesting that in later life ferdin became an animal rights activist). the one character i was less keen on was jo ann harris's carol who seemed too modern, like a swinging seventies chick transported back in time to the 1860s. the film is notable for the emotionally intense "hothouse" atmosphere which siegel brings to it. this will not be a film which is to everyone's taste; some will find it too overwrought and melodramatic, and some have found it misogynistic. (judith crist called it a film for "woman haters and sadists"). others, however, may find it a compelling psychological drama. 7/10

the biggest tragedy surrounding this thoroughly delightful movie is its lack of u.s. distribution. i was fortunate enough to see this film at the boston international festival of women's cinema, and highly recommend it to anyone who gets a chance to see it. terrific performances, and thoughtful script and great direction from the talented and funny rose troche all combine to make this film a winner!

this is a thoroughly enjoyable, well-acted film. it is funny and sometimes hilarious. the finale is a bit disappointing, since it tries to wrap everything up into too neat a package. the film is better remembered for its priceless vignettes: the jane austen staging, the camping trip as examples. b & h does not attempt to mirror the predominant attitudes toward homosexuality and bisexuality. most of the characters are quite accepting of sexual diversity. in that sense it is a joyous vacation from homophobic society. and it is a celebration of a flexibility, a loosening of rigid sexual categories--perhaps a happy harbinger of things to come.

though i saw this movie dubbed in french, so i'm sure it lost something in the translation, lack of accents, etc., it was an excellent, fun movie for a lonely night in a hotel room--a real pick-me-up that portrayed accurately and positively the complexities of individual sexuality, gender role, and finding a place within the communities to which one is supposed to belong--male, gay, urban, 30-ish, etc. i was very proud of french television for showing such an honest and positive portrayal of the gay community. while the fact that the gay lead character ends up somewhat "straight" in the end is mildly disappointing, that's life, and that happens sometimes. this is a great movie, whether alone or with a date! a really enjoyable experience.

ok, i don't kid myself that this is the typical gay love life but since when are straight romances in real life as they are on the screen? this movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself. it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren (tom hollander). and having seen him in priscilla, queen of the desert only the day before, he is probably one of the most secure-in-their-masculinity actors around. :) anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot. thumbs up! 8/10

this was laurel and hardy's last silent film for roach studios. however, since the public had a real thirst for "talkies", this same short was re-made by the team just a few years later with only a few small plot changes. laughing gravy was essentially the same plot except that stan and ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlord--not a goat like in angora love. this whole goat angle is the worst part of the film. while you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog (after all, it is snowy outside), why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless. according to the plot, the goat followed them home and so they got tired of shooing it away and kept it. huh?! this just doesn't make any sense--if it had been a giraffe or a cow, would they have done the same thing?! apart from being an unconvincing plot, the movie itself is pure laurel and hardy, with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians. this film features quite a few laughs, but unfortunately isn't one of their better films to wrap up their silent careers. this aspect of their careers just seems to have ended with a whimper.

whenever an idea was successful during those "golden days" of the silent movies, you could bet your bottom dollar that it would be repeated; although "reworking" is the term that is used. of course one could make the argument that this reworking business has never left us, for success in the movies or tv always leads to a trend; with all competing parties vying to come up with their own version of said hit movie or tv program.to this last premise we strongly disagree; for this is copycatting or plagiarism, plain and simple.this, the last silent laurel & hardy short, surely must have been quite well received; for angora love (hal roach/mgm, 1929) was reworked on the roach lot, not once, but twice over the next three years. we were treated to laughing gravy (roach/mgm, 1931), in which the goat was replaced with a cute, little puppy-dog. also, the weather is transformed into the dead of winter, in the middle of a blizzard. they also made other line-up changes with substituting landlord edgar kennedy with landlord charlie hall.the second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 reeler, the chimp (roach/mgm, 1932), which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct circus, to which stan and babe were former employees. the circus paid off its employees with their assets and the boys received the chimpanzee as their final payday.back to our original 'victim', today's subject, angora love. recomember? the short starts off simply enough. the boys encounter the goat on the street and the nanny in return follows them back to their rooming house; after stan feeds a doughnut to her. the comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between l & h and slow-burn exponent, edgar kennedy, their landlord. the incident's impact is amplified by having the interplay occur at night. and as luck would have it; their room is situated directly above the landlord's quarters.in addition to the noise, the bathing of the goat, its odor and landlord edgar's suspicions about laurel & hardy's having another person illegally in the room; we were most amused by a little throw-away gag, which may well have been missed by the censors. while admonishing the boys about the noise they'd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized person's being in there overnight, regardless of their sex.its camera shot is made from inside the boy's room, over their shoulder. with edgar in the hall and facing them, he warns; "remember, this is a respectable establishment!" just as he says this, a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the landlord; followed by a uniformed sailor, who cocks his hat forward as they pass! poodle schnitz!!

no this is not an ed wood movie. "angora love" is stan laurel's and oliver hardy's last silent movie. the end of an era! in the '20's laurel & hardy left a real mark on the silent movie genre with movies that are still popular and being watched and aired regularly, this present day.it's a shame that this movie is however not among their best.the premise of the movie sounds good and is good. the boys team up with a goat this time, which of course leads them into trouble and for us some hilarious situations to watch. it however at the same time is extremely silly and just totally unbelievable to watch the boys doing comedy stuff with a goat. most of the jokes in the movie still work good but the movie just however never gets truly hilarious or memorable. the comedy and story really feels lacking at times and is mostly too simple and predictable.of course still good and fun enough to watch for the fans but still a slightly disappointing last silent laurel & hardy entry.7/10

what are the movies? i mean.. what are movies made for? shootings? killings? no. they are made for life stories and this is what this movie does. it presents how the life has changed between two ages. the father and a son, the father being in a need of a job and asking the son for help.although there is another generation, there are some characteristics which remain including the caress for the family.the main subject is, in my opinion the love of the son to the father and vice-versa.the movie is consisted of only one dialog but that dialog is more than i could ever wanted. this movie is a pure art! once again, after "marfa si banii", cristi puiu delivers us another beautiful movie. well done !

this short movie intends to focus on one issue sociologically known as cultured shock. the film presents the condition of average romanian in democratic romania who finds out that the life and the problems are not different from communist period, and if you want something, you must bribe around to get it.so, our main character is fired after a long while, he is around 50 and needs to get a similar job, but the only job available is one inferior. he is forced to take it because the lack of money.my opinion is that you have to live in romania so that this movie can be as real and tragic as it seems.

found this movie in a rental store. never heard about it before, but it was a good movie. great acting, and thrilling story line. great kudos to vincent ventresca. he made thomas character very attractive, and brought a special atmosphere to this movie.nj

i am so happy not to live in an american small town. because whenever i'm shown some small town in the states it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies, evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless. in this movie a former doctor, who's just done time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash, directs his steps to the nearest small town - he must have never in his life seen a flick about any small towns - which happens to be the purgatory flats. and, of course, as soon as he arrives there all the hell breaks loose. he meets a blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles a cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and at once falls in love with her. but there is a tiny handicap, she is already married to a very small-time drug dealer who in a minute gets himself shot pitifully not dead. to know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself. i'll just tell you that it's slightly reminiscent of u turn by oliver stone but is a way down in all artistic properties.

my friend took me to a screening of this movie in hollywood and it was awesome! it's a film noir with amazing acting, great script, cool music, the whole thing was very well done and entertaining. don't know if it is getting a release in theaters, but this would be a great date movie or a fun movie to rent if you see it at blockbuster. this is the kind of movie i love, low on budget but big on style and imagination. i hope alexandra holden gets more big parts like she has in this one, she is fantastic.

after spending five years in prison, dr. thomas reed, played by the incomparable vincent ventresca, exiles himself to purgatory flats and winds up tending bar. he soon meets the luscious, angel-faced sunny (alexandra holden). "you are wicked." he tells her. "you have no idea." she replies as she sips her slo comfortable screw and languidly drags on her cig. reed finds himself entwined in the violent troubles of her family and the femme fatale story unfolds set against the desolation and desperation of the oil-drained western town.canny direction. great performances. superb entourage work. and some lust scenes that sizzle like the sun in purgatory.

"purgatory flats", shown on cable recently, is a small movie that packs a lot. harris done directs with style. the screen play by mr. done and diane fine makes a good thriller.if you haven't seen the film, perhaps you would like to stop reading.the film is the story about a young l.a. doctor that made a mistake and lives to pay for it. upon being released from prison he wants to hide in a small town where he feels he will be forgotten. bad choice! what thomas reed finds in purgatory flats is hell in the desert. right after landing a job as a bar tender, thomas meets a pretty young woman, sunny, who, clearly is someone to stay away from. the young doctor is called to help as sunny's boyfriend randy, is gunned down by a drug dealer.we get to know randy's family. his uncle dean appears to be ok, but his brother owen is a loose cannon. every one in the household is connected in more ways than one to the nubile sunny.the performances are fine. vincent ventresca is thomas, the man who should have gone to his l.a. practice instead of making a detour to the small town. alexandra holden is sunny, a young woman with a tremendous ambition to escape her surroundings. kevin alejandro, gregg henry, brian austin play the men in the mecklin family well. nicholas turturro makes also a good contribution as the drug dealer.the film shows a director with promise who will go far judging from this tightly constructed film.

a truly remarkable film that takes you on a journey through your hidden emotions,a deep and enlightening story. the story takes you through the lives and beliefs of gay and religious cultures, with excellent performances from an superb star cast. it will touch the deepest reaches of your emotions, for those who belief that a love that risks nothing, is worth nothing. the film starts with introducing us to the characters that on the surface seem to have everything ,later we find that beneath the surfaces of each character they are looking for a journey of self discovery. we learn from this story that we all must chose the path in life that we are destined to be on despite what difficulties we encounter,an all thumbs up film!!!!!

i loved this film!!! it was so easy to become a part of the characters lives and really feel the emotion they were going through.a film filled with laughs, sarcasm, shocks and upset just a fantastic romantic drama really!the only part i didn't enjoy was in the special features. the behind the scenes commentary was a little off putting. because i'd seen the film before the extras i prefer thinking of the actors like the characters (silly i know) but the actors personality's are very different from the characters they play. but nevertheless its a totally fantastic, spectacular, brilliant film i recommend that anyone who looked at this film and thought hmmmmmmm should i buy it? answer must be a definite yes!

when i was told about this movie i wasn't too happy to see it, although by the end credits, turned out to be one of the best movies i have ever viewed.the movie it self is quite graphic (male to male scenes, you don't see everything) wouldn't be a gay themed movie if there wasn't...the movie is very light hearted with humor and contains some very funny parts. i highly recommend this movie, about 3 quarters through you really feel for the main characters, and this i think brings the whole flick together.once again, very nicely put together.. plus cute mormon.

honestly, at first, i watched this movie because of the gratuitous sex scenes i heard it possesses but by actually watching the film, it just made me realize that there are still good and sensible movies out there. truly, it is one of the most well-crafted and touching movies i've ever watched. i'm a teenage bisexual and the film spoke to me about my predicaments - sex, religion, love, acceptance, etc. it gave me an idea on how to deal with these issues with the help of my self and others around me who love me for who i am. cox really handled the movie well by sprinkling dozes of heart-warming lines and a bit of sexuality in it. it made the movie more interesting. some people compare it to brokeback mountain but i don't agree myself. brokeback mountain has more drama while latter days is well-balanced.

latter days for me was a very moving film, it showed just how hard and disrespected the gay community really is. the film etherizes true passion and really explores the feelings of these two characters, the film holds a real depth of compassion for the gay community, as it really speaks out for the gay man/woman. personally i think it's about high time that the homosexual community of all religions should no longer hold there head in shame, just for being there beautiful self. the film was very much of a eye opener for me as i could not believe how anti homosexual this world really is. even at schools if a kid dislikes something they will refer to it as being "gay". i real hope that more film like this one are made, and that they are not just labelled as a "gay" film but as a love story, as i believe that gay directors should stick up for themselves and tell their story through their eyes.

with the exception of the main character, the acting didn't convince me, but the story was quite good: it's about a love affair between a gay party boy and a young mormon missionary. as you can imagine, such a relationship is quite problematic. the movie is very american and, as such, has some metaphysical undertones to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance. but some story lines are hilarious: one of the main characters asks his gay colleague: "do you believe in god?" and he answers: "Â…you mean: other than madonna?" all in all, the film is not one of my all-time favorites, but the script is really good and i really liked it: it's entertaining and stands up against (religious) prejudice and intolerance. i think this is an important message in our times. since i rated films that i liked less with 9, this is clearly a 10 for me. some people may find this exaggerated, but i think this film deserves it.

i watched it last night and again this morning - that's how much i liked it. there is something about this movie... when the movie was almost over, i was about to cry. i would strongly recommend "latter days" to my friends - it's definitely worth seeing! i agree with those who say that some parts of the movie do not look very realistic. for example, both main characters are totally cute and in perfect physical shape (although, round is also a type of shape:) ). i rarely meet people like this as singles and i have never met any in couples. other parts of the movie, including all those "coincidences", do not look very realistic as well. but, after all it is a movie, not a life story.

i love a cute heartfelt movie with a happy ending. this movie could be considered a drama, bout two characters realizing true love, but the story's so touching and so sweet that in my mind its a romance. granted, the acting is not so great (thats y i didn't give it a 10) but they do the job, and they don't overact (thank god) plus they're cute, but the story's powerful and just plain adorable (some of u pansies will choke up)!!!!!! its a great watch for a love story, but if ur homophobic, stay away! for everyone else, i loved the movie, its soo sweet! i felt its a brokeback on a smaller scale...but with a happy ending....so enjoy!!

for an independent film it scores well with reasonably high production values and a great cast. the acting is uneven but the plot is compelling. we could have used a bit more development of wes ramsey's character, but hey, the guy's fun to look at nonetheless! mary kay place and jacqueline bisset are like icing on the cake.it's not surprising that it was controversial on its release. it presents a less than flattering portrayal of the morman church and its relationship with gays. while, like brokeback mountain, it's about tolerance and accepting one's own life, i found it to be more successful in conveying a positive message. it was more moving, too.

if you've got a box of tissues, a comfy couch, a large bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on a friday night, this is definitely your movie! its romantic, its hot and its challenging. for most of us gay people, religion is just one of those things that we did when we were kids and probably just starred at the alter boy and how cute he was! but in latter days, you see the struggles of being gay when your entire world revolves around belief's which totally contradict being gay. the two main cast members were totally hot, but at the same time managed to capture your heart and even make me 'almost' cry (i have never cried in a movie!), which i thought was quite impressive for a b grade movie. i highly recommend this flick, you will laugh, you will cry (unless your me) and you will definitely drool! i love it so much i even purchased the dvd for my collection. its truly the most beautiful movie ever

i watched this movie on logo television today. i was absolutely enthralled by the powerful messages and plot line within this film. i don't want to spoil it. i will say this, i related to the inner struggle of aaron and his upbringing. as a gay man growing up in a small town, i related so well to the "big secret" and the choices i made. this movie has made a huge impact on me and i plan on buying a copy of it in the very near future for my personal library. i no more than finished the movie and began calling my friends to recommend it. it had that profound of an effect on me. to those who read this comment. watch it. try to have as little distraction as possible. also,keep an open mind. this is not a film that can be viewed like a disney film or the movie of the week. instead, take the time to watch and actively listen to the dialog as well as read between the lines and get involved in the plot. you may find yourself in tears. not since "steel magnolias" have i been moved to tears by a film. this one did just that. thank you to the cast and writer and crew for producing an emotionally charged romantic film about homosexuality and religion. it has been long overdue.

hey guy, this movies is everything about choices. all the times in your life you must pick something or it just pass away... and this movie prove that! of course, life in fact is not like a beautiful picture as this movie shows... it not shows indeed but some may figure that. i'm trying to say it's full of pain, love and deep lessons of live. aaron, the mormon missionary is the real shepherd digging out the thing beautiful deep inside chisthian, the skin feeling guy...it's a great end and you do always believe in fate because it will surprise you in a turn or in other of your live like latter days...big deal watch it!!!

this is an all-around superb film. a moving experience filled with real life emotion. there's lessons to be learned here about love, sex, work, religion and american culture regardless of one's sexual preference.while this film is also a scathing indictment of the mormon's (church of latter day saints) belief system, any conservative faith could easily take its place. but it's a bit ironic that homosexuality is currently condemned by the mormons in no uncertain terms. here's a faith that mandated for generations that believers practice polygamy! and these true believers only gave up this practice because they were forced to do so by the federal government in order for utah to join the union. talk about a unique form of hypocrisy! the sex scenes portrayed in the unrated version are tasteful, and surprisingly brief. there's nothing here that would offend anyone with an open mind.what this film makes so obvious is that homosexuality is perfectly natural to people who are gay, as heterosexuality is to people who are straight! while love and sex are obviously quite different needs, its absolutely beautiful, beyond words, when both occur at the same time between two adults! profound erotic love is one of life's most precious gifts! my congratulations to the filmmakers for a job well done!

excellent performance by mary kay place, steve sandvoss, jacqueline bissett and rebekah johnson. superb story that reels you into the movie, emotional, yet light-hearted. i own this movie, and everyone that i've shared it with, loves it. great for mixed company, 18+ crowd.nice production, not a cheap budget, well organized, and keeps your interest. uses dome newer ideas, for flashbacks, and at one point keeps the viewer at the edge of their seat.no matter what walk of life a viewer is from, they will buy-in to one or more viewpoints in this film.would love to see a sequel!

latter days is a very, very independent movie. and compared to many of today's more modern films, it's lacking on many parts. the shooting seems at times quite amateurish, the dialogues can be a bit chopped up and the characters are not impressively complex. so, don't have too high hopes for this movie, because as i've said, it's very independent. but whatever it lacks in the concrete aspects of the film can be overlooked because of the story's charm! i cannot claim that the plot is outstandingly original, but the story is still beautiful and heart-warming in many ways! it's not about being gay versus being straight, it's about faith, and how you decide to run your own life! it's a silly story, that makes you want to both cry and smile at the same time! so to be honest, latter days is far from perfect, but i truly loved the movie and i highly recommend it! it's very critical towards the religious aspects of our society, and there is homosexuality involved - but approach it with an open mind, and i'm pretty sure that most people will enjoy it as much as myself!

my father took me to see this film when it was released in 1976. i was but a child and it scared the crap out of me. so much so that i had to leave the theatre during a particularly claustrophobic tunnel scene as it was too intense for me!!! i went home to the safety of my family. i saw the film all the way through as i got older and thoroughly enjoyed it. shame about the men in monster suits, though. if you overlook the cheapness of the production and delve deeper, you'll find an excellent performance by cushing, a stunning opening score, some nice photography and the ever reliable mr.douglas mcclure, my childhood hero!british police constables guarding the whitehouse at the end! titty bang bang cave woman! monsters with beaks! actors in monster suits gliding on wires! this has it all! superb.

due to the fact that in 1976 there were no cgi i felt that the movie was quite watchable. the studio productions were very good and very elaborate. the background effects were very believable and always appeared as if they were part of the whole set. the actors did ok considering the premise of the film being set in a type of jules vern atmosphere where imagination and possibilities of future exploration were at most improbabilities. had i watched this film in 1976 i probably would have been in awe of the ability of man to build a machine that could travel to the earths core. i still wonder to this day why we are not all flying around in our cars but i digress. mcclure and cushing have their funny moments, mostly from their facial expressions toward each other which of course makes the film somewhat campy which i loved. the 'monsters' left something to be desired but the story had a good premise although i feel as though some other sort of 'thing' could have been more believable under those circumstances. all in all quite watchable for its time and fun now.

this movie was the second movie i saw on the cinema as a child. it scared the living crap out of me. so much so that i asked my father if we could leave halfway through.nowadays, the only people leaving halfway through are the ones who have a good taste in movies.i, however, still have fond memories of this flawed masterpiece of awfulness. doug mcclure and peter cushing in the same movie! great! monsters made of polypropylene substitute. scary stuff. a rubber monster is, when you think about it, is even scarier than a real monster.the astonishing thing about this movie is how good the score is. truly rousing stuff.there's also plenty of prehistoric tit on show, too. nice.

shame on you if you give this film a low rating. how can you not like a film that has doug mcclure, peter cushing, silly rubber monsters, fights, (and for the guys, that woman that was the baddie's henchwoman in the spy who loved me and one of the seventies sinbad films, not wearing very much of whom my mother said "she wasn't picked for the colour of her eyes"), lava, silly wigs and a daft victorian drilling machine very much like the one used in the old thunderbirds series? whoever watched this film and slagged it off was watching it for the wrong reasons. it may be crap, but is definitely good crap. they don't make 'em like they used to, sigh......

context is everything when one goes to rate a movie. when rating this movie one has to consider the time in which it was made. we didn't really know what the inside of the earth was in those days so you can't rag on the movie too much for the plot (based on a much older book). for the era, this was top notch special effects and the production quality was great. i watched this movie in a masterfully restored hd master. for the time the makeup and effects almost make the guys in the rubber suits look plausible as a monster-thing. this is pure movie cheese complete with bad rubber suits, models, and creepy costumes. awesome. ps doug mcclure rocks!

the main criticism of at the earth's core is that it's cheap, the special effects are bad and so on and so forth. yes, some of the special effects are painfully bad but what a lot of folks overlook about it is that it's actually quite fun, which is very important in my book.in comparison, just look at the latest star wars films: they have the latest, greatest special effects created by the latest technological advances which are capable in creating stunning visual effects as far reaching as the human imagination can imagine and yet, with all the razzle dazzle, those films were as exciting as a funeral. as yoda would say, fun they're not! in other words, who cares if the fx aren't the greatest when the spirit of the film is fast-paced, humorous and clearly set on the side of action. i love everything about at the earth's core: the contrast between stodgy victorian england vs the wild other-worldly, colorful setting of pellucidar, the cast of characters, the concept of a lost underground world, the telepathic pterodactyls, the human slaves rebelling, jubal the ugly one (lol!), the inspired teaming of peter cushing (who's great!) and doug mcclure, the excellent music (it's really good), cinematography by the amazing alan hume and last but not least, caroline munro. she's effing sexy in this movie. one of the sexiest b-movie babes ever captured on screen.seriously, anyone who doesn't like this movie doesn't know what fun is. gimme at the earth's core over any turgid star wars prequels any time! at least it has caroline munro, which no cgi fx can ever recreate.

his john dark-kevin connor fantasy adventures were a mainstay of summer holiday movies in the days before star wars: they weren't masterpieces, they didn't boast state-of-the-art special effects, but they were exactly what an audience of kids wanted from a film back in the mid 70s.at the earth's core catches just the right tone for the appropriately named burroughs' pulp adventure about victorian inventor peter cushing and the inevitable doug mcclure ending up in the underground world of pelucidar and battling its evil telepathic fighting dinosaurs. this time the puppets are gone in favour of men in monster suits, which is a lot more fun if you're willing to suspend your disbelief, and if you're not there's always caroline munro's cleavage to look at. aside from what may well be peter cushing's worst performance, an irritating but dottier rehash of his movie dr who ("you can't mesmerise me, i'm british!"), it's easily the best of the john dark-kevin connor-doug mcclure fantasy adventures, surprisingly well directed and boasting an atmospheric use of colour. never especially good at exterior scenes, alan hume's photography gains immensely from the control a studio set gives him (the film was shot entirely on soundstages) to paint a luridly vivid world worthy of a pulp novel cover. not high art but definitely great saturday matinÃ©e fun.

this film screened at the american cinematheque's egyptian theatre in hollywood on april 7, 1999. it was described in the american cinematheque schedule as follows:"tomorrow is another day 1951, warners, 90 min. steve cochran's an ex-con who's never been with a woman. ruth roman is a dime-a-dance dame with no use for sappy men. a hotel room, a dirty cop, a gunshot - the perfect jump-off for a fugitives-on-the-run love story. this virtually unknown noir is felix feist's masterwork, packed with revelatory set-pieces. cochran was never more vulnerable, roman never sexier. imagine gun crazy scripted by steinbeck - it's that good."i just saw this film, and i agree with every word of the above description.

tomorrow is another day is not the sequel to gone with the wind but a lovers-on-the-lam story, and a surprisingly alert and moving one as well. for a supposed hack relegated to b-minus features like the devil thumbs a ride, felix feist proves adept at filling his work with unexpected, inventive details. steve cochran leaves prison after 18 years for killing his brutal father when he was only 13, and now he's still a tentative, gawky pubescent operating inside a man's hulky frame. lonesome, he visits a 10-cents-a-dance palace and falls for brassy, grasping ruth roman. but the sudden shooting of her police-bigwig boyfriend causes the ill-matched couple to hit the road, ending, like the joads, in a california migrant-worker camp. roman's the revelation; in her best-known role, as farley granger's fiancee in hitchcock's strangers on a train, she was ill- and under-used. here she modulates persuasively from bottle-blonde taxi dancer to sacrificing wife and mother-to-be (and a brunette, to boot). cochran's almost as good, waffling between the suspicion of a wounded child and the explosive reactions of an under-socialized male. and the ending, while unconvincing, is nonetheless welcome. along with they live by night and gun crazy, tomorrow is another day displays a redeeming sweetness and warmth that belie its film-noir pedigree.

this documentary on dinosaurs was undoubtedly fascinating and very well made. however, i found myself watching many of the bits with unease. the film generally took a rather confident stand on anything it said and showed, but inevitably much of the behaviour of the beasts, their interaction with each other, what they looked like, how they moved, what they ate etc. much of that is surely guessing - sometimes guessing with reasonable confidence, sometimes just wild guessing. but the viewer is never made aware of that, the film pretends to actually observe real dinosaurs and their real behaviour etc. that makes probably better viewing than confronting the audience with mountains of disclaimers, but it makes it just a bit too populist in my estimation.

this movie is well done. it really attempts to show what the dinosaurs had to contend with in their daily lives. the animation is very well done and the film makers have done a great job of giving scientific fact in such a way that it is entertaining. this is a great movie.

spoiler warningi got this dino-documentarie on dvd at christmas 2004. i had longed to see it and was by no means disappointed. the score is memorable ( myfavourites were the "sauropod" theme song and the "winters coming" song ). the effects were dazzling, you could almost believe they were there. you actually learn something too ; stegosaurs may have been able to pump their plates with blood. female t-rexes might have gone on a killing spree before laying their eggs. i know there's a lot of people who thought this was based too much on speculation, but there will always be questions that we can only guess at. and there is a lot of hard-core, undeniable fact as well. we know that some dinosaurs travelled in herds, we know that diplodocus swallowed stones to grind up vegetation in their stomaches. despite this "speculation" the series did extremely well. so well in fact, that it spawned a followup, a prequel and several specials. if you're a dino-fan, then this is for you. it makes jurassic park look small and weedy.

(r#88) brilliant, very entertaining show with spectacular effects. any fan of these prehistoric reptiles has to see this. the cgi blends in extremely well with the environment and it's just plain fun to watch these giants walk about their daily business as casually as on discovery channel. this show was a stroke of genius and it blows its followers "walking with beasts" and "the future is wild" out of the water.the greatest episode was definitely the last, where we got to watch the final days of the tyrannosaurus rex and the meteor strike that became their doom. this stuff is almost too awesome for television. how about a theatrical release? i would pay anything to see these dinos in the cinema.if you're in the mood for a show that manages to be spectacular, engaging and educational at the same time, this is for you. dinosaurs have never been cooler.

walking with dinosaurs is an amazing documentary, educational for both the ignorant of dinosaurs and dinosaur-lovers (like myself) alike. i admit, i was very young when i saw this on discovery, but i was obsessed with it immediately. (spoliers!!!!!) the series contains 6 episodes, going from the late triassic when dinosaurs were just first evolving to the late cretaceous, at the end of reign of the dinosaurs. when i first saw this film, it was like i really had traveled back in time. the majesty of the diplodocus, the adventures of opthalmosaurus, and the caring mother version of t-rex all astounded my family and me. it is an amazing film, and i believe that bbc managed to do just what they set out to do. awesome job!

this series when the dinosaurus lived for 65 million years ago. the dinosaurus looks very real and are very realistic when they moves. it is also very interesting how the climate changes.i am very interesting in how the dinosaurs lived and died. i am also interesting in how the dinosaurs behaved.the color of the dinosaurs is also interesting to see and discovered. they think which color they had.the most interesting is why the dinosaurs died and what happened after that.bbc have made a brilliant series how the dinosaurs lived and died!

i like tom hanks, and he is one of few actors who will draw me into the theatre regardless of any misgivings i may have concerning the film. i worried about mr. hanks return to "light comedy" as this is the arena where he made the transition from tv to film- remember "big"? well, "charlie wilson's war" is not light comedy. it is political satire, and extremely well-written political satire at that. the script is the star of this film, and the word-smithing by aaron sorkin is some of the best on offer this year.mike nicols holds the entire escapade together, delivering a film that zips along in a very quick 90 minutes (timing is everything in comedy, and nothing is ever funny if it drags). nicols' choice in sets and lighting are also very reminiscent of '70's and '80's tv, a move used deliberately to root the piece in period.the return to the use of model work and stock photography over digital special effects also enhances the retro look and believability. note to the production designers in your choice of stock footage: i know the difference between an f-16 and a mig, and a bell and a hind. but that may have been part of the joke, too.i saw this film in philadelphia. it was interesting to watch and listen to the audience not get the historical references to their own history. history tends to repeat because the recidivists have forgotten what happened the first time around.kudos to both mr. hanks and that chameleon phillip seymore hoffman. sorkin's script is brought to life by these actors, and the entire production team is on the top of their game.heartily recommended.

told in flashback, the film opens in 1989 with charlie being given award for his role in the defeat of communism. i must admit my heart sank as at the thought of have to endure yet another earnest, somewhat boring and overlong life story. how wrong was i, because that short scene is as close as the film ever gets to boring.the film is full of entertaining & amusing set ups and cracking dialogue in some of the most unexpected places. the next scene after the awards ceremony is charlie in a hot-tub with some naked women and a guy trying to get him to invest in a tv programme. another rather amusing scene is about 3 quarters into the film comprises charlie, a group of his rather sexy secretaries, phillip seymour hoffmans cia man and a bottle of whisky. as to dialogue what about this for a line, "the senator says, he can teach us to type but can't teach us to grow tits.". ok, school-boyish i know but the film is laced with great lines.as to performances well phillip seymour hoffman as usual steals every scene he's in. hanks is ok but surprisingly to me anyway was julia roberts who is very good in the role of a rather eccentric texas oil millionairess.charlie wilson's war is one of the best non musician bio-pics in a long while as well as being that rare thing a film that entertains, amuses as well as informs all in equal measure.

it doesn't happen very often, but occasionally one man can make a difference -- a big difference.george crile's 2003 best seller, charlie wilson's war, is a fascinating and eye-opening account of the most unlikely "difference maker" imaginable. a relatively obscure congressman from the second district of texas, "good time charlie" was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation. likable and licentious (even for a politician), charlie wilson served his constituency well since the good folks of lufkin only really wanted two things, their guns and to be left alone. it's easy street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known, appropriately enough, as charlie's angels.when asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive, young aides his response is a classic, "you can teach 'em to type, but you can't teach 'em to grow tits." no argument there.but even the most rakish rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath, and for charlie wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter, humiliating defeat of the russian military and, possibly, to even help hasten the end of the cold war as a result. fat chance, huh?under the skillful direction of mike nichols and a smart, snappy screenplay by adam sorkin, charlie wilson's war is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind-the- scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising "charlie's team."the on-screen "team," is composed of three marvelous actors with four (4) academy awards and nine (9) nominations between them. charlie is beautifully portrayed by tom hanks in a solid, slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years. he's aided, abetted and abedded by joanne herring, a wealthy houston socialite played by the still-slinky julia roberts. hey, why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this? by all accounts ms. roberts looks good and holds her own, but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why kabul and country is so important to her character. maybe the two afghan hounds usually by her side know -- but we as an audience never do. as for the third member of the "team," philip seymour hoffman steals every scene he appears in as gust aurakotos, a smart, street- wise (i.e. non ivy league graduate) cia malcontent who knows the score -- both in the agency's boardroom and in wilson's bedroom.for the mujahideen to succeed, the most important assistance the u.s. can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded mi-21 helicopter gunships which rule the skies. this takes money, lots of money, and eventually "charlie's team" covertly coerces those in congress to fund the effort to the tune of $1 billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the afghan rebels. this includes top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices. nasty, nasty stuff.that this kind of multi-billion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind congressional doors is truly alarming. every american should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business-as-usual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government. oh momma, i wish it weren't so...even though the initial outcome for "team charlie" was an unqualified success, the unimaginable, unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the taliban and others. since the funding was entirely "covert," the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of soviet oppression and the end to russian barbarity was the direct result of american intervention. yes, once the russkies left, so did our aid -- zip for schools, zip for infrastructure, zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the afghan people. as a result, the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster -- it's like the forerunner to "mission accomplished."as nichol's film so pointedly points out, "the ball you've set in motion can keep bouncing even after you've lost interest in it." mike krzyzewski knows this, eva longoria parker knows this, little lateesha in lafayette knows this, but the typical american politician doesn't. so we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn't let the world know we were the good guys. talk about a catch-22 (another mike nichols film).perhaps charlie wilson said it best, "we f&%ked up the end game."again.

mike nichols in finest form. i was not a fan of "closer", so it's refreshing to see him again right back on top with this comedy set in the darkest of circumstances. just one slip in tone could have wrecked this compelling picture but nichols and his very strong a-list cast never put a foot wrong in this biopic of a deeply flawed but utterly compelling congressman.philip seymour hoffman as usual is scintillating and brilliant - here playing a damaged but ultra-smart cia manipulator, and it is in the exchanges between hanks and hoffman's characters where the comedy soars. rarely is movie humour laugh-out loud and also smart... this hits the spot time after time with a biting satirical edge that makes you both laugh and weep at the state of the world (often simultaneously).one other major plus is the length of the picture. the film is based on george crile's fat book of the same title. the temptation for screenwriter aaron sorkin (his claim to fame is "the west wing") must have been to make a fat movie, but what we get is a breath-taking 90 odd minutes of great story with sweeping implications.this film deserves to be seen and to be recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest of dark subject matter and the lightness of touch of it's sparkling witty script - even if it does flunk the obvious link between the help that herring and wilson provide and the ultimate consequences (9/11).

this film grabs you from the opening scenes and never lets go. you watch indulgently upon viewing janos szaby's excitement over coming to america. he's a likable fellow. you cannot help being fond of him even when his eagerness is replaced by bitterness as his fortunes turn. you know that in his circumstances,you would be forced to make the same choices he does to survive. this movie comments on society's worship of beauty and all things superficial and is only more true in the culture of the twenty-first century. janos himself becomes victim to this philosophy when he tells his blind girlfriend "you're young and beautiful; if you could see, you would have the world." and like many a modern gangster movie, when her safety is threatened, he extracts a powerful revenge. his innocence is not altogether lost however for he demands an equally high price of himself, knowing he deserves his fate.peter lorre is in fine form in this starring role. only a few actors could convincingly accomplish this character's transformation from innocent to embittered criminal in sixty nine minutes. lorre is well supported by all the cast making this a real ensemble picture and not just a vehicle for one star. with a bit less preachy dialogue, this movie would be a 10. highly recommended.

this film stars peter lorre as an exceptionally nice guy who immigrates to america. unfortunately, shortly after his arrival, he's in a horrible fire and his face is horribly burned. because he looks so awful, no one wants to hire him and out of sheer desperation, he resorts to a life of crime in order to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his ugliness. where exactly the film goes from there, you'll just need to see for yourself.i scored this movie an 8 because, for the money spent to make it, it's a heck of a good film with a lot of good twists in the plot to keep it interesting. the film could have degenerated into a simple horror or crime film, but it goes far beyond this an offers some genuine surprises. in addition, the excellent acting by lorre shows that he was capable of more than just supporting roles. this is an excellent film and delivers more than most "a-pictures" of the day.

peter lorre turns in one of his finest performances as a hungarian watchmaker coming to the united staes to make a new life for himself and someday bring his girl across the big pond to be with him. lorre's infectious optimism and bright outlook come off very effectively which makes the performance all the better when he has his face hideously burned in a hotel fire and, when no one will give him a chance to work, turns reluctantly to a life of crime. lorre's range as an actor is seldom as apparent as in this movie with his jovial, good-natured immigrant, to his depressing, melancholic, disfigured self searching for the truth behind what he believed america afforded him, to his suave, intelligent, better-than-your-average hood, to his sympathetic dealings with a blind woman with whom he falls in love. the story is well-paced, has some interesting twists, and gives lorre many opportunities to shine. director robert florey does a quality job behind the lens, and all of the supporting cast help aid the film with evelyn keyes giving a particularly good turn as the blind girl. i loved the ending - and the truth - that was shone to exist in lorre's character despite all the negative things society had done toward him. for a little b picture, the man behind the mask is good movie-making for its time.

i caught this a few times on tv in the late 1970s. it only played late at night (past midnight).peter lorre plays a kind, happy man whose face is disfigured in a fire. he is rejected by his girlfriend and left alone and filled with despair. he turns to a life of crime and eventually becomes very successful. he makes a mask to hide his disfigured features and falls in love with a beautiful girl (evelyn keyes)...who is blind! he tries to go straight for her...but he can't escape his life of crime or his hatred of his own scarred face.a no budget b film. very short (runs only a little over an hour) but well made and superbly acted by lorre. this has a lot more depth than you would expect from a quickie b picture. ankers especially takes the thankless "girl" role and makes her character fresh and appealing. this has sadly disappeared from tv and was never put on video or dvd (as far as i know). tcm did show it recently and it was great to see the movie still holds up.highly recommended.

this movie starts off as a college t'n'a flick, but turns pretty ugly after the main character's sister is gang raped by a biker gang driving a van. it has a pretty good pace, and james van patten does a pretty good job in this cannon tax write-off movie. this was the first movie i ever saw at the parkway drive-in, here in toronto. the main feature was "alphabet city", and "young warriors was the added feature. out of the 2 movies, "young warriors" was by far more entertaining and memorable. if you are a fan of blow 'em up, excessively violent movies, this one would make a great addition to any collection.

young warriors (1983) while this is a deeply flawed (and in some ways idiotic) movie, the way it continually defies expectations makes it decent viewing for the adventurous sleaze fan.meet yuppie college student kevin and his gang of lovable frat boy buddies. in what starts out as a particularly egregious teen sex comedy, we follow this bunch of jerk-offs and their antics, which involve, among other things, making pledges tie bricks to their genitals. the movie abruptly shifts gears when kevin's high school freshman sister is brutally raped and beaten into a coma by a gang of bikers who apparently have nothing better to do. when she dies in the hospital, kevin vows revenge, much to the chagrin of his detective father.so far, we've gone from porky's-lite, through last house on the left territory, into what is apparently shaping up to be your typical urban vigilante revenge flick. however, kevin and his gang's portrayal goes from vaguely sympathetic until they become kill-crazed lunatics. it's to the film's credit that it doesn't glamorize the fascist anti-crime rhetoric that kevin continually spouts, while still making it understandable that he would feel the way he does.the mood goes from lighthearted to grimy and downbeat very quickly, and by the end it's so over the top and exploitative that it'll leave you incredulous. and that's the strength of this film. you never know what to expect next.at over 100 minutes, it's a little lengthy for this kind of fare, but you won't get bored. poorly acted for the most part, with cardboard cutouts for characters and some particularly ludicrous situations and rather stupid dialogue, this won't be topping anyone's list of forgotten classics anytime soon. i got a kick out of it though, and i'm sure anyone reading this knows if they're up for it.

now, i realize that most people on here trash young warriors or hail it as "so bad it's funny" type entertainment, but let me make something clear: it's actually a quality piece of low rent action, if you're willing to watch such cinema without a critical eye. in fact, it's a good deal more entertaining and thought provoking than the bulk of the action films of the 80s.the key is in the film's subject matter. i'm always a sucker for movies that tackle the subject of vigilantism, especially when they ambitiously probe into the psyches of the characters involved. young warriors may not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first death wish film (and yes, i do think the first one had both of those elements), but it's trying to be different from the run-of-the-mill cannon films of the period in that it's genuinely unique.the plot is simple (don't worry, there won't be spoilers): a group of college student pranksters change their ways when one of their family members is assaulted by a tough street gang. the students take to the streets in an effort to combat general street crime, being that they don't know who the gang responsible is. they eventually acquire some heavy artillery (machine guns and grenades) and prowl the night fully armed. however, these are not schwarzenegger types; they're vulnerable, inexperienced novices who make sizable blunders nearly each time they set out to clean up the city (usually with their frat mascot dog in tow). they finally figure out who the gang is and go after them, but by then you won't be expecting a standard climax in which the good guys walk away unscathed.one thing about the film that struck me as strange yet effective is that the bulk of the first act offers no indication that we'll be seeing any action or violence later on as it's treated like a goofy frat comedy you'd see on usa's up all night (where i believe this was actually shown at one point). the comedy set-up actually lulled me into forgetting that the vhs cover showed a guy riding a motorcycle with a machine gun strapped to his back. then, when the violence finally arrives, it's not fun or cute at all... it's shockingly disturbing. from that point on the film becomes a full blooded, uncompromising action yarn containing some startling gunfights and gore.the acting, while nothing special, is far more impassioned than i anticipated. james van patten, who plays the protagonist, gives his all and his performance is surprisingly good for this type of movie. the rest of the cast is equally invested, including the always dependable ernest borgnine as the hero's cop father. the cinematography is also above par and the action scenes are handled with a level of severity that i personally wasn't expecting.i can understand why some people thought this movie was worthless as much of it is extremely dated, but those facets struck me as nothing short of cool in and of themselves. van patten's character is studying animation and his patently early 80s style work that's on display in several scenes is a retro film lover's psychedelic wet dream. i'm sure most contemporary viewers would cite those very moments as low points in the movie, but i disagree. also, joe walsh's soundtrack - which sounds like it could have only been recorded in '83 - seemed particularly fitting and enjoyable, regardless of how "old" it seems today.young warriors is one of my favorite action films of the 80s and i highly urge anyone interested in the genre to take a look. sadly, however, it's only been released on vhs as of this writing, and it isn't being shown on tv these days. a nice dvd presentation would make me moon-walk around my living room with such intensity that i'm sure my ankles would swell. in the meantime, i implore you all to go on ebay or amazon and cough up the ten bucks or whatever for the old big-box tape. it really is a remarkable staple of ambitious trash cinema.

like most sports movies, it's not surprising that people who know something about the sport can find flaws in it. as a soccer referee, i have yet to see a movie or tv show get it right when depicting a match. "forever" has good actors, but i found sean astin to be a bit young to be an administrator in a juvenile jail. i was very thankful that the plot did not involve the lead character turning his fellow inmates into rugby players and taking on flagstaff as well as highland. which gets to credulity: a police squad car just happens to pull up at precisely the time the flagstaff baddies are hazing rick penning. even though rugby is not a sanctioned high school sport nationally, the team is a school-based club sport -- much like rodeo. that said, i find it hard to believe that high school officials would allow students to play with open wounds: that just isn't done in this day of aids and hepatitis. i don't care what the tradition and macho image is. despite that, it was a cool movie in that teens were expected to act like adults (and sometimes actually did). sadly, far too many coaches are like flagstaff's -- or worse.

the movie forever strong will never be nominated for an oscar, it will never be nominated for best acting, for best motion picture. but this movie does have things that other movies don't. in a nation with so much scandal, so many problems, movies being poured out with little thought to the morals of society, at least this movie promotes good. what is wrong with standing behind something that promotes happiness? we should support movies that tell our american teens that there is more to life than sex drugs and alcohol. as for this haka debate as previously stated, the hakka is not exclusive to the new zealand all blacks, various utah high school football teams and colleges perform this ritual before games. including hawaii, byu, etc.

i am huge movie enthusiast and also an active rugby player who believes that rugby is the greatest game ever played. forever strong is a mix of coach carter and sloppy rugby. this movie is full of great acting, well developed characters and in action shots that will have you ducking and dodging in your seat, but with more arm tackles than pee wee football and almost every shot cuts away as soon as a player touches the ground its filmed to almost seem like football. if you want to bring your kids to see a movie that will build character from within and could inspire a blind man to see again i can easily give it 9 out of 10, if you want to see a great rugby movie that truly shows the sport your going to have to wait for the next one because forever strong is mostly practice, running, and a one ruck film, for this i give it a 7.75 out of 10.

i wonder how someone could diss on this movie. it is based on an actual story. it is not necessarily about "rugby" itself so to the one that posted on here that they need to make a "real" rugby movie, you missed the point. this is not another typical sports movie where a team sucks, they hire emilio estevez and turn the team around and win the championship and give everyone the warm and fuzzies. it focuses on a story. it shows how someone can change his or her life for the better. the movies now days are all about sex, drugs, partying etc. that is hollywood. i am a big fan of movies, but i have to say this was an inspirational movie with a great message. if you consider yourself a "tough guy" don't watch the movie, it won't live up to your standards. if you want to watch a good, inspirational movie, this is a good one.

i wanted to see this movie ever since the previews came out. i don't understand why everyone is so hard on this film. it may not all be technically true to the sport of rugby, but this film is not mainly about the sport. it's about a rugby team that is taught how to be more than the world expects of them. they are taught to become men, and not temporally vain boys. hollywood is never 100% correct in their productions. they are there to make a product that sells. something entertaining. the story of coach gelwix and what he has taught over the years is simply amazing. he teaches about service, honor, integrity, and moral cleanliness. how many other movies are teaching that to our youth these days? i was proud to see such an amazing story that taught reverence and respect.

my family truly enjoyed this movie. as far as what this movie will do for rugby in the usa...well i am sure that will be debatable. but as for me and others around me, i know that we were more curious about the sport after seeing the movie and i personally gained more respect for the game. you may wonder how this possible, especially since the movie does not dive in and explain rugby. but the simple fact is it drew you into the players and emotion of the game and life. the film was inspirational as well as entertaining. it made us laugh and cry. the chemistry between sean astin, big budah and sean faris worked well. some may think the movie is a little clichÃ©, but i seriously wish hollywood made more movies like this. i couldn't help drawing analogies of the game and life's struggles. at the end of it i found myself examining my own life to see what i needed to do better, in order to be the best person i could be. honestly i was grateful this movie taught morals, values and teamwork, there is so much to the contrary. after watching this i really hope my kids are coached by someone who has a philosophy like coach gelwix.

a very positive message for our youth is shown in this movie. through the sport of rugby as a mean, a high school rugby coach leads his players in their behavior and lifestyle, on and off the field. the acting and directing are good. the rugby shots are just ok if you know some rugby or really cool if don't know much about it.i recommend this movie, worth watching, especially at a point in time when this sport is gaining more and more adepts every day.the plot is based on a true story taking place in utah. the coach portrayed in this movie has been at the helm of the highlanders for over 30 years (and loosing only game every 3 years). enjoy!

i love a film that mixes edge-of-the-seat suspense, laughs, style, good acting, and a bit of self-parody. hitchcock consistently carried this off, and in "le cercle rouge" jean-pierre melville does the same. i was sorry when this long film ended. i agree with the english commenter who found remarks by one of my compatriots chauvinistic. i love french films, italian films, english films, indian films--and the increasingly rare good american films. i also feel the writer who panned the film for being not even a good copy of an american gangster film, missed the point completely. but i guess it's like jazz: either you get it, or you don't, so why waste time trying to explain.just see "le cercle noir" and be prepared to be deliciously entertained.

there were heist movies before this one, and indeed the likes of rififi were an obvious influence on it - but the red circle is more than just another entry in an overpopulated genre and with this film, director jean-pierre melville has managed to create something that both thrills on the surface and gives its audience something to think about. being cool is just as important a feature of the modern crime movie as guns and gangsters, and melville delivers that with this film in droves; the tone of the film is very relaxed too and melville allows the bulk of the film to bubble under the cool exterior. the story has a number of angles but the central character is corey - a thief who is released from prison. his release coincides with the escape of infamous murderer vogel, who slips from under the nose of police commissioner mattei during a train ride. the first thing corey does upon release is steal some money from his former boss rico, and the second thing he does is recruit vogel and a sharpshooter to help him pull of a jewel heist. but rico and the police are hot on the thieves' tails...the film is bolted together by four excellent central performances. alain delon is calm and calculating as the film's anti-hero, while gian maria volontÃ¨ looks formidable in his role as the escaped murderer. franÃ§ois pÃ©rier is good also as a dubious club owner, while the real standout performance comes from andrÃ© bourvil in his role as the police commissioner. the film runs at almost two and a half hours and is not exactly a thrill ride. however, the director keeps things interesting by keeping the action focused on the important elements. the film does feature crime film stapes such as shootings, but they are kept to a minimum. the first two thirds of the movie are really just building up to the suspenseful heist scene towards the end. rififi was most famous for its heist sequence - an intricately designed scene in which nobody speaks a word. the heist in this film is similar in that it is also wordless, and i have to say that i preferred the scene in rififi; but melville's skill in direction and the calm and composed way that it plays out make good of it. the film boils down to an exciting climax that rounds it all off nicely. overall, this might not appeal to all crime film fans as the action is more than a little bit slow; but the red circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.

after 30+ years of hiatus, once again i immerse myself in the mist of uplifting melancholy. the cold, slow-paced and existential treatment of this crime story comes from a different world, melville's world, where darkness is pure enlightenment.

meville's caper film is not as good as his most famous movie, the deliciously stylish "le samourai (1968)." i don't even think this is the best example of the much-loved heist subgenre. the main thing against the film is its long running time. meville has this tendency of concentrating on too many trivial details. he could have told the same story in a relative short time, but for reasons that i don't understand, the film seems to go on and on. still, the movie is never boring. melville's direction impressed me and the cast is very good, especially alain delon as a very "cool" master thief. the movie's must-see color photography is a great asset and melville uses sound (or lack of sound) in a very effective manner. from a technical standpoint, the movie is practically flawless. at times, one gets the feeling that meville is merely showing off, but when someone is as talented as he is, one has little reason to complain. i still like other heist movies a little bit more (jules dassin's "topkapi (1964)," just to name one), but there is no denying that this film is a good piece of pulp entertainment and a good example of what people refer to as "cool" cinema.

"all men are guilty," says the chief of the police. "they're born innocent but it doesn't last." add this bit of nihilism to jean-pierre melville's fascination with the idea of the crook's code of honor and you have le cercle rouge. this code of honor among crooks, however, is not simply a clichÃ©; it's a figment of the imagination even when film moralists -- realistic moralists by their viewpoint, romantic moralists by most others' -- began to make movies on the subject. their theme is that it isn't what one does, but how one does it. we most often wind up with stories all about experienced men with their own sense of honor, stories where fate, fatalism and the code run things. for most of humanity, except screen writers and movie directors, this would seriously get in the way of living one's life, raising one's children and being a good friend. this mannered fatalism is something of a self-indulgent notion. le cercle rouge is, in my view, a classic film for people who may secretly enjoy the adventure of just missing the last bus home. but where melville's le samourai - criterion collection, in my opinion, is style dominating story, le cercle rouge manages the great trick of combining style with a strong story and with compelling actors. the point of the movie, in my view, is nonsense...but the movie itself is a first-class experience. melville's hopeless tale of three crooks -- cory (alain delon), vogel (gian-maria volonte) and jansen (yves montand) - is based on a bit of wisdom which is, maybe, attributed to the buddha: that all men who are destined to meet, will...along with their destiny they cannot change. maybe, because some believe melville himself came up with the wording if not the thought. either way, we know right at the start that this movie will not end happily, will depend upon fate and coincidence to set things up for us, and will leave us recalling the nihilistic philosophies we discovered and loved when we were in high school. once corey and vogel meet and then gather in the unique talents of jansen, we are off on a one-way ride to rob an exclusive, heavily protected jewelry story on the place vendome. the tension arises because we not only know the french police are after vogel, we also realize that some determined crooks are after corey. the great pleasure of the movie, for me, came from admiring the work that delon, volonte and montand brought to their characters, and the intelligent ruthlessness that andre bouvril brought to his character, the police captain mattei. melville hooked me as he developed these characters and their own situations; he built me up emotionally and then released me when he brought me to appreciate their probable fate and let me see see it happen. melville establishes his set pieces -- the escape from the train, the escape from the woods, the later shootout in the woods, the meetings with mattei and a man who refuses to inform -- with intriguing possibilities. he builds tension in all these cases by taking his time; a rare trait in movie making and an even rarer trait now. and melville takes the time to build up mattei as an individual. mattei is a rueful, experienced man. he's a loner. he has a set routine when he returns to his apartment -- he greets his three cats affectionately, he draws his bath and while the tub is filling he sets out food for them. i don't know who mattei is destined to meet, but i hope it's someone who likes cats. nihilism is always fashionable among some creative people and some critics. in most cases, i think it's a much harder task to set nihilism aside and to simply live one's life without damaging too many people. (and that's even more challenging to show compellingly in a film.) le cercle rouge is a movie which, for me, tells me little, but it is in its own way, i think, a beautifully put together film.

jean-pierre melville's le cercle rouge follows the lives of two criminals: vogel (gian maria volontÃ¨), a murderer who gives the cops the slip while he's being transferred from one city to another by train; and corey (allain delon), a thief just released from jail. fate decides to join these two men to pull off a spectacular heist. in the background there is matei (andrÃ© bourvil), the detective vogel escapes from, implacable in his pursuit and sometimes ruthless in his methods. along the movie the viewer meets other minor but fascinating characters, the best of which is jansen (yves montand), a disgraced ex-cop and an excellent marksman.melville has such a unique style one doesn't need to watch many of his movies to catch on. le samourai, un flic and le cercle rouge are clearly made of the same cloth: the symmetrical angles; the long shots; the silences; the coats and hats and cigars; the quotes at the beginning; the amazing heists, the fatalism; the unglamorous and inglorious criminal life. everything that's great in melville is present here in top form.and his shortcomings didn't bother me so much this time: the illogical, perplexing behavior of his characters and confusing storytelling, which hurt my enjoyment of his other movies, are almost invisible here. since le cercle rouge preceded un flic that doesn't mean he got better with time; perhaps i'm just getting more used to it and reaching a mindset where it doesn't bother me anymore.melville made unique crime movies. as old as they may be, they show more ingenuity, realism and grace than the modern techno-thrillers in which cool thieves use computer systems and james bond-esquire gadgets to pull off impossible crimes. melville's criminals aren't cool: they're lonely, socially awkward and probably aware they're not good for much more than planning heists. they're society's unwanted, living in the night, always one step ahead of the police in a game they know they'll lose eventually. there's nothing romantic about them.amazingly for a movie of this type, the cops aren't complete idiots either. matei is smart, crafty, patient and even compassionate. he's not an unlikeable villain or a clichÃ©, he's just an old man doing his job and doing it right. he knows when to use force and when to use brains. many movies could learn from him.it's this down-to-earth, unromantic style that makes melville's movies such a joy to watch and puts him on a special pedestal as one of cinema's great crime masters.

le cercle rouge is a very good film, though it does suffer a bit since there have already been similar films. in all too many ways, the movie is reminiscent of previous heist films such as rififi and grand slam and many others. so, while director melville and the actors did great jobs, it all seems like a case of dÃ©jÃ  vu. because of this, i had a hard time giving this excellent film a higher score.the one unusual aspect of the film is how the crooks get together. instead of the usual means, vogel escapes from prison and just happens to meet up with corey, a career criminal just released from prison! both are a good match but having them both work in parallel for much of the film until they meet was a clever touch. apart from that, as expected much of the movie concerns the meticulous details in planning and executing the crime. i also appreciated how the film showed the crooks in such a cold and detached manner--something relatively common in french crime films but rare among american films until recent years.overall, extremely well-crafted and worth seeing...if you don't mind that it seems a tad repetitive, you'll see some fine acting, direction and a lot of great tension.

how good is this film? apparently, good enough that they plan to remake it in 2011. jean-pierre melville, who gave us le doulos and the good thief, wrote and directed this film.the film is almost a silent. these are men of few words, preferring to let their actions speak for them. they live by a code that governs their every move.there are some great actors in this film - alain delon (the leopard), yves montand (jean de florette, let's make love), and gian maria volonte (el indio from a fistful of dollars & a few dollars more). the film does not shine on them; they are along for the ride that melville has for them. melville makes the film; they make it better.you see melville's work in the ocean films, but they just get the idea. the can't make it work like he did. a great loss in the seventies, but his work remains for our pleasure.

just as in rififi, the most compelling scene in the movie is the perfected silence of the jewel heist. the scene is masterful in its execution, each of the robbers having their own specialized job to perform, each one successfully combining their own unique talent towards the objective, and each one, until a month before, complete strangers.many of the scenes play out very slowly. in fact, the opening scene is a long character introduction to both corey and vogel, as we see corey getting released from prison and vogel escaping capture on his way to prison. the two characters are then methodically brought together through fate at a roadside diner as vogel hides inside the trunk of corey's automobile. from this improbable break in, the two strangers agree to become partners to commit a perfected and precise jewel heist.however, to pull of this heist they must include the help of a third man named jansen. jansen is hired as the sure shot gun man. his inclusion into the mix was an interesting and desperate choice. at the time of his hire, jansen is in a full battle with dt's and spent most of his day on his cot hallucinating over lizards, snakes and spiders. his transition from the disheveled and hallucinatory world of a william s. burroughs dream into the steady handed and sober sharp shooter is a very quick one and perhaps the only real false moment of the film, but that's just me being extremely picky.one other mildly false note was that of the police inspector mattei. at times he appeared to be brilliant in the ways of strong arming the right people or gathering information and waiting out for his escaped prisoner to make his move. other times he appeared to be 10 years past retirement, especially at the beginning during vogel's escape through the woods.i wonder if i got too much hidden meaning from the beginning of the movie. at the start of the movie, as the police car is speeding through the city, the first image we see is that of a red stop light. my first thought was that this may be the 'red circle' and that if i am to find a deeper meaning in the movie, perhaps it is that this car, or rather the people inside of it going through the red light, will be the ones who will 'stop' the jewel heist. hmmmm? perhaps the red circle refers to the triumvirate thieving ring? perhaps it was the burning sled? no matter.it's a long movie, but it doesn't feel that way. the ending is a bit of a disappointment. it seemed too hurried for a movie that felt like such a delicious slow burn. 9/10clark richards

commissaire mattei(andrÃ© bourvil) is a single with a little gun who loves cats and his boss at the paris police department is a philosopher who knows that even the police becomes sooner or later guilty. that is what the film is all about. and a jewel robbery at the place vendome.corey (delon) brings the plan from prison, vogel(volontÃ©)joins him and helps him against two tough guys, who are after him, because he took mafioso ricos(andre eycan) money, while rico already took coreys girl friend and left him very much alone for five years in jail. corey and vogel find a third man, jansen(montand), a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by shooting special hand made ammunition into a hole. a perfect plan and cooperation, but they have to sell the booty and there is mattei in the role of a buyer in disguise. the circle closes. running to help each other they are shot by the cat loving mattei and his little pistol.it took melville 20 years he says to make a robbery film after he failed to get a contract for riffifi. melville wrote the screenplay and filmed in the south of france and in paris of yesteryear. the great henri decae is as usual the lighting cameraman. it is the one before last picture of melvilles who died after another film with delon in 1972.melville actually wanted belmondo instead of volontÃ©, he didn't like that italian at all, but volontÃ©-vogel is an excellent fugitive and gives next to bourvil the most convincing performance. but mind you: melville notes, that volontÃ© is an instinctive actor, a strange character, very wearying and absolutely impossible on a french set. melville didn't like him at all and didn't want to work with him ever again.melville is wrong. volontÃ© give the most lively character in the nowhere of not so many interesting characters. you can see what he is feeling being chased by mattei and his little dangerous gun and all the dogs of france in winter 70. a wild actor.also andrÃ© bourvil, who passed away close to the time of the filming. he also was not first choice, but definitely a great substitute. he carries the instinct of a lonely hunter through the whole film and gets in the end his chance to become guilty once more.jansen has entered at night the jewelry shop with a rifle and a tripod but risks eventually freehandedly a successful shot. when he meets delon the first time we already know that the elegant jansen has a severe drinking problem. after the robbery montand renounces to take his part of the booty and mentions to delon, who looks up to him, that he only got into the red circle, because he wanted to take revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe. delon doesn't catch what he means. the audience recalls having seen montand in a great scene in his haunted house fighting helplessly nightmare creatures that come out of the wardrobe and attack him. at that time a very rare scene, one recalls a long time after. i bet it was ever so difficult to arrange and direct that stuff at a time no one imagined the coming days of digital movie making. great artwork when art was made by hand.we sure will remember a crew like the actors, still it seems even after 33 years this one stays the less popular of the six thrillers of melville. what is wrong with it? i am afraid one doesn't take much interest in those three actors (showing three criminals) and their police hunter. we learn too little about corey and his fatal 5 years away from his beautiful girl(anna douking). montand is still a great sniper, but what made him become a drinking man with funny creatures in his wardrobe. delon acts as if he is in an earlier adventure of the samourai, volontÃ© is the man in the trunk of delons american car and superbly moving and mattei is swell to look at, a great actor at the edge of his life. but how could he ever possibly doubt that all are guilty ?in an interview melville states, that there is no woman in the film. not in the very red circle, but i remember well that jolly good looking female anna douking (with no future career). we are in the 70s. there in fact rises a woman from the bed of an old mafioso wearing nothing and walks slowly to the door to listen to the voice of her old lover delon. bardot did something like that 10 years earlier. this time melville was directing. well done.the red cercle has certainly added a few but not many glittering gems to film history. the robbery at place vendome and montands wonder bullet the inhabitants of the wardrobe and volontÃ© escaping bouvil in white underwear and carrying his trousers carefully across a stream. that is too little for a great gangster and robbery movie. but the 110 minutes never bore you and it is a game on a high level. and there are probably some secrets you learn when you see the film over and over again. none of the secrets is that we are all guilty and the late francois perier is also featured.michael zabel

i guess melville intended this movie to be the definition of the cool; it has the cool approach of the late '60s/ early '70s thrillersÂ—the same discrete quirkiness. le cercle rouge, a bitter and fatalist story, is also the playground of delon, bourvil, volontÃ© and montand in defining roles.bourvil is a cop who has in his flat three cats and a daily routine. delon is a hoodlum. montand is a sick, failed cop. volontÃ© plays an escaped suspect. le cercle rouge is of course far above a heist movie; melville uses his techniques Â–long wordless detailed depictions of every step of the heist, etc.. yet this particular action drama is far better than his other moviesÂ—and it's very unlikely them by being so much better. the look of le cercle rouge is very peculiar to melville, very melvillian.delon was sharp and cool; bourvil brings his craft, and montand makes maybe the finest role of this movie; his performance has an unexpected warmth .on the other hand, the characters are barely sketched, no more than strictly necessary, and are personae. or masks; yet the portrayal is inspired, economic but suggestive.another of the movies that prove delon to be a good, a very good actor; and the fact that he's not a genius does not imply that he ought to be despised as a fourth rate actor. he's good, he can bear the proximity of a bourvil and montand.only ten yrs. before le cercle rouge, melville was doing, towards the end of the '50s, a boring overlong insipid noir pastiche (starring himself)Â—and after only a decade, here he is, in full form, with this quite amazing action drama. stylistically, it's a success.before seeing le cercle rouge, i was not a melvillian fan; now i guess i rather am one.le cercle rouge is a dramaÂ—namely, an action drama, one of the most exigent genres. melville scores.

having finally caught up with this "masterpiece," it strikes me that it must have seemed terribly clever, in its day. it's french, arty, under-played to the point of agony, and ultimately downbeat. but viewed from the vantage of 37 years in the future, it's also just a bit vacuous, pretentious and unsatisfying.others have summarized the story, but i don't think anyone has pointed out the dramatic flaw at the heart of this film: the lead characters, corey and vogel, really don't deserve what they get. they play square within their code, never harm anyone who didn't ask for it, and show great courage and initiative. moreover, corey in particular is victimized by his former gangland 'friend,' who stole his girl and who repeatedly tries to have him killed, apparently just because he (corey) dared to 'borrow' a few thousand francs. these are guys who really ought to be due for a break! instead, things go far worse for them than they really need to, within the logic of the story.one might contend that this is the whole point: that the real villains never get caught; that they collude with the police as needed, sell out their friends, and always come out on top. but that's not shown either. corey's old gangster friend is not shown colluding with the police. nor is he shown gloating over his victory. in fact, after materializing several times when he's needed, he's nowhere to be seen at the conclusion, leaving a dramatic tension (his feud with corey) entirely unresolved!nonetheless, i'd say this film is well worth seeing for its beautiful photography, its slow, deliberate pacing, its great deadpan performances, its elaborate heist sequence, and its encapsulation of the art-film style of the late 1960s.

while its not the masterpiece that "le samourai" was (i've accepted by now that jean-pierre melville was never able to top that classic), i find "le cercle rouge" to be much better than "bob le flambeur". i felt that "bob le flambeur" was an above-average and influential b-film, but still a b-film. "le cercle rouge" proves that as a filmmaker melville improved as he continued. john woo is a massive fan of melville, even though their film-making style differs. while woo uses fast-motion for shootouts and an operatic sense of violence, melville has a minimalist style that suits him very well. he wasn't interested in creating quickly paced action films but more meditative crime thrillers. in that department, he was one of the best."le samourai" is still his best work, mainly because it has more character development than this, but on a technical level they're probably equal. besides, while "le samourai" had one great lead performance, this has four. alain delon is once again an ultra-cool gangster on the prowl - this man's silence is fascinating. bourvil is superb as the police inspector on the case of the heist and escaped con. he steals every scene he is in, and proves that he was a skilled dramatic actor (in france he is best known as a slapstick comedian in the mode of buster keaton). yves montand is great also as the shaky and paranoid gun expert. gian maria volontÃ¨ (a regular in spaghetti westerns) is overshadowed by his three co-stars but still does an adequate job.once again, melville's direction is superb. taking equal influence from both american crime thrillers and the french new wave, the man always seems to know the best shots and angles to choose. this is more slowly-paced than most caper flicks, but it really pays off by the end. "le cercle rouge" is a bit short of being an absolute classic, but is still one of the best heist flicks ever made. tarantino must've seen this before making "reservoir dogs". (8/10)

jean-pierre melville is a director i've only recently gotten acquainted with (i need to see bob le flambeur and le samourai again to fully grasp them), but in watching le cercle rouge (the red circle, supposedly based on a saying in buddhism) i realized i was watching as skillful and absorbing a crime film as i had seen in a quite some time. though his film has dialog, it is mainly to keep the film's scenes rolling along, adherent to the plot. what kept me on the alert, even in seemingly mundane scenes/sequences, was the emphasis on the characters' movements, or behavior patterns. melville has his story laid out, and he is careful to take his time to tell it (this could seem boring to some, but it does seem to work since he puts a little more emphasis on the weight of the characters/environments over plot). yet look at each of the four main players: alain deleon as corey (just released from prison, scheming a new heist), gian maria volonte as vogel (escaping & on the lam from hand-cuffed custody, meets corey by luck), yves montand as jansen (an aged pro with many years of experience with weapons, a friend of vogel), and andre bourvil as mattei (an experienced investigator, who is on the look-out for vogel, and on his toes with internal affairs). each of these actors plays their parts with precision, detachment, and they each have their own kinds of moments that indicate to the audience what their personalities might be besides as criminals and cops. the heist sequence gives little hints, for example, like how vogel cops-a-feel off a female statue while passing down the halls, or how jansen takes out a flask and merely has a whiff of the contents (and what a dream this guy creates). even corey's movements involving a photograph of a woman arouse interest. as absorbing and cool the story becomes, and as great the skills were to make it happen (via cinematographer henri decae, the editing, and the musical score by eric demarsan), it's the people on the screen that gain fascination, in how they stay true to their natures and ideals. not a film to be missed by french new-wave enthusiasts, and modern-day crime movie buffs might want to take the 140 minutes to soak up the atmosphere of melville's work. a suave piece of film-making that still ranks as one of my all-time favorites.

i decided to write a comment on this amazing movie because here on imdb it is cited that john woo, a mediocre director who made some decent films back in his pre-american years but totally ruined his reputation by his latest, made in us films, plans to remake it. well, here are a couple of reasons why it is one of the stupidest ideas for a remake ever: the plot of the film is simple and even clichÃ©d by today's standards, but what makes the film a masterpiece is acting by the four leads, unique direction by mellville, cinematography, music and its style. there is no way any director today can make such film, it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a movie in today's box-office targeted movie business. john woo did make a more or less decent film which borrowed from melville's le samourai - the killer, but remember, it was made when the director was not spoiled by big budgets and expensive (in salaries) but cheap (in acting merits) actors. so what i'm saying is that this is one of the greatest films ever made, together with another film by melville - le samourai. watch it. and even if the remake will be made, try to avoid it before seeing the great original first.

everyone likes the coolly created, memorable heist movie. alain delon provides the antihero, melville provides the cool, and a handful of other great talent (yves montand, gian maria volonte, and andre bourvil, mostly) arrives to add a crisp engaging movie......with very little dialog. this is great, because one certain aspect of the genre tends to be a lot of dialog involving the quick-witted and their various repartees. this movie, however, could be watched with the sound completely off and not too terribly much would be missed. not to say the sound is bad, oh no, the jazzy soundtrack and the crisp audio catching the little movements makes the slow, patient deliberation of the patients very compelling.what's also really neat about this film is that the color cinematography is pretty fantastic. usually when it comes to cinematography, black and white movies tend to stick out in my mind, but this film has some very strong and beautiful imagery that makes the movie pure visual pleasure to observe.--polarisdib

the red circle (jean-pierre melville - france/italy 1970).this might be the coolest film ever made, in the most literal sense of the term. the men here never lose control and never - not once - show their emotions. no dramatic outbursts in this film. everyone is cool all the time. it's an abstract dream-world, where the men live by their own code, a gangster code with the values of the outside world conspicuously absent. in this masterfully filmed heist saga, melville tackles the american crime thriller in his distinctly dark and desolate style, yet made in grand fashion with a hefty budget of ten million dollars and with four of the greatest french stars at the time. alain delon as the master thief, yves montand as an alcoholic ex-cop, italian star gian-maria volontÃ© as an escaped criminal and andrÃ© bourvil in an atypical role as the cynical police chief.melville described le cercle rouge as his penultimate film and it is indeed a masterfully stylized policier. he also claimed he wanted to shoot a film noir in colour and in many ways he succeeded. the two primary influences for this film were john huston's 1950 heist movie the asphalt jungle and jules dassin's rififi (1955). but unlike these films, where we learn much about the background of the individual gang members, with all their petty needs and worries that motivate them, making clear these are not just ruthless underworld types, but ordinary individuals engaged in a world of everyday worries and human endeavour, melville, though, tells us almost nothing about his criminals. why was corey (alain delon) in jail? why was his associate, vogel (jean-marie volontÃ©) arrested in the first place? or why the ex-police marksman jansen (yves montand) left the force, was it his alcoholism? we never learn the motivations behind their actions and never find out what drives these men. women are even more absent than in his earlier films, with the "emotional" ties exclusively between men. they don't even seem to have personal lives. a sort of an emotional twilight zone and although the setting is not as abstract as in his earlier le samourai (1967), melville still sketches a very eerie world. melville's favorite actor, alain delon, is perfect and almost outdoes himself in coolness, if imaginable.deliberately paced and with a length of over 140 minutes, melville takes his time to tell the story, but its slow pace and length seems a perfect way to show the desolate world these men live in. nothing is ever out of place in melville's films and here it's no different, every little detail seemingly of pivotal importance for the story. although le samourai remains my favorite melville film, even up there with the greatest films ever made, this one also belongs to the very best. camera obscura --- 10/10

not having seen this film in quite some time, we caught with it not long ago in the nicely transferred criterion dvd. "le cercle rouge" is a film that owes a lot to other movies, as it keeps reminding us about "rififi", "the asphalt jungle", among others, because they all deal with capers that take center stage in the movie and reproduce it in great detail. unfortunately, one knows that old adage that crime does not pay, and from the start, these men involved in it are doomed from the onset.jean-pierre melville was a director of few words. he didn't fill his pictures with a lot of dialog, as it's the case here. yet, for not being "talky", they had a style of their own as proved with "le dolous", "le samurai", and his masterpiece, "bob le flambeur", among others. mr. melville had a sense of style that comes across in everything he did. in this film, working with his cinematographer, henri decae, he takes us along for a ride through the streets of paris that shows the vibrant city mainly at night and the bleak winter in france. the score is by eric demarsan that emphasizes a jazzy music that accompanies most of the action.although the film shows alain delon, as corey, at the center of the action, it is however, the smart inspector mattei who is the real hero of the movie. as played by the great bourvil, he is a man that shows a lot of patience because he has figured from the beginning how to catch vogel, and in the process he gets involved in the investigation of the jewel heist in which he knows the escaped man he is tailing looms large behind it. bourvil gives an enormously satisfying performance as mattei showing equal parts of determination and tenderness, as it's the case with the three cats he adores.alain delon always responded with interesting performances his appearances in mellville's pictures. in here he is corey, the man who is first seen leaving prison and promising himself he won't go back, but he cannot pass a good thing when he decides to go ahead and participate in the robbery. his association with vogel and jansen, pays off in the way they get the job done, but it will also prove a mistake in the way they will not be able to dispose of the loot as the fence they have relied on has a change of heart.gian maria volonte and yves montand are seen as vogel and jansen, respectively. they were excellent actors who blend well in the action of the film. both actors were at their best moment when they took the roles in the film and it shows. mr. montand has the more complex character to play as we witness him in his first moment in front of the camera as a man with many demons inside his head.jean-pierre mellville got wonderful results from his cast and crew in a film, that although feels a bit longer, but still succeeds in showing his style in one of the most memorable pictures from the director.

wow, i just loved watching all these hot babes! the scenery around malibu and california was off the fizzy. i could watch it again just to see all that flesh crammed into those tiny, teeny bikinis! i recently saw pilar lastra, the steaming hot housekeeper in malibu spring break, as a center fold in my favorite mag, playboy. she is hot, hot hot! the opening seen was bitchin. when the two main girls run out of gas and stop at this desert gas station, they drive the gas-guy nuts with their bodies and skimpy outfits! the slow-mo lets me enjoy every inch of them! my girlfriend liked looking at this shredded hot dude too (now i'd like a bod like that) and at all the other hot dudes....and some of the girls too! any movie that can bring that out in my girlfriend is a 10 + for me!

with some wine, some friends and some good humor, i had a really good time watching this film. i particularly enjoyed the performance of jilon ghai (as "randy"), who was such a kick in the pants! his scenes with charity rahmer ("michelle") were wildly amusing. i wouldn't want him coming on to me, but it was great watching "randy" try to score with "michelle" and even better seeing the results! of course, the girls in the film are lots of fun to watch too. and, a friend of mine showed me the playboy issue that had pilar lastra as the playmate of the month. she's definitely a looker. all in all, this film totally served its purpose, which was to entertain us in a light and care-free way.

i already gave my comment on this movie under the name brucev3. now under brucev13 i want to add something! now after a long time i have seen a lot of so called heroic bloodshed titles! but not many come close to the action shown in john woo movies! that's why after all these years i think it is strange that "china white" doesn't get the credit it deserves! no matter what version you have seen! the action is top notch! the scenery,china town in amsterdam is very unique. you get the impression it is a large district. but having lived in amsterdam myself i know it is only a small area part of the red light district which happen to have a lot of chinese stores and restaurants! but because of the way they shot the movie it actually looks like a big and important territory where people know not to mess with the triads (chinese mafia)! besides the action "china white" is a compelling gangster drama with some good acting! for this i have to give credit to russel wong! too bad we don't see much of him lately,since he has a lot of potential! must see movie!

china white (1989) was ronny yu's first international film. this u.k,/holland/hong kong production was shot in english and was slightly edited for the western audience. the american wong brothers (michael and russell) were supposed to star in the film together but due to prior commitments was unavailable so another western actor steven leigh took his spot. several hong kong stars such as tommy wong (playing a mute) and the always creepy william ho appear as well as the director in an interesting cameo spot.the chow brothers are in holland to run the family business. they want to the family business to go legit but the other asian gangs don't want to and see there move as a face saving move to please the "foreigners" and want to keep on making money the old fashion way. others want to take their business to even a new low by smuggling drugs and what not. after the chow elder is gunned down in cold blood, the brothers make their move against any family who's not with them. can the chow family keep the families from killing one another or while the streets of holland flow with the blood of the innocence and gangsters?a highly underrated movie. i was surprised by how good it was. i haven't seen the hong kong version. that would be a huge treat for me. it's longer and has a lot more stars of the hong kong cinema involved with the production. too bad this film isn't available on d.v.d. the video print i saw was washed out and the sound reproduction wasn't that great.highly recommended for action fans.factoid: this film takes place before the decriminalization of drugs in holland.

as a huge fan of horror, i had given up on the vampire sub-genre due to the fact that in most vampire flicks the vampire has become feminine and non-threatening, benign and basically weak. this was the attitude i brought to a viewing of soul's midnight and i am happy to say that the vampires in this film at least have the hunger to kill old ladies and sacrifice babies! armand assante, one of my favorite actors of all time, was born to play the charming vampire with savage intensity. another thing that interested me is that the central location is the borgo hotel. that is cool because (and i went back to my high school copy to look this up) in dracula, the borgo pass is where jonathan harker must pass to get to dracula's castle.finally, my hats off to whoever made the decision to make the creature a real effect and not a darn cgi! that's the one thing great about many low-budget movies, they cannot afford the garbage computer effects that plague many hollywood monstrosities.bottom line...this is better than underworld for sure, especially if you are a vampire purest. cheers, ja

soul's midnight stars armande assante (simon) who stared in "the mambo kings" and elizabeth bennett (alicia milford). together with sexy vampire vixen, lucila sola (iris), simon lures pregnant alicia and her husband charles into the netherworld of soul's midnight. assante sinks his fangs into the script by writers brian and jason cleveland and you enjoy watching him and iris kill. alicia and charles (robert floyd) try to stay alive while gore keeps your lust for blood sated.(spoiler alert) in today's jaded landscape, it comes as no surprise that a back-stabbing preacher gets bitten. set looks cool Â– lots of detail at the borgo hotel and cool special effects at the end. i had a lot of fun watching this movie Â– it doesn't take itself too seriously and looks great.

if you love vampire lore and are a fan of gothic horror, then you might want to check out soul's midnight. i did not know much about this movie before i watched it, and i wasn't expecting much, but i found the movie to be fun and entertaining.starring armand assante as the leader of the vampires simon, soul's separates itself from other low budget vampire flicks by weaving in the mythology of st. george and the dragon in a fun new way.i'm not sure what the budget for this movie was, but i sense that if it was a little more then they might have really been able to hit home the gore and effects.if you're up late one night and you're in the mood for a fun low budget vampire flick then soul's midnight is a good choice.

no matter how many times wile ethelbert "famishius famishius" coyote tries to get road "burnius roadibus" runner, we always know what's going to happen, though our sympathy always remains with wec. the highlight in "hook, line and stinker" is a rube goldberg-style scheme that wec hopes will finally finish off rr; but of course you know what happens.so, wile e. continues hilarious engaging in fanaticism (defined by george santayana as redoubling your effort after you've forgotten your aim) while road runner pretty much never becomes aware of the potential danger - or lack thereof - in which he could find himself. a real classic.and yes, the coyote's middle name is ethelbert. i learned that from "jeopardy!".

just love the interplay between two great characters of stage & screen - veidt & barrymore

i loved this show but then i don't remember ever not loving anything he did, starting with "americanization of emily". a town sheriff who keeps trying to steal the town blind and ride off to mexico, gotta love it. like everything he does it has a tongue in cheek flavor that brands it as a garner product. james plays the same character in lots of his shows and movies but somehow it never gets stale.p.s. re: killing off the main characterif i remember right the "good" brother was killed off and replaced with the "evil" twin in an effort to increase the ratings i.e.; make it more like every other western on tv at the time. i think this show was too far ahead of its time and i still miss it. tv without a jimmy g show is missing something.

this show was a really good one in many ways, although certainly an atypical western with the hero (?) riding around on a motorcycle rather than a horse, due to the 1914 setting, very "late" for a western, which tend usually to be set between 1866 and 1890. i remember some controversy about its cancellation at the time but didn't really watch it during its time on nbc. when i came to see it and love it was a decade later when i was in the army stationed in germany and it was shown every week from the beginning on armed forces television. by then, margot kidder was famous as lois lane but i'll also always think of her as nichols' girlfriend. in a lot of ways, nichols was a lot like maverick; both were much more attracted to getting rich with little effort than they were fighting. it was in the little tv magazine that they distributed at the px (not really an authorized edition of "tv guide" but made to resemble it as closely as possible without getting into copyright trouble) that i first learned the real story behind the cancellation. i really wonder what the next season with the more violent twin would have been like if they had really made it as planned. of course, by the time this show was made the "western era" of tv had been in decline for around a decade; someday i hope to be able to write that the "reality era" has been in decline for that long! while "gunsmoke" and "bonanza" were still running, they were both nearing their ends and it had been years since a new western had really caught on; i think that this trend did a lot to hold "nichols" back, and was the main reason that nbc executives doubted that it would ever find a large audience but to me, a good western, unlike a show set in contemporary times, is somewhat timeless, as are other "period" shows; changing fashions and the like do nothing to make them look any more "dated" than they were supposed to be, and i think that watching this show, 10 years after it was produced, is really what brought this point home to me. also, this show is an early pairing of garner and stuart margolin, who is really one of the all-time great sidekicks, and not just in westerns.

a boy who adores maurice richard of the montreal canadiens receives, much to his horror, a toronto maple leafs sweater in the mail. i recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey, but nearly everyone knew about maurice richard and the toronto/montreal rivalry. highly entertaining, amusing, and accurate.

this marvelous short will hit home with everyone who, as a child, specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool, only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your mom or dad (or both) that it didn't matter, as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a witness protection program in order to avoid ridicule. for those u.s. residents who don't get the horror because you don't follow hockey, it's like a dallas cowboy fan getting a washington redskins jersey or a yankees fan getting a red sox jersey. it isn't pretty. for our european friends, think of two great rival football (soccer to us) clubs and imagine a fan of one getting a jersey from the other. ouch!!! nfb of c outdid themselves here!une hommage du maurice "rocket" richard, merci, m. richard.

animated shorts just don't get much better than this wonderful canadian film. this short feature is dripping with canadian references, and so, this film will probably be appreciated by canadians most of all. but the basic story is universal, and it is told lovingly by writer roch carrier. it is a hilarious story that i have known for quite sometime, and i was recently fortunate enough to see it again, so i simply had to write a hearty recommendation for it. this is a masterpiece, and a must-see whether or not you are canadian.

having been raised in canada, i saw this short many times mostly on the cbc. i have seen it numerous times, at many ages in my life, and each time the reactions are the same. it is a joyous bittersweet, beautifully animated film that tugs at your heart. i am sure i have it on some vhs tape somewhere digging around.every kid growing up can relate to the situation, and wanting to fit in with your favourite idols. the scene and look on the kids face when his mom is filling out the eatons catalogue and his jumping around the room is priceless. i haven't seen someone capture that carefree mood of youth on film as well as this little short has.sure i am a montreal habs fan, and that makes my appreciation for it more special. but in the end it is the nostalgic look and feel of pond hockey, and the memories of your family telling you that you should be greatful for what you get even if it isn't exactly what you wanted. and oh yeah, the animation is beautiful too ;)rating 10 out of 10

my teacher did this movie. it's a new beginning. watch it, and you won't notice that it is a romanian movie. the old boring style has gone. now it's something else. a post-revolutionary movie. it is using the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists. they are unique. you won't even know that you're watching, you will be simply transferred beyond the screen and you'll feel every frame. don't miss it, pay attention to the plot but don't ignore the details. they make the difference between this movie and the others romanian movies. you will hear some music at some point. it's representative for a part of us, but it does not represent us. please, just keep your head straight and leave your body free.

i have to say that i haven't expected that this movie to be this good. usually, the eastern cinema presents the communist past in 90% of the films. however, this film surpasses the romanian cinema, being worthy of some more advertisement. the acting is truthfully and not exaggerated, the plot is simple yet complex as it presents the life in the romanian suburbia, the sound amazed me, the directing was good and what more can i say... this "crash" of eastern europe was drawn me into the film living each moment of it. i have even felt a desire coming out of me, a desire for adventure after seeing it.watch it! you will definitely enjoy it!7/10

the movie has an excellent screenplay (the situation is credible, the action has pace), first-class direction and acting (especially the 3 leading actors but the others as well -including the mobster, who does not seem to be a professional actor).i wish the movie, the director and the actors success.

is not a bad movie but the acting and the screenplay can be better. i like this movie because i have a life that is in good part like the one in the movie. is hard for a lost generation to get a life in romania, and 90 percent of us choose something else, and that something else includes dealing with people with "bad habits" if you understand me but that comes with the territory. this movie represent me and i like it. i have a rage in me that i barley talk with people, i live in a messed up society and i can't fit in and i don't want to,and that's the story of movie also, if you r like me you can understand the true movie, if not you will find it easy and cheap.

now we know radu munteans movies, the excellent paper will be blue and boogie, but its worth to see again (or at last) this first furia, which shows perfectly clear his initial qualities. its very interesting to see how his beginners talent developed into confirming him as one of the best romanian contemporary directors.of course, the movie itself is excellent - intelligent and professional script, sure-handed direction, stylish photography. definitely, one of the best - in the most serious and competent sense! also, munteans storytelling sense is compelling and gripping - and he actors... well, they simply rock!

looking backwards to that year 2002 when "furia" was made, one can easily recognize the heralding sings of today's new generation in romania.the main qualities of "furia" stand in a very solid script, with a substantial dramatic core and a really professional developing, plus a cast of excellent actors. all four leading roles are admirably performed, both with depth and casualness: dragos bucur and andy vasluianu confirmed, since then, being two of our best performers today, dorina chiriac follows them closely, and adrian tuli, a non-professional (in real life, a graveyard manager!) cast as gabonu, was a genuine revelation! further, radu muntean's directing is skilled and expressive, creating in a very compelling style that feeling of "a fateful night" and inescapable destiny. one can easily pass over the few awkward and even failed moments, since time proved them to be only the uncertainties inherent to a debut, never repeated in his subsequent movies: "hÃ¢rtia va fi albastrÃ¤" and "boogie".

well, i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated short. he loves it and claimed it was hilarious. i enjoyed it but didn't see any humor. he doesn't even like hockey or know anything about it, and still loved the story. living right across the border from canada, i have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in buffalo....but i didn't think much of this cartoon. oh, it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec area - disaster! that especially holds true in the glory years of les canadians. however, that doesn't make the story funny. back in the 1950s, everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal canadians and their star player, maurice richard, and everyone wanted to be like him. when his mother orders a new sweater, it has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it, so the kid doesn't want to be caught dead wearing it.. when he finally does and heads to the local rink, he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies. what's so funny about that? i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox die-hard and his mom gets him yankees shirt! horrors! you couldn't wear it, and vice-versa.maybe to someone who doesn't follow sports at all, like maltin, this situation seems odd and humorous to him...but it's a fact of life or any bit-time sports fan and his favorite team. it was an interesting story, and totally believable, but nothing that made me laugh.the art was fun to look at throughout, almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid. the french canadian accent was good, too. this movie was part of the dvd "leonard maltin's animation favorites from the national film board of canada.

it seems everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon and say "maha go go go"....the word is macha........like "mach".....pronounced maa - ka"...i grew up with this series in the early 70's here in la on the late and very lamented channel 56...before that there was tetsuwan atomu (astro boy), dating from 1963 on ol' khj tv. astro boy was the first tv example of anime we got here in the states...i was into anime as a kid and followed it until the late 80's when, by then it'd become a series of badly animated "talking heads", a phenomenon which has only gotten worse. 'nuff said.as for "speed racer", i really enjoyed the basics there, the pov shots, the cinematic aspects of live action skillfully adopted to animation...that was fairly typical of most japanese anime back then...graphics graphics graphics! take note sometime how obviously the series was inspired by stanley kramer's film "grand prix" (1966), especially the redone american credits....oh yeah, i have the original comics from which the series is based, so i know of which i speak.what were we doing animation-wise besides crap like johnny quest?.....th' same ol' stuff we'd been doin' since the 20's....ho-hum!i guess the real problem i had/have with the way anime was/is shown on american tv is the hatchet job done on the scripts, credits, etc to "sanitize" them for american audiences...i won't go into other programs as we're talking' speed here.look at clowns like peter fernandez as one of the culprits here, as he was 99% responsible for the re-writes of the series...not to mention the voice of speed, racer x and others...between him and the goofs at trans/lux ( think felix the cat and the mighty hercules - oy vey!) they took a slick, very sophisticated show and dropped it down to the level of sesame street. think "cruncher bloch", the "forthebird company", "skull duggery"...if i go on i'll puke.this series dates from 40-odd years ago but i, at the time, was keen enough to feel insulted by the dumbing down of this and other japanese programs...i mean it's obvious when someone's getting' killed but they either remove it or gloss it over........pleeeeeze!good show - originally. sadly all the more recent incarnations of the series have that crappy "made in korea" look, not to mention being nauseatingly "pc" in content. even the japanese outsource their animation now..try watchin' the original japanese opening on youtube sometime...it sends chills up my spine.....if only......oh well. robert

the role of economics in the industrialized north american market must have always been theorized in the homelands of the engines creation. persons and industrialist such as mercedes benz and the bavarian motor works (bmw) surely realized the opportunity of the north ameircan market with the purchase of fuel and number of automobiles purchased per household. this type of economic phenomena sparked the concept of speed racer.after the new constitution of japan the industrialization of the isolated island nation of japan must seek opportunity once again via economic partnerships with its global neighbors. this also helped spark the economic opportunities in the european and north american market if not the global market.speed is a young avid driver who without knowing any better is driven by his demanding father pops racer who has challenged himself his whole life to make a better machine better at winning races. it was in fact pops racer who drove his first son rex racer to the brink of destruction with his strategy of how to best use the technology he developed. as a mature racer, rex, finally realizes his own inherent values and becomes independent but still feels obligated to his younger bother speed.the exact relationship of rex racer to persons such as the inspector are never really clear, but put into dramatization. rex is eventually accused of being a type of agent for a country or organization due to his ability to be in places at times when there is no other explanation to how he would have known speed was in trouble. or the fact that the situations involved some types of illegal activity were his secretive knowledge is leveraged against an evil plot. this brings a level of cloak and dagger romance to speed racer.the mixture of speeds innocence with trixy, sprital, and chim chim brings a level of comic human nature. this concept is a good form of rhetoric to balance the themes and plots as they are played out from episode to episode. so, instead of a dry detective story the thrill of international race car driving, romance of cloak and dagger, and comedy of human nature is put into one story, speed racer.

this short deals with a severely critical writing teacher whose undiplomatic criticism extends into his everyday life. when he learns why that's not a good idea, we learn a bit about the beautiful craft of writing that he's been lecturing on.

this movie, with all its complexity and subtlety, makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films i have ever seen. the topics it addresses are ugly, cynical, and at times, even macabre, but the film remains beautiful in its language, artful with its camera angles, and gorgeous in its style, skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories, tobias wolff.not wishing to spoil anything of the movie, i won't go into any details, other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself. it takes pride in what it does, and does it well. it shows the most important memories of life, all of which can be topped by the single most elusive feeling: unexpected bliss. this movie, of its own volition, has created in me the same feelings the main character (tom noonan) felt when words transformed his very existence, and that is one impressive feat.
