clive barker of hellraiser fame has written and produced a fantasy horror film that is funny and exciting.the make-up done by bob keen and geoffrey portass was fantastic. it took quite an imagination to come up with these mutants that lived underground. it was really a treat to see the quality of work.it wasn't particularly horrible, as the worst creature was actually a human serial killer.i just saw craig sheffer in shadow of doubt the other day and he did a good job in this film also. nothing spectacular, but fair. this was only anne bobby's third film, and she was good also.the ending was spectacular and the rednecks got their just desserts, as did david cronenberg. ha!

this movie is masterly directed by clive barker, he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters. i think there is a sequel missing for this one, barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring lord of illusions, that is one i think was a real garbage. but i also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel nbreed has become a dark cult classic of horror films.

the film 'nightbreed' is one of the best horror films i have ever seen. overall, i'm not a big fan of horror films, but there is something about this film that is more atmospheric and different from any other horror film i have ever seen. many horror films i've seen i've enjoyed watching, however, as they are based on horror, i know that the stories are unreal, as they are fictional, therefore i can't take them all seriously. nightbeed, on the other hand, is a unique horror genre as it has a feel of realism that i've seen in very few other horror films.this films story on how a man gets murdered and ends up living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with undead monsters is the kind of story a person would get from a dreaming nightmare as its a very unique and original storyline. most horror films i've seen are all quite fake, but because nightbreed was so incredibly sophisticated and geniously directed with superb acting, especially by craig sheffer (aaron boone) amazing special effects, great lighting and fantastic dialogue, i found this film to have a sense of depth and maturity with no silly fake horror parody, whatsoever, that many other horror films have. nightbreed, as well as being horror has elements of thriller, romance and action all rapped in one. if you haven't seen this film, i recommend you watch it, as i rate it a 10/10.

i did something a little daring tonight when i watched this movie. i attempted to wean myself from silent movie scores. sure, when this film originally was distributed, a piano score was probably played with it. oftentimes, the director would choose the score himself (charlie chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films). but most of the music you hear on vhs tapes over silent films is in no way the same music that was supposed to be played when the film was first released. and, then again, there were plenty of silent films that were played without a score. i do not know the history of potemkin's score, so i decided to watch it for the medium this piece of art was produced within - film. soon after i turned the music off, unaided (or should i say unimpeded) by the musical interpretation of the emotions on screen, i became utterly attached to the film. visually, it is easily one of the most stunning of all films. eisenstein was a master of composition. the editing, possibly the cinematic technique eisenstein is most famous for (montage), is extraordinary. the mood of this film is anger, and it stirred my passions violently. it takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent film, especially a drama, but films like battleship potemkin prove that this effort is entirely worth it. come on! you owe it to yourself to watch this film! your education is incomplete without it.

there are only a handful of movies that were made on such a grand scale and made such a difference in the art of movie making."bronenosets potyomkin" is one of these movies, and it should be on anyone's list looking to learn more about the history of cinema. grigori aleksandrov & sergei m. eisenstein directed this groundbreaking film that documents the horrors taking place on a russian battleship. when the sailors finally retaliate against their superiors, the locals embrace the them, and support them. things get ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to take care of business. what follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema. anyone who has seen "the untouchables", and "bronenosets potyomkin" knows exactly what i mean.overall i think this movie raised the bar for film making just as "intolerance" did a few years earlier. if you do not mind silent films, do yourself a favor, and see "bronenosets potyomkin". if you don't like silent films..... watch "bronenosets potyomkin" anyway. 

the battleship potemkin is now the oldest film i've seen and it is also the first silent film i've seen. i heard a lot of good things about this movie so i got the tape out at home and i watched it. when it ended i just thought that this was a classic masterpiece. the story is based on the real-life russian battleship potemkin. you wouldn't think it but some of it was sad and disgusting. sad being that the mother dies and the pram rolls down the stairway and disgusting being they have to eat rotten meat with maggots in it.today it is still considered to be one of the best silent and russian films ever made. i think that everyone should see it (if they can find it.) you will be presently surprised at how good it is. it's a must see classic. 5/5.

on june 14 1905, during the russian revolution of that year, sailors aboard the russian battleship potemkin rebelled against their oppressive officers. frustrated with the second-rate treatment they receive, and most particularly the maggot-infested meat that they are forced to eat, the ship's crew, led by the inspirational bolshevik sailor grigory vakulinchuk (aleksandr antonov), decide that the time is ripe for a revolution. and so begins sergei m. eisenstein's rousing classic of russian propaganda, 'bronenosets potyomkin / the battleship potemkin.'the film itself is brimming with shining examples of stunning visual imagery: the spectacles of an overthrown ship captain dangle delicately from the side rope over which he had been tossed; the body of a deceased mutineer lies peaceful upon the shore, the sign on his chest reading "killed for a bowl of soup;" close-up shots of the clenching fists of the hundreds of spectators who are finally fed up with the tsarist regime; a wayward baby carriage careers down the odessa steps as desperate onlookers watch on with bated breath (this scene was memorably "borrowed" by brian de palma for a particularly suspenseful scene in his 'the untouchables'); the barrels of numerous canons are ominously leveled towards the vastly-outnumbered battleship potemkin.however, the film itself is best analysed  not as a fragmented selection of memorable scenes  but as a single film, and, indeed, every scene is hugely memorable. though divided into five fairly-distinct chapters, the entire film flows forwards wonderfully; at no point do we find ourselves losing interest, and we are absolutely never in doubt of whose side we should be sympathetic towards.the film is often referred to as "propaganda," and that is exactly what it is, but this need not carry a negative connotation. 'the battleship potemkin' was produced by eisenstein with a specific purpose in mind, and it accomplishes this perfectly in every way. planned by the soviet central committee to coincide with the 20th century celebrations of the unsuccessful 1905 revolution, 'potemkin' was predicted to be a popular film in its home country, symbolising the revitalization of russian arts after the revolution. it is somewhat unfortunate, then, that eisenstein's film failed to perform well at the russian box-office, reportedly beaten by allan dwan's 1922 'robin hood' film in its opening week and running for just four short weeks. luckily, despite being banned on various occasions in various countries, 'the battleship potemkin' fared more admirably overseas.the film also proved a successful vehicle for eisenstein to test his theories of "montage." through quick-cut editing, and distant shots of the multitudes of extras, the audience is not allowed to sympathise with any individual characters, but with the revolutionary population in general. eisenstein does briefly break this mould, however, in a scene where vakulinchuk flees the ship officer who is trying to kill him, and, of course, during the renowned odessa steps sequence, as our hearts beat in horror for the life of the unfortunate child in the tumbling baby carriage. the accompanying soundtrack to the version i watched, largely featuring the orchestral works of dmitri shostakovich, served wonderfully to heighten the emotional impact of such scenes.one of the greatest films of the silent era, 'the battleship potemkin' is a triumph of phenomenal film-making, and is a significant slice of cinematic history. the highly-exaggerated events of the film (among other things, there was never actually any violent massacre on the odessa steps) have so completely engrained themselves in the memory, that we're often uncertain of the true history behind the depicted events. this is a grand achievement.

the battleship potemkin was said to have been a favourite of charlie chaplin. it presents a dramatised version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the russian battleship potemkin rebelled against their officers of the tsarist regime.the film is a textbook cinema classic, and a masterpiece of creative editing, especially in the famous odessa steps sequence in which innocent civilians are mown down in the bloodshed; the happenings of a minute are drawn into five by frenzied cross-cutting. the film contains 1,300 separate shots, and in 1948 and 1958 was judged the best film ever made by a panel of international critics. the battleship potemkin is in the public domain, in some parts of the world.

the silent film masterpiece battleship potemkin (1925) was commissioned by the soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905 and to establish the event as an heroic foreshadowing of the october revolution of 1917. ironically the film's director, sergei eisenstein, was one of the earliest and most influential advocates of a formalistic approach to film art. subsequently, eisenstein's formalism and suspect politics would cause innumerable conflicts with government agencies insisting on "socialist realism." influenced by the russian film theoretician, lev kuleshov, and through him by d. w. griffith's intolerance (smuggled into russia in 1919), eisenstein constructed his films from a "collision" of rapidly edited images, a montage of shots varied in length, motion, content, lighting, and camera angle. without question the most memorable illustration of eisenstein's stylistic approach - and probably the single most cited and studied sequence in world cinema history - is the "odessa steps" sequence in potemkin.in structure potemkin is a "five reeler" divided into five narrative parts, an organization clearly derived from the five-act arrangement of western drama. in "men and maggots," eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and discontent of the battleship's working class sailors as the situation inevitably builds to mutiny. even before the sailors and their upper class officers/masters are visually introduced, eisenstein establishes revolutionary conditions symbolically by the collision editing of waves breaking violently and ominously at sea. onboard ship we witness crowded, unsanitary conditions. eisenstein emphasizes the sailors' dehumanization with shots of arbitrary lashings, harsh labor, and - most memorably - the maggot infested meat intended for the evening's meal. the ship's nearsighted physician is brought forward by the other officers to declare the meat perfectly suitable to be served with the dark soup, boiling like the sailors' rage. in accordance with marxist maxims, the church also fails the men, and we see one of them smashing a plate inscribed with words from the lord's prayer from two different camera angles (in perhaps the first deliberate "jump cut" in cinema history).identified by inter-titles as "drama on the quarterdeck" and "an appeal from the dead," potemkin's second and third parts depict the actual mutiny and the onshore funeral of its leader and first hero of the revolution, vakulinchuk. united by vakulinchuk's appeals to brotherhood, the initial mutineers are joined by the entire crew in an attack on the officers. a chaotic scene ensues whose violent passion is served well by eisenstein's editing techniques. the officers' quarters are trampled and symbols of their privilege are destroyed. the ship's doctor is thrown overboard, accompanied by dramatic crosscuts to the maggot-ridden meat and his eyeglasses metonymically dangling in the rigging. tragically, vakolinchuk's death is the price paid for the revolt (no omelet without breaking eggs) and he is laid out with dignity on an odessa pier. hundreds of ordinary odessa citizens gather with the sailors to honor him and to pledge "death to the oppressors." shots of fists clenching and unclenching signal the birth of revolutionary consciousness.the complex and unforgettable odessa steps sequence constitutes the film's fourth act. it begins with uplifting music and a series of close-ups and medium shots on the elated faces of diverse people on the shore and selected objects (parasol, eyeglasses, baby carriage). suddenly (as exclaims a title card in huge letters) the music stops and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps. here eisenstein releases the full force of collision editing as nearly a hundred shots are pieced together to contrast the panicked mayhem and victimization of the citizenry with the relentless assault of the soldiers driving the citizens down to the trampling horses and flying sabers of the waiting cossacks below. the mise-en-scene is framed by a statue of caesar at the top of the stairs and a church at the bottom, symbolic metonyms for russia's oppressive institutions: tsarist monarchy and the orthodox christian church.punctuating the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children. in the first, a mother and young boy who had been introduced among the joyous faces in the crowd are among the slaughter's first victims. the boy is shot, but the mother continues running until close-ups of her face convey her horrified gaze at the son's fallen body being trampled by the crowd. with a much slowed editing pace, the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of her child up the stairs to confront the soldiers (shown only in a diagonal shadow line). they summarily shoot her dead. after this lull, the carnage continues for another several dozen cuts until a second mother is shot through the stomach (the womb of mother russia?) as she tries to shield her baby in its carriage. in a scene famously imitated in the untouchables, the carriage incongruously slips down the staircase. horrified faces of huddled citizens watch the slow progress to its doom. when the carriage reaches the bottom there is a cut to a cossack wielding a sword and a classic kuleshov effect suggests what we do not actually see: the slaughtering of this pure and symbolic innocent. the final series of shots in the odessa sequence is of three stone lions, one in repose, one sitting up, and one roaring. the editing animates them into a visual metaphor of the people's awakened rage.somewhat anticlimactically, the fifth act returns us to the battleship as the mutinous sailors flee on the high seas and await an encounter with other ships from the fleet. they and the viewer expect retribution, but when the meeting occurs no shots are fired and instead all the sailors wave and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of comradeship. eisenstein was rewriting history at this point since the revolution was not successfully launched for another twelve years. but that quibble aside, battleship potemkin stands as one of the seminal works of the silent film era, and it retains extraordinary cinematic power.

eisenstein created the russian montage theory, and this film is his finest example. it took years before someone could utilize his ideas and make them work (the limey, 1999). nonetheless, the baby carriage scene really demonstrates the discombobulated nature of rmt. granted, like most movies, it gets long in some parts, the beauty of the film is amazing. one of the best silent films i have ever seen.

sergei eisenstein's most famous movie has truly withstood the test of time. the story of a mutiny aboard a warship in 1905 does have the feeling of soviet propaganda, but does a good job showing the conditions that led to the revolt. the scene on the odessa steps should remain seared into anyone's mind.okay, so "the battleship potemkin" wasn't actually the first movie to use montage, but they did a great job with it here. certainly any film history class should show this movie. it's a great historical drama (although i will admit that i don't know how accurate it is). a 10/10.oh, and we should have learned by now that "potemkin" should be transliterated as "potyomkin".

originally supposed to be just a part of a huge epic the year 1905 depicting the revolution of 1905, potemkin is the story of the mutiny of the crew of the potemkin in odessa harbor. the film opens with the crew protesting maggoty meat and the captain ordering the execution of the dissidents. an uprising takes place during which the revolutionary leader is killed. this crewman is taken to the shore to lie in state. when the townspeople gather on a huge flight of steps overlooking the harbor, czarist troops appear and march down the steps breaking up the crowd. a naval squadron is sent to retake the potemkin but at the moment when the ships come into range, their crews allow the mutineers to pass through. eisenstein's non-historically accurate ending is open-ended thus indicating that this was the seed of the later bolshevik revolution that would bloom in russia. the film is broken into five parts: men and maggots, drama on the quarterdeck, an appeal from the dead, the odessa steps, and meeting the squadron.eisenstein was a revolutionary artist, but at the genius level. not wanting to make a historical drama, eisenstein used visual texture to give the film a newsreel-look so that the viewer feels he is eavesdropping on a thrilling and politically revolutionary story. this technique is used by pontecorvo's the battle of algiers.unlike pontecorvo, eisenstein relied on typage, or the casting of non-professionals who had striking physical appearances. the extraordinary faces of the cast are what one remembers from potemkin. this technique is later used by frank capra in mr. deeds goes to town and meet john doe. but in potemkin, no one individual is cast as a hero or heroine. the story is told through a series of scenes that are combined in a special effect known as montage--the editing and selection of short segments to produce a desired effect on the viewer. d.w. griffith also used the montage, but no one mastered it so well as eisenstein.the artistic filming of the crew sleeping in their hammocks is complemented by the graceful swinging of tables suspended from chains in the galley. in contrast the confrontation between the crew and their officers is charged with electricity and the clenched fists of the masses demonstrate their rage with injustice.eisenstein introduced the technique of showing an action and repeating it again but from a slightly different angle to demonstrate intensity. the breaking of a plate bearing the words "give us this day our daily bread" signifies the beginning of the end. this technique is used in last year at marienbad. also, when the ship's surgeon is tossed over the side, his pince-nez dangles from the rigging. it was these glasses that the officer used to inspect and pass the maggot-infested meat. this sequence ties the punishment to the corruption of the czarist-era.the most noted sequence in the film, and perhaps in all of film history, is the odessa steps. the broad expanse of the steps are filled with hundreds of extras. rapid and dramatic violence is always suggested and not explicit yet the visual images of the deaths of a few will last in the minds of the viewer forever.the angular shots of marching boots and legs descending the steps are cleverly accentuated with long menacing shadows from a sun at the top of the steps. the pace of the sequence is deliberately varied between the marching soldiers and a few civilians who summon up courage to beg them to stop. a close up of a woman's face frozen in horror after being struck by a soldier's sword is the direct antecedent of the bank teller in bonnie in clyde and gives a lasting impression of the horror of the czarist regime.the death of a young mother leads to a baby carriage careening down the steps in a sequence that has been copied by hitchcock in foreign correspondent, by terry gilliam in brazil, and brian depalma in the untouchables. this sequence is shown repeatedly from various angles thus drawing out what probably was only a five second event.potemkin is a film that immortalizes the revolutionary spirit, celebrates it for those already committed, and propagandizes it for the unconverted. it seethes of fire and roars with the senseless injustices of the decadent czarist regime. its greatest impact has been on film students who have borrowed and only slightly improved on techniques invented in russia several generations ago.

i think it was a pretty good film. it shows how someone grew up in an environment that created a rich and powerful man but unfortunately because of his ambition and the people around him it led to his destruction. it shows that you can't trust anyone especially in a world that deals with a lot of money and envy.the character that i mostly liked was sebeva. she was another ambitious, powerful and ruthless woman in a man's world who loved and respected kilo. she also knew that business was business and a dangerous one. everything she did was risky but got the job done. she helped kilo become rich with her connections. overall, i really liked this film and have it in my collection and waiting for el padrino 2.

this film is just really great. i don't know why. i alway have a weakness for damian chapa. it's not scarface, but still i really enjoyed my self. this is a film i can see more than ten times. he really try's to make a good movie, but he just can't do it. i feel pity for him, so maybe it's a bit of a sympathy vote. i can't help it, but i just can't give it less than 9 stars. everyone should have seen this once in his life. to see how to make a cheap film work. i live in holland and bought this film for only one euro! that's 1,50 dollar. i would have also bought it for ten euro. great great great. on a little dutch film site this film gets a 101 votes. here only a 260. that's not so much more. so people all over the world. buy this movie!

i liked this movie. that's pretty much all i can say about it. lou gossett did a good job, even though i'm still very disappointed in him after all the iron eagle movies. and even if i was smiling on the inside when the first main teenager dies (i won't give it away) it was done in a nice, fitting fashion. pretty much everyone in this movie does a good job, so check it out! it's another one of those movies i found real cheap, so i bought it, and i recommend the same.

i don't understand how people could not like this movie. you have gossit jr., the kid who played the main character in stand by me, sean astin, and many other great actors. lots of action and fun that you don't see in today's movies anymore. it's really a shame. this is an underrated movie that is among other great movies like let's get harry. the 80's and early 90's created such great movies that will never again be topped by today's standards. they tried to somehow recreate this movie in masterminds, but came up short with some really bad acting. the only thing that movie had going was patrick stewart, but obviously that wasn't enough.

being raised at the time this movie was released has probably influenced my shallow mind, but still, this isn't a bad movie by any means. it's a movie about a hostage situation involving a prep school populated to some extent by endearing teenage boys who can't seem to get out of trouble. what's wrong with that? it doesn't have any big special effects, but so what? who needs special effects? cinema's decline began around the same time that special effects were popularized. a coincidence? i think not. it turned movies with potentially good plot and feelings and turned them into a big, substance-less light show for innocent kids and the self-medicated. well, you know, not all movies need special effects. about three fourths of the movies on the imdb top 250 are without special effects, but almost all of the top grossing movies of all time have some special effects. think about it: star wars, e.t., ghostbusters, etc. all good movies, but the rest of the top-grossing movies are usually cliched tripe with non-sensical plots and lots of eye candy. well some movies don't need ny of that junk.excuse me for going off on a tangent, which i normally do, but i'm just so fed up with that special effects junk. back to the point: toy soldiers is simply a great movie. i admit, some of the content is a little corny and ripped off, but so what, every movie rips off another to some extent. think of resovoir dogs. countless "appreciation" sites dictate the fact that beloved quentin tarentino, who i admit i like, has copied many, many, many movies in the making of his first major film reservoir dogs. many say that the entire plot is ripped off almost scene for scene from japanese and chinese gangster movies which mr. tarentino loved so much, and probably still does. sorry once again for the tangent.toy soldiers is fun. it has the whole insubordination from teenagers to unwanted members of authority, i.e. hostage takers. it's fun to see kids take over when they're being held to something they don't want to do. hell, teenage angst-inspired rebelion was the key topic to a great majority to 80's comedies. plus there's the tension and thrill of having the characters use fire-arms and knock out the bad guys, etc. plus there's some emotional points to the film. when one of the characters dies the others have to cope and adjust. it's not perfect acting but it beats most of the other tripe out there.in short, toy soldiers is exciting, interesting, and fun. how dare you jaded blowhards rate this movie poorly! shame on you all!personal rating: 8/10

i have nothing but praise for this movie and cast, especially ann margaret. but more importantly i have praise for my in-laws who were (are) the adoptive parents of warren and frank in real life. i met most of the "children" at warren's wedding in 1989. this is an amazing story and is even more incredible to me knowing the family and what everyone went through. it is also enjoyable for me to see how my in-laws were portrayed in the movie. it was pretty accurate. my wife even enjoys seeing some little details such as a toaster that she remembered from her childhood. yes, it is a hard movie to watch, but so amazing and heartfelt.the beauty of this story for me is how many of the children passed through my in-laws lives and, as a result of marrying their daughter,and having warren as a brother-in-law, how many i have met in mine. for the past 20 years this story has been a part of my life because of what my mother-in-law has shared with me. that and knowing warren. for what it is worth, warren lives in california with his family. he married his high school sweetheart, who he reconnected with at his 20 year high school reunion.there was a show in the 1980's called "that's incredible." they had a reunion of the family who also got to meet the cast of the show.for anyone's interest, the dvd is available in great britain and australia. it is a tough video to come by here in the united states and i have not been able to find a dvd here, yet.

ann-margret did the best job she has ever done in her history of film making. i felt as if she was mrs. frey. there might be one or two films of ann-margret's i have not seen since her film debut in "pocket full of miracles" with betty davis in 1961. i feel she has been totally under-rated in the industry. though she was nominated for an emmy award for this role in "who will love my children," she was overlooked. like she was nominated for an academy award for her roles in "carnal knowledge" and "tommy," she was snubbed. over all, i think everyone did a superb acting job including all the children in "who will love my children." yes, it is a sad movie (as true stories can be), but well worth the time. thank you.

this movie is based on the true story of iowa housewife lucille fray, who got breast cancer after the birth of her 10th child. realizing that the state would take the children away from her ineffectual, alcoholic husband, she devoted the last year of her life traveling around the state to find new homes for each of the children. a terrific script - which still holds up 20 years after it was first made. the grown children, many of whom had not seen each other since their mother died in the late 50's, were reunited on "that's incredible," prior to the film's airing in 1983. barbara stanwyck won the emmy for best actress in a tv movie or mini-series, but during her acceptance speech, she went out of her way to single ann-margret out for her moving performance.

i originally saw this on its premiere in the uk. i was mesmerised by it, and it had me in tears all throughout its duration. i taped it off the tv for safekeeping, but over the years, it's worn out. and tv never seem to show it. therefore it was a joy to find out that true movies own the copyright and were showing it on their channels. this time, i taped it onto a dvd, so i can enjoy it again and again.lucile fray (played magnificently by ann - margret) discovers she has cancer, and that it is terminal. her husband has arthritis, and, although he is loving, he is an alcoholic, and would be incapable of taking care of their children after she has gone. therefore, she has to find new homes for each of her children before she dies.the acting is top notch, the music beautiful, and it has stood the test of time wonderfully (it still makes me cry!) if you ever get the chance, you would be silly to miss this. it is a wonderful film! a must see for everyone!!!

i was still living with my parents when they aired this on dutch tv. usually i was the one watching movies with the other's not caring. but somehow we all sat down and watched this movie. this kinda movie used to be aired at wednesday-evening. it is the story of a woman who'll die soon. but before she dies she wants to make sure her ( many ) kids will have the best possible foster-parents. so we were watching this and my dad ( the most emotional of the four of us) started to cry. i followed almost immediately and before long my sister and mother were teared up too. there we were, totally moved by this simple but heartbreaking story. if you want a good cry, this is the one for you!

this has to be the ultimate chick flick ever. we taped it off the t.v. years ago and i've watched it about 30 times over the years. i hadn't seen it for about 12 years and just recently watched this movie. i'm not lying, i cried from the opening credits to the ending credits. this movie truly tears your heart out, even if you don't have children.

"who will love my children" saddest movie i have ever seen. definite 10/10. released on tv in 1983. movie has been released on vhs. dvd release is a must, sooner rather than later. mother dying of cancer, must find homes for all her children before she dies, because her thoughts are that her husband and father of the kids is not capable of caring for them once she has died. she manages to find homes for the children except one, a young boy whom is not wanted because he suffers from epilepsy. very sad when your not wanted. in for a real good tear jerker, get your hands on this movie. i'm a male even i cried when i watched this movie. not to be missed.

i watched this film many years ago on tv and taped it from there i could never really understand why my own mother was upset watching it! it was because i was so young at the time. i have just sat and watched this film again i now have 2 children of my own and i had to try and fight the tears back but that didn't happen i was crying through most of the film it just go's to show how different you feel when you have children of your own! such an amazing family such a heart wrenching film truly wonderful! someone has said about 8 still living any more news are you all still in touch i would love to know! touched by the film all over!

i saw this movie when it was broadcast on television in february of 1983. i was in the hospital, having just given birth to my first and only child. i'll refrain from telling you the extent to which i was moved. suffice it to say that the memory of the movie has remained with me to this day, almost 23 years later. i hope i can find a copy of this movie, if such a thing was ever made. this movie should be remembered fondly by anyone who ever saw it. however, i must admit that the fact it remains somewhat obscure is just fine by me. this way, it will always be a small secret to me and those who were also moved by it. i never saw ms. margaret perform a better part. nor have i ever seen her in a more convincing role. i will forever respect her just for accepting such a lovely part.

who will love my children has changed my heart, it made me cry all the way through, the most i cried with was when the family had to say goodbye to the baby, i cried the most with that, and each time a child was adopted, i cried when they had to say goodbye to their mother, it was sad for them to lose their mother, i felt sorry for the kid with epilepsy, i was glad he was adopted by the same family as one of his brothers. to me that boy i thought was the special one because he was going in a home. i feel that i am special because i am in a world with aspergers syndrome and sometimes when i feel down, i sometimes like to cry. i really enjoyed this movie, 10 out of 10. a true story, very good. another movie that would bring tears to your eyes i think would haver to be tuesday's with morrie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805)

most definitely the saddest movie i have ever seen. a must see, just so you can walk away and realise just how precious your life and loves are. the acting is superb, the story line potentially 'real'.remains a firm favourite of mine even after all this time.

i was just looking up " who will love my children" to buy, when i came across this web site and an entry made by a fellow briton!! i am a great fan of this movie and would, and have, recommended it to all. what i found comforting is to find someone else who also finds comfort in the good will of others. i also have a son with aspergers (amongst other things) and it is also a fear of mine to think if anything ever happened to me and my husband, that someone would not only want to take on just my beautiful 'normal' daughter, but my special and gifted son also. missing home and being able to relate to people raised with the same values as myself has more meaning than you know. living here in the us i have yet to meet anyone who has seen this movie. so to all of you reading this, if you have not seen it, make an effort to do so. it is a very moving experience, especially for anyone who is a parent, or even if you just have a sympathetic bone in your body, you will cry, and beg. after that you will count your blessings, and to anyone who has ever been through an experience like , or close to this one, my heart goes out to you. it makes me realize no matter how hard or stressful thing get, just remind yourself that there is always someone worse off than you. an amazing movie and what makes it more powerful is the fact that it is based on a true story. do not be put off by how sad it is, at the same time this movie is heart warming, and makes you feel encouraged about the strength and goodness of mankind.

i quite this anne rice book adaption. while most of the film is filmed here in australia it offers a great amount of scenery and a fantastic area to shoot in. lestat (stuart townsend) has recently woke up from a long period time of sleep and has decided to betray his vampire oath by revealing himself to a band. when he becomes a popular movie icon his fellow vampires, understadebly, go mad and plot his death. meanwhile jesse (marguerite moreau) a orphaned member of the supernatural studies, who has an ancient vampire family tree, has become deeply obsessed with lestat. her boss david (paul mcgann) understands her obsession and revaeals his obsession with the vampire marius, (vincent perez)who is an ancient vampire and the man who made lestat a vampire too. jesse is given lestats diary and reads of his first killing and an encounter with the queen of the damned- akasha (aaliyah). when lestat holds a concert in death valley he receives news that not only will angry vampires be there akasha may come as well. meanwhile akasha has other plans. she goes to a vampire coven, a bar, and kills everyone in her path. with lestat tempted with royality and loving care by akasha the ancient vampires consisting of marius and jesses aunt maharet (lena olin) plot against them. join her or die?i thought the film was fantastic, it had great fight scenes, great music and great locations. aaliyah sadly passed away in a plane crash shortly before the films premiere, but she looked stunning on the set and off the sets.i gave this film 10/10 because it was a fantastic film and i urge you to see it!

personally, i loved tris movie! my best friend told me about it so i rented it out a watched it. it's amazing! the music, the acting, the story lines the emotion, everything...... well except for one minor fact. absolutely no loyalty to the books at all. i saw this movie before interview with the vampire and before i even knew the books existed, so i was shocked to find how many people actually hated the movie. i picked up quickly that the book fans weren't at all happy with the unfaithfulness, not wanting to be hypocritical (i hate the harry potter movies due to lack of book loyalty)i stayed silent. eventually i picked up "the vampire lestat" and understood immediately why everyone hated it. it is completely different (the movie queen of the damned is a combination of "the vampire lestat" and "the queen of the damned"). but i still loved the movie from when i saw it before reading any of the books. so if you haven't seen this movie or read the book watch the movie first or you'll hate it. if you have read the book then you have every right to hate this movie.

***may contain spoilers*** ok, it wasn't exactly as good as expected in fact it was a lot different than i had thought it would be but it still turned out to be a pretty good movie.i usually don't care too much for that type of music but in this movie it worked perfectly (i mean duh he's a rock star) but anyway i loved stuart townsend in this, and aaliyah, although she had a small part in the movie was amazing.and even though tom cruise played lestat in the interview with a vampire, i have to admit that i am glad he turned down the role even though i normally hate when they use different people to play the same characters in like sequels and stuff.overall, the movie was great and i enjoyed watching it, even if there were parts that could have been better. great vampire movie.

i have to say this movie is absolutely amazing. i don't understand why it got such a low rating. it has romance, music, darkness and vampires. also stuart townsend did a great job of being lestat, the acting was great. also, normally i am not into that music, well sometimes. but i have to say in this movie the music fit it perfectly. if you like dark movies about vampires this is definitely for you or even if you don't there is a love story to this.but,all i can say is one word: amazing! my rating is defiantly: 10 out of 10. anyway, i seriously suggest you watch it. i remember not seeing this for years, i watched it again about a year ago and im addicted to it again. lol. great movie!!!

okay... first to anne rice book fans....sure lestat's eyes are not blue...sure he isn't blond in this movie... but even though marius is not lestat's maker...even though they completely altered the story.....how can u say its not a good movie..this movie...is the best vampire movie i ever saw...and lestat is pictured perfectly in it....maybe not his features...but i don't think one can find a better lestat....the way he speaks...and the way he looks at mere mortals...his arrogance..and sheer love for fame is pictured flawlessly.if u for once...consider it just a movie..and not try and relate every scene to the book...u will love the movie as much as i do.now...to the non readers..be prepared to fall absolutely in love with this movie....it has every thing....and the goth music...is like an added treat... the dialogues...are beautiful...and catching...and even though its a vampire movie..u will find yourself smiling...at the wit of the characters...and u will find yourself sympathizing with the vampires..overall...one of my fav movies...!!10/10

i remember disliking this movie the 1st time i saw it, but it has grown on me. i love the costumes and poses the actors make, the humor, the cinematography, the soundtrack. the scenes are very rich, and it moves very quickly. every time i watch it, there is something new that catches my eye. aaliyah as akasha is probably the only thing that ruins it, but not enough.also, the lestat in this movie is different, it is not the same character. you can see that the character armand has been given lestat-like qualities because i'm assuming anne wanted it in. but there is no reason to trash this movie just because it's not like books, it's a fascinating by itself.

this has been one of the best vampire movies that i have seen in a long time. it was very seductive and alluring, i liked that it did not have the usual gore and carnage that comes along with most vampire movies. the music was excellent. it would be great if there was a sequel.

"queen of the damned" is one of the best vampire movies i had ever seen! the movie had suspense, action, and gore. the combination of the fierce demanding attitude of the queen and the rock mood of our star, very well acted by stuart townsend, makes a wonderfully done movie that only this combination can create. i'm always the one to give advice to my friends and family members on which movies are worthy of renting and when they ask me if "queen of the damned" is worthy, i tell them it's worthy of buying. this movie is most for sure a must-have in all horror movie lovers' homes!

after going to sleep out of sheer loneliness, lestat wakes from a 100-year sleep to the sounds of a new music he wants to be a part of and the band "the vampire lestat" is born. his longing to end his loneliness and his "living in the light" attitude along with his music, anger his fellow vampires and awaken an evil that has been slumbering for thousands of years.this film is not for those looking for a true book-to-film adaptation. those who have read the books and expect to see it on the screen are in for a huge disappointment. this film will appeal to those who really enjoyed the "interview with the vampire" film.there are a few plot holes and incongruencies, but as a whole, this film was satisfying. stuart townsend portrays lestat with a sensuality and sexiness lacking in the previous film. the relationships portrayed in the film were very sexy and sizzling.as a film, the story compels you and draws you in. casting is wonderful. loved this story and film. if you like simmering sensuality and sexual tension you'll love this film!

i thought that this was actually the best vampire movie that i've ever seen. i've seen a lot too. the effects were great, and the casting was brilliant. it was an all around good movie. the makeup and costumes were great too. i would recommend it, but not for kids. it's not a children's movie.

the movie, although not faithful to the original novels, succeeds in creating modern gothic vampire vision. somebody tried to insult qotd calling it a 1,5h music video clip. actually it is a complement. the everpresent gothic music combined with the music-video-like shots made the movie so moody - and "queen of the damned" is a mood-driven story.i do not understand the die hard fans who complain on the modifications of the story. the plot has been modified to be less confusing for viewers who do not know the novels. the number of characters had been lessened and i have no problems with changing lestat's maker or skipping mekare's character. the biggest change - the romance of lestat and jesse - seemed a very nice addition to me.actually, i think that a faithful adaptation would be a complete failure. the slow and gloomy mood, that was perfect to xixth century new orlean and louis's angst, wouldn't fit lestat's rebellion and his music. and while the book can be slow, descriptive and combining multiple elements yet conveying them well, the movie simply cannot do it without turning chaotic. "vampire lestat" and "queen of the damned" can be split into at least three movies - the creators had to choose something.some of the special effects, like the flying or walking out of the flames were the only thing i actually didn't like in this movie. but akasha's death was very nice. the cast was good, stuard townsend was convincing as lestat, especially on the concert, but i preferred banderas as armand. i loved jesse, maharet and marius though. and of course aaliyah was perfect with her quasi-ancient-egyptian accent.so if you are into gothic music and vampiric dillemas of loneliness and eternity (and you don't consider books to be movie scenarios) "queen of the damned" is one of the few movies which show vampires as something more than blood sucking monsters. but please do not compare it to the "interview" movie. it has a completely different style, precisely as much different as different were louis and lestat. personally i find it thrilling first to watch a vampire's existence from louis' "bottled hunger" point of view, and then switching to one devoid of all morals but surprisingly outgoing for a vampire, lestat.i'd give "queen" 8 of 10 as it had some technical flaws, but i decided to give it 9 as it's vastly underrated by people who hate it simply because it didn't match their vision of the books, which can be clearly seen by looking at the votes breakdown.

despite the pans of reviewers, i liked this movie. in fact, i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat (stuart townsend) better than cruise's attempt. all the major players from the series were present: talbot, lestat, armand, maharet, khayman, pandora, mael, marius and a half-dozen more (albeit most of them in cameo). marius, lestat and akasha were the main players (and jesse of the talamasca). also, despite other reviews, i think this movie and the music was faithful to anne rice's portrayal and ethos, at least as i perceive it. aailiyah was pretty good as akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene). the movie didn't capture the breadth of the books series but i thought it was a nice supplement.i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style, sensitivities and treatments. and i found this movie a faithful and often superlative representation of the author's vision.

it has very little to do with the books: half of the characters have been eliminated, the plot has been greatly altered, people's parents are changed for different characters . . .however, if you watch it as an independent piece (try and forget you ever read the books) the movie is very well put together, everyone is very good looking, and there is even a sweet ending...

i've seen this movie countes times now and still can't get sick of it. it's like a frickin' drug. i know a lot of people don't like it but there's something about it that just draws me in. every single performance is spectacular, but aaliyah is the one who steals the show. she not only played the role of akasha she became it. her body movement and beauty was captured exceptionally well. it's also nice to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an egyptian queen (no, i'm not predjudice against white people, i am one). true it's not known what color the ancient egyptians really were but this was a nice change. stuart townsend completely made me forget about tom cruise's portrayel of lestat and marguerite was striking once again. all in all it was a good time at the movies. for those who haven't seen it, be sure to watch it with an open mind and not take it too seriously. i mean, it's a movie about a vampire who becomes a rock star. take it as that.

although this movie doesn't have the darkness of the books, it is in my opinion a great movie. it's great campy fun with the beautiful stuart townsend as lestat. he may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, but to be fair, he would not look good with blond hair, and lestat is most definitely about looking good. he moves like the predator i always imagined lestat would have. the visual effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. it's not interview with the vampire, so don't try to compare the two. interview is louis' story. this is a cut and paste version of lestat's. in any case, i highly recommend.

despite a few acceptable adaptations of the books' main themes, queen of the damned/the vampire lestat did not stay true to anne rices's complicated story telling. the deep layers that build up all the characters were shredded apart to only their surface, if not a completely different identity. the chronological order of the major events in the movie seemed warped and uneven.however, there were quite a few things the movie did to deserve my rating of 7. one was that the film strongly captured the affect that lestat (among other vampires)had to the public, especially young girls. the movie also did a fairly good job focusing on the importance of heredity and history that the vampires took pride in. the scenes of sensuality were also atmospherically satisfying.the acting in queen of the damned was moderate, if disappointing. stuart townsend and aaliyah have a surprising chemistry, though it only shows when the acting is at its best (not very often). the characters are nothing compared to the ones established in interview with a vampire. it also lacks the emotional intelligence of the feast of all saints, which is a shame because rice's queen of the damned book had that, and more.this movie doesn't give all that it appears to be. the effects are dull and very disappointing. the extravagance needed in many scenes is not given, and the dialog is tiring. the settings for many scenes are not how i pictured them in the book, and i think that many of them weren't even taken from the story. there are only a few areas of incoherence near the beginning and middle of the movie, but it wraps itself up fairly neatly, giving the viewer a full story (if they had not read the book).somethings that i feel the movie needed include a good original score (howard shore or elmer bernstein), instead of the mix of rock music; though i had no problem with some of the songs. another thing that would have made the movie better is better set direction. the scenery was boring as well as unclear, which is important in a story that moves around quite frequently.overall, queen of the damned was an unevenly disappointing yet somewhat satisfying adaption of the important novel. with a few simple changes, it may have been a very successful piece of film work. i'd recommend this movie for people who has seen interview or have read the books, so that they can make their own opinion on the adaption.

if vampire tales are your cup of blood, then this goth-fest based on the anne rice vampire chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience. a veritable consortium of the undead in a contemporary setting, `queen of the damned,' directed by michael rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness, and of the unfortunate souls who dwell therein for eternity.	the vampire lestat (stuart townsend), bored with a world that no longer excites him, has been `asleep' for many years; but suddenly, the sounds of that world he hears from his extended slumber change, and liking what he hears, he ventures forth to investigate. what he finds is a world filled with new sounds, a new kind of music-- driving and penetrating-- sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome. and he knows that at long last his time has come, that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms. toward that end he becomes the front man for a band-- a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known. he presents himself as a vampire, and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond london (where it all begins), and will ultimately take him to death valley, california, where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced.	lestat is powerful, without question, but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them, one of whom is marius (vincent perez), a vampire powerful in his own right-- the vampire, in fact, who `made' lestat so many years before-- and they are gathering, coming together and making their plans to meet lestat at the concert. and they are not going for the music. but there is something else, as well: at one point lestat has inadvertently awakened the `mother' of them all, the most powerful of all the vampires, akasha (aaliyah), who is about to make her presence known to all, and especially to the one she has chosen to rule by her side as her king: lestat. and at the concert, rest assured, akasha will be in attendance, without fail.	make no mistake, this is lestat's story, and rymer presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments, though his film has less bite to it than say, `interview with the vampire,' or `bram stoker's dracula.' he sets a good pace, and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills, but overall the film isn't as soaked in menace as it could be, or as much as one might expect. in the final tally, in fact, the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual blood-letting, though there is more than a taste of gore, and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff. there's some good f/x on hand, too, especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires, as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern. it's a decent job by rymer, but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by lestat; as it is, you get a sense of his detachment, but not enough to get you totally involved.	in `interview with the vampire,' tom cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of lestat, but townsend is even more effective, with a look and an attitude that captures lestat perfectly. he plays him with a sense of acceptance, and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing. it's a good performance, and one that sells his character convincingly.	as marius, vincent perez does a nice job, too-- he is, in fact, one of the strengths of the film-- though his character is a bit ambiguous; that, however, has more to do with the way he was written than with perez's performance, which is quite good. 	turning in noteworthy performances, as well, are marguerite moreau, as jesse, a young woman too curious for her own good; and the gorgeous lena olin as maharet, jesse's aunt, who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving lestat and akasha.	and as akasha, aaliyah is an absolutely riveting presence. what more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer, with tremendous talent and beauty. and, tragically, she has left us much too soon.	the supporting cast includes paul mcgann (david), christian manon (mael), claudia black (pandora), bruce spence (khayman), matthew newton (armand), tiriel mora (roger) and megan dorman (maudy). with a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre, anne rice fans, especially, will be pleased with `queen of the damned,' a film nicely crafted and delivered by director rymer and his engaging cast. by focusing attention on the drama of the story-- and the way it's presented-- rather than concentrating on merely providing some cheap thrills, rymer has succeeded in turning out a true horror film that is definitely a cut above, and one that just may whet your appetite for more of the same. and that's the magic of the movies. i rate this one 7/10.   

surface is one of the greatest t.v. series i have seen. the acting is great and the storyline enthralling. each episode left me barely able to wait to watch the next. i especially thought carter jenkins who played miles bennett did a superb job...he is a very talented actor and i look forward to seeing more of his work. i can't believe surface only made one season...once again the public has let me down. it is hard to fathom that a great shows like this one would get canceled, while crap reality shows continue on year after year. whoever made the decision to cancel this show really dropped the ball on this one.

once again, there's dastardly government agencies stopping at nothing to prevent public knowledge of some momentous events. in this case, the discovery of a new underwater species that could threaten the planet's ecology. although the creature is no e.t. he does seem to befriend one youngster, who protects it at all costs, not realising it is but an infant of the species and is going to get a lot bigger  and badder this 2005 series had a lot going for it. it is family drama, sci-fi, thriller with more than a few comedic moments. the characters are believable, well acted and well photographed. the show holds the attention. of course, as with any sci-fi show, suspension of disbelief has to be achieved. and i think it is here. alas, the series crashed after season one, so we never get a resolution. infuriating.. there is a general comment i feel worth making here. many tv networks and/or film distribution companies cancel, quite arbitrarily, seemingly excellent tv series  particularly intelligent sci-fi ones. now there may be some very good reasons for this, although the audiences are treated with utmost disdain and rarely told the reasons. this in itself is annoying. what really gets my goat is that, having cancelled the series, they then issue the thing as far as it's got, on dvd, in an obvious attempt to milk the cash cow as far as possible. for previous viewers of the series that's ok, they know what they're in for but  many of these unfinished series end on a cliffhanger. two that come to mind immediately are "surface", and "odyssey 5". if you've heard good things about the series and not seen it you go and buy the blasted dvd and end up with an unresolved plot issue  it makes me very angry!! i enjoyed "surface" immensely and didn't realise the poor characters would end up in a situation that looked totally untenable  and we'll never know what happened next. i believe that there should be a prominent notice on all such dvd issues, to the effect that the story is unfinished. nowadays i check on tv series purchases (imdb is an obvious excellent starting point) to find out whether a 'complete' series is really complete or not. buyer beware.

surface was one of the few truly unique shows on tv last season. i can honestly say i modified my schedule so i could be home to watch every episode. tons of action, suspense, science fiction, etc.story was of a boy who found an egg that hatched into a sea creature. the same sea creature that had killed the main character's brother and the woman character (oceanographer) had seen. most people think it is a deadly killing machine but the one raised from the egg was very friendly.only problem is nbc canceled it so now we'll never know what happens... hopefully sci-fi or some other channel will pick it up.

i have now seen the whole of season one and can say i have not enjoyed a show of this standard in a long time it great to see a show like this in the pipeline and hope that there are many on the way the season final was the best bar none cant wait for season 2 as far as i am conserned things can only get better like how will milles continu to change will rick get his family back and how will they get off the church roof with acting of this level it is easy to see why the show is such a big hit with people as long as people as making shows like this i will keep watching i think its hard now to come up with an original idea as so many shows have coverd a large range of subjects so to see one as original as this is refreshing

i thought this was a very good tv series and i would like to see it continue. it really got interesting there at the end and i really want to see where it is going from there. some times we are to quick to kill a series without giving it a chance. i think this one needs a chance to go on, and i will definitely be waiting for it. the ocean is one of the places that man knows so little about and i think that is a mystery in itself. what is waiting for us beneath the waters of the world. it is even said that man maybe crawled out or slivered out of the waters many millennium ago. is this a new evolution coming about? are we going to move down the food chain or fight for our position?

a new and innovative show with a great cast that keeps you on the edge of your seat. lake bell is wonderful..it is to bad that her other show "miss match" was canceled. i am just glad she came back on "surface". i can't wait for the return of "surface". this show is really something unique to watch. with an eerie underwater world that is akin to jurassic park, this show keeps you wondering what is next. nim is adorable even if he is going to turn into something larger and much more ominous. there are so many generic shows out there that just seem to rehash the same old subjects. when something like "surface" comes along you just have to say "thank you!".

this is the first sci fi series that i have seriously become hooked on since star trek, (and i haven't watched trek in years). it takes the invasion theme in somewhat different directions, but has done it in a very exciting way. it also borrows from soap opera format, where it continues the arc throughout the entire year run of the series. the cgi definitely doesn't overcome the plot or the characters, except for nim, the fledgling creature who is a pet with definite attitude. (anything that would show what he really thought about the neighbor's yippy dog is a-1 in my book.) he was a stroke of genius. i am left at the end of the finale asking questions (intelligent ones, i hope) and crossing my fingers and toes that nbc or someone else (sci fi, maybe) will continue to run the series and answer those questions. a really great, classy show.

i am sorry to see that surface has not been picked up for the nbc 2006-2007 season. i guess market demand for inane game and reality shows on broadcast television, a reflection on our sense of culture, has conquered a good story. i hope and pray that some network picks it up so it will continue on as does stargate and it's spin-offs.i also hope the producers find a venue where they can produce the level of post production they wished for in a tv guide interview. right now the reruns on sci-fi, marathons, will have to do. i for one would love to see where the story goes after the tsunami that ended episode 15. i would like to find out the mastermind of the efficient effort to obfuscate the real identity of the creatures.fyc morningbear

surface was awesome, i don't know how many mondays i survived at school just by thinking about the new episode of surface. i loved it, sometimes i had to call home and tell my mom to tape it for me. i was pretty upset when i heard it was cancelled, i mean jeez way to let us hang. so,they can have their new tina fay comedy(you couldn't pay me to watch that, i think seeing the commercials made me dumber). i'm gonna miss my monday night fix of surface, even if my sister did make fun of me. although,kidnapped does look good and, they still have l&o: svu (i think, i still have to check) (i only wrote the 2 lines above, because they said i needed ten lines).

surface, from the day its teaser first showed in the summer of 2005, was a tossup. on one hand, it seemed so high-concept and plot driven that to the passerby it felt like it would work out better as a motion picture (or several). plus, it felt like it was nbc's attempt at a "lost-killer". on the other hand, one may have realized that the story was too expansive to tell in a movie or two, and fans of lost seemed intrigued.so, after one (and possibly only) season on nbc, the show is on an indefinite hiatus that could either put it in the vault, on sci-fi, or filling a gap in nbc's lineup in the summer or fall of 2007 or beyond. its ratings were some of the better on the network (which isn't saying much), but the show has been taken off the air with no real official announcement of its future.so, is it worthwhile? yes.surface follows a continuing story format, driven by plot with next to no filler episodes. almost everything that happens on the show is important to the plot, much like a motion picture. no filler episodes, which put a pain in your side when you missed an episode. yet, the show's double-edge helped made up for that; big things seem to happen every episode, but since it feels like a movie you end every episode feeling like little happened and you're left wanting more! that trait of the show, though shows how great it is. the cast is solid; the three main leads, including the beautiful lake bell as laura daughtery, put in a solid performance every episode, each driven by their own reasons for finding/studying the creatures. the supporting cast, including ian anthony dale and the brief performance by rade serbedzija fill out the cast well. the story is slow to start (my one regret; it doesn't really pick up until a 3-4 episodes in to the short 15-episode season), but the latter half of the season makes up for it. the visual effects are stunning (one's jaw will drop when you see an overhead view of one of the creatures 'attack' a ship), as well.many of the show's problems can be remedied by purchasing the complete first season and not having to wait a week (or three) to watch the next episode.in short, if you've missed the first season and you're curious, go back and watch it. it's no twin peaks in terms of quirkiness, but the high-concept nature of it puts in in league with that, lost, and other similar shows, with a flair for action and adventure. enjoy it.

all i can say after watching the dvds of the first season is that i can not believe nbc "green-lighted" this show. it's so different than what's currently in vogue save for lost. those who miss the x-files just may have a worthy successor. not as mysterious or intense as lost, i find it to be overall more entertaining.this kind of extended story is hard to make. i mean it could degenerate into childish dribble if most of the elements do not cohere together. but cohere they do and i think the cast is excellent, the writing sharp, the location and props first rate, and the special effects very good for a television budget. sure it pushes what is plausible, but as it does it never gets so silly as to insult your intelligence.bottomline is that this is great sci-fi drama for the entire family. i doubt it will be a classic with a long run like x-files, but in the meantime i recommend getting the dvd if you missed it like i did the first time around. this fall my must see shows has just increased by one more series!ps: i just heard it got axed from nbc...here's hoping sci-fi picks it up.

as part of an initiation prank julie (meg tilly of psycho 2) has to spend the night in a mausoleum, but karl rhamarevich, a master of telekinesis has recently died and been put in there. when julie's fellow sorority sisters desecrate where he's housed the real terror starts.this little flick had a good deal of atmosphere and i enjoyed the build up, plus the last twenty minutes are just plain great. anyone who's looking for a lost gem of an '80's horror movie needn't look any further. highly under-appreciated. plus elizabeth daily is adorable.my grade: b media blaster dvd extras: disc 1) commentary with director tom mcloughlin and co-writer michael hawes; and trailers for "the being", "frankestien's bloody terror", "just before dawn", & "devil dog" disc 2) alternate director's cut (that's almost unwatchable due to a bad print) & behind-the-scenes featurette

"one dark night" is a staple in the 1980's low budget horror genre. filled with retro puns, clothing and scenery, "odn" transports the viewer to a simpler time, when horror films were just that... horror!nothing so intense that you can't understand whats going on, the film tells a dark fable of what happens when you mess with the dead. well acted by it's stable of scream-queens, and a fine directorial job by tom mcloughlin, whom revels in the time and makes you believe what he's presenting. there is no "who done it?" and certainly no big twist at the end. it is straight-forward and in your face horror from beginning to end, with a lot of 80's humor thrown in for added spice. i give it "8" simply because some of the special effects fall short towards the end of the film, but at least there is no cgi... perfect film for new fans to the 1980's horror genre, or anyone looking to re-live a fun night of classic horror bliss.

i also saw this at the cinema in the 80s and have never forgotten it, even though i have never seen it again anywhere. i don't know whether if i did see it now it would seem dated, but remembering the storyline and comparing it to some of the terrible modern films i've seen on zone horror i should think it would stand up very well.i can still remember his coffin sliding out and opening up and all the dead bodies becoming reanimated, and the blue lightning. having seen hundreds of horror movies and still remembering this one, it must be good.

i didn't know anything about this movie before i watched it. it seems to be a lesser-known teen horror from the 80's. what struck me were the ways it differed from so many other movies from that era.the first thing i noticed was how slowly this movie builds. it doesn't do the typical setup of showing characters being murdered one by one. it takes its time building the back story, leaving a little bit of mystery about what might happen. i was almost starting to think no one would even really get hurt in this movie. but everything leads to the climatic sequence during the last 15 minutes, and then it gets fairly graphic (this was a bad time to take a snack break--i almost couldn't finish my pizza once it started).the characters also seem slightly more three-dimensional than a lot of the cheap teen scare flicks. there conversations were refreshingly level-headed for the most part, as opposed to the over-the-top stereotypes you'd expect. for example, the girl who is the popular, snobby, queen-bee of the clique isn't constantly spouting insults at everyone, but is capable of having doubts and showing some consideration for others.so, to summarize, i felt this movie was somewhat original compared to what i expected, and a little better made as well. it drew me in, kept me interested, and then let me have it. as i said, it's pretty gory during the finale, but almost family friendly much of the rest of the time. i don't need to own it, but i'm glad i discovered it.

i saw this film when it was released to theaters. it's definitely one to remember, i had forgotten the title until recently. a friend found it via online search.one dark night is rather unusual for the suspense/horror genre of the time in that it contains no blood. it is of the teen fright variety yet the teens are respectable in their own ways. it's a nice, old-school film with props and scenes that reflect the times. our hero rides a motorcycle with no brain bucket, for example.as has been mentioned by previous reviewers, one dark night is currently available on dvd. the original negative was not available for the dvd transition. some reel changes are a bit rough but this doesn't take away from the story. that being said, the colors are vibrant and the lighting is very good.adam west plays a rather smallish part in this film as raymar's son-in-law. his role as an overbearing and indifferent husband is thankfully short.the story builds over the course of the film. unlike many horror films of the era, one dark night is a great suspense story that gives the viewer time to absorb what is happening.the final 20 minutes or so of one dark night are what make it so memorable. raymar's telekinetic abilities are used to open old graves in the mausoleum, pull the coffins out, open them and move the corpses around. attention was afforded to great detail in the final scenes. the rotting, worm-riddled corpses look quite real.

since jason and his ilk took over horror films circa 1980 most every horror film has involved a group of hormonally charged teenagers being chopped to bits with the focus on the chopping and not the suspense.this little film is different. made in the early 80's it does what every good horror film should do - bring your worst fears to life while you sit around just knowing that these horrors are just around the corner. then, you make those horrors simmer, just don't turn it into a lesson on the biology of butchering.the story features meg tilly right before she had a short-lived turn with fame starting with "the big chill" and then slipped back into obscurity in the early 90's. meg plays an outcast teenager who is just dying to get into the good graces of some classic mean girls. they tell her she can be part of their little group if she spends the night in a crypt. the mean girls intend to scare her and cause her to leave the crypt thus giving them a double reward - further tormenting the outcast girl and having an excuse to reject her.meanwhile famed occultist karl rhamarevich has died a bizarre death shortly after having claimed to have discovered a way to return from the grave and upon his return command great magical powers. his daughter doesn't believe this at first, but she listens to a tape about her father's experiments which included his successful animation of small dead animals and of his plans to emerge from the grave with the power to animate bigger game and draw further power from these animations. she also learns that she may have inherited her father's power and may be the only person who can stop him should he actually rise from the dead. i think you know where this story is headed, so i'll stop here. did i mention the magician was entombed in the same crypt in which meg tilly's character is spending the night?i will mention that the commercial dvd containing this film does look somewhat degraded compared to what you would expect from a film that was made so recently. i saw it on tv in the mid 1980's and i remember it looking better than this. the problem is that the original negative of the film was never located so the dvd had to be created from a print. this means it comes complete with dirt and scratches.this is worth checking out for any horror fan. it was an independently made film and an example of the kind of unusual stuff that you could commonly find on late night tv until the infomercial turned that time slot into a vast wasteland circa 1986. only tcm underground airs this kind of film anymore.

a bunch of sorority girls make a new pledge spend the night in a creepy mausoleum. of course the recently deceased don't stay deceased for long and all hell breaks loose."one dark night" is an enjoyable 80's horror with some ghastly dead bodies floating around that are being controlled by the spirit of a dead psychic raymar.there is no gore and nudity,but the atmosphere of a mausoleum is very eerie.the acting is solid,but the script takes too much time to develop the characters until the final 20 minutes that raymar finally breaks out of his grave.the cinematography is impressive and the the mausoleum is a great location for the climactic events.the film takes so long to get going and this is its major flaw.7 out of 10.

chris nolan's labyrinth like noir about voyeurism and identity is amazing from start to finish. a first film is as complex as "memento" or "the prestige", though maybe a little harder to get a handle on. still it smacks of originality and creative drive, and has a "twist" as intellectually challenging as it is realistic pulp. few film makers have made as good of use of their editors and attention to narrative that nolan has. the story is about a bored writer who likes to follow random strangers down the street, until he follows someone, whose noticed him following others, and has been following him in tern, from there the complexity escalates and identities begin to rearrange. more naturalistic and realist than nolan's later work but just as razor sharp.

following is a little-known 1998 british film, which was made with a budget of £8000 and has a running time of 70 minutes. when watching it, you'd never expect its director to go on to make it in hollywood and become one of the most acclaimed and celebrated directors of the 21st century  well, everybody has to start somewhere i suppose.the director of following, as you probably already know is englishman christopher nolan, who directly after following would go on to direct the critically-acclaimed independent film memento; a few years later he would be hired by warner bros. to direct the new batman series, which further brought him acclaim, and so on and so forth. my point is, everybody has to start somewhere  even if it's not in the most astounding debut  and christopher nolan introduces himself to the world in 1998 with following.when watching it, i couldn't help but draw resemblances to another directorial debut, avant-garde auteur david lynch's eraserhead. following is not a surrealist psychological horror film in that sense, but the similarities are noticeable; most notable, it's shot in grainy black-and-white and has an atmosphere about it that makes it unique. it's hard to describe in words, but it loosely resembles the smoky atmosphere you'd find in the film noirs of old. hence, it can be said that following is a contemporary film noir, or a neo-noir. overall, it's an amalgamation of that and a psychological thriller, and the story is most appropriate to these two genres.the main character is nameless, and the movie's title stems from an early, obsessive-compulsive trait he possessed  randomly picking out people on the street and following them, sometimes even for hours on end. during one of these 'stalking expeditions', the main character becomes noticed by one of the people he is following, and is confronted. turns out that the 'confronter' is a man who is willing to befriend our narrator, and he introduces himself; his name is cobb, and he's a petty burglar who invites the narrator to follow him on his burglaries.from there, the main character becomes swept up in cobb's world, and he becomes embroiled in crime, passion and violence as he gets more and more intimate with cobb. following is not so much a character study, but instead a film which follows the tumultuous relationship between these two main characters, and the devastating ramifications it has on our narrator. nolan succeeds in making the film resemble a film noir, and emulates the respective atmosphere well.as a thriller, following is taut and atmospheric; however as a film in general, it's somewhat of a disappointment. if not that, then one could definitely call it underwhelming. the entire film is shot in a non-chronological and non-linear fashion, and it makes the story and film-experience unique, to some extent  this style has been done so many times now it's almost commonplace technique  and the story itself is unique to some extent.however, following is ultimately underwhelming for the entire film, and is disappointingly unspectacular. the story calls for more  more action, more suspense and more thrills  but it becomes too embroiled in its own storyline, and instead focuses on creating an intricate story. following does succeed in doing that, but without any other elements it's a film noir that doesn't quite work out; it's got a sense of emptiness which isn't enormous, but still noticeable nonetheless. furthermore, the film's shocking revelation at the end  almost a mandatory convention in film noirs  is one that makes us feel cheated; it's unpredictable and comes out of nowhere, but in relation to the story it's disappointing, as it essentially makes the preceding scenes, and the entire film, seem like an enormous waste of time.but the positives far outweigh the negatives, and in the end following turns out to be a flawed but satisfying film, yes, everybody has to start somewhere. christopher nolan does it with following, and he does it in a fine manner. a quiet, meek but fine manner. it's not the most astounding movie, and it isn't quite worthy of the accolades the director would go on to receive in the following decade, but it's still a good film nonetheless. when singling out following, you find a well-made, taut and atmospheric thriller, one which lacks noticeable nuance or innovative style but still manages to grip audiences nonetheless.

most of other reactions by subscribers to this service were very apt, although that some found it slow or ambiguous puzzled me. rather than ambiguous, it was complex and multi-layered in its meanings. one can see it as anti-war, because of the opening and closing scenes, and the folly of pretended grandeur, as how wonderful the cavalry men looked as they prepared for the great charge at eylau, contrasted with its so horrible and disturbing conclusion, when we see the bloody uniforms, the boyish dead, etc--but chiefly, i see the film as about a moral man in an immoral society. at the end chabert chooses retreat from the corrupt post-napoleonic french world and opts for the simple pleasures provided by derville (who himself is saved by his recognition of chabert's basic decency and the morality of his choice of renunciation)--white bread, cheese, some wine and tobacco--over the riches he leaves to his wife, and her and society's dishonor. in her case, we can see the film as also feminist, in the position of women at that time, in which the only weapons mme chabert has are her charm, beauty, wiles and, ultimately, money.

this is an unfortunately unrecognized classic.the look is superb, the design, costumes etc are flawless, the post battle scenes and the cavalry charge are both chilling and exciting.the characters are vivid and really human. ardent is right and fabrice luchini as the lawyer derville steals the movie with his clever pedantic rodent-like performance, delighting in the ups and downs of others' misfortunes. depardieu is good but perhaps too large a presence for this role.where the film really excels is the story and also its changes from balzac's novella. those changes are editorial in that balzac has lots of discussion on society and this film breaths with characters. nevertheless yves angelo has retained the key ingredient, not just the missing man trying to regain his place in society but every character has to find their place in society: the comte ferraud is trying to buy a peerage, his wife (ardent) comes from a lowly birth and when she was married to colonel chabert they achieved their position in the turbulence of post-revolutionary france. everyone has something to lose in terms of status and that makes for a good drama as their objectives are in conflict with each other.it also feels very modern: money is critical to buy status to reach power, but someone can go down as quickly as they go up. derville enjoys the strategy, he has seen the worst of people he says to chabert when he takes the case. this speech's original place is at the end of the novella as balzac sums up the human comedy with huge irony.

watched this film at a local festival, the silver sprocket international film festival florida . what a lovely film. a simple, uncomplicated morality tale about a young care free young man having to take responsibility for his actions. it neither pretentious or flashy my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change i wasn't embarrassed by any of the film content or language. a real family film and the best british comedy film i've seen since billy elliot.the film went on to win not surprisingly the top festival awards of best film and best director. ten out of ten.

logged on to the imdb to say what a charming film love love is and am totally confused. seems to me that someone has been getting their titles mixed up. "plastic demon baby" what? this wasn't love life. a little bit luvy dovey for my tastes but a great, funny and original film. especially liked the ending that didn't fall into the normal pit of cliche that all hollywood romantic films crash and burn it. nine out of ten.

just before dawn is an excellent horror movie. it is atmospheric, filled with tension made of wonderful shots of wild nature, in which few young people meet their doom, in the shape of two crazed, fat bastards,who slaughter them. jeff lieberman is very talented and intelligent director,who is unfortunately underrated. he achieved to built tension, not with gore,but with showing menacing nature environment. lieberman succeeds to built a tension in a very linear, simplistic way, which is also the best way, not to show to the viewer the gore, but to let him to imagine the worst thing that happen to characters. just before dawn was always compared to texas chainsaw massacre, deliverance and hills have eyes. it is as good looking as deliverance, better than hills, i mean scarier and better crafted,and it is creepy as the texas chainsaw massacre.jbd is one of the best horrors of past few decades, who finally lives on dvd!

i didn't have very high expectations about just before dawn. i don't know why i keep buying these slasher movies when i know it's all the same every time. maybe i'm a bit masochistic? anyway, i'm glad i bought this one. yes, it's all the same. no, it has nothing original. yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. and you know what? it's just magic! it's one of the best experiences i had watching a slasher movie. the places where it's shot are so wonderful. you see mountains, waterfalls, rockies. it's just amazing. it takes a very long time (except for the opening scene) before the killer starts killing, but i didn't care! it was enjoyable to watch enough not to care. what i mean is, you won't be sitting there waiting for the murders to start because every thing that happens is enjoyable because of the beauty of the film itself. the ending is a bit weird, but i won't tell you anything more about it. you'll know what i mean. another thing i enjoyed: you care about the characters. they're not just a bunch of jerks who spend their time bitching each other. sure, they are pure stereotypes of usual slasher characters but, there's something special about them. anyway, it's a great horror movie and i hope you have a pretty good time watching it because i really did!

a quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. however, "jbd" delivers considerably more.rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. these feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil. oh yeah- george kennedy is here too and when is that not a good thing? if you liked "wrong turn", then watch this to see where much of its' methodology came from.

just before dawn really surprised me when i saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than i expected. instead the director jeff lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until i was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. the lack of action in many parts gave it a very deliverance mixed with the texas chainsaw massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory. the characters are about par for this kind of movie, though more sympathetic than some, and the bad guy memorably freaky. the photography and suspense are the real winners in this movie and they keep it from ever being dull (as has been suggested). i firmly recommend this one to serious horror fans. don't expect gore, do expect a creepy backwoods tale with several awesome moments and a great dreamlike ambiance.

for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to imdb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie. i still love it as much as i did all those years ago.buy this movie!!

just before dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! this movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job mr. lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. the opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! and the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars! if you are looking for a gore-fest, don't look here. but, if you want chills sent down your back, see this one. there are 6 deaths and one of them you don't see but, it leaves you mind to think "how was she killed?" the stranded theme reminded me of 1977's the hills have eyes, which followed kind of the same concept, but in the desert with canninbals. but, still slasher fans, give this forgotten gem, i promise you, you will be staisfied!

just before dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. the backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like friday the 13th, the burning, and madman. just before dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. the cinematography is gorgeous. the acting is top notch. the heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in. there's a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the final girls hidden sexuality - coinciding that alongside her will to survive.just before dawn isn't for everyone, but for the slasher fan, it's as close to perfect as you can get. the killer(s) are very menacing - almost like it's a game to maim and murder anyone who crosses their territory. the end scene is a bit off kilter. for the first time viewer, it may be a little shocking. i'd recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the backwoods slasher. even non-slasher fans will find something to like about it. the setting is eerie and makes one feel uneasy. the death sequences aren't particularly gory, but i'm not sure the film needed gore. see it!

ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! "just before dawn" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. it's a hell of a lot of fun.i enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. "wrong turn" ripped this movie off something fierce! there's plenty of blood and scares. my girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch. it's got that creepiness to it.i'd say that "just before dawn" is the best early 80's slasher out there. i really enjoyed it.8 out of 10, kids.

(warning: spoilers!)five young people ignore the warnings of forest ranger george kennedy and hike up to the misty oregon mountains where they are stalked and butchered by a pair of huge, deformed, in-bred hillbilly twins. when only two are left, warren and his girl connie, they resort back to their animal instincts to stay alive. the film ends with connie shoving half of her arm down one of the killers' throats, choking him to death. a very powerful, if somewhat overrated, backwoods slasher flick thats effective use of lighting, sound and photography make it a cut above the usual friday the 13th cash-in. lead by an attractive, likeable cast, especially deborah benson (where is she now?) and gregg henry, this nifty companion piece to director jeff lieberman's squirm (1976) and blue sunshine (1977) shouldn't be missed.

the mountainous woods, young happy campers, a warning by a park ranger and a lurking figure. the ingredients are there for a horror delight, and director/co-writer jeff lieberman does an adequate job at achieving it. it's formulaic woodland horror, but for most part the execution is at the top the game and the story (which is quite basic in a trimmed sense) is effectively told in certain realism. maybe a little more exposition wouldn't have gone astray, but lieberman's craftsmanship makes up for the material's flaws and typical details with rising tension, moody visuals and a smothering atmosphere created by brad fiedel's very ominously lingering score. whenever that very creepy whistling was cued in, it painted a truly unnerving sense that settled in with the beautiful backdrop. cinematographers dean m. and joel king do a striking job too. there's plenty of style abound, even with its minimal scope and the build-up is slow grinding. at times the pacing can become a stop-and-go affair. it's not particularly violent, but there's still a mean-streak evident even if some of it happens of screen. the latter chase scenes and escalating fear is well done, as it has the darkness coming alive with its burly killer/s and you get actor george kennedy riding his white horse in a slight, but wonderful turn. there's a likable bunch of performances; deborah benson makes for a strong, dashing heroine. gregg henry, chris lemmon ralph seymour, jamie rose, mike kellin and katie powell round off a modest cast of believable deliveries. the final climax is rather twisted, but the ending is one of those types that leave you thinking "is that it?" a well-etched backwoods slasher item, which probably plays it a little too safe to truly set it apart from the norm.

five teens set out to do some camping in the oregon wilderness, and despite being warned by the park ranger, they soon realize that something is lurking around in the backwoods waiting to strike.when it comes to old horror movies, the only one that keeps popping up in every conversation is friday the 13th, so i took it upon myself to find those good old horror movies that fell short for simply being compared to friday the 13th, just before dawn just so happened to be among the ones i found, and was really very impressive, it wasn't as bland as some of the stuff you find today, it was very sharp in terms of character development as it had quite a few likable ones, and it has this very casual pace, its not in a hurry to get to the hack and slash bits, it takes its time to set the proper mood and tone and is very atmospheric and builds some killer suspense by letting you always have that sense of dread like, somethings out there but you don't know where it is or when it will strike.where i live its definitely an overlooked gem simply because people never heard of it or won't give it a chance, but i'll state that it is not a friday the 13th rip off, the two concepts don't even go near each other, but in my mind, it is overall one of the more impressive slashers i've seen in a while.

taking its cues from backwoods classics deliverance and the texas chain saw massacre, jeff lieberman's just before dawn might not offer much very new in terms of plota maniac stalks and kills a group of campersbut still manages to be an effective shocker thanks to the director's deft handling of the material, great use of the stunning scenery, even greater use of women in hot-pants, a brooding synth score from brad fiedel and a nifty twist towards the end (although one that should be apparent to those who have been paying attention).thanks to solid performances from its capable castincluding oscar winner george kennedy as forest ranger roy mcleanthere is a sense of realism to just before dawn that is all too often missing from this kind of fare. the film also offers a pretty creepy maniac (who sniggers like dick dastardly's dog mutley and uses a nasty serrated machete to kill), and delivers a couple of very imaginative sequences which help lift it above many of its contemporaries: a topless woman (gratuitous nudity box well and truly ticked) in a lake discovers that the hand that has been groping her underwater doesn't belong to her boyfriend; and a shortsighted character makes out with his pal's girlfriend (as a joke), unaware that the person who is slowly approaching is not his friend but the killer.

well, sadly, i can't help but feeling a little bit disappointed after my much, much, much-anticipated viewing of "just before dawn". jeff lieberman is a terrific filmmaker and he can undoubtedly do great things with a tiny budget, but i nevertheless expected to see a far more sadistic and gruesome early 80's slasher. but actually i'm beginning to think that lieberman isn't the one to blame for this, but we gorehounds are! it's more than obvious that lieberman intended to make his take on the backwoods-slasher look like "deliverance" and absolutely not like "friday the 13th", which immensely popularized the sub genre one year earlier. the horror and constant sensation of menace doesn't mainly come from the demented maniacs with their machetes, but from the genuinely ominous and isolated oregon forests where this movie was shot. in case the film seems slow and uneventful, this is only because lieberman takes his time to introduce the dark woods and eerie mountains as extra characters in his film. we hardly ever see the killers in person, but there always appears to be someone luring from behind the trees or from underneath the mountain lakes. bearing this in mind, "just before dawn" becomes a highly admirable horror effort and actually a lot better than its contemporary blood-soaked colleagues. amidst a nearly endless selection of gory and sickening slashers, lieberman successfully puts the emphasis back on tension and character development. the plot revolves on five twenty-something friends heading for a camping vacation in the oregon woods, where one of them owns a small piece of land. the woods are deserted and, naturally, the campers ignore forest ranger roy's (george kennedy!) advise to return back to civilization. shortly after, they brutally encounter an inbred family of which the twin sons have murderous tendencies. all five main characters are surprisingly likable and convincing! no irritating stereotypes for which you don't feel sympathy anyway, like slutty girls or football jocks. as a result of this "natural" character, you automatically cheer for them, even when they eventually almost turn into savages themselves. the sublime camera-work supplies the film with an at times unbearable tension level and brad fiedel's chilling electronic score only adds to this effect. "just before dawn" is a fine slice of early 80's horror, as long as you don't desire blood to drip from your tv-set.

this completely forgotten slasher flick is one of the best horror movies ever made.very dark at times it reminds me a little famous thriller "deliverance".director jeff lieberman creates terrific atmosphere of dread and despair.all actors are decent and the climax is really exciting and memorable.so if you are searching for something creepy,try to find this little treasure.my personal rating:10 out of 10.p.s this one is even more chilling than "halloween".

this was a great 1981 film which had a great story about three men and two girls who go on a camping trip together and go through thick woods and high mountains with a great water fall. this group of people run into property owned by george kennedy, (roy mclean) who plays the role as a forest ranger and rides a white horse. roy mclean warns these young people that where they are going is no area for camping and they should turn back. of course these young people pay no attention and proceed to have a ball swimming in the nude near the water fall and playing great music and dancing by the fire and having plenty of beer and wine. there is an old wooden one room school house that draws the gals and guys inside and it is from that point on the film starts to get very scary. there is one occasion when a young girl has to climb a tree in order to get away from a human beast who desires her body and starts chopping the tree down in order to capture her. don't miss this film, there is plenty of everything.

one of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. yes it has a cheesy plot but i was pleasantly surprised at this film, because i thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.first of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. but when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway. it's a shame that we don't get movies like this any longer, and if we do, it's usually some boring terrible film.this movie more relies on tension and being scary than gore, because the gore factor is really low in this movie which i wasn't pleased with but other than that it's still a great movie.all in all you'll have to search long and hard to find this movie and if you do find it, you will like it and also watch out for ending with the final girl and the killer it's totally not what you'd expect.

29 sept 1990 marked a small but important milestone in my appreciation of horror flicks. this was the date that bbc1 broadcast (for the only time i'm aware of) jeff lieberman's super-creepy 1981 shocker just before dawn, and it made a huge impression on me. nearly twenty years later, i'm delighted to report that i've finally got my hands on the two-disc shriek show / media blasters special edition, and it's just as eerie and unsettling as i remember it, if not more so.the plot, as is usual for genre flicks (and this was lieberman's first film as a 'director for hire', though he did at least remove all the religious cult snake-handling mumbo-jumbo from the screenplay), is a bit thin - five likable twenty-somethings (including chris lemmon, son of jack, in a pair of uncomfortably tight white strides) venture into the dense oregon woodlands to do a spot of camping and to check out a patch of land that's been bequeathed to one of their number. but just before dawn stands out from a crowd of imitators because lieberman wastes no time in showing us just how deranged things are on this particular patch of mountain, with a complete innocent skewered and a drunk preacher's truck shoved down a hill and engulfed in flames within minutes of the film beginning. the youngsters come rolling into the picture in a snappy winnebago, blondie's 'heart of glass' pounding on the soundtrack, and before you can say "texas chainsaw massacre!" they've clobbered an innocent deer with the front bumper and had their first taste of aggro from the heavy-set maniac responsible for the opening catastrophes. forest ranger roy (george kennedy) warns them that things are likely to go awry if they go any further, but they go ahead with the trip anyway, refusing to give the sozzled preacher a ride even though he's understandably scared witless and finally pitching camp miles from anywhere. needless to say, things go downhill from here.although this film's not short on bloody horror and well-handled action scenes, the standout moments for me are those where lieberman lets his camera zoom out, long and slow, from apparently innocuous shots of the fun-loving kids larking around in the wilderness, or just lets it settle for a while on the dense, imposing, people-dwarfing woodlands. he makes the oregon exteriors as threatening and as ominous as kubrick made the overlook hotel's spacious interiors in the shining, and brad fiedel's score (discounting the horribly distorted racket that runs over the titles) stays the right side of intrusive, underscoring the slowly escalating menace with subtlety and flair. there are plenty of surprises along the way, nods to deliverance with the discovery of a backwoods babe and her freaky, disturbing family, and a truly bizarre kill technique deployed shortly before the film's end. i won't spoil it for you. i've said enough.quite why this undervalued horror gem fell through the cracks and became a cult item instead of a breakout hit is hard to ascertain, but hopefully it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years to come - it deserves to be.

it may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of "slasher" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. this is a great "rare" film from jeff lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films "squirm" and "blue sunshine".five young people head into the oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."just before dawn" is noticeably more ambitious, "arty", and intelligent than some slasher films. lieberman actually fleshes out the characters - well, two of them, anyway - as much as a 90-minute-long film will allow him. the film has genuine moments of suspense and tension, and actually refrains from graphic gore, save for one killing right at the beginning.there is an above-average cast here, including oscar winner george kennedy, as a forest ranger who's understandably gone a little flaky from having been alone in the wilderness for too long. jack lemmon's son chris, future brian de palma regular gregg henry, blonde lead deborah benson (it's too bad she hasn't become a more well-known performer, judging by her work here), ralph seymour ("ghoulies"), mike kellin ("sleepaway camp"), and jamie rose ("chopper chicks in zombietown") round out the cast.some of the shots are interesting, and the early music score by brad feidel (now best known for his "terminator" theme) is haunting and atmospheric.this is worth catching for the important plot twist at about the one hour mark, although a moment at about 75 minutes in involving the heroine and a tree and the killer is almost comical; it may actually remind a viewer of a cartoon! one of the most clever touches is the final dispatching of the killer, which i'd never seen before in a horror film and probably won't see again.i didn't give it 10 out of 10 because i can't honestly that i was that frightened. still, it's an interesting slasher that is worthy of re-discovery."that deed don't mean nothing, son. those mountains can't read."9/10

i'd been postponing purchasing this one ever since its dvd release  for one thing, because i'd been somewhat underwhelmed by this director's two other horror titles (squirm [1976] and blue sunshine [1977]), but also the fact that the film itself is said to have been slightly trimmed for gore on the media blasters/shriek show 2-disc set! i now chanced upon it as a rental and am glad i did  because, not only is it superior to the earlier efforts (at least, on this preliminary assessment), but i also found the film to be one of the better imitations of the texas chain saw massacre (1974). this factor, however, only helped remind me that i've yet to check out another such example  wes craven's classic the hills have eyes (1977), whose 2-disc r1 edition from anchor bay i purchased some time ago but, after all, halloween-time is fast approaching... anyway, the film manages an effortlessly unsettling backwoods atmosphere (it was shot in the forest and mountain regions of oregon)  with plenty of effective frissons throughout but, thankfully, not too much violence (even if the last of the villains is dispatched in quite an outrageous fashion!). the principal young cast here (one of them played by jack lemmon's son, chris) isn't quite as obnoxious as those we usually encounter in this type of genre offering  despite freely indulging in the shenanigans one associates with teen-oriented flicks and which, by and large, persist to this day! george kennedy appears as a sympathetic ranger; though he doesn't have a lot to do, his characterization is decidedly enhanced by making him a lover of plant and animal life. also notable among the locals is familiar character actor mike kellin in a nice role as the drunkard who first comes into contact with the murderous duo of the narrative  his warning to the teenagers, naturally, goes unheeded but he's later able to lead kennedy to them.the hermetic family the teens come across in the woods, then, is eventually revealed to be hiding a skeleton in their closet. while one of the girls displays genuine curiosity at the intruders' presence, the rest are openly hostile to them  and, in the case of the burly and uncouth twins, appropriately creepy (one of them is even prone to maniacal laughter during his rampages); at a certain point in the narrative, the ranger even offers an interesting explanation as to the nature of their aggressive and generally uncivilized behavior.

jeff lieberman's "just before dawn" is definitely one of the most underrated horror movies ever made.the film,whilst a little bit influenced by "deliverance" and "the texas chain saw massacre",is extremely creepy and memorable.the suspense almost never lets up and the atmosphere is genuinely eerie.the cast is excellent,deborah benson and jamie rose are great female leads.the inbred twins are truly frightening and remorseless killers.the film is beautifully shot-it was actually filmed on location at silver falls state park in oregon.there is very little gore,but one killing,when verchel is stabbed in the groin,is pretty nasty and unpleasant.a must-see for slasher fans.10 out of 10-what else?

1981's just before dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. it's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like the final terror, don't go in the woods, or the prey out of the water.a group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. however they are not alone in the wild. a hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers. director lieberman, who gave us such great b films as squirm (1976) and blue sunshine (1977), does an excellent job with this smart thriller as well. the movie is nicely atmospheric, with a creeping sense of tension and some strong suspense. this film makes even the open wilderness seem frighteningly claustrophobic. the oregon locations are beautiful and well captured by the crafty cinematography. the music score is a true original and awesome in contrast with the scenic visuals. deborah benson makes for a great lead, her presence was captivating. gregg henry delivers a good performance as benson's lover and chris lemon provides some occasional charisma. the supporting cast, especially veteran actor kennedy, also does quite well. a true gem of the slasher genre, that needs no gore to thrill. definitely well worth seeking out for slasher fans and horror buffs alike. see it!*** 1/2 out of ****

i really enjoyed this movie and i usually don't like animated pictures. but i thought the cats were appealing and the story line was charming. there is a good song called "everybody wants to be a cat," that is a lot of fun. it has some comic moments and is an interesting adventure. i think it helps to be an avid cat lover to enjoy this film.

sadly, this movie is relegated to 'curio' status it seems. many people that i've asked "did you know the monkees made a movie?" usually answer 'no.' that being said, if you are one of that large number, i recommend you see it, but with the following caveat(s): if you expect monkey style humor, it is in there. it's just not all over the place like the tv shows.yes, they are trying to break their tv mold a bit by poking fun at it like a bunch of no-longer-teenagers who have been on the short end of a lot of sticks.no, you don't have to be inebriated to enjoy it.no, you don't have to be inebriated to understand it.if you like classics, you'll love the interspersed clips throughout.if you like the psychedelic era, you'll love some of the cameos.if you are a monkees fan, you might recognize some of the jabs they are taking at the heavy commercializing of the band.in the nigh-immortal words of one of my best friends after seeing 5 minutes of it: "this is a weird movie, man." in fact it might be better if you don't try to understand it, just sit back and react to it. it's weird, it's funny, it's a bit surreal, it's experimental (still)...it is many things. overall, it is an experience.

to experience head you really need to understand where the monkees were when they filmed it.this was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. their inventive and comedic series (sort of an american idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.this is their take on their "manufactured image" and status as the 2nd tier beatles. they always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.it is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (i have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.see it with an open mind.

i can't believe this isn't a huge cult hit. perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the monkees as a silly factory-made pop band rip-off of the beatles, refused to see it. that cynicism probably covered it from sight ever since. don't make this mistake. _head_ is an amazing film that most open minded people will appreciate. it is very funny and very intelligent (and very trippy).

the cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. starting with both "breathless" and underground american cinema (such as kenneth anger), films became more and more experimental. all of this accumulated when hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with "easy rider". one of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially. "head" was made when the monkees career was seriously waning, which is what damned one of the best psychedelic films ever made.the plot? well, there really isn't one, as many have said. it involves the monkees going from one surreal scenario to the next one. however, these sequences are all obviously lsd-tinged and basically mock how the monkees were sick of being confined to their light pre-fab reputation. its a shame that the film found no audience. the teeny boppers who loved them had moved onto a new fad as they always do. the psychedelic / haight-ashbury crowd to whom the film was garnered would never be caught dead at a monkees movie. its all their loss. this film may be plot less, but it is certainly not without meaning and is very intelligently put together. the crew later made both "easy rider" and "five easy pieces". the film was later revived at a 1973 raybert retrospective and it gained a very positive response, which granted it the cult following it had deserved for a long time. ironically, the monkees would fall victim to the same commercialism they protested in this film with their later 80s reunion. (10/10)

this all-but-ignored masterpiece is about the monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie (head), and that everything they do or say had already been written in an (unseen) script they seem to be following. head was written by jack nicholson, rafelson, and peter tork during a three-day lsd trip in a suite at an expensive hollywood hotel. the other three monkees only acted in it.they fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script. they deliberately flub their lines, walk off sets, tear up scenery, punch other actors for no reason; and ultimately, commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. for instance, in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene, if you watch frame-by-frame, you can see rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman, very deliberately shooting into a mirror. he is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the director yells "cut!"the monkees, however, never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are. that ends up being the core of the revelation soon to come.at every turn, they realize their increasingly-bizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they can't escape being in. you say they went crazy and walked through the sky (which turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the set's background)? no problem! hey, hey, they're the monkees, and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around! in the end, even their deaths did not set them free. that was how the movie was supposed to end, and their motionless, waterlogged bodies are fished out of the river, put in another box, and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio production.this is made all the more poignant by the fact that the monkees really are fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world. they did it through the power of their music.ironically, near the end, peter tork has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem, but unfortunately, no one listens. peter realizes: "it doesn't matter if we're in the box (the film)". he means that it doesn't matter if will is free or illusory, and that "the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur... you need to just let 'now' happen, as it happens", without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is "valid" by some abstract definition.when you can't even tell the difference, will being free or not doesn't matter--tying to figure out if you are the "real" you is just a pointless waste of time.i saw this film at a very important time in my life. i was trying to figure out how to escape being just "that geeky, creepy nerd girl" by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun (i.e., sex) like everyone else did. but the revelation in head broke my self-imposed recursive trap and helped me more than rafelson or nicholson or tork will ever know.for decades, i've watched "head" and wished i could thank pete.was this a good movie?uhh, how about, like...==< yes >==

forget easy rider - head is the film about the 1960s.almost laugh: as the monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute tv commercial about dandruff! see: the 50 foot victor mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film! hear: frank zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell davey jones "your music is awfully white"! experience: the monkees' only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (circle sky)! listen: as davey jones sings a harry nielsen song about having a transsexual father! be confused: be very confused, as confused as terri garr is when mickey dolenz makes sexual innuendos about her in her film debut! witness: futile protests against the vietnam war leap out of nowhere and just as quickly disappear! watch: mike nesmith spit on christmas while wearing a velvet victorian smoking jacket in a cobwebbed gothic horror-movie sound-stage! let yourself drift: into the karmic bliss inspired by a comic-book version of indian mysticism delivered by a hammy white character-actor in black-face, while peter tork pretends that he knows how to play a guitar! discover: academy award winning director bob rafelson's first feature length film, as written by academy award winning actor jack nicholson! pretend it's not happening: when the monkees commit group suicide by jumping off the golden gate bridge! take drugs - take a lot of drugs: take as many drugs as the cast and crew evidently did while making this film!with head, the monkees revealed themselves as the angriest, snottiest entertainers in hollywood history, bar none. it is bewildering to discover that they blamed the failure of this film on bad promo. to be sure, the promotion was virtually non-existent; but did they not recognize how angry, how down-right depressing, how self-destructive this film actually is?! i mean, this film is a trip - on bad acid - to the suicide ward of a mental hospital. the only film i know to be this depressing is terry gilliam's brazil; and like brazil, this film reveals why life in the later 20th century was almost unbearable - if you were lucky. it's not simply that western culture was suffering from serious information-overload, but the information itself was just bad, bad, more bad, and dismal. in fact, it was the overload effect itself that kept people going, since this allowed people to keep distracting themselves with one crisis or another - if news from vietnam became too much to bear, they could turn the channel and watch a documentary on the rising unemployment rate.the "positive" response to the reality revealed in head was woodstock - three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and bugs and bad food and dirty drink and poop and pee and bad acid and peter townsend almost killing abbie hoffman. all taking place behind a steel fence, under the lovingly watchful eyes of a veritable army of ny state troopers - meaning that the "freedom" of woodstock nation was as illusory as the song john sebastion thought he was singing while so strung out he could barely speak. "500,000 assholes too stupid to come in out of the rain," was one critic's judgment on woodstock (i think it was andy warhol). the one good thing occurring there was jimi hendrix's star spangled banner. two years previously, the jimi hendrix experience had gone on their first national tour of america, as the warm-up band opening for - the monkees. see, it's all connected somehow.you owe it to yourself - nay, you owe it to your unborn children - to see the real 1960s, only to be found on film in this bizarre, miraculous, and utterly absurd tribute to one of the more interesting capitalist scams of the later 20th century.

the beatles had just done 'magical mystery tour.' there was the general feel that performance, peace and drugs went together naturally. in la, there was a film subculture that knew something was up. nicholson was in several of these gangs.before he decided to seriously become an actor, before 'easy rider,' before 'pink flamingos,' before 'day for night,' there were several experiments with what to do about this. an important one is 'saragossa manuscript.' this is another.jack writes. he plays with circular narrative, self-reference, film reference, performance self-loathing, the pain of creation, all on the outskirts of safe kiddiepop. you must see this, if only to know something about jack.certain actors act by digging into themselves. it is a common technique. some dig deep, but after a while, they become boring because they are incredibly shallow people. there isn't just enough stuff in there to sustain a career. think of deniro and hackman.others are pretty interesting people, who seem to become more interesting over time. when they dig into the barrel, they put stuff back in because of the pain of the digging. think sean penn and jack. at the bottom of jack's barrel, at the end of the thread he spins, as the base of every character is this experimental, risky writer/filmmaker.who cares if it is a bad movie? it is bad because it took risks. watch when a tear is wiped from annette's cheek by the director. it is a loving goof on the whole brando thing, something that i heard marlon laughed about. that is one of the richest moments in hollywood film history.there's another reason to watch this. music in film is has a strong root in dance. revolution in film often relies on music. whole cultures are thus swept along.an unsung giantess in inventing how billions now dance is toni basil. she was as influential in pop choreography as the beatles were in music. she was already well into her career when called upon to work on this. but this is one of her earliest screen appearances. you can see her work throughout and she herself in the pretty cool 'daddy's girl' segment, over one of nilsson's better songs. (followed by the frank zappa cameo.) mccartney would reference this scene in his teevee special years later.a third reason to watch is early (about 6 1/2 minutes) in the film: a character named 'lady pleasure' kisses each monkey in a long continuous shot and then dismissively departs. she is credited as i. j. jefferson but is really mimi manchu, nicholson's lover at the time and lsd partner. red hair, psychedelic demeanor. lovely. that scene says it all for me, about how jack feels about the boys.ted's evaluation -- 3 of 3: worth watching.

i will admit, i had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, i felt like many did. i was expecting a monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead i was given... well, i didn't know what i was given to be honest.however, after finally watching this film, i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, i also found myself watching it over and over again. it's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as i try to attempt to decipher it's meanings. and just when i think i've figured out something in the film, it's answer is destroyed once i watch the film again. brilliance indeed.it seems that most people who disliked this film are wanting to watch a film with primarily a clear plot. they want everything explained and all questions answered in the finale. well sorry, if that's what you're wanting, this is not the movie for you. but if you liked movies like the matrix (and better yet, their sequels) i think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.think of the film being like a dream. in our dreams, things make no sense, things we expect to happen don't, people places and things don't speak, act or function in the same way they do in reality. to complain about "head" is like complaining about a dream you've had that you felt you could not understand. the mind is a complex system, and being that a film titled "head" is just as complex, is it that difficult to relate the two?the music (and musical numbers) really stand out, especially peter tork's two compositions, which remain the best tracks in the film, "can you dig it?" and "long title: do i have to do this all over again?"this film proves that the monkees were much more than just four zanny guys in a 'pre-fab' group (as their critics called them) on a television show, but that they are actually much more intelligent and talented than the world would give them credit for. there's so many messages that can be derived from the film, both in regards to the monkees and to the 'entertainment industry' in general, that it stands as a masterpiece of film-making that was far ahead of it's time.i feel, had this film been released as an independent piece at this point and time, it would actually garner the respect and admiration it deserves.and one finale note:one could compare this to the beatles "magical mystery tour" film, since the beatles film appeared to be just as strange and bizarre. however, in my opinion, "head" stands far above anything the beatles put on celluloid.

you would really need to remember the monkees and have a clear understanding as to where and how they fitted into the second half of the 1960s in order to fully appreciate this movie.there is no plot as such. basically, it's a crazy, mixed up pastiche of various, unrelated sequences. but, it is interesting and entertaining in its own peculiar way once you get onto its wavelength. in short, it was a classic, cleverly conceived and well crafted example of late '60s experimental cinema. it contains some good songs, some ultra-groovy cinematography and plenty of other worthwhile ideas in terms of film technique.i give it 7 out of 10 for several reasons. first, it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox movie in the commercial mainstream where both its stars and its producers were firmly ensconced at the time. if a feature movie flops at the box office, the consequences can be dire for all concerned. secondly, it was, for the most part, a creative success. and, finally, as already mentioned, it is, unquestionably, a classic of the genre and, as such, it is now historically important.unfortunately, "head" came too late in the monkees career. but, there again, they would not have been allowed to make it earlier on because it was essentially a very pointed and cynical satire of their own image. clearly, the members of the group knew, only too well, that the whole monkees juggernaut had just about run its race when they started work on this project. in a way, it was to be their swan song and they were determined to let it all hang out. they were tired of being treated like mere pawns in the high powered corporate game in which they had been manipulated and exploited over the preceding few years. in short, they "wanted out" and they were going to say a few things before they left.history, however, has vindicated the band. let the critics be damned. the monkees, left behind some of the best, most polished and successful pop records of the decade. yes, they had plenty of help. but at the end of the day, they stood in front of the studio mikes, they fronted the movie and tv cameras and they did the concerts. they were fun and just a little bit crazy. but, unlike some of their contemporaries, they were never threatening. you could safely introduce a monkey to your elderly aunt."head" probably borrows a bit too heavily from the beatles "hard day's night" but it's still worth another look for those who were around at the time or for younger retrophiles who have the ability to appreciate its significance.enjoy!

"i am ... proud of 'head'," mike nesmith has said. he should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.yes, it's unconventional. to many, frustrating. it's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: "you figure it out."you probably already know that the monkees tv show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. tv shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain. that the monkees broke out of the box for a short time to make "head" is a testament to the group's popularity and importance in pop culture, despite where your head's at. get one thing straight: "head" is not the monkees tv show.so what we have here is a "psychedelic documentary" about western pop culture from a source that has authority on the subject. "head" is a movie that could only come from those "inside the box". by 1968, the monkees' cast and crew were seasoned and weary professionals who had seen their share of promise and disappointment. the movie was a deliberate attempt at market repositioning. so, it did three things: make a film the way the monkees envisioned. most importantly, reinvent the group to one not subservient to it's old bosses - and yas, hipper than before. make a film that exposed american attitudes of information dissemination."head", therefore, really is about media manipulation and its net result: deception. the mass media is supposed to inform, educate us on the happenings in the world at large, and ultimately asks us to form opinions of these events that can shape thought into positive action. thus we assume the information we absorb to be complete and unbiased - otherwise, how can one establish a valued conclusion on any one idea presented by a book, newspaper or tv show? in one of the street interviews in "head", a guy admits, "i haven't looked at a newspaper or tv in years." is he lesser or better the man? even the drug parallels are a soft veiling of "things are not as they seem." remember the old joke, "everything you know is wrong"? the screenplay starts with the monkees' public admission of it's own "manufactured image" and runs with the football - literally. is the football scene in the movie a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind "head"? is the film a stream-of-consciousness exercise? is the film the culmination of pot smoking marathons? there are too many coincidences that occur in the film that suggest otherwise. my guess is that "head" is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intended and unintended.largely, the insiders responsible for "head" seem to enjoy themselves in the revelries that take place in the film, but there is anger - anger at the chaos that characterized the late '60s and anger at the way the media, television especially, had changed culture in negative ways. drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late '60s and still are, but the producers of "head" want you to know that poor "information" is a far greater danger.wars have been attributed to hoaxes and lies. what perfect way to spread disinformation than through tv? repeatedly, the mysterious black box is seen as an obstacle to the monkees and seemingly, all of us as well. in one scene, peter is sullenly sitting in a saloon holding a melting ice cream cone, and is asked by a fellow monkey, "what's wrong?" "i bought this ice cream cone and i don't want it." the movie suggests that the first purpose of the media is not to inform, but to sell en mass blindly. "head" goes further: put any idea into someone's head, and merrily goes he.the filmmakers know this, and the danger is real. "head" is either a movie that creates itself "as we go along", or is a deliberate statement. perhaps, perhaps not. maybe it is just "pot meets advertising", as critics scathed in 1968. the jokes are on the monkees and us. be careful what you ask for, you may get it.cheers: a true guilty pleasure. very funny. intelligent. will please the fans. find the substance, it's there. unabashedly weird. bizarre collection of characters. good tunage. length is appropriate. lots of great one liners, including my all time prophetic favorite: "the tragedy of your times, my young friends, is that you may get exactly what you want."caveats: dated. drugs. no plot. no linear delivery of any thought in particular. at least twenty-five stories that interweave in stop-and- go fashion. so, may easily frustrate. may seem pretentious to some. people who can't stand the monkees need not watch, though that in itself is no reason to avoid it. the psychedelic special effects may kill your ailing picture tube or your acid burnt- out eyeballs.match, cut.

"head" is one of those films you'll have a lot of trouble convincing your friends to see, but once they do they'll fall in love with it. i don't know how many times this has happened to me. this film is just so funny and bizarre, really a deconstruction of everything the monkees had been up to this point in their career. a lot the credit goes to bob rafelson who pretty much ended the monkee's career with this film. my guess is he wanted to get out of directing the tv show and get into features, which he did in a big way after this one. micky dolenz is absolutely hilarious. i can't believe he didn't have a second life as a comic actor after this film. this film has a lot of great cameos and a lot of wonderful psychedelic nonsense. i feel like the reputation of this film is continuing to build and it wouldn't surprise me if it eventually becomes a full on cult classic

this is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. my wife has never seen it, and when i just rewatched it last night, i waited until after she went to bed. she might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but i know she would have had enough within ten minutes.head has nothing like a conventional story. the film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. it could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres. if you're not a big fan of those things--psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernism and the "acid trip aesthetic" (assuming there's a difference between them), you should probably stay away from this film. on the other hand if you are a fan of that stuff, you need to run out and buy head now if you haven't already.oddly, the film has never received much respect. that probably has a lot to do with preconceptions. after all, it does star the monkees--micky dolenz, davy jones, michael nesmith and peter tork--and the monkees were a musical group of actors put together by producers bob rafelson and bert schneider to be a kid-friendly, bubble-gummy beatles for a television series. in their era, they had as much respect as, say, menudo, new kids on the block, the spice girls, and so on. as a fellow imdb reviewer rightly notes--"perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the monkees as a silly factory-made pop band rip-off of the beatles, refused to see (head)".the monkees and head have never been quite able to shed that negative public perception. it's a shame, because there was a lot of talent, both musically and otherwise, in the monkees. it's probably odder that rafelson, who directs here and co-produces with schneider, and jack nicholson (yes, _that_ jack nicholson), who wrote the script and also co-produces, decided to take the monkees in this unusual direction. it's as if new kids on the block suddenly put out an album equivalent to pink floyd's ummagumma (1969) or atom heart mother (1970). in fact, the songs in head, written by the monkees and frequent collaborators such as carole king and harry nilsson, have a floyd-like quality, somewhere between the syd barrett era and the immediate post-barrett era. this is much more prominent than any beatles similarity. some people have complained about the music in the film, but to me, all the songs are gems. for that matter, some people dislike barrett era (or other) floyd, which is just as difficult for me to empathize with.but what _is_ head about? the basic gist is just that the monkees are taking a trip through various film genres--there are war scenes, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comedy scenes, drama scenes, western scenes, sci-fi scenes, romance scenes, and on and on. except, in the film's reality, this turns out to be happening primarily (if not exclusively) on a studio lot. at root, we're watching the monkees shoot a film. of course all of the scenes in the various genres have something surreal and self-referential about them, and they, and individual shots within a scene, tend to lead to one another using dream logic not dissimilar to the monty python television show. as a dream, head tends to vacillate between a good dream and a nightmare, while often being one that would cause you to laugh in your sleep (something that i frequently do, by the way).technically, rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to realize the above. there are scenes with extensive negative images, there are a lot of very fast cuts (including a great sequence that features davy jones and tony basil dancing alternately in a white and a black room, wearing a combination of white and black reversed in each, that occasionally toggles back and forth as quickly as two frames at a time), there are a lot of bizarre segues, there is an animated cow mouth, there are odd editing devices, and so on. for my money, i wish this stuff wasn't just a relic of the psychedelic era. this is the kind of artistic approach i relish. it seemed like a good idea back then and i still think it's a good idea. i'd like to see films like the life aquatic with steve zissou using (2004) using these types of extended techniques. now that would make that film surreal.interpretationally, some folks who aren't so in tune with the acid trip aesthetic have complained that it's basically b.s. to offer meanings for something intended to not have any. i disagree with such a pessimistic/nihilistic view; head was intended to have a lot of meaning(s), and it's not just films without conventional plots that have multiple interpretations. nicholson, rafelson and schneider have a lot of interesting things to say about the monkees--the film postmodernistically comments on their manufactured status; pop stardom--way before pink floyd, head conflates pop stardom and violence, from images of war to images of fans cannibalistically dismantling their idols; and naïve u.s.-oriented ideas of international perceptions and respect--well-armed foreigners in a desert surrender to micky dolenz just because he's an american, then later they blow up a coke machine (again in the desert) for him because he's thirsty and can't gain access. the film comments on many other topics--from big industry to police, surveys, spectatorship (especially in relation to tragedies), and on and on. head is full of ideas, appropriately enough, with intelligent, multifaceted things to say about them.head deserves to be considered a classic--it's basically shooting for the same vibe as the beatles' yellow submarine. both premiered in november of 1968, interestingly enough, and both were intended as something of a summation of the psychedelic aesthetic. yellow submarine wasn't quite successful. head is everything yellow submarine should have been.

after winning a championship fight, boxer john garfield (as johnnie bradfield) celebrates with a drinking binge, which leads to the manslaughter of a pushy reporter. although his manager killed the man, mr. garfield is blamed. when the manager dies in a car crash, wearing garfield's stolen watch, authorities think the boxer is dead. still a wanted man, garfield changes his identity to "jack dorney" and moves to an arizona ranch. there, garfield meets "the dead end kids": billy halop (as tommy), bobby jordan (as angel), leo gorcey (as spit), huntz hall (as dippy), gabriel dell (as t.b.), and bernard punsly (as milt).garfield bonds with the young "dead end" lads, who were sent to stay with sweet "grandma rafferty" (may robson) as an alternative to reform school, courtesy of her brother, deceased priest "father rafferty". garfield falls in love with halop's sister, pretty "peggy" (gloria dickson), who is there to keep any eye on the kids. of course, garfield's past comes back to haunt him "john garfield and the 'dead end' kids" make beautiful (max steiner) music together, thanks to effective direction and photography, by busby berkeley and james wong howe. the story is predictably comfortable, with the warner brothers support team in fine form. garfield and the "dead end" kids are a winning combination; although garfield made no further movies with the "east side" gang, the studio had him re-team with both billy halop and bobby jordan, almost immediately, for "dust be my destiny".the boxing scenes are nicely staged. but, the most exciting sequence has garfield and four of the new york "kids" (halop, jordan, hall, and punsly) climbing into a giant water tank for a swim - which unexpectedly puts their lives in danger. other, more brief, highlights include floozy ann sheridan (as goldie), boozy barbara pepper (as budgie), and young ronald sinclair (as douglas) losing at strip poker.******** they made me a criminal (1/21/39) busby berkeley ~ john garfield, billy halop, bobby jordan

i had heard of john garfield, but, didn't know him. i loved this movie. i had never heard of it. i just picked it up randomly. john garfield is a boxer in the movie. he had been in real life also so he knew his part. he was a fugitive throughout the movie. someone else killed a man. he character was blamed. he is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. all sorts of minor plots ensue. my favorite was the scary swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and one dead end kid couldn't swim, and none of them could get out.john's character saves the day. the dead end kids were great as his friends and followers. one of them right to the very end. ann sheridan played the family's daughter and john's eventual love interest. she was believable, but not lovable in my opinion-the only weak link in the movie.

whoever plays the part of j. douglas williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. he apparently received no credits. too bad.all the dead end kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. it is odd to watch them in a western setting with their brooklyn accents ( i guess that should be bowery ). they even show some swimming abilities.i think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. my favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film. busby berkeley shows his dance movie expertise when john garfield shifts his feet and as we watch that move, the camera moves up to his face. i will not give away why or when, but the look on his face at that point probably brought the 1939 audience to its feet in the theaters.some will think john garfield looks a lot like frank sinatra in many scenes. just his face. actually frank was not yet making movies so maybe frank looked like john. the boxer named smith in the movie looks like a clone of ed begley, jr.now i must tell you something that is not a spoiler, but if you watch the movie, watch grandma's hands. may robson does her part well. she seems to have hands that wander a bit. in a scene where she and a crowd go into the boxer's (john garfield) dressing room, watch where she touches the reclining john garfield while he is wearing only his trunks.a great ending. lots of wonderful characters.best line might be at the gas station, "...eight gallons, that's a dollar twenty-eight..." tom willett

very good 1939 film where john garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he has committed a murder. trouble is that the killer and garfield's girl, ann sheridan, in a brief but good performance, get killed while trying to elude the police.a crooked attorney persuades garfield to flee n.y. he lands in arizona and meets up with the dead end kids.. they've been sent there by a funding program to keep them out of further trouble.of course, garfield finds a new love interest but must conceal his identity as everyone thinks he was not only the killer but was the victim in the car crash.may robson is fabulous as the grandma type running the place for the wayward youth. claude rains is also effective in the role of the detective who suspects that garfield is still alive and pursues him when a picture is snapped of him in arizona.the film really deals with garfield's relation to the boys. while the ending is good, you want to see garfield go back to n.y. to proclaim his innocence.

as a fan of old warner brothers gangster movies i had to check this out,its the 2nd best movie in the adventure classics dvd set that also had one of my favorite movies;scott of the antarctic on it.this was made in 1939 a good year for a lot of warner brothers movies,it boasts a great cast;john garfield,claude rains,ann sheridan,and the dead end kids,who would be later known as the bowery boys at monogram pictures. well a boxer(garfield)gets framed for a murder he did'nt commit and is on the run and being tailed by a tough new york detective(claude rains) he ends up at a fruit picking place run by a pretty woman(gloria dickson)and the dead end kids(huntz hall,leo gorcey,benard punsley, billy halop,bobby jordan,gabreil dell)he later returns to boxing but tries to keep a low profile.this was directed by famed director busby berkley who directed timeless classics like 42nd street,goldiggers of 1933,and 35,footlight parade and many others.i would like to give a shout out to platinum dvd/video for putting out a lot of good budget priced dvd's like adventure classics(see my scott of the antarctic review)i give they made me a criminal 10 out of 10,great movie. ill have to point out that i have only seen 2 john garfield movies,this one and body and soul.i thought he was a very good actor.

i wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. it's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, john garfield.garfield plays jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. he must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with gloria dickson and the dead end kids. here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? garfield was an actor ahead of his peers. before the term 'method' was even coined and before brando ever screamed 'stella!' he brings 'natural' to the screen. his earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production. also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that 'golden boy' role he so desperately wanted to covet on screen. garfield looks the type and goes the distance as a boxer, proving his acting worth.ann sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as jack's trampy girl goldie. i haven't ever thought much of sheridan, but i liked her here. she plays well off garfield. dickson's' performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with garfield. the dead end kids are here, and garfield seems their natural idol (even more so than cagney). claude rains is miscast, and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene. strange, as he always was such a reliable actor.also interesting to note is the director- busby berkeley, best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images, directs a different genre here with remarkable ease. he maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirably.a very good film that deserves greater attention 8/10.

the early films of the dead end kids (before they were re-christened "the bowery boys") were all very entertaining and well-produced films from warner brothers. despite their being rather formulaic, they still had excellent writing, acting and hold up well over time. do not confuse these with the cheap bowery boys films from monogram pictures--despite the presence of huntz hall and leo gorcey, these films were several notches below the earlier films in regard to quality.the film begins with tough-guy john garfield winning the lightweight boxing championship. unfortunately, shortly after this he's on a drunken binge and is blamed for a murder he really didn't commit. the problem is that he was so loaded that he wasn't sure he didn't kill the man, so he runs away and lives the life of a hobo. eventually, he meets up with feisty may robson and the dead end kids--as well as a lady you just know will become his girlfriend given time.where the rest of the film goes was not all that surprising, but because of the quality of the film, it doesn't seem to matter. garfield and the kids are at their best and this is a film sure to please all but the pickiest of viewers.

another enjoyable warner flick. i really liked john garfield in this, though i'm wondering why cagney wasn't in the role. perhaps it was too similar to angels with dirty faces? i mean, it's another dead end kids story of sorts too, but i really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. the boys work great with garfield. a nice sequence was the whole "swimming" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.one negative comment: claude rains was grossly miscast. as the detective, the fine actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a whorehouse.

***spoilers*** even though the movie "they made me a criminal" is nowhere as good as the later john garfield anti-hero classics like "body & soul" in 1947 "force of evil" in 1948 and his last and very underrated "he ran all the way" in 1951 it's the film that defined his career from that point onward until his untimely death on may 21, 1952 at the young age of 39. garfiled plays the part of light weight champion johnnie bradfield and later the fugitive from the law jack dorney who's innocent of the murder that he's charged with, even though he's been declared officially dead. jonnie's manager doc ward, robert "doc" gleckler, who during a drunken victory party killed reporter charles mcgee,john ridgely, who was going to expose to the public his fighter johnnie bradfield lies about him being a one women guy as well as non drinking momma's boy. doc gleckler smashed a bottle over mcgee's head killing him as jonnie was almost dead drunk with a number of women partying in his hotel suite. doc was later killed in a car crash with johnnie's girlfriend goldie, ann sheridan, but doc burned to a crisp and with johnnie's watch on him was mistaken for johnnie. told to stay dead and buried by his lawyer malvin ,robert strange, who took $9,750.00 of the $10,000.00 of johnnie's money that he had for this great piece of advice. malvin told johnnie to take on a new identity and call himself from now on jack dorney and get the hell out of the state of new york; talking about sleazy shysters. johnnie now jack dorney travels the rails from new york down to arizona ending up at the rancho rafferty date farm where most of the film takes place.if it wasn't for john garfield in the lead role as both jonnie bradfield & jack dorney the movie would have long been lost and forgotten. garfield who was only 26 at the time brought the best out of everyone in the movie. even the transported dead end kids, i guess we can call them the arizona kids here, acting were notches above what you would have expected from them and they came across as real and sensitive persons not a bunch of slap stick clowns like in almost all of their movies. all that due to being on the same stage, or filming location, with john garfield. "they made me a criminal" is a good story that has the undercover champ acting like anything but not to draw any attention on himself and end up not only behind bars but in the electric chair. in the end jack showed just what kind of man he is by not fighting the big fight and against all the odds dramatically winning at the last moment but by going four brutal rounds to get the money for his new found family at the date farm including his girl peggy, gloria dickson, to open up a gas station with it. giving the european champ gaspar rutchek, frank riggi, the fight of his life and getting $2,000.00, thats $500.00 a round, for doing it jack showed everyone who looked up to him like the "arizona kids" that sometimes taking a punch is far braver and more courageous then throwing one.the fact that jack could have easily clobbered rutched but didn't in order not to expose himself to the police, as on the loose killer johnnie bradfield. but instead went as far as he could taking everything that rutchek could throw at him to help out his friends showed more then all the fights that he won in the boxing ring put together. i for one didn't find the ending of the movie contrived at all but fitting right in with the story. the cop morty phelam, claude rains, who came to arizona from new york to arrest jack had to live with for years the fact that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair. we were told all this right at the start of the movie. why knowing that jack/johnnie was innocent of the murder that he's charged with and not knowing for sure if he'll be found innocent of it in a court of law would he want to make the same terrible mistake again? i can easily see this happening in real life why not then in the movies.

the young john garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 "they made me a criminal." celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer johnnie bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. and the whiskey.a problem develops when another couple arrives. the guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose bradfield's phony life on the front page. the manager kills the reporter and he and the floozy depart. the murder discovered, cops, later, are on the lookout for the now somnolent boxer whose car is driven by the manager with his new girlfriend-johnny's now instant ex. a police chase ends with a fiery car crash. manager and girl are dead and unrecognizable.johnny discovers that he's supposed to be a killer. but he's also presumed dead. seeking advice from a lawyer, he entrusts the counselor with the key to a bank deposit box holding his sole savings, $10,000. the lawyer later gives johnny $250 and tells him that the balance is his fee for giving him professional advice: get out of town, fast, and go far away. (i would never charge a client more than $5,000 for such pithy, succinct and wise direction.) johnny, now a freight train hopping hobo, winds up conveniently passing out at an arizona date ranch where he's nursed back to health by beautiful goldie west, ann sheridan, a fine actress whose career was in the ascendancy. taking jack dorney as his moniker, the pugilist loses some of his rough edges as he falls in love with goldie. he becomes a mentor and pal to - the dead end kids. familiar screen characters to pre-war moviegoers.a chance to make money arises when an exhibition boxer shows up challenging any suckers to last several rounds in the ring with him. it's a natural temptation for bradfield/dorney but there's a fly in the ointment. who should show up but new york detective monty phelan, the laughing stock of the department? he's been on morgue duty for ages because of a slight mistake early in his career that sent an innocent man to old sparky (we all make mistakes, don't we?) phelan recognized bradfield from a news photo and he's there to watch the fight and make the pinch. claude rains is the cop who's endured slights and barbs from his fellow officers for years.what follows is predictable but it's well acted. i hope this was a main feature when it was released-it's too good to rank as a "b" second on a marquee.busby berkeley, best known as an outstanding choreographer, directed "they made me a criminal" and max steiner, one of hollywood's all-time prolific score composers, wrote nice but not extraordinary music for the film.now available on dvd from alpha video, the movie set me back a mere $4.99 and gave me real pleasure. i'll view it again.8/10

a beautiful film.john garfield's character is a distant relative of "les miserables"'s jean valjean while detective rains recalls victor hugo's javert,the ruthless arm of law.like in many films noirs,the city epitomizes evil whereas the country and the nature represents sanctuary,redemption,and a second chance for those whose life seems forever doomed.but even in the luminous daylight,danger may appear suddenly,as the excellent scene at the reservoir shows.john garfield -an actor who,as leonard maltin points out,should be rediscovered:i've never been disappointed by any of his films except for his supporting part in "gentleman's agreement " but it was not his fault-gives a heartfelt sensitive performance and the audience sides with him as soon as he is unjustly accused (the first sequence shows a rather unkind hypocrite person,but all his trials redeem him and how do we feel for him during the last scenes with detective rains.colorful characters (grandma and the kids ) add a lot of joie de vivre which is necessary .humor is also present in the strip poker game as the dead end brats fleece a rich kid.i recommend this movie.

this is breezy highly entertaining drama with an excellent cast. garfield is fine as a boxer hiding from the police with that motley crew the dead end kids. most notable of these is the beautiful billy halop who has some very moving moments. gloria dickson, who in real life died very young in a house fire, is strong and very attractive as halop's sister, and in the early scenes ann sheridan, on the brink of stardom, is a knock-out. may robson is very funny as a crusty old granny, but claude rains proves here that even a great actor can flounder if mis-cast (whoever thought of casting him as a tough new york cop?).busby berkeley proves here that he was a fine director with or without musical numbers. the film moves at a terrific pace and the water tower sequence is very suspenseful and well photographed. the ending is contrived, and the plot nothing startling or original, but i still found this a highly enjoyable experience.

they made me a criminal is a remake of an earlier warner brothers film, the life of jimmy dolan which starred douglas fairbanks, jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.even with the restrictions now upon production by the hays office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. douglas fairbanks, jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. john garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.they made me a criminal was directed by busby berkeley who jack warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. berkeley in fact would soon be leaving warner brothers for mgm. berkeley does do a fine job here, keeping the action flowing at a good pace. i particularly like the scene where four of the dead end kids and garfield are swimming in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down. they get it out of it quite narrowly and with some good ingenuity.other performances besides garfield and the kids to remember are may robson who runs the summer camp for the kids and claude rains as the obsessed detective on garfield's trail.

it's always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods when you weren't expecting it. the dead end kids/bowery boys found themselves in a lot of uneven films, and usually did better when in a support role, as in "angels with dirty faces". here, their presence as a backdrop to the story of a boxer framed for murder gives them a lot of screen time without distracting from the main action.john garfield is light heavyweight champion johnny bradfield, a southpaw hitter who's a lot different from the image he portrays to the sports world and the press. when a newspaper reporter inadvertently learns that johnny's a party loving womanizer, his plans to spill that information in a column is interrupted by a whiskey bottle to the head from johnny's manager doc ward (robert gleckler). in turn, doc talks johnny's girlfriend goldie (ann sheridan) into running off with him to avoid the legal hassle of dealing with the reporter's death. as both flee, a police chase winds up in a fiery car wreck, and doc's body is misidentified as johnny from the gold watch he was wearing.claude rains adopts an edward g. robinson sneer that doesn't quite work as a detective who's been reassigned to morgue detail after a bad arrest years ago. his character is monty phelan, and he has a pretty good hunch that the body in the car crash wasn't johnny. he pesters his boss to hand over the closed case to him, and is given the assignment to get him out of town and out of the way.meanwhile, johnny looks for advice from his lawyer, and winds up being screwed even worse when he gets conned for most of his ten thousand dollar savings. making his way cross country, johnny winds up at the rancho rafferty date farm in arizona, run by a crusty granny rafferty (may robson). the farm is the legacy of granny's brother, a deceased priest from brooklyn, and is now the home of a band of rag tag street boys (the dead end kids) who work the farm. billy halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this one, and his sister peggy (gloria dickson) becomes the romantic interest for johnny, now going by the name of jack dorney.i get a kick out of the historical perspective offered in these pre-war era films. when johnny and the boys take a joy ride in the farm's truck, they fill up at a gas station for a $1.28! tommy (halop) gets the idea that a gas station on the farm would be a good way to earn some extra money, and with that thought, jack dorney decides to take on a barnstorming boxer offering $500 a round to anyone who can stay in the ring with him. the clichéd premise is turned on it's ear somewhat when jack gets knocked out in the fifth round, but by then he's earned enough to give the fruit farm a fighting chance of it's own. maybe grandma rafferty should have been in the ring, she just about took out everyone sitting around her at ringside. as johnny/jack comes around in the locker room, detective phelan is on hand to take him into custody. knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this collar, it's a toss up as to whether phelan follows through on his arrest - you'll have to watch the film to find out.i like the dead end films where leo gorcey's in charge, but he doesn't have a lot to do in this one. however he does a great film flam on the ticket taker at the gate of the boxing match. another thought - wouldn't it have been great if the ever present picture on the wall of the priest had been that of pat o'brien?all in all, this is a pretty good entry in both the john garfield and dead end kids filmography, and an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half. if there's one downside, it's not enough screen time for pretty ann sheridan. the film might have wound up even more satisfying if the roles of sheridan and gloria dickson were reversed, as the on screen chemistry between dickson's peggy and jack seemed more forced than natural.

i must have been around ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to see this martial arts movie at the " drive in " at the circle drive in in long beach. the title was " hammer of god " from which i can never forget for some reason, but what i do remember are the different scenes that have left an imprint on my mind forever.my brother always reminds me of the movie although it has been forever it seems since we seen the movie. from time to time throwout the years i would look for it at the rental stores and from time to time i would check on the web and for some reason it appears like it is never available or no one knows what movie i'm talking about.if i only knew if and were it was available i would love to purchase that movie. if anyone is aware of its availability please inform me.

jimmy wang yu, an authentic asian superstar, directed and wrote this film which i have only seen in a dubbed videotape version. the widescreen (shaw scope!)shape was lost and the original actor's voices absent but this is still good to watch. the story is the usual martial arts school fights villains from japan plot with our young hero winning out in the end by beating up loads of assorted thugs.the combat gets better as the film unravels. early in the film it looks stiff and dull but later there is a great scene where wang yu fights hordes in a gambling joint then walks out into a snowy scene and takes some more villains on with knives, sword and fists. that part is very exciting.quite good then but it would be interesting to see a non dubbed widescreen version if there is one.

i will be honest, i rented this movie solely on the fact it was part of the "child's play" series. i was expecting a boring dull 4th part too the series, but i was surprised. this movie was surprisingly good, and i found it to be quite funny. there was a lot of dark humor, and the idea to have two dolls was a good way to spice things up. the two dolls worked well together and added a bonnie and clyde type fell to the movie. overall it was very good for a 4th movie in the series, with some gruesome death scenes (just watch the marilyn manson type get killed at the beginning, not to mention john ritter getting a face full of nails). applauds to the writers for spicing things up, and the ending although i found it a bit strange leaves room for yet another sequel...maybe "son of chucky"!!!

it's just that. chucky 1 was good. chucky 2 was better. chucky 3 sucked. now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. jennifer tilly was just great in this movie. for dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (freddie prince jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies i've seen in the past.the plot wasn't great, but i really didn't care about it. just to see chucky and tiffany bicker and fight each other. and the ending leaves it wide open for a 5th sequel (which i hear is in the works). idle hands premiers next week and looks to be another horror/comedy, but i doubt it'll top this one.

on march 17, 1974, a man is found dead in the toilets at manhattan's penn station. although well-known, he cannot be identified because he scratched out the personal information in his passport and his body lays unclaimed at the city's morgue for three days. it turned out to be the body of what many consider one of the greatest american architects of the twentieth century, louis i. kahn. he died at the age of 73, on his way from india, where one of his greatest projects, the institute for management in ahmedabad, was nearing completion.one of the most influential post-war american architects, louis kahn's architectural legacy includes the house of parliament in dhaka, bangladesh, the kimbell art museum in forth worth, the yale art gallery, the salk institute in california and a kind of mobile "music boat", designed to give concerts in harbours in various cities around the world.while celebrated as an architect, very little was known about his private life. in addition to his wife esther, and their daughter, sue ann, kahn was survived by two mistresses, harriet pattison and anne tyng, and their two children. all three families lived within miles of each other in suburban philadelphia, but their paths never crossed until the funeral. his son, nathaniel, the director of this film, was only 11 years old at the time, and had only a few memories of his father's weekly visits at harriet patterson, nathaniel's mother, in philadelphia. twenty-five years later, he sets out on a journey to confront his father by visiting kahn's buildings, talking to relatives and colleagues and visiting the places that played a role in louis kahn's life.one of the most moving confrontations is when nathaniel asks his mother, a landscape architect and mistress of louis kahn, why she kept up with playing second fiddle to his wife and never confronted him with this. tears shed her eyes, but she has no regrets. "it was worth it." it's such an intensely sad moment. she's obviously shattered, treated as an outcast at his funeral, which she was forbidden to attend, it's almost as if she led a substitute life. it all feels strangely unreal. another interview with edward bacon, kahn's architectural nemesis, who was in charge of the rebuilding of his native philadelpia in the fifties and sixties, almost suffers a stroke on the spot, when he is reminded of kahn's unsavoury ideas about architecture. his son, nathaniel, listens uncomfortably when a very senior bacon literally screams with anger whenever kahn's name comes up. the final scene is reserved for kahn's grandest creation, the capitol in dhaka, bangladesh. it took 23 years to complete, a vast and extraordinary building, of which the bangladeshi are extremely proud. it's one of the very few national symbols with stature in this impoverished nation. some of the interviews with the locals brought tears in my eyes, especially when they find out they are talking to - god forbid - the architect's own son!the film is as much a personal journey as it is an account of kahn's grand architectural legacy and is above all about the fruition of the film itself and film-making in general. perhaps louis i. kahn faltered as a father, but these shortcomings in his personal life make for an all the more interesting portrait in this extraordinary film.camera obscura --- 9/10

this is a profound and moving work about the creation of art, that which is uniquely human and cannot be produced by nature, the cost of genius and the search for transcendence and what in the end constitutes family, i.e, all of us. i was very much moved by the family discussion that nathaniel had with his sisters about the shortcomings of their father as it was set in a beautiful home that seemed to radiate warmth that lou had created. and although esther seems so cold in her discussion about lou's inability to make money you can appreciate how she at many points in his life must have been a counter-weight to his impulses. nathaniel did a great job of showing how all of the people in lou's life fit in and completed it and became as much a part of his work as his own genius. yes even, or maybe especially, our failures make us who we are. and of course there are the buildings. i had only known lou kahn by name and did not really connect his name to his work, they are evidence of grace. perhaps someday there will be a building where we will all fit, and it will certainly resemble a lou kahn building, perhaps the unbuilt temple in jerusalem. perhaps there is salvation

when nathaniel kahn embarked into this voyage, he hardly knew who his father really was. by the end of the film, he found him and comes to terms with the strange life he lived as a child.louis kahn was the father. he was an architect's architect. his designs were perhaps too complex, as he tried to create buildings that didn't conform with trends popular at that time. it is ironic that he never achieved the fame that came so easy to some of his contemporaries. he had a vision and he never strayed from it. we can see characteristics of his unique style in the buildings he left behind as a legacy to humanity. every one of his creations are unique in that they don't imitate works from other architects.louis kahn's life was rather complicated. he was married, yet he had affairs with two of his assistants that produced a girl and a boy, besides the legitimate daughter he had with his wife.as a boy, nathaniel kahn's life was lived in a secluded area, away from his father, who only visited late at night. louis kahn never recognized these children, although it is very clear they all knew about the others existence. it is tragic that louis kahn died alone in grand central station when he was returning from a trip without making peace with the women and children he never acknowledged as his own by his side. he probably cared a great deal about all his children, but he remains an aloof figure throughout the film. we never get to know the man, although at the end, nathaniel, in his quest to discover his father's life, finds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle.this is a personal account on the life of an artist. thanks to that son, who has the courage to tell the story, we are almost prying into the lives of louis kahn and his extended family.

nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's academy awards, my architect follows filmmaker nathaniel kahn in his quest to find out about his father, the legendary architect louis i kahn. lou kahn died in 1974, when nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. my architect follows kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings, and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius. as the son which lou never publicly acknowledged during his lifetime, nate has delicately placed himself in the story without overpowering the main focus. when examining the magnificent salk institute in california, nate evokes his father's mythic use of space and light in his buildings, making it a peaceful and fascinating experience for viewers. the shot of nate rollerblading in salk's smoky white central meeting place emphasises the building's harmony with nature. it's breathtaking. my architect also covers the difficulty louis kahn had with getting his designs accepted. several fantastical buildings exist only on paper, dismissed by more practical architects and property developers. it wasn't until louis kahn went to the east that his visions were enthusiastically embraced. in india, where he built the indian institute of management, a former co-worker describes him as a guru. in bhangladesh, where he built the magnificent national assembly building, citizens consider him a father of democracy. watching my architect is a wonderful way to begin or continue learning about architecture and the importance of space. but it's the irony of lou kahn's egotism combined with the transcendence of his work that will inspire you. 4 stars.

what a tribute to his father! he set out on a quest to learn more about a man whom he knew little of, and by the end of the journey, i believe nathaniel kahn is content with what he learned and personally felt. the film is 5 years in the making, and a quarter of a century after his death, louis i. kahn's total commitment in his work - consistent strong desire to build buildings that are meaningful to humanity and timeless to the whole world, with insight into his life is proudly depicted by his son nathaniel in the documentary "my architect: a son's journey".the film is by no means an anthology of louis' work. there are plenty of books and archived materials that have records of louis kahn's projects and buildings. this documentary works like a mystery, writer-director and co-producer nathaniel kahn was searching for the man whom he briefly knew as his father. the film is in chapters. in "heading west," we're at the salk institute for biological studies at la jolla, california. it's a sight worth beholding - kahn's integral concept of building and environment, optimizing light for the scientists at work is amazing. from a former colleague who worked with 'lou' 35 years ago, we hear about his meticulous attention to detail, also how 'rambunctious' he could be - certainly didn't mince words in his criticism. a memorable scene is when the camera pulled back wide and we see nathaniel skating around at the plaza area of the salk institute - a tiny figure, like a child happily playing in the bowl of his father's hands. the "immigrant" segment brought us to meet anne tyng, the architect who collaboratively worked with 'lou' and also bore him a daughter, alex. now at 80, tyng's return with nathaniel's film crew to the bath house project at trenton, new jersey, was nostalgic. in "go to sea," we get to see the barge for american wind symphony orchestra - all made of steel, and meeting robert boudreau, who was surprised by nathaniel when he finally told him he's 'lou's' son. boudreau was touched, he said he had seen nathaniel when he was six, with his mom (harriet pattison), and he was not to tell anyone that lou had a son. it was a 'chokingly' emotional moment of reunion.like his father "the nomad," nathaniel traveled to jerusalem, and learned about the synagogue project that his father began but not realized. he visited the wailing wall, and seeing his yarmulke kept falling off/being 'breezed off' his head gave me a sense that he need not be 'totally' jewish to be his father's son. we continue with sitting down with his two half-sisters at the "family matters" segment. we also hear him conversing with his mom at maine, and from talking to previous office personnel at his father's office, we come to know how his father intensely worked and practically lived there, sleeping on a carpet on the office floor, weekends and all. "the end of the journey" brought us to ahmedabad, india, to the indian institute of management building. talking with architect b.v. doshe was a revelation. in the end, nathaniel found a very much alive louis kahn, his father - his spirits live within him. this documentary is very much a tear-jerker for me. i was teary-eyed most of the time - it was very touching and am in awe of the man, the architect and his son, and the women in his life besides his famous works and buildings. louis i. kahn wanted to give his love to the 'whole world,' juggling work and three families (you might say he has three women in his life to keep his inspiration going). as shamsul wares, the architect at the capital of bangladesh complex (completed 9 years after 'lou's' death) so poignantly noted: louis kahn has given the people of bangladesh a lot, spending time at bangladesh, understanding the culture of the place and people - as well as giving them democracy through what he has achieved, and for such a dedicated man, usually the people close to him he'd often miss seeing. it seems the price of being great comes with inevitable personal sacrifices. this film reminds me of king vidor's "the fountainhead" 1949 (good dramatic story in b/w with music by max steiner), based on ayn rand's novel, with gary cooper as the uncompromising architect who stands by his own ideals, and patricia neal as the parallel supportive woman in his life.

what starts as a homespun comedy-drama and then halfway turns into a melodrama made a major star of john garfield - and justly so. but jeffrey lynn is not to be dismissed as the object of affection of the four daughters. lynn is very handsome and is so charming it's easy to believe that all four daughters could fall for him. although garfield received most of the kudos, lynn became a major leading man at warner bros. as a result of this film.michael curtiz insisted on location shooting for the picnic scene, making it the highlight of the film. throughout, the craftsmanship is enough to inspire awe. a soap opera by fanny hurst has been turned into a cinema masterpiece.

story about a widowed father (claude rains) bringing up his four daughters. emma (gale page) is loved by big hunky ernest (dick foran). thea (lola lane) is romanced by an old but wealthy man. kay (rosemary lane) wants to become a singer. ann (priscilla lane) is a romantic. drop dead handsome felix deitz (jeffrey lynn), a business associate of their father, comes to stay with them. all the sisters fall in love with him. then tough cynical mickey (john garfield) enters the picture...very entertaining movie was a big hit and nominated for five academy awards. it's beautifully directed by michael curitz, has a pretty good (if predictable) script and a very attractive cast (especially lynn). also this was john garfield's first film and made him a star. this was so popular there were three or four sequels (which i never saw). this is an engrossing, entertaining, big budget soap opera--well worth seeing.

"four daughters," a sentimental story of a solid middle class family with four sisters, was notable in one respect: into this romantic, idealized milieu enters mickey borden carelessly dressed, with an uncompromising attitude to all bourgeois values, he really sets the hearts of the sisters aglow his criticisms are not only directed towards those about him but also towards himself one day ann (priscilla lane) discovers him passionately playing the piano "that's beautiful," she says "it stinks," he replies he falls in love with  and marries  ann but eventually, realizing that their basic incompatibility is leading their marriage into disaster, he takes the equally uncompromising step of causing his fall the role was superbly played by john garfield, and it brought him not only stardom but also, and perhaps more important, won for him his place in cinema history as the screen's first rebel hero garfield was born in new york's east side of russian immigrant parents, and spent his adolescence as a delinquent, a real life role that he only relinquished when he began to portray the rebel on screen he continued, however, throughout his life to question and reject certain traditional values he was occasionally suspended by the studio and maintained a cynical view of hollywoodfinally he ended his career and his life as one of the victims of mccarthy's witchhunt he was blacklisted by hollywood because of his suspected left wing sympathies and friends claimed that being banned from working contributed to the heart attack' that killed him at the early age of 39

warning,contains spoilers!this is one of the best italian sleaze films i've seen.the plot has a teenage girl who is interested of occultism and has supernatural powers.her mother is a member of satanist group and is afraid what influences it'll have on the girl.no need to worry, the girl knows just what to do and there's no return,she belongs to satan..during the film odd things happen in typical italo way,there's not too much logic,but that's only good thing.it's amazing how entertaining these films are.. on the final battle we see her and her mother fighting each other (nude off course) and doing some mysterious rituals,you might guess who wins... the films final pictures leaves your mouth open and wandering why can't there be more films like this?there's superb music through the whole film and the actors are quite good,better than usual in these type of films.specially anne heywood looks and acts good.it also has some unusual camera angles and stuff like that, so it's not boring at all.my rating is 10.hopefully someone releases this on dvd.

you've got to think along the lines of last tango in paris for this one because the mood and emotion runs along the same lines and maintains the same heights - the difference being that in this exceptional, intense and torrid depiction of love among the ruins of a dostoyevskyian dispossessed the setting is a gay-subcultural milieu - perhaps even one that is set to vanish in time, and not the equally arresting but heterosexual context of bertolucci's own film.the last third of this film depicts a passionate love never seen in gay cinema. to talk of pornography or gay self-effacement misses the point and intelligence of this work. this film, though on first impression appears to take us into the familiar & often depicted underworld of gay street-life, then precedes to subvert the rules of this genre by exaggerating it to a super-real degree. the result is a hyper-charged emotional heightening - an exceptional strategy that elevates the drama to one of big universal themes and giant gestures.this film snatches the high ground because of the brilliant performances by it's actors, notably a young jean hugues anglade and the directing. a tour- de -force of cinema. outstanding in ambition and it's unceasing plummet into the depths of human emotion. as a contribution to gay cinema, this film conquers this difficult ground and makes it it's own triumph.

a fine performance by vittorio mezzogiorno and a masterful one by jean-hugues anglade adorn this stange tale of lust, desire and alienation in france. the work of the two lead performers is striking--subtle, intense and passionate. alas, the script is deliberately turgid and sordid, and the overall effect leaves one with a downcast spirit. still, those who can appreciate fine quality acting will be able to savor the courageous work of the leads in this often difficult film journey of gallic low life.

when this showed at the seattle int'l film fest i was the only person standing and clapping and cheering. the rest of the crowd booed or was silent. it is a well played small film that reaches deep into the reality of a young gay man's humanity. it is about a real man; and does not play to the insipid hyper-buffed muscular "gay paositive" that passes for the genre of non-porn gay cinema (and that is why so much of contemporary gay genre movies are so dull). this movie is intense passsion and great tragedy. the acting and directing and cinematography is fantastic; it all keeps the film clastrophobic and tense and passionate. don't miss this if you can find it.

l'homme blesse is not for an impatient, adventure-seeking audience. there are no explosions nor is the drama straightforward. like the films of lynne ramsey, the director is working more deeply with mood than with storytelling in a manner that is effective and incredibly moving. because it does not rely on gratuitous nudity, or superficial pop-cult. story lines, this is quite frankly one of the best gay foreign film i have seen (also, see francois ozon, pedro almodovar). nicolas roeg's "don't look now" gets a lot of bad press because it is sold as a horror film. that film, like l'homme, is more than what the box might lead you to believe. if you are in the mood to sit back and be absorbed by the subtle, transformed powers of cinema, you'll love this movie.

though for most of us, sexiness is a variable quality, i cannot recall a movie that did for me what this one does. it transported me into an awfully familiar realm of longing and desire. all the compulsive attraction, uncertainty over the outcome, the palpable fear and excitement so attendant to that state of arousal were brought to fever pitch by this flick. so french and what i consider daring! no matter what your orientation, i think that the danger of chasing your desire is brought full-front and center here...much more so, say, than with kubrick's "eyes wide shut".

i gave this show a chance because of jaleel white, not for his urkel character, but mainly for the sonic the hedgehog voice xd so anyway, like i said, i gave it a chance, and i was very fond of it. i never cared for the urkel character, so i was pleased to see mr. white in a role other than the ever-so-annoying nerd. and his calvin j. fraiser (first called calvin, but come the second episode, everyone started calling him "j") was very entertaining and interesting.i think my favorite episode was when j was dating the ex-cowboys cheerleader with the snobby kid. ("don't you talk that way 'bout my momma!" "this is grown-up talk, you stay down there!") the only beef i have is that the show was suppose to have 3 main characters, but mr. white's character always seemed to have the most attention and the other two (who are married) always had the back stories... it isn't exactly a good thing when a story about those two possibly being pregnant takes backseat to j. having to babysit his girlfriend's dog.....other than that, i really wish this show could have lasted a little longer. unfortunetely, it seems that people weren't interested in jaleel white as something other than the god-awful annoying ass nerd known as urkel....hope they at least put it out as a dvd box set.

to be honest fellow imdb reviewers, i enjoyed this show a lot. the reason? well, it didn't try to be more than it is; i mean, a sitcom with regular expectations, with a well known and repeated plot, funny and talented actors, and clever jokes oriented for a post college audience.this is what grown ups is all about: trying to be mature but in a funny way.jaleel white is funny as always and delivers some witty, and hilarious sex oriented jokes. the humor is very 90's without taking in account the tendencies of the new millennium and that's the main reason in my opinion why the show didn't have success. it got stuck in the 90's.oh and mrs. ribisi was really funny and perky.my favorite show has to be the one that deals with karma biting the ass! not a cult classic but i'm sure it's part of regular early 2000's nostalgia.

when i first viewed the trailer,i have to decide if this series would be perfect for my collection. but after hearing about it,i decided to buy it. when i bought the entire collection in a box set,it was absolutely what i wanted to see. it was very funny,and the characters were pretty cool. favorite characters in the show are:marion,carrot,the haze knights,big momma,and dotta. i also liked the opening and ending theme songs. the show also has some great voice talents from tiffany grant,jason douglas,and others. but however,this show is one of the greatest. so if you want to see something cool. then this show is the one.

this is a classic animated film from the cartoon series! most of the major characters get alot of screen time plus do extra characters aswell! the film`s focus is on the superstar characters vacation and each one has his/her very unique summer fun! its very funny from beginning to end! it has excellent color, great music and believe it or not i have seen this more than any movie. its that great and in my opinion its perfect!

as a big fan of tiny toon adventures, i loved this movie!!! it was so funny!!! it really captured how cartoons spent their summers.

i watch this movie at the start of every summer, and it never ceases to amuse me. here the jokes are packed in near every line of dialogue, giving you more bang than the average simpsons episode. some of the jokes fall flat or will only elicit a slight chuckle, but others will leave you rolling and then there are those that stick in your brain... "the audience is now deaf."the video knows it's a video, and makes no pretensions about being anything else. it's easy to sit back and let the bombardment of humor begin. a good mix of slapstick, pop culture, and tongue-in-cheek comedy ensures there's something for everybody. i was in sixth grade when i first saw this video, and i have to admit i still find it as hilarious now that i've started college.this is a good movie to watch over the summer, much in the way you might watch "it's a wonderful life" at christmas or "ten commandments" at easter/passover. more than that, it's just funny as hell.

while not the first movie i've purchased for myself, this is almost certainly the one i've watched the most. the animation is well-drawn by the experts at tokyo movie shinsa, and the animators frequently made use of clever techniques such as having the sun cause "lens flare", having the camera get soaked (and having the "camera operator's hand" clean the lens!) etc. while the film avoided becoming a an "animator's gadget-fest", the judicious but generous application of such techniques gave the film a much more "realistic" feel than the typical cartoon.the story has many interweaved plots which don't seem to have much to do with each other until everything comes together at the end, in a manner even the writers self-effacingly admit is contrived. each of the major plot lines has its own musical theme, ranging from "pop goes the weasel" [hamton & plucky], to the love theme from "romeo and juliet" [fifi & johnny]. the transitions between plotlines are slightly varied, but consistent.truly a wonderful film; there isn't much original music, though the new lyrics to "spinning song" are clever and enjoyable. highly recommended.

you don't have to be a fan of the cartoon show to enjoy this film. i watched it for the first time when i was nine, having been a fan of the t.v show, and my parents laughed just as hard as i did. it is done in the classic style of bugs bunny cartoons from yesterday, and considering todays vulgar cartoons, i would think anybody would appreciate a cartoon movie that relies more on "wackiness" then on vulgarity, to get a few laughs.

i love this movie... it can make me laugh! =^_^= which is kinda hard to do. this movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations ever. it doesn't warp the characters like other movies out there. everyone is in character and has a role to play!the movie focuses around buster and babs going down river after a flood (courtesy of buster), to plucky going on a trip with hamton (hilarious stuff), elmyra running around torturing animals (as usual), fifi following her crush around for an autograph, and shirley and fowlmouth going to the movies.in my own personal opinion, i didn't like the buster and babs segments that much, although they had some notable dialogue and jokes. i have got to say the plucky and hampton 'vacation' parts were the best! hamton's family is hilarious! i especially like uncle stinky. fifi in the hotel was also hilarious. i love the actor cameos during this scene. :dprobably the most famous part in this movie, again imho, is when fowlmouth and shirley are in the movie theater... lol! you've got to see it to appreciate it! and when hamton and plucky go through the tunnel to make a wish... :)although this movie moved slowly during the buster/babs parts, the rest is pure gold! i rate this movie 8/10. show this to your kids one day... or even adults yourselves - watch this movie! you won't regret it.

caution: potential spoilers ahead!"steven spielberg presents tiny toon adventures" was always one of my favorite cartoons growing up (heck, it still is). and this movie perfectly captures everything i love about the show and puts it in full-length form.beautifully animated by the tokyo movie shinsa studio (wb outsourced every "tiny toons" project, and this was the best studio to handle the show), the movie starts at the end of the school year at acme looniversity, the renowned cartoon college where buster and babs bunny (no relation) and their teenage toon peers learn from the masters of animated lunacy, the looney tunes. after the final bell, the movie splits off into five different plots. buster engages babs in a water gun fight that culminates with a bursting dam and a tidal wave, sending buster, babs, and elmyra's dog byron downriver on an overturned picnic table in search of adventure in the deep south. plucky duck talks hamton pig and his family into letting him come with them to happyworldland, "the happiest place in the western hemisphere", but he has to put up with an excruciating car ride and the threat of a chainsaw-wielding hitchhiker. elmyra's cat furball finally runs away, but she isn't daunted...not when there are plenty of "aminals" to play with at the acme safari park. fifi la fume devotes her summer to hunting down her heartthrob, movie star johnny pew, in the hopes of getting an autograph. of course, the hotel he's staying at is nearly impenetrable. and shirley mcloon sets up a fortune telling booth on the acme acres boardwalk...and lets her guard down on her day off when fowlmouth takes her to see the horror flick "skunkophobia".all these story lines are sidesplittingly hilarious, and some of them even overlap in the end. the only complaint i have with this movie is that it doesn't make full use of the tiny toons roster - dizzy devil and mary melodie have only one scene, gogo dodo only appears at the beginning and end of the film, and montana max, sweetie, calamity coyote, and little beeper are nowhere to be found. still, they're excusable flaws in an otherwise perfect film. this movie is pretty rare today, since it's over 12 years old and has never been released on dvd to my knowledge, but i highly suggest you track it down - anyone who's a fan of warner bros. animation, either classic or contemporary, needs to see this movie.

tiny toons is the first cartoon i remember watching as a child and i loved every minute of it. when i was four or five my parents purchased the video how i spent my vacation. i watched it over and over again until i new every word. well a few days ago my three year old cousin came over and i had to entertain him. i decided to show him this old relic of my childhood. i new he would laugh but i was surprised how much i laughed. like every tiny toons film and episode the humor is based more on wackiness and slapstick humor and succeeds tremendously. bugs, babs, plucky duck, maton pig, and fifi all endure amazing adventures from bugs and babs white-water rafting with a little help from superman, plucky duck and maton pig travel to the greatest amusement park only to ride the monorail, and elmyra goes on an odd quest to find cute kittens in a safari land.some of the classic humor stands in this tiny toon adventure and is some of the best wacky comedy i've ever seen. my favorite gag had to be the monorail thing when hamton and plucky arrive, ride the monorail, and leave )much to plucky's dismay). no matter what your age you'll laugh yourself to tears while not having to deal with language and nudity.tiny toons adventures: how i spent my vacation. starring the voices of: charles adler, tress macneille, joe alaskey, and don messick.5 out of 5 stars.

this was one of my favorite movies from childhood. i watched it so many times,eventually my tape wore out. i was a huge fan of this show and still am.the thing i love most about this movie is that it appeals to so many people, both young and old. i watch this movie now and laugh just as hard as i did the first time i saw it. i am now able to appreciate all the adult jokes that i never got as a child. my favorite characters are elmyra and foulmouth. almost fifteen years later, my dad (a huge fan of the movie as well) and i are still quoting lines from this movie. i love the part where foulmouth and shirley go to the movies. "you save the seats, shirl and i'll snag the dadgum snacks." i also loved the storyline of plucky and hampton and his family going to happy world land. wade pig reminded me a lot of my dad. i love the part when they finally get to happy world land and all they do is ride on the monorail. this movie is hilarious and appeals to children and kids. the animation, jokes and everything about it are top notch. if you have not seen it, rent it. you won't be sorry.

tiny toons:how i spent my vacation, has always been my favourite animation movie and loved it since i first watched it when i was 7 or sumthing,now i'm almost seventeen and i still love this wonderful work of art..i really like the idea how we track what each of them did in their vacation, and there were really some funny quotes said, that really made me laugh a lot...in this movie u'll never get bored and once u see it u'll want 2 c it again and again, because believe me it's really wonderful and it's suitable for all ages..

it is in the opinion of this reviewer that the best time to be a child was in the 1990's, a period when cartoons were not heavily censored and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment to hit the air-waves. the best producers of saturday morning animation were at warner brothers television, who experienced a major golden age with the dream-team of steven spielberg, tom ruegger and paul dini. along with serious and dark series like batman, they also revived zany, outlandish cartoons made famous by the looney tunes. animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark adult humour and homages to the celluloid of yesteryear and today, but tiny toon adventures was equally popular by re-inventing the looney tunes for a new generation, while still keeping that crazy cartoon violence and intelligent comedy that can hold onto any age group, no matter how old. even when the tiny toons were stretched to a feature-length with how i spent my vacation, it did not feel like a longer episode of the television series, a curse that so often plagues other feature-length adaptations of popular animated shows.the tiny toon gang are young off-springs of the classic cartoon characters who made audiences laugh back in the 1940's and 1950's and are currently learning cartoon comedy to "earn their toon degree." summer vacation has started and each character has their own idea of what to do. buster bunny (charles adler) and babs bunny (tress macneille) start a water gun fight which ultimately leads to acme acres getting flooded and them both sailing down the mississippi. plucky duck (joe alaskey) joins hamton pig (don messick) on a cross-country car trip to the happiest theme park in the world, but hamton's family proves to be more difficult than he imagined. meanwhile, in other stories scattered throughout, elmyra duff (cree summer) tries to find a cat to hug and squeeze, fifi le fume (kath soucie) attempts to go out on a date with her favourite skunk star and shirley the loon (gail matthius) goes to the cinema with a loud-mouth fowlmouth (rob paulen).while the premise sounds thin for a feature-length film, the many directors and screenwriters make all the stories work well together. the best of these is plucky's unfortunate road trip, which utilises a golden comedic opportunity very well: feeling pity for somebody, while also laughing at their predicament. plucky's annoyed reaction to all the bad things that happen to him are a perfect blend of script and animation, all in the confines of a small car stuffed with pork. elmyra's story definitely ranks second just to see how a little, almost innocent girl can cause fear into so many jungle animals. the aforementioned cartoon violence definitely comes to the fore-front with buster and babs' story, which makes us smile not only due to the hilarity of the outcomes, but also nostalgically, since ruegger and company would probably not be allowed to show half of what they do in that segment. practically half of that segment plays as a parody and homage to deliverance, including a clever twist on the dueling banjos scene, featuring the unforgettable tiny toon adventures theme song.part of the universal appeal of the tiny toons is that the humour proves to be very intelligent as it targets subjects with a ferocity that proves that it does not at all deserve the title of "children's fare" that people seem to slap it with. an entire segment featuring fowlmouth's poor etiquette at the cinema pokes fun at yappers in a note-perfect way, along with an additional jab at lucasfilm's thx logo. that scene is done so perfectly that it should be featured before every cinema showing. there are also a couple of moments that poke fun at disney world, cinematic plot holes and even warner's legal department. the fact that today's cartoons are bland and un-creative makes those intelligent moments even more treasuring as there probably will not be another animated series that will come close.after watching how i spent my vacation for the first time in many years, i can say with all certainty that they do not make cartoons quite like they used to. with the ongoing censorship that today's family entertainment receive, one wonders whether anything like this will ever be made again. this review is not only a recommendation of a truly smart film, but also a plea for spielberg, ruegger and dini to team up again and bring forth a magical creation to our minds once again. lord knows that the children of the twenty-first century is in need for something with the intelligence of tiny toon adventures. this is not a simple cash-grab, it is a wonderful film with full of spirit, madcap mayhem and hilarity.

when i was a kid, i loved "tiny toons". i especially loved "tiny toons: how i spent my summer vacation". i thought it was laughs on the floor funny. a few years later, my friend had the video. and i figured i'd watch it for the good old days. i was still on the floors laughing. my opinion, the plucky and hampton skit is the best. they decide to go to "happy world land". and they end up having a crazy adventure to get there. all the skits are funny. i'm still looking for the video. so, if anyone has any tips. please write me. this is one of the funniest cartoons i have ever seen.10/10

how i spend my vacation puts closure to the television series that aired from 1990 to 1992. i've always enjoyed the series for what it is. i've never compared the series to the looney tunes of the old days. the video release was split up in four or five episodes (i can't remember as i'm writing this) for television and it's included in the episode list of the series. what's good about this series is that all the main characters of the show have a major role in the story. we see what they all do during their summer vacation in different parts of the world. elmyra is with his parents in a safari, plucky and hampton crossing the country with hampton's parents, fifi is in some beach, etc. the climax is very good and at the end all tiny toon characters reunite for the start of a new year in the "looniversity", thus practically ending the good run of this tv show.

this is a great flick! it is funny for everyone, even adults. we got jason voorhees/leatherface like killer in this, along with other wacky characters. very funny flick, for children of all ages. must of rented this every time we went to the video store! buster and babs make a good pair, and gotta love the duck. he is probably my favorite character! i was never big on the tv show but this movie just brings back so many great memories. must see for families, fans of the show, or anyone! enjoyable no matter how small or old you are! rent it now at your local video store!p.s. needs a dvd release!

before watching this movie my thoughts were like "another israeli typical movie" but i was suprised to watch i great israeli drama. the plot is really good and the actors act great. one of the best isreali movies i saw... so at the bottomline i really recommend this movie. :)

one of my favorite movies of all times, have seen it three times already. it does a great job of summing up the isrelai walks of life, israeli humor, and seriousness, and much of the problems israelis go through. universal theme of wanting to be accepted, and be accepted for who you are. good subtle humor, and it's the charisma of the characters, that makes this movie magic, and says a lot about isrlaei culture, and the irnonicness, contradictions, and humor, with a great actor in it, oshri cohen. i highly recommend it to anyone, and it's a movie perfect for practically anyone, family movie, boyfriend/girlfriend movie, and also says apart from israeli culture, wanting to be accepted, most of all, how important family is, with all its diversity and imperfections.great great movie.

over the years some of them most enjoyable films have been about dysfunctional families.bonjour,monsieur sholmi is such a filmthis is an isreali film about a moroccan jewish family.this could be about any family, in any culture. we all know or would want to know people like those in this comic gem.this 2003 delight was written & directed by shemi zorkin. let us hope he a long career.the movie is seen through the eyes of the 16 year old son,who seems to be concerned with everyone in the family. heis brilliantly played by oshri cohen (he was 18 when he made the movie.he has been in a few since & i know i will hunt them up. hopefully this young man will become an international star.the entire cast is magnificent,i do hope i see them again.i loved every person in the cast to some degree.i think all who see this will agree.it has been nominated for many international awards & has won 8, it deserved every one.now being a film in a language besides english it had a very limited run in the usa, which i feel is regrettable.rent this film you will be glad you did.ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 95 points(out of 100) imdb 9 (out of 10)note: since the story is not new, this is as high a rating it can get.

this is a great movie to watch with a good friend, boy/girl friend or family. basically one of those feel good movies you want to share with your loved ones....without all the girlie crap you find in a lot of american feel good movies. this movie is light hearted but makes you think, and will make you laugh. just a really simple but universal plot. would think most people could relate in some way to this movie. the characters in the movie are amazing and the actors do a great job in sucking you into the movie. and the movie is topped off all along the way with hilarious true to life jewish humor. i watched the movie for the first time last night, and now i want to own it. :)

imagine you have just been on a plane for 18 hours. you have been on a business trip to south africa. you are a high-paid professional. you've lived in the us for 20 years. you are in your thirties, you have a wife a little boy and another baby on the way. one thing, even though you have a green card, you are still egyptian. on transit you are asked to come with 2 security guards, next thing you know you are overpowered, hooded and chained and after a brief ( but still reasonably civil) interrogation you are to be rendered! this is what happens to anwar el ibrahimi at the beginning of the movie. his is a story of pain and ( literally )torture. it's one of several story lines. one follows his wife's attempts to get more information. one follows the (cold) bureaucrats behind the rendition. another story deals with the family of the man who leads the interrogation of anwar el ibrahimi. there are some other stories too and by the end they all neatly come together. though the more famous actors like reese witherspoon ( as the distraught pregnant wife ) jake gyllenhaal ( as the cia rookie forced to watch the interrogation in northern africa) and meryl streep ( as cia hotshot corine whitman) it is really the more unknown actors that carry the story and give it it's heart. for me the actor playing the unfortunate mr el ibrahimi ( omar metwally ) was the heart and soul of this movie. his portrayal of a man in distress was shockingly well done. it's almost as if he was being tortured for real! also israeli actor yigal naor was very impressive as the part worried family-man and part extremely cruel chief of torture. hard to watch and not exactly fun, but still very worthwhile.

i think this was the most outstanding edge-of-your-seat thriller that i have seen in a long time. the research for the film was thorough, the writer kelly sane has left no loose ends. the cast was seasoned (fantastic performances all round). omar metwally was outstanding.the cinematography is poetic, music enchanting and the overall effect highly satisfying.rendition goes into territory that even the media fears to tread. it is really a wakeup call for those involved with espionage and the legal web that is the "war on terror". a woman walked out of the theater and asked me "does this really happen"? that in itself speaks of gavin hood's masterful achievement.

rendition presents a very topical matter in the form of a very tense thriller. it's a gripping, and not a preaching, movie. seeing it in an arab country with a mixture of arabian and european audience gave it an extra level of atmosphere. the audience was totally gripped by the film and gave it a loud applause afterwards. the story of an egyptian, married to an american, picked up on the suspicion of links to terrorist organizations and shipped to a friendly (with us) arab country for "enhanced interrogation (as meryl streep's character states in the film: "we have no torture in the us") seems to be from the front page of todays news. there is a very neat link between the various characters which appear in the movie and the pace of the film never drops. the movies'message seems to be (as stated by jake gyllenhal's character in the film) that by abducting and torturing suspects you create many more terrorists. the acting is uniformly excellent with streep and reese witherspoon the stand outs. not to be missed.

i saw the movie yesterday and was shocked by it, but even more shocked by some of the comments i have read here. one person wrote that it was ambiguous if the victim of the torture was guilty or not--therefore... one person wrote that since he wasn't an american citizen, therefore... some people comment that the people in the middle east hate us and want us dead, therefore... so are we saying then that it is right to torture someone who is guilty of a crime? are we saying it is right to torture someone who is not an american citizen? are we saying that it is right to torture someone who may hate us and want us dead? are we saying that, as is written in the geneva convention, the declaration of human rights and the constitution of the united states that "torture is wrong, but some torture is less wrong than others?" when does it become "right" to torture? that is why this movie is powerful-- it is ambiguous, but not about torture. torture is always wrong, and if we are willing to do it, even in the name of justice and "national security" or "freedom and democracy" then we are wrong and we are evil; we are doing exactly what we are accusing our enemies of doing (and we are calling them "wrong" in the same breath.) my favorite line in the film was "if you don't want to compromise join amnesty international." right on.

just reading why this show got canceled makes me rather steamed. this was a favorite of mine as a kid and i always watched it when it came on no matter how many times i saw the episode. sure the effects were not great, but they were also not horrible either. they did a fairly good job with the costume and it had the nice 70's vibe to it that is always enjoyable to see and hear as the music was also very 70's. it did not really have any villains from the comics, but then most comic book live show adaptations had none to very few actual super villains from the comics. spidey's powers were a bit different here too, he had his spidey sense and he could climb walls, but he was not nearly as strong as the spider-man of the comics. he was super strong though as i do remember an episode where he broke into a room by breaking the door knob off, he just was not the car hurler that the one from the comic book can be. the show was set in los angelos so there were not as man buildings to swing from, but they did okay with the web. it is nice that this show actually has the web shooters and not organic shooters of the movie. i love the movies, but part of me wishes they would start over and do the more smarty pants spidey that has the mechanical web shooters. this show had a good star as peter parker and he was okay as spider-man, it is nice to see a spidey who does not basically live in the slums like he does in the movies. neither this show nor the movie though has a spider-man that is quick with the insult like the one in the comic. still, this show was fun without being as corny as the batman show.

my god, ryan gosling has made a lot of deep characters in his career, this is one of his wonderful acting jobs. for me this is a very deep movie, needs a lot of concentration, not because is difficult to watch, just because you understand it if you put your shoes in this kid, even though has everything and has famous father that is a writer, has a deeper mind, you don't understand why he kills this poor kid, until you really heard what he has to say and you start to think, at least to me, that a lot of things that he says is true. simple kid, sweet, very gentle, in a way normal like any teenage, but inside of him suffer because he start to look at the world in a different way, then you understand why he did what he did. i recommend this movie for those who likes deep drama.

this movie was a masterpiece of human emotions and experience. i think that a lot of people get caught up in leland's apparent mental illness as the storyline, but i was drawn into the relationships of many of the characters and what they reveal about the force of human emotions. much of the message of the movie is that we never know the good without the bad, which is a little cliché, but what makes this movie so good and so original is that it very eloquently portrays the crushing and devastating force that the bad can have, whether you see the bad everywhere like leland, or are experiencing the utter helplessness of unrequited love or a relationship that just isn't going to work no matter how bad you want it to. this movie captures how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie i've seen, and it is as depressing a movie as it is good.

this has to be one of the most powerful message-sending movies i saw lately, it was absolutely flawless all the way, amazingly original and thought provoking. story is unusual and original, and the characters make this story very very powerful. it's about a guy who kills his ex-girlfriend's retarded kid brother, and as he is sent to juvenile prison, through many memory flashbacks you get a grip on a story and you don't let it go until the very end. murder he commits changes the course of life for every member of his family and the family of deceased, and as you watch and realize that everyone has its own story and its own dark side you just appreciate this movie even more, it's a total tour de force, cause those actions cannot be described by simple words. his motive of committing murder is left incompletely explained, and it makes viewers think. acting was pretty much flawless, and the cast was very good, it contains many familiar faces. if you like the movies that are thought provoking and that just make u think during them(e.g. 'donnie darko', 'mulholland dr.') then 'the united states of leland' is an excellent movie choice for you, otherwise you should pass this movie and watch it when you're in the mood for serious thought provoking movie.10/10

i remember seeing the trailer for this film and i absolutely knew i had to see this movie. it looked like something that would be right up my alley."the united states of leland" is a terrific movie. it is not one that will leave you with a nice, pleasant ending, but with a sad, empty feeling instead. and when i say it will leave you with an "empty" feeling, i do not mean that as a bad thing. i believe that you are meant to fill that empty feeling with your own thoughts about the characters and human's general motives and how they act as parts of society.ryan gosling is perfectly cast as leland. he is intelligent, yet stoic. i like the way that he narrates the film with his journal. the supporting cast is terrific as well. kevin spacey is very good, as always, and don cheadle is amazing as leland's teacher and mentor. this was a great story and is very smart and thought provoking. i highly recommend it.

i loved this film. a must see for any rod steiger fan. producer suzanne delaurentiis and director stewart raffill have brought us a true family film that touches the soul. an incredibly well put together movie with a beautiful soundtrack.

this film is a sleeper because rod steiger's is the only big name in the credits. yet, all of the supporting actors fit well with his character. it was fitting that in his last film, rod steiger reminded us once more of his inventive power as an actor. he portrayed a grandfather's impulsiveness, stubbornness, and acceptance of the end of life in a characteristically individual and convincing performance. because his character was close to death, the story brings us closer to the most precious things granted to us: the privilege of life, relationships with family members, and the empathy of those who care for us. his search together with his grand daughter for one of his sons provided enough suspense to keep me waiting, expecting a highly-charged climax such as the meeting of two long-separated elderly lovers who were also on the cusp of death in "forever young." i wondered how the meeting would be staged and how tightly my emotions would be wound by the time he and his granddaughter reached the end of his quest. i was delighted to find that the story brought more than i expected. the delightfully satisfying climax brought for me a greater appreciation of the value of the precious gifts of life, love, and family that are enjoyed today by me and by all of us.

i love this movie. the cast were all terrific in the portrayal of their various characters. judith ivey did so well portraying a weak, fearful, dependent, who was passive aggressive in her complaining and self-involved character, that it was a relief to see the character's metamorphosis. blythe danner was equally appealing in her role as a somewhat judgmental jewish mother, devoted wife, and loving sister. jonathon silmerman, bob dishy, stacey glick, and lisa walz performed their roles equally well.if you enjoy movies that relate to going through challenging times without loosing your sense of humor and hope, you will love this movie.

one of my favorite movies. great cast, lead by jonathan silverman and blythe danner. serious drama situations with brilliant comedic punches. an exact mixture of character and story. real people with real problems, and everyone has a different relationship with each family member. sensitively moves from slightly-sad to hilariously-funny. read the quotes. this is the best adaptation of a neil simon play.if you wanna see more of eugene check biloxi blues (starring matthew broderick who played in both stage versions) is ok, a bit on a darker side. get away from the made-for-tv broadway bound.

this is a gently amusing coming-of-age comedy that comes from the later, more mature period of neil simon's writing. although there are plenty of wisecracks to go around, this is not one of those neil simon pieces where every character spouts out one-liner jokes for 2 hours like they're guest stars on a bob hope special. there are also dramatic elements (some work, some are overkill) that lend some weight to the story.the performances are good across the board, especially blythe danner as the mother (although she and judith ivey were oddly wasp-ish choices to play jewish women). i've never been a fan of jonathan silverman, but i will say that he hits the right notes as the obnoxious, gawky, and totally horned-up teen-age narrator/protagonist of the story.the movie is very similar in tone to woody allen's "radio days," but the latter is far more imaginative and funny than this one.

how many of us have read a book or seen a play, and then when the movie version came out we were terribly disappointed? well, maybe this would be one of those movies for those who saw the play too, but as someone who never had the opportunity to see it on stage, i was extremely entertained by this movie. the characters were funny, the music was great, and the story was interesting and made you feel genuine empathy for the characters, flaws and all. jonathan silverman has such good comedic timing, and his lines especially are hilarious. i'm not going to give any spoilers, it's just a nicely done, funny movie showing the inner workings of a middle class family during wwii. so if you never saw the play, and if you have enjoyed other neil simon movies, don't be held back by the couple of negative reviews seen here. on its own, brighton beach memoirs is a great movie. i guarantee it (no money back, though).

the viewer who said he was disappointed seems to be wildly missing the point here. this is a superb movie, excellent and realistic portrayals of a middle class jewish family in brighton beach, brooklyn, of long ago. the nuances are perfect and i felt the casting of everyone was superior. i especially found the acting done by judith ivey just perfection---especially the speech she has with her daughter when the daughter comes home late one night. that scene was oscar worthy. but, really, all the acting was fine. i recommend this movie. it is a fun, family film and delightful to see how a lovely middle class family lived in brooklyn so long ago. see it and you will be glad you did. has some very funny lines and the eugene character is a real comedian--very funny.

this is without a doubt one of neil simon's best plays turned movies. it's full of great characters, and memorable dialog. johnathan silverman makes a great screen version of young eugene(he was played by matthew broderick on stage).this is the first of simon's autobiographical trilogy, its followed by the wonderful "biloxi blues", and closes with the tv movie "broadway bound". if i had to say the movie has any flaws it would maybe be that characters sometimes usually speak in obvious dialog, but that's alright because it's great dialog. rent this little gem, you won't be sorry!

in april 1947, new york city faced an epidemic crisis. eugene labar, a rug importer arriving from mexico, had arrived in the city, bringing with him the deadly smallpox virus. he stumbled off a bus, complaining of fever and a headache, and soon died in a midtown hospital, but not before he had infected a dozen passers-by. the damage was already done; for the first time in decades, smallpox stalked the streets of new york. the city's health authorities acted quickly to isolate sufferers and contain the virus, enacting a free vaccination campaign that saw over six million new yorkers immunised against smallpox. thanks to their swift response, the virus was contained with minimal casualties. the outbreak, nevertheless, must have left an indelible mark, for several years later it was followed by two similarly-themed film noir thrillers in which doctors must track down a single contagious carrier in a city of millions: elia kazan's 'panic in the streets (1950)' and earl mcevoy's lower-budget 'the killer that stalked new york (1950).'mcevoy's film unfolds in an unglamorous docu-drama style. reed hadley's narration sounds as though it was plucked straight from a newsreel, reciting facts as if reading off the official police transcript. this technique does feel a little cheap at times, but fortunately the narration is largely restricted to the film's bookends, as well as providing some explanatory filler during breaks in the plot. the "killer" stalking new york, in this story, is not a rug importer from mexico, but beautiful diamond smuggler sheila bennet (evelyn keyes), who has just arrived from cuba. within days, sheila has two parties independently pursuing her: a treasury agent (barry kelley) looking to arrest her for smuggling crimes, and a team of doctors (led by william bishop) who have identified her as the source of the smallpox outbreak. as in 'panic in the streets,' an otherwise routine manhunt is given a heightened sense of urgency, particularly when those in pursuit initially have no idea as to the identity or appearance of their suspect.'the killer that stalked new york,' for the most part, manages to sidestep its low production budget. aside from a select few lines of dialogue ("we have to stop it!" exclaims dr. wood at one point, as though coming to a difficult decision), the filmmakers and cast members allow the story to unfold in a realistic, engrossing fashion. indeed, in this regard, the low budget quite possibly aids the film's intentions, necessitating a documentary style that adds to the immediacy of the outbreak scenario. evelyn keyes is excellent in the leading role, showing obstinate resilience in the face of unimaginable torment; by the film's end, she appears so brutally incapacitated by her illness that it's almost painful to look at her face. aside from the virus, charles korvin is the main villain of the piece, as sheila's greedy and adulterous husband who, rest assured, gets everything that's coming to him. and if all nurses looked like dorothy malone, perhaps catching smallpox wouldn't seem like such a bad break, after all.

in this crackerjack noir thriller from columbia which is a combination of panic in the streets and the naked city, evelyn keyes is unknowingly the killer that stalked new york. evelyn who smuggled some stolen jewels into the country from cuba also smuggled in smallpox. it gets misdiagnosed by doctor william bishop and when they do find out what it is the hunt is on for her.for most of the film the treasury department is also hunting keyes, but for the smuggled jewels. it's not until nearly the end of the film that the health department and law enforcement realize they're looking for the same woman.evelyn's on a mission also. her husband charles korvin has left her flat, the unkindest cut of all being that he was fooling around with her sister while she was in cuba collecting the gems and contracting smallpox. when lola albright as her sister commits suicide over the whole affair, evelyn's on a mission, get korvin or die trying. and that's not an idle threat given the situation.the film was mostly shot in new york like the naked city and its cast is sprinkled liberally with a lot of familiar names and faces. keep an eye out for good performances by connie gilchrist as evelyn's unsympathetic landlady, jim backus as a shifty club owner, and art smith as korvin's fence.a real sleeper in the noir category, don't miss it if broadcast.

(some spoilers) sweeping into new york city on a first-class railroad car a killer who doesn't kill with a gun or knife or club but just with his,or it's, touch and breath. a killer that's as old, or even older, then man himself. that killer has a name it's know the world over as smallpox.arriving in new york one cold november afternoon the killer hidden inside of sheila bennet, evelyn keyes, and like a trojen horse it waits until the opportunity presents itself. then like a ticking time bomb with it's fuse set off explodes throughout the length and breath of the city.sheila knows that she's being followed by a u.s customs officer who's been on her tail since she came back to the us from the island nation of cuba. having smuggled $50,000.00 of illegal uncut diamonds she had to be careful in getting them to her husband matt, charles korvin, to be cut and sold to unsuspecting jewelers in the city. mailing the diamonds ahead of time sheila knows that if caught the diamonds won't be found on her. what she doesn't know is that matt is two timing her by having an affair with her kid sister francie, lola albrght. even worse he plans to check out of town with the diamonds leaving her as well as francie holding the bag.even though we know right from the start of sheila's deathly condition it doesn't really come to the surface until much later in the movie.the first half of "the killer that stalked new york" is a crime suspense/drama with the u.s customs officials and nyc police looking for the stolen diamonds. as sheila starts to get sick and begins to infect everyone whom she comes in contact with the film reaches the point of a mass panic in the streets type horror movie. both the police and custom officials together with members of the city's health depertment race against the clock to find sheila before she infects the entire city of new york with the deadly smallpox infection that she's carrying. sheila finding out from matt's boss willie dennis,jim backus,that he quit his job as a nightclub piano player and that he was having an affair with francie shocks her into the realization to what a heel he is.confronting francie at her apartment it turns out that matt not only stiffed shelia but her sister as well. which later leads the guilt-ridden francie to take her own life. on the run and not knowing that she's infected with smallpox sheila goes to her brother sid (with bissell),who manages a flop-house on the bowery, to find a place to stay. only too late does sheila, and sid, find out the the stolen diamonds is the last of her problems. knowing that she's dying sheila goes to the office of jeweler arnold moss, art smith, knowing that sleaze-ball of a husband matt, who ended up beating old man moss into a bloody pulp, is going to be there to exact vengeance on him.doucmentry-type drama, based on a true story, with striking black and white on-location photography makes this movie about the horrors of unseen and deadly smallpox unleashed on a unsuspecting public well worth watching.

this is a really dark movie. noir indeed. the title character is smallpox, brought into new york city unknowingly by evelyn keyes.she is on one mission when she arrives and on a rougher one after she's spoken to her no longer innocent sister. but she herself is not intentionally a killer. this doesn't mean she doesn't kill. it doesn't mean her presence somewhere among eight million other people doesn't throw the city into turmoil.keyes is excellent. the supporting cast is very good too. there are several little-known people involved in this -- the director included. don't be put off. it is a movie to be reckoned with! (and how nice to see a columbia picture. columbia and republic turned out wonderful comedies and noirs; yet we hardly ever see them anymore.)

from 1950 comes a neat thriller about a couple smuggling diamonds from abroad and also the contagious disease smallpox. evelyn keyes pulls out all stops as the essential victim of this film-noir. once back in the united states she is not aware that she could be spreading the disease on everyone and everything she comes in contact with. eventually she is pursued and must be stopped before an epidemic occurs. other than keyes striking performance there is good support from villainous charles korvin, william bishop, dorothy malone, lola albright and whit bissell. the finale is a humdinger with miss keyes on the ledge of a building with spotlights and hundreds of spectators below. a good b flick!

there must have been a sale on this storyline back in the 40's. an epidemic threatens new york (it's always new york) and nobody takes it seriously. some might say that richard widmark and jack palance did it better in panic in the streets, but i disagree.there is always something about these poverty row productions that really touch a nerve. the production values are never that polished and the acting is a little rough around the edges, but that is the very reason i think this movie and those like it are effective. rough, grainy, edgy. and the cast. all 2nd stringers or a list actors past their prime. no egos here. these folks were happy to get the work. whit bissell, carl benton reid, jim backus, arthur space, charles korvin, and the melodious voice of reed hadley flowing in the background like crude oil. by the way, i've been in the hospital a couple of times; how come my nurses never looked like dorothy malone? in these kind of movies they don't bother much with make-up and hair, but they really managed to turn evelyn keyes into a hag. or maybe they just skipped the make-up and hair altogether. anyway, it was pretty effective. she plays a lovesick jewel smuggler who picks up a case of small pox in cuba while smuggling jewels back for ultra-villain charles korvin (who is boffing her sister in the meantime). you got the customs agents looking for her because of the jewels, and the health department looking for her because she's about to de-populate new york. no 4th amendment rights here. everybody gets hassled.you gotta have the right attitude to enjoy a movie like this. i have a brother who scrutinizes movies to death. if they don't hold up to his orson wellian standards, he bombs them unmercifully. they must have the directorial excellence of a david lean movie, the score of wolfgang von korngold, the sound and art of douglas shearer and cedric gibbons respectively. this ain't it.but i have the right attitude, and if you do as well, you'll love this movie.

this is an excellent b-film horror movie that borders between horror and comedy. it is about a genetically mutilated scorpion in outer space. can it get more unreal? it is a hybrid between "alien" and "chain saw massacre." the movie was shot in stockholm with a mixed cast of americans and swedes that interact beautifully. director martin munthe does a great job finding the comical highlights in this script and gets a few good laughs out of the audience. the movie was shot with little or no money and it is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources. stinger has all qualities of a b-film horror movie. it is comical and scary at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause. it is great to see that movies like this can still be made! i would recommend seeing it if you like this type of films.

i think this movie was made as good as it could have been. with only 4 months and a 52000$ budget - i'm surprised this wasn't worse. if you are not to care about the cg or special effects, this movie is great.okay, the movie is not that well made (i'm sure it could have been but, you try to do better in only 4 months) but the story is good and the movie is rather exciting.don't trust me when i say that this movie is good, cause i also find the 1933 king kong to be good.i must confess that i didn't watch the complete movie either... i might have fast forwarded some minutes here and there...

i found this little gem as an extra feature on my dvd of vampyr-der traum des allen grey, and didn't expect all that much from it. it looked like it might be an interesting little short though, so i turned it on.i am so glad that i did. it was really incredible! despite having been made more than 70 years ago, the animation was, in my view, better than some of that done today with all the computer effects and experience available now.the story is quite simple-a newly put together toy dog hears its owner's laments about not being able to afford an orange and goes on a quest to find her one. in the process, it runs into a toy's underworld with all sort of nefarious creatures and toys overseen by none other than the devil himself, who all want the dog's orange for themselves as well.this film precedes, but reminds me a lot of mad monster party? (1969, jules bass)-a movie which i have always really enjoyed-and to a lesser extent, some of tim burton's animated works-the nightmare before christmas (1993, henry selick) and corpse bride (2005, tim burton). fans of any of these movies will, i am sure, also love the mascot.overall, an incredible piece of short animation which is well worth watching.

the mascot is ladislaw starewicz's masterpiece. it tells the tale of a stuffed toy dog who searches for an orange after he overhears the mother tell her daughter she hasn't any money. the dog gets picked with other toys to be sold off. in the truck, after the others jump off while the vehicle runs, the dog stays and waits to be picked up from store before setting off on his own. he manages to get orange after biting woman's leg as she was holding and selling the fruit. as he runs, he encounters the devil and accepts his offer to stop at nightclub. there, he meets the other toys who jumped off truck. the cat who was next to him in vehicle is especially determined to get dog's orange. i'll just stop here to mention that other wonderfully bizarre things happen in nightclub that you'll have to see for yourself. suffice it to say, if you love starewicz and is interested in all animation from the past, i most definitely recommend you seek this one out!

i agree with most of mr. rivera's comments, and i just want to ad a couple of caveats. this film, "the mascot" is criminally neglected in its current form. for that matter, so is "vampyr". "the mascot" isn't a "bonus feature"-- it's tacked on as a chapter in "vampyr". even though it's made very clear that this is a separate movie, it should have been treated as such by the manufacturers. and while i"m at it, "vampyr" needs some of that same respect and cleaning up as well. i got the feeling the decision to put the mascot on there went something like this.dude a: "we just transferred vampyr to dvd, but it comes up about 20 minutes short. we need to put something on there that won't cost much money. can you believe film critics want to be paid to talk about films!" dude b: "not to worry. i have this little animation thingy that's been sitting in my drawer. just go ahead and throw it on as an additional chapter." dude a: "you're awesome, dude b." the animation's of the mascot is great, and there's no need for me to repeat what mr. rivera's done so well. however, this thing needs some major cleaning and restoring, especially the audio. the plot comes through in the dialogue. and in my copy there were so many hisses, pops and places where the sound just dropped right off (i would have had no idea what the dog was going after without having read the box). no amount of volume was going to make the words more understandable, it just brought up the tinniness and made the hisses and pops louder.bottom line is: starewicz's films need to be put into a respectful collection, cleaned up, spiffed up, liner notes and the whole nine yards. in other words, they need to be "criterionized" 9 out of 10 for the movie, not the product which would get only a 5.

i still can't belive that starevich made this film back in 1934. animation is simply perfect, and what is amazing about it, with all the advanced technology we have nowadays there are few animation studios that are capable of producing a little gem like this one. it has everything: a great story, beautiful chracters (although this is a morbid kind of beauty in some cases), special effects... well, it is definitely not a kid's movie,but it's a must-see for anyone seriously interested in animation.

one of starewicz's longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange. the dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold, but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters. with the help of a stuffed cat, the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death. the mascot features new techniques i have not yet seen in starewicz's films. the addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop-motion animation makes for a new twist on starewicz's old style of puppetry. live scenes of moving cars and people's feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh. the honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and starewicz's utilization of the new technology seems like old hat. new puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil's club scene. twigss and newspaper shreds come to life. skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks. characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses. a new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene. overall, starewicz is able to update his style of film-making to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work.

words alone cannot describe the sheer beauty and power of this film.think "toy story". now, think "toy story", circa 1934. now, imagine the animation looks as lifelike, as fluid. think of the movie not as something adults and children can enjoy, but imagine it as a filme-noire.imagine trying to do something like that back in 1934. somehow, "the mascot" delivers. in a story where toys come to life, and one of them is trying to deliver an orange to his sick owner, starewicz delivers a level of animation completely unexpected. it's so fluid, you will wonder for a long time whether what you see is really stop-motion animation. comparing "toy story" and "the mascot" is an excercise in futility, plot-wise: while "toy story" is a children's story adults can enjoy, "the mascot" is a dark, chilling story aimed at adults. meaning, no, your kids won't like it. one bit.still, get it if you can. you might be able to find it along "vampyr" in dvd and laserdisc. and prepare to be stunned at what starewicz was able to do back in 1934 with a couple of puppets.

a brilliant animated piece that was far ahead of its time, and certainly far ahead of anything that was being released in mass production at the same point in history. the influence of this work upon tim burton's "nightmare before christmas" is readily apparent. one can only imagine how starewicz slaved over every beautifully detailed frame of this masterpiece.there have been very few animated films of this caliber. it's a shame that more people haven't seen this gem.apparently, imdb now requires comments to be at least ten lines long, so this is the tenth line. this must be something new - but i really don't have anything else to say!

straight from the brilliant mind of animation pioneer wladyslaw starewicz, "fétiche", or "the mascot" as it is known nowadays, stands as a masterpiece of stop-motion animation that sadly, has been almost forgotten by now. nevertheless, the work of this man deserves to be seen, and in fact, must be seen to be believed because the outstanding way the animation flows is simply unbelievable.decades before "toy story", starewicz conceived the idea of moving toys, in "fétiche", he tells the story of a small stuffed dog that gets makes friends with the sick daughter of his maker. one day, his maker takes him away to sell him, and the adventure begins as he tries to find his way back home. in his odyssey, he'll travel from paris to hell, and will find the other toys that were supposed to be sold with him.it is a surreal experience to watch this movie, as starewicz makes every imaginable creature come alive with grace and beauty. the other toys include a beautiful ballerina, who loves a thief, but she also is secretly loved by a clown, forming a love triangle; an old woman, a stuffed cat and a stuffed ape complete the group. every toy is so detailed and very expressive that without words one can understand their motives.truly, the surreal atmosphere the whole animation has it is remarkable. it is hard to believe that a work of this magnitude was done in 1934 since it looks even better than most of the current day animation. the influence it has in modern day animator such as tim burton and henry selick is very significant.this short is a masterpiece of animation and the outstanding work of one genius who done everything by himself and that has influenced animators for decades. starewicz's work is an immortal piece of art that should be seen by everyone. this work is not only for kids, adults as well will enjoy it and probably catch most of the subtext hidden in the movie.it is possible to find it in the "vampyr" dvd as a bonus feature. anyone with the slightest interest in animation should give it a look.

there is a complete copy now available at the internet archive - watch it or download it today!http://www.archive.org/details/the_mascot_completeone of the greatest animated shorts ever made. starewicz is endlessly inventive and his techniques still astound animation fans 70 years later. we may have computer-generated techniques now, but all he had in 1934 was an imagination that wouldn't take "no" for an answer. whatever he wanted to see on the screen, he created. and he wanted to see some truly bizarre stuff - every imaginable piece of scrap is called up for service: old shoes, chicken bones, utensils, broken glasses, dolls, monkeys, rats....seems like there was nothing that was off limits.a truly eerie, even unsettling film that should be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in animation. this film must be seen to be believed!

cannibalism, a pair of cinematic references to delicatessen, not only in plot, but in style. cannibalism, a pair of references to the historic case of the uruguayan rugby players that survived in the andes by eating the dead members of their flight to chile. cannibalism, only an excuse the movie uses to delve into the extremes men are willing to go to defeat isolation and obtain social acceptance.the script is extremely creative, and hopefully is going to leave the viewer laughing and wondering...

this movie is the funniest danish movie i've ever seen!the plot is funny, surprising and exceptionel. danish humor is unlike any other, and it gets you every time. the entire audience laughed 90 % of the time....it was incredible. the characters are so well played, and the two actors, mads mikkelsen and nikolaj lie kaas play their best ever!i would highly recomend seing this movie, you won't regret it, believe me :-)

this is a novelty in danish film. the mood is not unlike that of blinkende lygter, also by anders thomas jensen, but with a novel touch. one difference is fewer characters, leaving much more room for them to be dwelled into. and what characters?! the two butchers are perfect. mads mikkelsen is a dominating, deranged parody and nikolaj lie kaas an indifferent looser with a twin brother more or less an unholy pairing of the two.

it is a wonderful film about people. strange people. the characters in the movie all have a very tragic past, so they all have their problems. their problems evolve in a way that makes the plot of the movie very absurd; but that does not make the movie worse, only better, for it is shot in a kind of fantasy-like way, so nothing is real. this review might sound a little weird, but then again, the movie is not quite normal... it is also a hilarious movie at many times. if you have not seen it, see it. enjoy!

this without doubt one of the funniest and most entertaining movies i have ever seen. i really enjoyed the characters in the movie. they are all wonderful bizarre in them selves. it's quite something i have never seen before in any movie.the story is almost non-stop from beginning to the end. there are no boring moments. i was totally captured by the movie. and i thought the acting was great.so if you want to see a fun movie. you should look for the green butchers. a great movie.i give it 10/10

this is actually a brilliant movie. the story is grotesque, but the actors are brilliant. especially the performance of mads mikkelsen as svend, is magnificent. it's a simple story about two guys with an urge to make it on their own, but it unfolds to a strange and absurd story, with a lot of people accidentally getting killed and served up as chicken steaks. if only more people understood danish... this could be a great candidate for an english version. it is also worth mentioning ole thestrup, who always delivers that extra twist to the plot, with his slightly mad character holger. i can only recommend this movie to the danish audience. also take a look at adams æbler (2005), a movie by anders thomas jensen, also with mads mikkelsen accompanied by a well playing ulrich thomsen.

this movie is a mix of a dark comedy and a drama, about two guys who worked in a butcher's shop and wanted to build up their own. when they finally fulfilled that dream, they faced a new problem: there were no clients! one day, by accident, one guy dies in the refrigerator room, and a new kind of butcher's business begins they start selling human flesh, saying to the clients it's just chicken and their business starts to improve: human flesh sells good! oh! i forgot to say something these guys aren't normal! there's really something missing in their brains! the movie has some nice dark humour scenes, but it is, in my opinion, mostly a drama. one that shows us what is inside the head of a psychopath, what are his motivations to what he does. i must confess i was a bit surprised with the ending of the movie, because i never expected they could make it without been discovered, but that's probably because i see too many hollywood movies what i mean by this is that in hollywood's cinema we always expect the punishment of the guys which do the "bad things". there's always a morality protecting the "good values", in spite of we all know that in "real life" it doesn't happen this way too many times and i liked this movie mostly because of that, because it fits in a kind of cinema which is true, frontal, without fake moralities, and which "see" what is on the other side, behind the "conventional morality" it just happens in independent cinema (especially in the european)! besides, there're excellent performances by nikolaj lie kass and mads mikkelsen (especially the first one) in the roles of the "disturbed guys" very nice danish film!

this is, by far, the best movie i've seen in a long while. it is a wholly original and beautiful plot. it is not boring, nor is it too dramatic. the characters are tangible and realistic, but it does not take away from the story line. the fact that is not in english is most likely the final touch. the end leaves you fulfilled in a way i've never experienced in a movie before. i wish i had found this movie earlier.more lines.more lines.more lines a lot more lines c'mon, i'm done

many americans are lazy, and this has manifested itself even in our dvd-watching. many of us don't like to take the time to read an hour-and-a-half (or more) of subtitles, so we choose not to see many foreign films. one film that is totally worth your time, no matter how mundane a task you might think the subtitle-reading is, however, is "the green butchers." it's by far the best foreign film i've ever seen, and tops many american films i've seen lately as well. it's a complex situation told in a remarkably simple and funny dialogue. the character depth derived in this film is amazing. the way svend and eigel (sorry if those are spelled wrong) feed off each other's contrasting personas is downright spectacular! the actors were well-cast, and i'm very much hoping that a sequel is in consideration...it needs very little of bjorne and what's-her-face...just give me svend and eigel on some sort of journey with supporting characters and more amazing dialogue! to the author of this fine screenplay, i say: write more! the story itself is rather twisted, but you'll find yourself rooting for the bad guy anyhow...with no remorse. please check this movie out!

de grønne slagtere or the green butchers as it is called in english is a very dark comedy about two losers who work for a popular butcher. they are fed up with their bosses criticism and decide to start a business on their own. their shop is expensive and it doesn't even have electricity all over the place. and to make things worse, they haven't got any customers (as their former boss predicted). when the man pays them a visit in their shop, he challenges them to provide the meat for a dinner party he organizes.than a tragic accident happens. one of the butchers locks the electrician into the freezing chamber when he closes the shop. the man dies and the neurotic one of the two butchers decides to cut fillets out of the electrician's thigh and serves it to the dinner party instead of calling the police. it's an incredible success. all at once every person in the village wants to taste that incredible "chicken". overwhelmed by his sudden success the butcher sees no other option but to kill more people, who he can sell as chicken.i guess that the subject cannibalism may not be enjoyed by everyone, especially not because it is shown with a lot of humor. personally i liked it a lot. it shows perfectly how far some people would go for some social acceptance and to get out of their isolation. it may sound a bit far-fetched, but i'm sure you would be surprised to see how people in real life sometimes act.next to the original subject, i was also pleased by the actors' performances and the humor. there is no overacting, as you might expect in this kind of movies, it's all very sober and realistic (i guess that's typical for the scandinavians and scandinavian movies). the same for the humor. i'm sure i wouldn't have liked it as much as i did now if the humor had been over the top, or with a lot of farting, vomiting,... like you see so often in american movies. i loved this movie and i give it an 8/10.

the game was made in 1996, but it is still good today. the graphics is not that hot and the actors are not oscar-worthy but the plot is twisted, diabolic and highly enjoyable. the dark story is compelling from the first film and is continuing throughout all the play. we played several people together for several reasons: 1) to use all our minds together. 2) not to be so afraid.play this game and you won't regret this, just don't try to find a quake engine in there.

i play this game exactly after i watch the trailer in old magazine advertise cd...the is very interesting and dark atmospheric (missing in nowadays games/movies). the game is set somewhere in the middle of the '90 in the spooky mysterious mansion. you play as adam randell and your quest is to free the soul of your death trapped father.the look of the game is doom-like, but very different type of game. a lot of a action, various puzzles, quests, mazes and many more interesting locations and characters are presented in this old classic game.the game will run only on windows 98 and there is no patch for windows xp.

found a copy in a bargain bin sale of this old time classic. i played it with dosbox on a vista machine without any issues. it's graphically dated heavily, but what do you expect for a 12 year old game! the game is a fps/adventure game hybrid. it's what i call pseudo 3d, you can't look up or down, just spin in 360 (think wolf3d). game play can get tricky with a very limited supply of health pots, and a somewhat average interface (tip: press i), but on the whole it's passable.one main strength of the game is the mood. there game heavily uses full motion video, and whilst the acting is b-grade and the plot is very choppy, the game as a whole feels genuinely creepy. it also does a good job of making you question the 'good guys'. are they really helping, or are they just waiting to stab you in the back? the other major selling point is the games length. there are from memory 18 chapters, which range in game play time from 10minutes to, potentially, hours. my first play through took me a week with some serious devotion of time.dated, yes, but if you missed this years ago and can find it for $5, give it a look. cheaper than a movie, and more entertaining than most movies.

this game is an action/adventure with combat. there are quite long periods with no combat but other times, you have to get rid of various kinds of monsters. the monsters are not like anything you would see in real life, and they have to be gotten rid off in order to continue with your quest. the whole game is a quest. you play adam randall whose father contacts him from the beyond and asks him to come and save him. the game is from the mid 1990's and has to be played in dos. i used dosbox and was able to play the game quite well. the graphics are not as good as some games even of the time, mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes look quite blocky, but others look batter, but don't let that put you off the game. the game is very imaginative, its long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters appear out of nowhere. not for young kids who likely wouldn't be interested anyway, but over 13 or 14 might like this game. its a horror\mystery\action\adventure\combat combination.i thought it was a great game. its had to find now. maybe ebay. but remember its a dos game and you would not be able to play it on todays faster computers. would be hard to play on fast computers unless you use dosbox. oh, and the acting is very good too.

this game is one of the best horror/shooter games i've ever played. the plot is a little choppy, but the game never fails to send you plenty of chills and excitement. many people shelved the game when they found that there are no cheat codes for it and very little health potions and ammo to be found. but actually, after you've gone through the game once, you are more familiar with the monsters and different rooms, so you can easily get by the second time around. the puzzles are great, not too hard, not too easy. there are tons of different monsters so you never get bored. and there are plenty of gaming areas. you really feel like you're in a good stephen king novel as you play. it's nice and creepy. pick this game up cheap and have some fun.

never mind if 'national velvet (1944)' is a bit hackneyed and occasionally unconvincing, clarence brown's equestrian fable is an endearing and very likable story with a good moral. after achieving modest success through her appearance in 'lassie come home (1943),' young elizabeth taylor, age 12, landed her first leading role as velvet brown, a passionate schoolgirl with an obsession for horses. though filmed in california, the story - adapted from a novel by enid bagnold - is set in a small township on the english countryside, and full advantage is taken of the technicolor photography to present the vibrant and handsome landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs. mickey rooney takes top billing as mi taylor, a misguided ex-jockey with devious intentions, whose relationship with young velvet reawakens his sense of dignity and opens a new, optimistic chapter in his life. though he noticeably struggles in one sequence, when he must confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses, rooney is enjoyable as the surly but passionate young man who must prove his worth.it is perhaps a good thing that elizabeth taylor had those entrancing violet eyes, because her acting abilities, at this young age, were rather limited. her more emotional sequences, in which she displays courage and integrity in the face of adversity, strike one as being rather hollow, and the touchingly-naive notion that simply "believing" will accomplish everything is one that has since been repeated ad nauseam by practically every unmemorable inspirational sporting film ever made. nevertheless, taylor is bright-eyed and enthusiastic, and she works well with mickey rooney, who was no stranger to being a child-star. anne revere plays a very important role as velvet's mother, once a famous athlete, who not only swam the english channel but was lovingly-trained by none other than mi taylor's own father. i liked that mi was not told about this until the film's final seconds, with mrs. brown correctly deciding that the young man would first need to develop his own sense of decency, rather than exploiting the memory of his late father for financial gain, as he would undoubtedly have done at the film's beginning.the film reaches its climax at the grand national sweepstakes, where velvet has, at the last moment, decided to ride her own horse, the pi, in the world-famous competition. under the guise of a latvian male, she goes on, as expected, to win the race, but is later disqualified - either because she's a girl, or because she tumbled from the horse before she was allowed to dismount (what a stupid rule!). this extended race sequence is exceedingly well-done, effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerve-racking pre-race seconds, and the confusion of the event that places us in the same position as rooney's character, stranded behind tall spectators and waiting anxiously for somebody to provide an accurate update. it doesn't really matter that we know it's a stunt double doing most of the difficult riding - in several scenes, we can clearly see a creepy-looking man in a wig - but the positive message remains the same. i'll wager that 'national velvet' has nurtured the imaginations of millions of young girls over the last sixty years, and it's power to inspire has decreased little with time.

a teen-aged girl gets the horse of her dreams and is trained by an ex-jockey to participate in london's grand national steeplechase. a fine adaptation of the classic children's book, with an excellent, start-making performance by taylor as the energetic but polite youngster. rooney is ok as her trainer, although he has some overly melodramatic moments. crisp and revere are quite good as taylor's loving parents. filmed in technicolor, it looks beautiful. the problems are that there are corny elements, nothing very interesting happens, and it drags on a bit too long. the race is exciting but could have been much more so.

i just wanted to say that i am watching national velvet on tv, it is now feb 2006 and i was checking on dates details, etc. surprising to see it was made in 1944 and rooney was 24 years old whilst liz taylor only 12, what an accomplished english actress she is.to put some americans contributors right: there are no irish villages in england. ireland is a completely different country and has nothing whatsoever to do with the english countryside. the scenes shown are supposedly taken on the south coast of england between brighton and arundel (county of sussex). no such scene exists now unfortunately. like many other places roads and buildings have been built on the hills and beaches.so please, all you lovely americans, do not confuse ireland with england, ever! we take great exception to it. like confusing texas with coney island.

wow! what a lovely, warm, rural film! the story focuses upon mi taylor (mickey rooney), a young male wanderer, whose journey takes him to a quiet, rural coastal town. there he stays with the brown family. velvet (liz taylor) their youngest daughter, who mi subtly befriends, has a passion for horses and wins one at an auction. this horse is a beautiful, maroon stallion; referred by its previous owner as a 'murderous pirate', but velvet re-names him pie. not long later, velvet suggests to enter him in the grand national race, mi and her family are against the idea, but soon agree and velvet and mi began to train him for britain's most famous horse race  this film is a beautiful example of what british films are like. i remember i first saw this when i was eight and on my summer holidays. my parents taped it off the tv and i warmed to it instantly  watching it most days instead of the large collection of disney films that i owned.i believe it was one of liz taylor's first movies and a good one! her character is naïve but sweet  her acting is extremely convincing, especially when she portrays her love for horses. it's also a good chance to see angela lansbury in one of her early roles; who co-stars as velvet's older sister, who spends most of her time in the film being smitten with a boy in the town! i must say she was a gorgeous lady when she was younger. beautiful blonde hair and a rosy cheeked face. although she doesn't have a major part in the movie, she dose have a number of scenes - so not to disappoint her fans! parents reading this, i must emphasis  if you can get hold of a copy of this please do! if you're children love animals  i strongly suggest you show it to them! they may find a few scenes boring but you see velvet riding the horse on many occasions throughout the film and would most defiantly entertain children! a lovely and nostalgic film. i might just go away now and put it on!

yes, let's get this out of the way before we begin: *this is the one that sean connery returned to in 1983 after the stint we had of roger moore. *it's connery's last film. *and yes it's a (kind of) remake of thunderball, but more of a film inspired by it. if all you bond purists out there think i'm gonna get controversial, you're right. bond is one of the greatest movie series ever, but that doesn't mean that a series should go on forever. this, i think, is one of two films where they could've done themselves a huge favour and ended the bond saga. not offended yet? then i'll continue... hey, if you're thinking i'm indifferent about bond flicks, you're wrong. i grew up with my mum being obsessed with them. any spare moment, bond and his antics would be on the tv. bond rules, and 'never say never again' (directed by irvin 'empire strikes back' kershner) is one of the best. it may not be 'goldfinger' or 'from russia...' and may not have been done by the same production house as all the others (which i hear is why they refuse to accept it was ever made!?), but still stands head and shoulders above the recent brosnan outings... (if you haven't spat at the screen, read on). characterization!!!!! something so many blockbuster films forget about these days, but something which is essential to telling a good story. 'never' played a superb hand by treating 007 like he had been ageing since 'dr. no'. he's 'getting on a bit' and so has to do things like go to a health farm - a direct order from 'm' (!). yeah, if you haven't seen this film, i won't give too much away with the plot because a) loads happens and b) obviously, i want you to see it for yourselves. don't be put off by my 'old bond' revelation, connery still get plenty of superb set pieces to charge, swim, punch, speed, smash, and snog his way through. the man is a legend, and this film is one of his most enjoyable outings as bond. high tech gadgets galore, some great villains, and an excellent supporting cast (including a fantastic cameo by rowan atkinson) lift this movie high above audience expectation.this could've been the last bond film ever, and it would've been a party to remember. playing the secret agent as someone nearing retirement was refreshing stroke of genius - the last scene wraps things up perfectly for the series.... ...but still we had more, and then more, and more still, and one more moore. still, if you fancy finding out what "fatima blush" is all about, get this film. then you can at least pretend 007 spent his last moments as a wisecracking secret agent, in the arms of kim basinger, and smirking at mr. bean. (p.s. * that other film that i think could've finished it all off? the gritty 'license to kill'

many have disparaged never say never again because it is not an official bond movie. nevertheless, it is manifest that the producers adhered to the fruitful bond formula. although the film does not have a pre-credit sequence, it is clear that the training exercise at the commencement of the film is meant to be the introductory scene. it would have been impossible for eon to stop the producers from including a pre-credit and title sequence, albeit without the gun-barrel introduction.sean connery is on fine form as the immortal secret agent and this film is certainly better than dr no, thunderball, you only live twice and diamonds are forever. although, nsna is meant to be a remake of thunderball, it is a vast improvement. 007 spends more time on terra firma and a more diverse range of exotic locations are included in the film. there is some resplendent acting in this movie. barbara carrera is impeccable as the bizarre fatima blush. one of the best scenes in the film is the coup de grace between bond and fatima in nice, which is preceded by a dynamic motorcycle chase through the city. klaus maria brandauer plays the psychotic largo and max von sydow is free of the melodrama that other actors portraying blofeld have indulged in.nsna tends to centre on connery rather than the character of bond. at the commencement it is stated that bond is ageing and has been out of action. this seems to refer to the 12 year hiatus in connery's portrayal of bond. bond promises "never again" to work in the secret service; an allusion to connery's portrayal of bond. it appears that the producers were trying to hurt the official bond franchise. nevertheless, this film is definitely worth watching. this is the last time that sean connery played james bond, but his performance convinced me that perhaps he should have never have said "never again".

i'm sick and tired of people complaining that never say never again is just a weak remake of thunderball. yes, that movie's influence is unmistakable, but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of re-made films is reserved for such thoughtless and unintelligent films like the 1998 re-make of psycho. while it's true that the opening theme of the twelfth (and connery's last) bond film is one of the worst of the entire series, the film itself still manages to stand on its own, despite many other weaknesses. besides that, even the weak title song is made to blend pretty nicely with the closing dialogue in the film.sure, sean connery was getting a little on in age when this movie was filmed (at least by james bond standards), but there is plenty of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this was not exactly unknown to the filmmakers. james bond is near retirement before he is handed his assignment, having spent most of recent time teaching, not doing, and there is even the tongue in cheek insistence from m that he pay more attention to his health, dieting and training and getting more exercise and whatnot. besides, this is james bond, remember? this guy is supposed to be some kind of super human, and all of his fans are getting all upset because he's got some gray hairs. when this guy retires at the end of the film, m sends poor `small-fawcett' (in a hilarious cameo from rowan atkinson) to tell bond that without him, he worries about the safety of the free world, and all of you people can't get over the fact that he's not a sprightly young man anymore. come on, sean connery could still play james bond just as good as he ever could, or at least better than anyone else ever has been able to.the majority of the film deals with the elaborate plan to steal nuclear missiles and hold the world hostage (as dr. evil would say, `oh hell, let's just do what we always do'), so there's clearly not much new there, but this is one of the bond films that had the better one liners. there's the amusing scene where bond is asked for a urine sample  `if you could just fill this beaker for me' `from here?' there are a lot of good one-liners, but the sexual innuendos aimed at mr. bond are especially prevalent in this installment. but then later he happens to throw that very urine sample into a villain's face, making him scream as if his face were burning off. not a very good attempt at comic relief, especially since this guy had been kicking bond's ass with some sort of super-spring device that could cut through pretty much anything. and of course, kim basinger stars in this film as one of the best bond girls of the entire series.it's no secret that never say never again has dated badly, and one of the things that has dated the worst is the special effects  with the one exception of the flying missiles, which were obviously fake but still impressive for 1982. the colored contact lens at the beginning of the film was totally without effect, and the laser watch was one of the worst things in the entire movie, second only to those damn sharks. evidently, fatima blush put some sort of device on his scuba tank that attracted sharks (granted, they did have weird guiding mechanisms of their own), in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line, `i have one simple request. and that is to have sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads!' and then, of course, there is the exploding hotel room scene which was redone in an episode of the simpsons, and which was obviously followed by another obligatory and overly casual one-liner from james.the domination video game created by largo, the film's villain, is an especially memorable scene, and the film also boasts what is probably the best motorcycle chase in the entire series (far to superior to the laughable one in tomorrow never dies). but despite many strengths, the film's weaknesses are left clearer in the audience's mind at the end of the film due in large part to the anticlimactic underwater conclusion (one of the more obvious parts borrowed from thunderball, and inferiorly recreated). never mind the fact that largo revealed some crucial information to bond as he left him in the tower alive (dr. evil's brilliance, once again, `i'll just leave him there without actually witnessing his death and just assume everything went to plan. what?'), the climax of what is expected to be a fast-paced action film should never take place in a muted underwater atmosphere. all in all, never say never again ranks very highly on the james bond scale, and connery's wink at the end of the film (as well as the two closing lines) suggested at the time that he may still return for another turn as bond. clearly, this is no longer very likely, so we can only hope.

i've heard a lot about porno holocaust and its twin film erotic nights of the living dead. both films are interchangeable and were filmed at the same time on the same location with the same actors changing clothes for each film (and taking them off). if you are expecting the d'amato genius displayed in films like buio omega or death smiles on murder, you won't find it here. nonetheless this film has a charm that exploitation fans will not be able to resist. where else will you see hardcore sex mixed with a zombie/monster and his enormous penis that strangles and chokes women to death? only from d'amato. there is some amount of gore in which many of the men are bludgeoned to death. the film is set on a beautiful tropical island. as far as i know there is no subtitled version, so if you don't speak italian you wont know what is going on...but who cares right? in all honesty, gore fans will probably fast forward through the hardcore sex. and if anyone is actually watching this for the sex only, will for sure be offended instantly. i can just imagine modern day porn fans tracing back through d'amato's output and coming across this atrocity! out of the two i find erotic nights of the living dead far superior. but, don't bother watching either if they are cut. porno holocaust is extremely low budget as expected. even the monster looks no where as good as george eastman's character in anthropophagus. the film is worth watching for laughs and to complete your d'amato film quest.

purportedly made back to back with 'erotic nights of the living dead' with the same cast and setting but for certain this one does not have laura gemser. much derided by all i rather like this movie. sure enough the storyline and dialogue are codswallop, but this is so beautifully filmed in such a marvellous setting and i actually like the hardcore. i find it at once naturalistic and exotic, and that doesn't just mean there is a black girl and some limp penises! i find the numerous and varied sex scenes very believable, even if two are set upon a tree trunk at the edge of the ocean with the waves constantly splashing around. the creature does not deign to appear until half hour before the end and is, it has to be said, a disappointment. still, in the time remaining he manages to kill off all but two of the expedition and in the case of the girls having sex with them first (or afterwards in at least one case!) and this film is not as slow as some maintain. moreover there are some fine moments of sexploitation, not least the lady scientist and her urge for two 'natives', and the glorious finale when the two survivors speed off in their boat, gaze back at the island they have escaped from, and find there is still time for one last act of copulation.

before i continue forth with the new millennium, i will go back in time once more because i had completely forgotten about these gems!!!!!in 1987, disney, while still a "low" company in the 80s, was able to start a series of films on television called "not quite human," about a geeky teenager who, like in "inspector gadget," looks like a human but is really a robot!!!!! now this screams 80s, along with other films like "tron" and "honey, i shrunk the kids" because it combines everything of yesteryear with the technologies of tomorrow!!!!!my parents remember seeing this on the tv back then, back when i was just born or something. however, my very first encounter with this film was on the old disney channel (one time, i've seen this, and the other parts, on my 12th b'day in may of '99!!!!!)"not quite human" is a very good series of films to watch, if you can ever find these movies again. has this been shown recently? if so, give me an e-mail or personal message.10/10
