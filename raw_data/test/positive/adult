this is one of the finest tv movies you could ever see. the acting, writing and production values are top-notch. the performances are passionate with beverly d'angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and rob estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. however, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. it showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. it is thought provoking and entertaining. congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie.

it's 3:30am.i just saw this movie about six minutes ago and it is fantastic.a teenage girl has a night of passion with her mom's lover and it ruins everybody's lives. the really interesting thing about this movie is that you can't really place the blame on any one person.everyone performed perfectly, and the story was thought-provoking.you should definitely see this movie if you can get your hands on it.i give it a 10.

i didn't have much faith at the beginning, but as a costa rica's citizen i can confirm that the movie shows the reality that we live day by day, and shows a lot of things of our culture, such as our way to speak, our music, our way of standing up for our rights without any fear, without any weapons.i'm really proud of the job they did and of how they didn't forget along the movie the message they wanted us to receive, not caring for the money, but actually working with a short budget, letting us appreciate the beautiful scenarios and the great photography.i strongly recommend seeing this movie, you will not regret it.

"caribe" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. however, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, along with a magnificent cinematography. the narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of them embedding the other, each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. the story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). the acting is great, and for that we owe credit to the emerging director, esteban ramírez. furthermore, the characters are very well written and masterfully complex; so, once you become familiarized with them, you can perceive their feelings without them even saying anything. i can't say i liked this picture because of all the hype it generated(in costa rica), but rather because of the way it really achieves in showing an interesting portrait of what happens when you interfere with the equilibrium of people's lives. hopefully, caribe will establish a reference for future projects in costa rica, as it is a very good example of nice movie making.

mom has to be one of the all time uncomfortable movies to watch. it features an elderly lady you would love to have as your nanny who becomes the nastiest mother f***ing monster you would ever want to meet on a dark night!this supper nanny eats the inners of a young lady at the opening of the movie and it just gets sicker as it goes on. a cross between the howling and brain dead seem to come to mind when describing mom!a must for horror fans who have the stomach for it (if you have watched re-animator or brain dead, this will float your boat)and are willing to switch the brain off for an hour or so...let the gore pour!...8/10

four or five episodes of johnnie socko and his flying robot edited together. amusing giant robot battling giant monsters tale aimed squarely at kids. parents of course will go crazy since the action is violent with the robot/monster battles resembling professional wrestling and the human on human violence the sort of stuff you'd find in the al capone st. valentine's day school and gangster training academy. i liked it, but then again i grew up on the series. if there is any problems, other than the "men in suits" effects variety is that the movie plays like a series of episodes stitched together, with a climax coming every 20 minutes. recommended for those who've run out of ultraman or godzilla

ok, i admit it, i'm 40 and still shed a tear every time i watch johnny calling back his robot at the end."robot, now stop! don't do it, stop the attack...robot, what are you doing, robot... robot, where are you goingrobot, come back! robot...robot please! don't do it, you'll die... robot... robot, please comeback! i need you heregiant robot... robot! giant robot" -johnny sokko, the last of emperor guillotineof all the tokusatsu thats out there, giant robot has a special place in my heart and will always be there. i credit it with getting me into everything sci-fi and anime when i was a kid. live on gr!

if you love japanese monster movies, you'll love this action packed battle pitting an alien invader, intent upon conquering the earth, and a "giant robot" with an armory of super weaponry. the alien, "emporer guillotine," from the planet gargoyle, has a army of thugs called, (of course) "the gargoyle gang," as well as an endless supply of immense hostile creatures that are routinely loosed upon the earth to smash buildings, make loud noises, panic the populace, etc. a little kid, named johnny sokko, has the giant robot at his beckon call, and sends the robot, as needed, to beat up, and then blast these creatures. johnny joins a group of "good spies" called unicorn, and endeavors to help save the world.in spite of the campy nature, unintentionally humorous dialog, and the fact that the target audience was obviously children, this movie has non-stop action, colorful characters, decent special effects, and just happens to be downright fun to watch. battle scenes are well executed, and frequent, as the storyline requires. the good guys and bad guys both made sure they had an inexhaustible supply of bombs, lasers, ammunition, and schemes to attack each other. in spite of the fact the movie was constructed from edited episodes of a tv series, the plot actually develops, and reaches an ultimate conclusion.the film has a positive outlook and appeals to everyone's (especially kids') desire to destroy evil in its many forms. kids may be the target audience, but it's fun for everyone to laugh at its comical silliness; yet, at the same time, root for the good guys to prevail and "save the world." the acting is cheesy in places, but that is the charm: there are several lines of corny dialog (possibly translation errors or possibly intentional jokes by the movie makers), and you'll find yourself quoting these absurd lines later.admittedly, this film is not high in production quality or budget. however, for what it is, campy sci-fi, it's enjoyable for some laughs. i recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor for that sort of thing.

i remember running home from school almost every day to catch ktla's channel 5 monster movies, but never did i run home faster then when this movie was scheduled. somehow, the idea of being a boy and having a giant robot as a friend appealed to me in a very unique way. sure, i pretended to be spiderman, batman and other superheros, but i really wanted to be johnny sakko over any of them. i have not seen this movie in 30 years and i can still remember it vividly. who can forget the way giant robot shot missiles out of his fingers! or how about the way ghuillotene threw his fingernails to make explosions! geez, i can even still whistle the theme music that plays at the end, which is so tragic that i remember crying myself to sleep a number of times!only one other movie has the kind of magic that this movie does in my mind and that is the wizard of oz. but i have seen that movie many times since i was a kid. of course, the wizard of oz is a true classic whereas voyage into space is low budget nonsense. these two films shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence but to a young boy it isn't high production values or continuity that capture your heart, its flying monkeys and giant robots!p.s. my cousin use to do a very accurate impression of giant robot (he pronounced it "giant robutt.") if you recall, giant robot had a particular way of shooting his missiles and my cousin had it down cold. i made him repeat the routine endlessly for my personal amusement.

this is a cherished movie from my childhood!! i can still hum the theme song at the drop of a hat!! i remember getting to stay up late to watch this movie with my father, usually two to three times a year. we always referred to it as "giant robot". although the effects in this movie are crude compared to today's standards, they were perfect for this movie's genre. i am also a big fan of the japanese "monster" movies, so this movie fell right in to place with the others. it's been years since i've seen this movie & would love to get my hands on a copy of it to share with my 8 year old daughter.

what can i say? the little kid inside has always had great affections for the following...giant robots, giant monsters and a cackling, megalomaniacal lead villain and this movie delivers on all counts. as an adult, it's easy to point out the many flaws in this film and to say hey it's really only a bunch of episodes taken from a children's tv series strung together. despite all of this, i find the ending very moving and the content surprisingly adult in nature. tremendous fun if a little nonsensical at times.

william shakespeare's merchant of venice portrays 16th century venice. al pacino plays shylock, a jewish loan shark who plots revenge on a catholic that has looked down on him. the movie is a slow moving plot in the beginning that builds up throughout the two plus hours. the film gives a very good and believe appearance to it's characters, especially pacino. when hearing that pacino plays a jew one might think that it would not work looking at pacino's previous mobster type movie roles. nonetheless it works very well, credit must be given to the costume designer's and director's of the film. the look of all the characters fits well with the time period the play takes place in. the costumes look like the renaissance appearance one might envision to be.the film portrays a very anti-semitic vibe. from the first minute to the last it is shown how the catholic's try to take advantage of the jews in every way they can, even to the point of keeping them locked away in "ghettos" and not allowing them to regular jobs. in comparison to the passion of the christ, another recent film that people believed to be very anti-semitic, merchant of venice makes passion look like a jewish holiday. the film shows how the jews, or at least shylock wanted revenge for the mistreatment that the jews received. the location shots also seem very timely and the scenery is at times very beautiful or very ugly depending on the scene of the film, making it just that much more realistic. showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be seen as anti-semitic because the ugly is usually shown around the jews and the beautiful around the catholics.although the film clearly attempts to have a serious aura certain parts do add a bit of humor to the act. the oh so serious trial between shylock and antonio (irons) adds a bit of humor when portia (collins) and nerissa (goldenhersh) come into the trial and decide who will be the victor and the defeated. that in itself might not be funny, but seeing it that they were women dressed up in disguise as men one might find it to be pretty amusing. the whole cross dressing scene, as compelling as it was could have probably been even more memorable had the make up artists and director michael radford taken notice that the two women still look like women and could easily be recognized. the director also could have seen into the fact that the women are speaking through their regular voices instead of trying to sound like men, which in part takes away from the scene but doesn't kill it entirely.overall the film gets a 7 out of 10

hello. hello and goodbye. but, before i go, i want to talk to you. i just want to quickly mention a few keys points about this film. the first being erotica. especially homo-erotica.yes, well. let us begin. when a man and a man love each other very much they fuse together in a spectacular, not to mention tender, explosion of cinema which we call merchant of venice.the homo erotic love was sensual at worse. and even more sensual at best. it was hardcore and emotional. it touched me inappropriately and i'm pretty sure i touched it back. and when no one was looking i touched myself a little too.i laughed because portia was denied. she was second in line to our friend, the homo erotic love. oh antonio. antoni. just toni. i love you. more than you loved that guy. whos name may or may not have contained an "b". he was well ugly.antoni was very greasy. he lathered his body in an encasement of his own hair grease and sensual juices and proceed to writhe accoss the screena and present himself to the guy with the name i like the movie in conclusion, go see the movie if not for the homo erotic connotations, for the love of a man such as antoni. just toni.

people have often been uncomfortable with "the merchant of venice", due to its anti-semitic subject matter. fortunately, this movie avoids that, opting instead to show how anti-semitism reigned supreme in 16th century europe. the story, of course, is that antonio (jeremy irons) needs money so that he can help bassanio (joseph fiennes) ask for portia's (lynn collins) hand in marriage. he gets the money from jewish usurer shylock (al pacino), who demands a pound of antonio's flesh if the latter doesn't pay back the loan. when antonio can't pay back the loan, shylock is determined to get what is owed him.we would expect this cast to do a good job, and they don't disappoint. it is yet another testament to what a great actor al pacino is.
