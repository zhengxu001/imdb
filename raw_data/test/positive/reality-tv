the quintessential housewife and perfect mother, donna reed (as donna stone) could do it all. settle spats between the children or neighbors, take care of her hard-working pipe-smoking pediatrician husband, alex, and still have a stack of pancakes, three types of breakfast meat, and a tall glass of milk and oj ready for the kids every morning before breakfast.over the course of the past fifty years, we've lost sight of the idealistic stay-at-home mom, family meals together at the kitchen table, and preparing dinner for a hard-working husband when he comes home from work.i wish the show were available on dvd- i'd discontinue my cable altogether!

one of the more lucid statements against the death penalty ever filmed, quite a frontal attack against the most disgusting way of doing justice. the final sequence, with that parallel between the crimes that the convicted poncelet committed and his own execution are just superb.no, what about the work of sean penn and susan sarandon? it leaves you breathless, they're two giants and their performances achieve the highest levels of emotion.tim robbins put clear that he's not only a good actor, he's a nice director as well.*my rate: 9/10

i have just seen this broadcast on channel 4. having seen some of the earlier comments here i think i would like to state firstly that i am not in favour of the death penalty. with that out of the way, i was expecting great things of this film, but it just didn't quite deliver. dead man walking is very cleanly done, with good performances all round, and a good script. in fact it's hard to fault it artistically. however, i felt that although it attempted to confront the issues surrounding capital punishment, it seemed to become sidetracked by the religious/moral stance (hardly surprising given that the main character is a nun). although i'm not a heartless individual, i didn't really empathise with any of the characters in the story. if you don't take religion seriously then you probably won't see much in this film. i think that peter medak's let him have it was a much more powerful and moving film, and i would strongly recommend anyone considering watching this to go and see that.

this movie has two new features in relation to the message conveyed by other equally good movies about death penalty and executions. those are the stress also given to the drama endured by victims' parents -- without for that reason disguising the hatred and desire of revenge they feel or lessening the horror that execution represents -- and the christian vision of all the questions implied. we must also point out that in this movie the sentenced man is not the usual nice innocent person we see in other movies dealing with executions which doesn't lead us to abandon the idea that a penal execution is no more than a legal murder anyway. last but not least we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight put on the last moments of the execution course with all the catharsis shown by the convicted's last words and the detail with which the act of the execution itself is viewed in a parallel cut with images of the murder scenes in the forest to stress that we are being confronted with another murder so pitiless as the latter but performed in a cold and supposed "legal" way.

i saw this movie many years ago and it has never left my list of all-time best films ever made. when i first watched it, i was just beginning what has become a life-long passion for justice. it gave an interesting perspective of the death penalty and also gave me a few things to think about.when you have a cast like this one, you are right to assume it is going to be nothing short of fabulous. this is, by far, the best role i have ever seen sean penn play (along with i am sam). he nails the role, doesn't glamourize his actions while doing so. he manages to maintain a level of debauchery throughout the movie that i think was very important. up until the very end, he does not try to be seen as anything more than what he is. he is a sick man who regrets his past, but still makes excuses for it. he ends up able to redeem his sense of self-worth as much as a convicted (and guilty) murderer can through the aid of susan sarandon's character, sister helen prejean. her character taught me about good will towards others without making me forget how horrible a person's actions can be and without making excuses for them.the supporting cast was also top-notch. i was surprised to see a small cameo of jack black in this film given the funny-man he has become today! i loved this movie for both personal reasons and just because it was a work of cinematic art. and, in my opinion, this is one of the rare exceptions when the movie far out-did the book.

i haven't seen "hardware wars" in years, but i remember it as one of the most hilarious events of human experience, and it was over far too soon. every aspect of this movie was hilarious, and it was even better than "star wars." i laughed. i cried. after watching it, i asked a family member for a moment with three dollars just so i could kiss it goodbye (i'm kidding about the last one). i love it when ham salad's sidekick/co-pilot tries to eat princess anne droid's cinnamon hair buns, and the darph nader character is just hilarious! this film would be great to watch back-to-back with "thumb wars," and i sincerely wish there could have been a "hardware wars, episode ii: the umpire strikes out." (was there?)

nothing is sacred. just ask ernie fosselius. these days, everybody has a video camera, and a movie is hardly out before the spoofs start flying, quickly written and shot, and often posted directly to the internet. spoofs are hot these days, and we go out of our way to make sure filmmakers don't get off on their own self-importance. 25 years ago, when the first star wars was made, it was a different world. filmmaking was the playground of a select few and spoofs were very rare. then god gave us hardware wars. it was shot to look cheap (or was it just cheap?) and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact. does that take away from the experience? heck no! that's what makes it so great! it was raw and unpolished, and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie. from fluke starbucker waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber (i did that when i was young!) to chewchilla the wookie monster, to auggie ben doggie's "nah, just a little headache" remark, this film short is as much a part of the phenomenon as any of the actual star wars films. rent it. buy it. borrow it from a friend. and may the farce be with you. always.

the title role of this western is played by robert walker, jr. he's a young gun who with partner david carradine gets separated after doing a contract hit on a mexican general. in eluding their pursuers carradine and walker become separated. walker comes upon the camp of lawman robert mitchum who takes a liking to walker and makes him a protégé and reclamation project of sorts.this is the first of two films robert mitchum did with writer/director burt kennedy. the second was the more humorous the good guys and the bad guys. not that young billy young does not have its moments of hilarity. but it is a tripartite story involving the walker reclamation, mitchum's hunt for the bad who killed his son and a romantic triangle involving mitchum, angie dickinson, and town boss jack kelly.the film abounds with nepotism. david carradine is john's son. dean martin's daughter deana is in this, walker is the son of robert walker and jennifer jones and mitchum's son chris plays mitchum's son in some silent flashbacks.robert mitchum got his start in westerns and always looks right at home in them. angie dickinson essentially repeats the role she had in rio bravo. walker had a brief career playing rebellious youths and doing a good job at it. i've often wondered what happened to him. he looks hauntingly like his father. maybe he didn't want to come to such a tragic early end like his father.and it that wasn't enough, mitchum fans get to hear old rumple eyes sing the title song at the beginning of the film.

if sicily is a territory of the baroque, with its doubling of perspective, that's part of this movie's challenge to realism. and it's an exuberant pleasure here, outdoing fellini with not one but three film directors, plus of course the actual bellocchio, who has made some really great movies and shouldn't be touchy about his honor. there is a variety of takes and casting improvisations on manzoni's "i promessi sposi" with, somewhere there, actual marriage. sicily is also taken to be a territory of skulduggery (you already know this version of the island, so there's no spoiler involved), a comic version of which makes the picture worth seeing for sergio castellito's work with guard dogs on the floor of the great hall of a palazzo.

there is something that one of the characters (the aging film director who pretends to be dead) says which may summarize all the film: "in italy it's the dead who rule". true! this is a country without a future, in the hands of old and jaded men. and bellocchio's cryptic portrait of the country, pivoted on the apparently senseless story of a director who has to film marriage parties to earn a living, manages to say a lot about what is not working here. but foreigners may miss the point, as it's not clearly expressed. i understand that australian or canadian people who watch this may get bored and wonder if there's a meaning--well, there's a meaning, but it's clear only to people who live here today, and keep their eyes wide open... like bellocchio. surely it's not one of his best films, and it's not as powerful as buongiorno, notte, but it's worth seeing... for italians who live in italy.

this film was a wonderful romp, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in odd places and a tremendous energy. the famous film director (the protagonist) and the events he tries to manipulate through film all become entangled in fascinating ways as he is nearly out-maneuvered by a prince who has never heard of him. there are wonderfully rich images throughout and paths suggested but not followed (exactly what is going on with the somber wife of the pedestrian tourist wedding director?). the ending is so much the better for being untidy. realism and logic are not what you should be looking for here. if we are going to turn our weddings and our imaginative lives over to film directors, we should be prepared for a wild ride, this film seems to suggest.

this is the last episode of the goldenboy ova series. kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio, which is rather interesting if you don't know anything about the way anime studios were run. besides episode 3, this was probably the least risqué, but it had a nice girl interest, as well as a surprise reunion from others in the previous episodes. my only complaint about this episode is it seemed a little too short, but at the same time this may have only been because it was the only original script for the show that wasn't based on one of the manga chapters. but it ended well, leaving us with the nice feeling that kentaro is permanently 25, studying on. definitely watch the rest of the series all the way through, you can buy the whole series for like $17, you can watch it all the way through in about 2 1/2 hours, or watch your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes free time (which i do if i have a lunch break at school.) good series, check it out.

finally! other people who have actually seen this show! it is the funniest anime i have ever seen, but most people have even heard about it. it is just hilarious. 'and so kintaro will continue to ride his trusty bike and maybe one day, he will save the world....or maybe not'. tare just some classic bits in it 'and so he will ride onto the next city...because he has no choice since his brakes are broken (study study study)' and some of the lessons that he writes down in his little notebook, 'today i had a very educational experience. i tried to look backwards, but unfortunately i was already looking that way. it hurt. todays lesson, the human head cannot turn 360 degrees.'

this is one of those movies where i just want to move my feet and dance around the house. it's a very positive and happy type of music. the movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. gary busey did a great job as buddy holly. buddy holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the nashville record producer told him no. buddy holly didn't give up on what he liked. i didn't know much about buddy holly until i watched this movie. i've been to the surf ballroom where he last played but didn't give much attention to it until i watched this movie. it's an incredible movie with lots of fun so get on your feet and see this movie.

"the buddy holly story" shows the famous singer's beginnings in the dunk lubbock, texas, to his rise to stardom, to his tragic death in a plane crash. strengthened by the fact that gary busey, as holly, plays his own instruments, this movie is the biopic in its purest form. there are some things that seem a little hackneyed, namely the people of lubbock considering rock 'n' roll to be the devil's music, but the masterful performances outweigh any weaknesses. if there's only one thing that's for certain in this great big world of ours, it's that buddy holly's music will never get stale. whether it's "that'll be the day", "peggy sue", or another one of his songs, they still sound great after all these years. he remains one of the greatest singers in history.just to show what lubbock really thought of their most famous son, they didn't name a street after him until 37 years after his death! what a bunch of ingrates!

the movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. but it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.as keith richards remarks in paul mccartney's movie about holly, there's some buddy holly in almost all rock made since his day. the tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.gary busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music. as a long-time holly fan and rocker, so do i.

hiblade is an sensational action movie . the hero (wesley snipes) and the villain have done justice to their roles.the movie's action sequences are better then matrix! wesley snipes is one the best action heroes ever.if u like action/vampire movies , this is the one.the theme is pretty good considering the fact that so many vampire movies have been made before.but these is the best of them.enjoy the ride.

charlotte beal arrives at an isolated country mental hospital to become a full-time nurse there. she is confronted with a motley group of crazies and a seemingly crazier supervisor. is dr. masters all she seems to be?don't look in the basement is one of the best low-budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down is beyond me. the acting is excellent, my favorite performance being by betty chandler as allyson the nymphomaniac. the chills just jump right off the screen. you probably won't have to say "it's only a movie, it's only a movie", it isn't that scary, but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre, which i do. it is very hard to make a creepy film on a low budget and few actually succeed. axe is another cheap film that is looked down upon. maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that doesn't have excellent effects and/or isn't considered a classic doesn't have a chance with an audience. but i think that after people see this movie, they will see how important the low-budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish.

you'll either love or hate movies such as this thriller set inside a lonesome asylum in a far off lonesome land. it's not so much of a horror show, but a concoction of frightening imageries and wackozoid mental patients. "scream" is the best term to use in what was obviously a popular drive-in classic noted for some strange and wicked behaviors. notice the "judge", who's about to put on the ax from behind the doctor! brr-r-r-r!!! not much else can be described here other than some bloody tasty goodness, but when you get a chance, remember the familiar old saying by the hag lady: "get out! get out! and never ever come back!". don't you wish you haven't looked in the basement?

if you love drive-in cheeze from the early '70s you will just love this one.how could you go wrong with a low budget film about bloodshed in a lunatic asylum? you can't! crazy folks and sharp objects are always an entertaining combination.the film looks like it was shot inside someone's house for about $320.65. for me that just ads to the fun of watching this type of stuff.the gore is a bit mild compared to others of this ilk,but there is enough to keep us bloodthirsty sickos (like myself)happy.some horror films drag in parts and leave you waiting for something to happen.that's not the case here.the characters are entertaining enough to make every frame quite enjoyable.there is never a dull moment from start to finish.the mind melting climax at the end that is just unbelievable. i liked it so much that right after the end credits i watched it a second time.it's an absolute must see for any self respecting drive-in horror nut.9.5/10 on the drive-in-freak-o-meter...required viewingyea i love you..i do love you...now take your thorazine and put your clothes back on...please....8)

i was unsure what to expect from "driving lessons"- unsure whether rupert grint could carry such a role, but within the first few minutes i was completely hooked. all the way through, the music, acting and scenery were absolutely stunning. julie walters, as always, gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress evie, and rupert grint, equally as good,gave a fantastic performance as the romantic ben.right from the beginning, i was forced into involuntary cringes, bursts of laughter and swellings of joy as ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend, evie. a very controversial story, probably rather exaggerated but none the less one of the best films i have seen in a long time.highly recommend to anyone seeking a good british film and an evening to kick-back and just enjoy yourself.
